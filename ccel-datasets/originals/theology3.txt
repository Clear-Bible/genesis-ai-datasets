  REGENERATION
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Usage of the Word.

   The subjective change wrought in the soul by the grace of God, is
   variously designated in Scripture. It is called a new birth, a
   resurrection, a new life, a new creature, a renewing of the mind, a
   dying to sin and living to righteousness, a translation from darkness
   to light, etc. In theological language, it is called regeneration,
   renovation, conversion. These terms are often used interchangeably.
   They are also used sometimes for the whole process of spiritual
   renovation or restoration of the image of God, and sometimes for a
   particular stage of that process. Thus Calvin gives the term its widest
   scope: "Uno verbo poenitentiam interpretor regenerationem, cujus non
   alius est scopus nisi ut imago Dei, quæ per Adæ transgressionem foedata
   et tantum non obliterata fuerat, in nobis reformetur. . . . Atque hæc
   quidem instauratio non uno momento, vel die, vel anno impletur, sed per
   continuos, imo etiam lentos interdum profectus abolet Deus in electis
   suis carnis corruptelas." [1]

   With the theologians of the seventeenth century conversion and
   regeneration were synonymous terms. In the acts of the Synod of Dort,
   we find such expressions as "Status conversionis aut regenerationis,"
   and "effecta ad conversionem sive regenerationem prævia." John Owen, in
   his work on the Holy Spirit, follows the same usage. The fifth chapter
   of the third book of that work is entitled "The nature of
   regeneration," and one of the heads under this is, "Conversion not
   wrought by moral suasion only." "If the Holy Spirit," he says, "acts no
   otherwise on men in regeneration or conversion," then so and so
   follows. Turrettin, as we have seen, distinguishes between what he
   calls "conversio habitualis" and "conversio actualis." "Conversio
   habitualia seu passiva, fit per habituum supernaturalium infusionem a
   Spiritu Sancto. Actualis vero seu activa per bonorum istorum
   exercitium. . . . Per illam homo renovatur et convertitur a Deo. Per
   istam homo a Deo renovatus et convertus convertit se ad Deum, et actus
   agit. Illa melius regeneratio dicitur, quia se habet ad modum novæ
   nativitatis, qua homo reformatur ad imaginem Creatoris sui. Ista vero
   conversio, quia includit hominis ipsius operationem." [2] This is clear
   and accurate. As these two things are distinct they should be
   designated by different terms. Great confusion arises from this
   ambiguity of terms. The questions whether man is active or passive in
   regeneration and whether regeneration is effected by the mediate or
   immediate influence of the Spirit must be answered in one way if
   regeneration includes conversion, and in another if it be taken in its
   restricted sense. In the Bible, the distinction is generally preserved;
   metanoia, repentance, change of mind, turning to God, i.e., conversion,
   is what man is called upon to do; anagennesis, regeneration, is the act
   of God. God regenerates; the soul is regenerated. In the Romish Church
   justification is making subjectively just, i.e., free from sin and
   inwardly holy. So is regeneration. So is sanctification. These terms,
   therefore, in the theology of that church are constantly interchanged.

   Even by the Lutherans, in the "Apology for the Augsburg Confession,"
   regeneration is made to include justification. That is, it is made to
   include the whole process by which the sinner is transferred from a
   state of sin and condemnation into a state of salvation. In the "Form
   of Concord" it is said, "Vocabulum regenerationis interdum in eo sensu
   accipitur, ut simul et remissionem peccatorum (quæ duntaxat propter
   Christam contingit) et subsequentem renovationem complectatur, quam
   Spiritus Sanctus in illis, qui per fidem justificati sunt, operatur,
   quandoque etiam solam remissionem peceatorum, et adoptionem in filios
   Dei significat. Et in hoc posteriore usu sæpe multumque id vocabulam in
   Apologia Confessionis ponitur. Verbi gratia, cum dicitur: Justificatio
   est regeneratio. . . . Quin etiam vivificationis vocabulum interdum ita
   accipitur, ut remissionem peccatorum notet. Cum enim homo per fidem
   (quam quidem solus Spiritus Sanctus operatur) justificatur, id ipsum
   revera est quædam regeneratio, quia ex filio iræ fit filius Dei, et hoc
   modo e morte in vitam transfertur. . . . Deinde etiam regeneratio sæpe
   pro sanctificatione et renovatione (quæ fidei justificationem sequitur)
   usurpatur. In qua significatione D. Lutherus hac voce, tum in libro de
   ecelesia et conciliis, tum alibi etiam, multum usus est." [3]

   As this lax use of terms was unavoidably attended with great confusion,
   the "Form of Concord" itself, and the later Lutheran theologians were
   more precise. They made especially a sharp distinction between
   justification and anything signifying a subjective change in the
   sinner.

   In the early Church regeneration often expressed, not any inward moral
   change, but an external change of state or relation. Among the Jews
   when a heathen became a proselyte to their religion, he was said to be
   born again. The change of his status from without to within the
   theocracy, was called regeneration. This usage in a measure passed over
   to the Christian Church. When a man became a member of the Church he
   was said to be born anew; and baptism, which was the rite of
   initiation, was called regeneration. This use of the word has not yet
   entirely passed away. A distinction is still sometimes made between
   regeneration and spiritual renovation. The one is external, the other
   internal. Some of the advocates of baptismal regeneration make this
   distinction, and interpret the language of the formulas of the Church
   of England in accordance with it. The regeneration effected in baptism,
   in their view, is not any spiritual change in the state of the soul,
   but simply a birth into the visible Church.

   § 2. Nature of Regeneration.

   By a consent almost universal the word regeneration is now used to
   designate, not the whole work of sanctification, nor the first stages
   of that work comprehended in conversion, much less justification or any
   mere external change of state, but the instantaneous change from
   spiritual death to spiritual life. Regeneration, therefore, is a
   spiritual resurrection; the beginning of a new life. Sometimes the word
   expresses the act of God. God regenerates. Sometimes it designates the
   subjective effect of his act. The sinner is regenerated. He becomes a
   new creature. He is born again. And this is his regeneration. These two
   applications of the word are so allied as not to produce confusion. The
   nature of regeneration is not explained in the Bible further than the
   account therein given of its author, God, in the exercise of the
   exceeding greatness of his power; its subject, the whole soul; and its
   effects, spiritual life, and all consequent holy acts and states. Its
   metaphysical nature is left a mystery. It is not the province of either
   philosophy or theology to solve that mystery. It is, however, the duty
   of the theologian to examine the various theories concerning the nature
   of this saving change, and to reject all such as are inconsistent with
   the Word of God.

   Not a change in the Substance of the Soul.

   Regeneration does not consist in any change in the substance of the
   soul. The only advocate of the opposite doctrine among Protestant
   theologians was Flacius Illyricus, so called from the place of his
   birth. He was one of the most prominent Lutheran theologians in what is
   called the second Reformation in Germany. He did great service in the
   cause of truth in resisting the synergism of Melancthon, and the
   concessions which that eminent but yielding reformer was disposed to
   make to the papists. He contributed some of the most important works of
   the age in which he lived to the vindication of the Protestant faith.
   His "Catalogus Testiam Veritatis," designed to prove that the doctrine
   of the Reformation had had their witnesses in all ages; his "Clavis
   Scripturæ Sacræ;" and especially the great historical work, "The
   Magdeburg Centuries" (in thirteen volumes, folio), of which he was the
   originator and principal author, attest his learning, talents, and
   untiring industry. His fervent and uncompromising spirit involved him
   in many difficulties and sorrows. He died worn out by suffering and
   labour, says his biographer; one of those men of faith of whom the
   world was not worthy. Always extreme in his opinions, he held that
   original sin was a corruption of the substance of the soul, and
   regeneration such a change of that substance as to restore its normal
   purity. All his friends who had sided with him in his controversy with
   the Synergists and the supporters of the Leipzig Interim, forsook him
   now, and he stood alone. In the "Form of Concord," adopted to settle
   all the controversies of the period, these peculiar views of Flacius
   were condemned as a virtual revival of the Manichæan heresy. It was
   urged that if the substance of the soul be sinful, God, by whom each
   individual soul is created, must be the author of sin; and that Christ
   who, in assuming our nature, became consubstantial with us, must be a
   partaker of sin. No Christian Church has assumed the responsibility of
   the doctrine of Flacius, or held that regeneration involves a change of
   the essence of the soul.

   Regeneration does not consist in an Act of the Soul.

   Regeneration does not consist in any act or acts of the soul. The word
   here, of course, is to be understood not as including conversion, much
   less the whole work of sanctification, but in its restricted sense for
   the commencement of spiritual life. The opposite view, which makes
   regeneration, even in its narrowest sense, an act of the soul, has been
   held by very different classes of theologians. It is, of course,
   involved in the Pelagian doctrine which denies moral character to
   everything except acts of the will. If "all sin is sinning," and "all
   love loving," then every moral change in man must be a change from one
   form of voluntary activity to another. As the later Remonstrants held
   the principle in question they made regeneration to consist in the
   sinner's own act in turning unto God. The influence exerted on him was
   one which he could yield to or resist. If he yielded, it was a
   voluntary decision, and in that decision his regeneration, or the
   beginning of his religious life, consisted.

   Dr. Emmons's View.

   Dr. Emmons, holding that all sin and holiness consist in acts, which
   acts, whether sinful or holy, are immediately created by God, makes
   regeneration to consist in God's giving rise to the commencement of a
   series of holy acts. In his discourse on Regeneration, the first
   proposition which he undertakes to establish is, "that the Spirit of
   God, in regeneration, produces nothing but love." This is maintained in
   opposition to those who say that the Spirit produces a new nature,
   principle, disposition, or taste. "Those in the state of nature," he
   says, "stand in no need of having any new power, or faculty, or
   principle of action produced in them, in order to their becoming holy.
   They are just as capable of loving as of hating God. . . . This is true
   of all sinners, who are as much moral agents, and the proper subjects
   of moral government, before as after regeneration. Whenever, therefore,
   the divine Spirit renews, regenerates, or sanctifies them, He has no
   occasion of producing anything in their minds besides love." [4] "The
   love which the Spirit of God produces in regeneration is the love of
   benevolence, and not the love of complacence." [5] "Though there is no
   natural or necessary connection between the first exercise of love and
   all future exercises of grace yet there is a constituted connection,
   which renders future exercises of grace as certain, as if they flowed
   from a new nature, or holy principle, as many suppose." [6] His first
   inference from the doctrine of his sermon is, "If the Spirit of God
   produces nothing but love in regeneration, then there is no ground for
   the distinction which is often made between regeneration, conversion,
   and sanctification. They are, in nature and kind, precisely the same
   frdits of the Spirit. In regeneration, He produces holy exercises; in
   conversion, He produces holy exercises; and in sanctification, He
   produces holy exercises." [7] Secondly, "If the Spirit of God in
   regeneration produces nothing but love, then men are no more passive in
   regeneration than in conversion or sanctification. Those who hold that
   the divine Spirit in regeneration produces something prior to love as
   the foundation of it, that is, a new nature, or new principle of
   holiness, maintain that men are passive in regeneration, but active in
   conversion and sanctification. . . . But if what has been said in this
   discourse be true, there is no new nature, or principle of action,
   produced in regeneration, but only love, which is activity itself." [8]

   Professor Finney's Doctrine.

   Professor Finney, in his "Lectures on Systematic Theology, teaches:
   (1.) That satisfaction, happiness, blessedness, is the only absolute
   good; that virtue is only relatively good, i.e., good as tending to
   produce happiness. (2.) That all virtue lies in the intention to
   promote the happiness of being, that is, of universal being. There is
   no virtue in emotion, feeling, or any state of the sensibility, for
   these are involuntary. Love to God even is not complacency in his
   excellence, but "willing him good." (3.) All sin is selfishness, or the
   choice of our own happiness in preference to the good of universal
   being. (4.) Every moral agent is always "as sinful or holy as with
   their knowledge they can be." (5.) "As the moral law is the law of
   nature, it is absurd to suppose that entire obedience to it should not
   be the unalterable condition of salvation." [9] (6.) Regeneration is an
   "instantaneous" change "from entire sinfulness to entire holiness."
   [10] It is a simple change of purpose.

   The system of Professor Finney is a remarkable product of relentless
   logic. It is valuable as a warning. It shows to what extremes the human
   mind may be carried when abandoned to its own guidance. He begins with
   certain axioms, or, as he calls them, truths of the reason, and from
   these he draws conclusions which are indeed logical deductions, but
   which shock the moral sense, and prove nothing but that his premises
   are false. His fundamental principle is that ability limits obligation.
   Free will is defined to be "the power of choosing, or refusing to
   choose, in compliance with moral obligation in every instance." [11]
   "Consciousness of the affirmation of ability to comply with any
   requisition, is a necessary condition of the affirmation of obligation
   to comply with that requisition." [12] "To talk of inability to obey
   moral law, is to talk sheer nonsense." [13]

   But it is acknowledged that man's ability is confined to acts of the
   will, therefore moral character can be predicated only of such acts.
   The acts of the will are either choices or volitions. "By choice is
   intended the selection or choice of an end. By volition is intended the
   executive efforts of the will to secure the end intended." [14] We are
   responsible, therefore, only for our choices in the selection of an
   ultimate end. "It is generally agreed that moral obligation respects
   strictly only the ultimate intention or choice of an end for its own
   sake." [15] "I have said that moral obligation respects the ultimate
   intention only. I am now prepared to say, still further, that this is a
   first truth of reason." [16] "Right can be predicated only of
   good-will, and wrong only of selfishness. . . . It is right for him
   [for a man] to intend the highest good of being as an end. If he
   honestly does this, he cannot, doing this, mistake his duty, for in
   doing this he really performs the whole of duty." [17] "Moral character
   belongs solely to the ultimate intention of the mind, or to choice, as
   distinguished from volition." [18]

   The end to be chosen is "the highest good of being." "Good may be
   natural or moral. Natural good is synonymous with valuable. Moral good
   is synonymous with virtue." [19] Moral good is only a relative good. It
   does meet a demand of our being, and therefore produces satisfaction.
   This satisfaction is the ultimate good of being." [20] "I come now to
   state the point upon which issue is taken, to wit: That enjoyment,
   blessedness, or mental satisfaction, is the only ultimate good." [21]
   "Of what value is the true, the right, the just, etc., aside from the
   pleasure as mental satisfaction resulting from them to sentient
   existences." [22]

   It follows from these principles that men perform their whole duty, and
   are perfect, if they intend the happiness of being in general. There is
   no morality in emotions, sentiments, or feelings. These are involuntary
   states of the sensibility, and are in themselves neither good nor bad.
   "If any outward action or state of the feeling exists, in opposition to
   the intention or choice of the mind, it cannot by any possibility have
   moral character. Whatever is beyond the control of a moral agent, he
   cannot be responsible for." [23] "Love may, and often does exist, as
   every one knows, in the form of a mere feeling or emotion. . . . This
   emotion or feeling, as we are all aware, is purely an involuntary state
   of mind. Because it is a phenomenon of the sensibility, and of course a
   passive state of mind, it has in itself no moral character." [24]
   Gratitude, "as a mere feeling or phenomenon of the sensibility, . . .
   has no moral character." [25] The same is said of benevolence,
   compassion, mercy, conscientiousness, etc. The doctrine is, "No state
   of the sensibility, . . . has any moral character in itself." [26] The
   love which has moral excellence, and which is the fulfilling of the
   law, is not a feeling of complacency, but "good-will," willing the good
   or happiness of its object. Should a man, therefore, under the impulse
   of a benevolent feeling, or a sense of duty, perform a right act, he
   would sin as really as if, under the impulse of malice or cupidity, he
   should perform a bad act. The illustration is, that to pay a debt from
   a sense of justice, is as wicked as to steal a horse from
   acquisitiveness. A man "may be prevented [from committing commercial
   injustice] by a constitutional or phrenological conscientiousness or
   sense of justice. But this is only a feeling of the sensibility, and if
   restrained only by this, he is just as absolutely selfish as if he had
   stolen a horse in obedience to acquisitiveness." [27] "If the selfish
   man were to preach the gospel, it would be only because upon the whole
   it was most pleasing or gratifying to himself, and not at all for the
   sake of the good of being as an end. If he should become a pirate, it
   would be exactly for the same reason. . . . Whichever course he takes,
   he takes it for precisely the same reason; and with the same degree of
   light it must involve the same degree of guilt." [28] To feed the poor
   from a feeling of benevolence, and to murder a parent from a feeling of
   malice, involve the same degree of guilt! Such a sacrifice to logic was
   never made by any man before. But still more wonderful, if possible, is
   the declaration that a man may "feel deeply malicious and revengeful
   feelings toward God. But sin does not consist in these feelings, nor
   necessarily imply them." [29]

   Moral excellence is not an object of love. To say that we are bound to
   love God because He is good, is said to be "most nonsensical. What is
   it to love God? Why, as is agreed, it is not to exercise a mere emotion
   of complacency in Him. It is to will something to Him." [30] "Should it
   be said that God's holiness is the foundation of our obligation to love
   Him, I ask in what sense it can be so? What is the nature or form of
   that love, which his virtue lays us under an obligation to exercise? It
   cannot be a mere emotion of complacency, for emotions being involuntary
   states of mind and mere phenomena of the sensibility, are without the
   pale of legislation and morality." [31] "We are under infinite
   obligation to love God, and to will his good with all our power,
   because of the intrinsic value of his well-being, whether He is holy or
   sinful. Upon condition that He is holy, we are under obligation to will
   his actual blessedness, but certainly we are under obligation to will
   it with no more than all our heart, and soul, and mind, and strength.
   But this we are required to do because of the intrinsic value of his
   blessedness, whatever his character might be." [32] Surely such a
   system is a hupodeigma tes apeitheias.

   Dr. Taylor's View.

   The system of Dr. Taylor of New Haven agrees with that of Professor
   Finney in making free agency include plenary power; in limiting
   responsibility and moral character to voluntary acts, in regarding
   happiness as the chief good; and in making regeneration to consist in a
   change of purpose. The two systems differ, however, essentially as to
   the ground of moral obligation or nature of virtue; and as to the
   nature of that change of purpose in which regeneration consists.
   Professor Finney adopts the common eudæmonistic theory which makes the
   happiness of being, i.e. of the universe, the chief good; and therefore
   makes virtue consist in the governing purpose to promote that
   happiness, and all sin in the purpose to seek our own happiness,
   instead of the happiness of being; consequently, regeneration is a
   change of that purpose; that is, it is a change from selfishness to
   benevolence.

   Dr. Taylor, on the other hand, recognized the fact that as the desire
   of happiness is a constituent element of our nature, or law of our
   being, it must be innocent, and therefore is not to be confounded with
   selfishness. He hence inferred that this desire of happiness is
   rightfully the controlling principle of action in all sentient and
   rational creatures. Sin consists in seeking happiness in the creature;
   holiness in seeking happiness in God; regeneration is the purpose or
   decision of a sinner to seek his happiness in God and not in the world.
   This change of purpose, he sometimes calls a "change of heart,"
   sometimes "giving the heart to God," sometimes "loving God." As
   regeneration is the choice of God as our chief good, it is an
   intelligent, voluntary act of the soul, and therefore must take place
   according to the established laws of mental action. It supposes the
   preliminary acts of consideration, appreciation, and comparison. The
   sinner contemplates God as a source of happiness, estimates his
   suitableness to the necessities of his nature, compares Him with other
   objects of choice, and decides to choose God as his portion. Sometimes
   the word regeneration is used in a comprehensive sense, including the
   whole process of consideration and decision; sometimes in a restricted
   sense, for the decision itself.

   Such being the nature of regeneration, it is of course brought about
   through the influence of the truth. The Bible reveals the nature of
   God, and his capacity and willingness to make his creatures happy; it
   exhibits all the motives which should determine the soul to take God
   for its portion. As regeneration is a rational and voluntary act, it is
   inconceivable that it should take place except in view of rational
   considerations. The Spirit's influence in this process is not denied.
   The fact is admitted that all the considerations which ought to
   determine the sinner to make choice of God, will remain without saving
   effect, unless the Spirit renders them effectual.

   These views are presented at length in the "Christian Spectator" (a
   quarterly review) for 1829. On the nature of the change in question,
   Dr. Taylor says: "Regeneration, considered as a moral change of which
   man is the subject -- giving God the heart -- making a new heart --
   loving God supremely, etc., are terms and phrases which, in popular
   use, denote a complex act. . . . These words, in all ordinary speech
   and writing, are used to denote one act, and yet this one act includes
   a process of mental acts, consisting of the perception and comparison
   of motives, the estimate of their relative worth, and the choice or
   willing of the external action." "When we speak of the means of
   regeneralion, we shall use the word regeneration in a more limited
   import than its ordinary popular import; and shall confine it, chiefly
   for the sake of convenient phraseology, to the act of the will or
   heart, in distinction from other mental acts connected with it; or to
   that act of the will or heart which consists in a preference of God to
   every other object; or to that disposition of the heart, or governing
   affection or purpose of the man, which consecrates him to the service
   and glory of God." [33]

   "Self-love or desire of happiness, is the primary cause or reason of
   all acts of preference or choice which fix supremely on any object. In
   every moral being who forms a moral character, there must be a first
   moral act of preference or choice. This must respect some one object,
   God or mammon, as the chief good, or as an object of supreme affection.
   Now whence comes such a choice or preference? Not from a previous
   choice or preference of the same object, for we speak of the first
   choice of the object. The answer which human consciousness gives, is,
   that the being constituted with a capacity for happiness desires to be
   happy; and knowing that he is capable of deriving happiness from
   different objects, considers from which the greatest happiness may be
   derived, and as in this respect he judges or estimates their relative
   value, so he chooses or prefers the one or the other as his chief good.
   While this must be the process by which a moral being forms his first
   moral preference, substantially the same process is indispensable to a
   change of this preference. The change involves the preference of a new
   object as the chief good; a preference which the former preference has
   no tendency to produce, but a direct tendency to prevent; a preference,
   therefore, not resulting from, or in any way occasioned by a previous
   preference of any given object, but resulting from those acts of
   considering and comparing the sources of happiness, which are dictated
   by the desire of happiness or self-love." [34]

   Regeneration being a change of purpose, the mode in which it is
   produced is thus explained. "If man without divine grace is a moral
   agent, then he is qualified so to consider, compare, and estimate the
   objects of choice as means of happiness, and capable also of such
   constitutional excitement in view of the good and evil set before him,
   as might result in his giving his heart to God, without grace. . . .
   The act of giving God the heart must take place in perfect accordance
   with the laws of moral agency and of voluntary action. If the
   interposing grace violate these laws, the effect cannot be moral
   action; and it must violate these laws, if it dispense with the class
   of mental acts now under consideration. Whatever, therefore, be the
   influence which secures a change of heart in the sinner, the change
   itself is a moral change, and implies the exercise of all the powers
   and capacities of the moral agent, which in the nature of things are
   essential to a moral act." [35] On a previous page it had been said,
   "The Scriptures authorize us to assert, generally, that the mode of
   divine influence is consistent with the moral nature of this change as
   a voluntary act of man; and, also, that it is through the truth, and
   implies attention to truth on the part of man." [36] "Cannot," Dr.
   Taylor asks, "He who formed the mind of man, reach it with an influence
   of his Spirit, which shall accord with all the laws of voluntary and
   moral action? Because motives, without a divine interposition, will not
   secure this moral change in sinful man, and because they have no
   positive efficiency in its production, must God in producing it
   dispense with motives altogether? Must the appropriate connections
   between motives and acts of will, or between the exercise of affections
   and the perception of their objects, be dissolved, and have no place?
   Must God, if by his grace He brings sinners to give Him their heart in
   holy love, accomplish the change in such a manner that they shall have
   no prior perception or view of the object of their love; and know not
   what or whom they love, or wherefore they love Him, rather than their
   former idols? Does a consistent theology thus limit the Holy One, and
   oblige Him to accomplish the veriest impossibilities, in transforming
   the moral character of sinful man?" [37] This may be a correct account
   of the process of conversion, with which this system confounds
   regeneration. Conversion is indeed a voluntary turning of the soul from
   sin to God. From the nature of the case it is produced proximately by
   appropriate motives, or it would be neither rational nor holy. But this
   proves nothing as to the nature of regeneration. The most accurate
   analysis of the laws of vision can throw no light on the way in which
   Christ opened the eyes of the blind.

   Remarks.

   It is plain that these views of regeneration are mere philosophical
   theories. Dr. Emmons assumes that such is the dependence of a creature
   upon the creator, that it cannot act. No creature can be a cause. There
   is no efficiency in second causes. Then, of course the first cause must
   produce all effects. God creates everything, even volitions. In the
   soul there are only acts or exercises. Regeneration, therefore, is an
   act or volition created by God; or, it is the name given to the
   commencement of a new series of exercises which are holy instead of
   sinful.

   Professor Finney assumes that plenary ability is essential to moral
   agency; that a man, so far as his internal life is concerned, has power
   only over his choices and volitions; all, therefore, for which he is
   responsible, all that constitutes moral character, must fall under the
   category of choice, the selection of an ultimate end. Assuming,
   moreover, that happiness is the only absolute good, all sin consists in
   the undue pursuit of our own happiness, and all virtue in benevolence
   or the purpose to seek the happiness of being. Regeneration, therefore,
   consists in the change of the purpose to seek our own happiness, for
   the purpose to seek as our ultimate end the happiness of the universe.

   Dr. Taylor, agreeing with Professor Finney on the nature of free
   agency, and in the doctrine that happiness is the chief good, holds
   with him that all sin and holiness consist in voluntary action. But
   assuming that self-love, as distinguished from selfishness, is the
   motive in all rational moral action, he makes regeneration to consist
   in the choice of God as the source of our own happiness.

   All these speculations are outside of the Bible. They have no authority
   or value which they do not derive from their inherent truth, and any
   man is at liberty to dispute them, if they do not commend themselves to
   his own reason and conscience. But besides thc purely philosophical
   character of these views, it would be easy to show, not only that they
   have no valid ground on which to rest, but also that they are
   inconsistent with the teachings of Scripture and with genuine Christian
   experience. This will be attempted when the Scriptural account of
   regeneration comes to be considered.

   Regeneration not a change in any one Faculty of the Soul.

   Regeneration does not consist in a change in any one of the faculties
   of the soul, whether the sensibility, or the will, or the intellect.
   According to some theologians, the feelings, or heart, in the
   restricted sense of that word, is the exclusive seat of original sin.
   Hereditary corruption, in other words, is made to consist in the
   aversion of the heart from divine things, and a preference for the
   things of the world. The end to be accomplished in regeneration,
   therefore, is simply to correct this aversion. The understanding, it is
   urged, so far as moral and religious truth is concerned, apprehends
   aright and appreciates what is loved; and in like manner, in the same
   sphere, we believe what we apprehend as right and good. If, therefore,
   the feelings are made what they ought to be, all the other operations
   of the mind, or inner man, will be right. This theory is founded in
   part upon a mistaken view of the meaning of the word "heart" as used in
   the Scriptures. In a multitude of cases, and in all cases where
   regeneration is spoken of, it means the whole soul; that is, it
   includes the intellect, will, and the conscience as well as the
   affections. Hence the Bible speaks of the eyes, of the thoughts, of the
   purposes, of the devices, as well as of the feelings or affections of
   the heart. In Scriptural language, therefore, a "new heart" does not
   mean simply a new state of feeling, but a radical change in the state
   of the whole soul or interior man. Besides, this theory overlooks what
   the Bible constantly assumes: the unity of our inward life. The
   Scriptures do not contemplate the intellect, the will, and the
   affections, as independent, separable elements of a composite whole.
   These faculties are only different forms of activity in one and the
   same subsistence. No exercise of the affections can occur without an
   exercise of the intellect, and, if the object be moral or religious,
   without including a correspondent exercise of our moral nature.

   Regeneration not merely Illumination.

   Another and antagonistic theory equally one-sided, is that the
   intellect only is in fault, and that regeneration resolves itself into
   illumination. This view is far more plausible than the preceding. The
   Bible makes eternal life to consist in knowledge; sinfulness is
   blindness, or darkness; the transition from a state of sin to a state
   of holiness is a translation from darkness into light; men are said to
   be renewed unto knowledge. i.e., knowledge is the effect of
   regeneration, conversion is said to be effected by the revelation of
   Christ; the rejection of Him as the Son of God and Saviour of men is
   referred to the fact that the eyes of those who believe not are blinded
   by the god of this world. These Scriptural representations prove much.
   They prove that knowledge is essential to all holy exercises; that
   truth as the object of knowledge, is of vital importance, and that
   error is always evil and often fatal; and that the effect of
   regeneration, so far as they reveal themselves in our consciousness,
   consist largely in the spiritual apprehension or discernment of divine
   things. These representations also prove that in the order of nature,
   knowledge, or spiritual discernment, is antecedent and causative
   relatively to all holy exercises of the feelings or affections. It is
   the spiritual apprehension of the truth that awakens love, faith, and
   delight; and not love that produces spiritual discernment. It was the
   vision Paul had of the divine glory of Christ that made him instantly
   and forever his worshipper and servant. The Scriptures, however, do not
   teach that regeneration consists exclusively in illumination, or that
   the cognitive faculties are exclusively the subject of the renewing
   power of the Spirit. It is the soul as such that is spiritually dead;
   and it is to the soul that a new principle of life controlling all its
   exercises, whether of the intellect, the sensibility, the conscience,
   or the will is imparted.

   Not a Change of the Higher, as distinguished from the Lower Powers of
   the Soul.

   There is another view of the subject, which falls under this head of
   what may be called partial regeneration. it is founded on trichotomy,
   or the assumption of three elements in the constitution of man, namely,
   the body, the soul, and the spirit (the soma, psuche, and pneuma); the
   first material, the second animal, the third spiritual. To the second,
   i.e., to the soul or psuche, are referred what man has in common with
   the lower animals; life, sensibility, will, and understanding; to the
   spirit what is peculiar to us as rational, moral, and religious beings,
   namely, conscience and reason. This third element, the pneuma, or
   reason, is often called divine; sometimes in a literal, and sometimes
   in a figurative sense. In either case, according to the theory under
   consideration, it is not the seat of sin, and is uncorrupted by the
   fall. It remains, although clouded and perverted by the disorder in the
   lower departments of our nature, the point of contact and connection
   between man and God. This at least is one view of the matter. According
   to another view, neither the body nor the soul (neither soma nor
   psuche), has any moral character. The seat of the moral and divine life
   is exclusively the pneuma or spirit. This is said to be paralyzed by
   the fall. It is figuratively dead insusceptible of impression from
   divine things. There are as many theories of the nature of regeneration
   among the advocates of this threefold division in the constitution of
   man, as there are systems of anthropology. The idea common to all, or
   to a majority of them, is that regeneration consists in restoring the
   pneuma or spirit to its normal controlling influence over the whole
   man. According to some, this is a natural process in which an animal
   man, i.e., a man governed by the psuche, comes to be reasonable, or
   pneumatic, i.e., governed by the pneuma or higher powers of his nature.
   According to others, it is a supernatural effect due to the action of
   the divine (Pneuma) Spirit upon the human pneuma or spirit. In either
   case, however, the pneumatikos, or Spiritual man, is not one in whom
   the Holy Spirit dwells as a principle of a new, spiritual life; but one
   who is governed by his own pneuma or spirit. According to others again,
   the pneuma or reason in man is God, the God-consciousness, the Logos,
   and regeneration is the gradually acquired ascendency of this divine
   element of our nature.

   In reference to these views of regeneration it is sufficient to remark,
   (1.) That the threefold division of our nature on which they are
   founded is antiscriptural, as we have already attempted to prove. (2.)
   Admitting that there is a foundation for such a distinction, it is not
   of the kind assumed in these theories. The soul and spirit are not
   distinct substances or essences, one of which may be holy and the other
   unholy, or negative. This is inconsistent with the unity of our
   interior life which the Scriptures constantly assume. (3.) It subverts
   the Scriptural dostrine of regeneration and sanctification to make the
   governing principle in the renewed to be their own pneuma or spirit,
   and not the Holy Spirit.

   Modern Speculative Views on this Subject.

   The modern speculative philosophy has introduced such a radical change
   in the views entertained of the nature of God, of his relation to the
   world, of the nature of man and of his relation to God, of the person
   and work of Christ, and of the application of his redemption to the
   salvation of men, that all the old, and, it may be safely said,
   Scriptural forms of these doctrines have been superseded, and others
   introduced which are unintelligible except in the light of that
   philosophy, and which to a great extent reduce the truths of the Bible
   to the form of philosophical dogmas. We cease to hear of the Holy Ghost
   as the third person of the Trinity, applying to men the redemption
   purchased by Christ; of regeneration by his almighty power, or of his
   dwelling in the hearts of believers. The forms of this new theology are
   very diversified. They are all perhaps comprehended under three
   classes: first, those which are avowedly pantheistic, although claiming
   to be Christian; secondly, those which are Theistic but do not admit
   the doctrine of the Trinity; and thirdly, those which endeavour to
   bring theology as a philosophy into the forms of Christian doctrine. In
   all, however, the anthropology, christology, soteriology, and
   ecclesiology advocated, are so changed as to render it impossible to
   retain in their exhibition the terms and formulas with which the Church
   from the beginning has been familiar. Regeneration, justification, and
   sanctification are almost antiquated terms; and what remains of the
   truths those terms were used to express, is merged into the one idea of
   the development of a new divine life in the soul. As to anthropology,
   these modern speculative, or as they often call themselves, and are
   called by others, mystic, theologians teach, (1.) That there is no
   dualism in man between soul and body. There is but one life. The body
   is the soul projecting itself externally. Without a body there is no
   soul. (2.) That there is no real dualism between God and man. The
   identity between God and man is the last result of modern speculation;
   and it is the fundamental idea of Christianity.

   Soul and Body one.

   As to the former of these points, Schleiermacher [38] says, "There are
   not a spiritual and a corporeal world, a corporeal and spiritual
   existence of man. Such representations lead to nothing but the dead
   mechanism of a preëstablished harmony. Body and spirit are actual only
   in and with each other, so that corporeal and spiritual action can only
   be relatively distinguished." The Late President Rauch [39] says, "A
   dualism which admits of two principles for one being, offers many
   difficulties, and the greatest is, that it cannot tell how the
   principles can be united in a third. A river may originate in two
   fountains, but a science cannot, and much less individual life." "It
   would be wrong to say that man consists of two essentially different
   substances, of earth and the soul; but he is soul only, and cannot be
   anything else. This soul, however, unfolds itself externally in the
   life of the body, and internally in the life of the mind." So Olshausen
   [40] teaches that the soul has no subsistence but in the body. Dr. J.
   W. Nevin [41] says, "We have no right to think of the body in any way
   as a form of existence of and by itself, into which the soul as another
   form of such existence is thrust in a mechanical way. Both form one
   life. The soul to be complete, to develop itself at all as a soul, must
   externalize itself, throw itself out in space; and this externalization
   is the body."

   God and Man one.

   As to the second point, or the oneness of God and man, as the soul
   externalizes itself in the body, "dividing itself only that its unity
   may become thus the more free and intensely complete," [42] so God
   externalizes Himself in the world. Schleiermacher says, it is in vain
   to attempt to conceive of God as existing either before or out of the
   world. They may be distinguished in thought, but are only "zwei Werthe
   fur dieselbe Forderung, two values of the same postulate." According to
   this philosophy, it is just as true, "No world, no God," as "No body,
   no soul." "The world, [43] in its lower view, is not simply the outward
   theatre or stage on which man is to act his part as a candidate for
   heaven. In the midst of all its different forms of existence, it is
   pervaded throughout with the power of a single life, which comes
   ultimately to its full sense and force only in the human person." The
   world, therefore, is pervaded by "the power of a single life;" the
   highest form of that life (on earth) is man. What is that life? What is
   that pervading principle which reveals itself in such manifold forms of
   existence, and culminates in man? It is, of course, God. Man,
   therefore, as Schleiermacher says, is "the existence-form" of God on
   earth. [44] Ullmann [45] says that the German mystics in the Middle
   Ages taught "the oneness of Deity and humanity." The results reached by
   the mystics under the guidance of feeling, he says, modern philosophy
   has reached by speculation. This doctrine of the essential oneness of
   God and man, the speculative theologians adopt as the fundamental idea
   of Christianity. To work out that idea in a manner compatible with
   Theism and the Gospel, is the problem which those theologians have
   attempted to solve. These attempts have resulted, in some cases, in
   avowed Christian Pantheism, as it is called; in others, in forms of
   doctrine so nearly pantheistic as to be hardly distinguished from
   Pantheism itself; and in all, in a radical modification, not only of
   the theology of the Church as expressed in her received standards, but
   also of the Scriptural form of Christian doctrines, if not of their
   essence. This is seen to be true in the anthropology of this system,
   which destroys the essential difference between the creator and his
   creatures, between God and man.

   The christology of this modern theology has already been presented in
   its essential features. There is no dualism in Christ as between soul
   and body. The two are one life. Neither is there any dualism between
   divinity and humanity in Him. The divine and human in his person are
   one life. In being the ideal or perfect man, He is the true God. The
   deification which humanity reached in Christ, is not a supernatural act
   on the part of God; it is reached by a process of natural development
   in his people, i.e., the Church.

   Soteriology of these Philosophers.

   The soteriology of this system is simple. The soul projects itself in
   the body. They are one life, but the body may be too much for the soul.
   The development of this one life in its twofold form, inward and
   outward, may not be symmetrical. So humanity as a generic life, a form
   of the life of God, as projected externally in the world from Adam
   onward, has not developed itself aright. If left unaided it would not
   reach the goal, or unfold itself as divine. A new start, therefore,
   must be given to it, a new commencement made. This is done by a
   supernatural intervention resulting in the production of the person of
   Christ. In Him divinity assumes the fashion of a man, -- the
   existence-form of man, -- God becomes man, and man is God. This renewed
   entrance, so to speak, of God into the world, this special form of
   divine-human life, is Christianity, which is constantly declared to be
   "a life," "the life of Christ," "a new theanthropic life." Men become
   Christians by being partakers of this life. They become partakers of
   this life by union with the Church and reception of the sacraments. The
   incarnation of God is continued in the Church; and this new principle
   of "divine-human life" descends from Christ to the members of his
   Church, as naturally and as much by a process of organic development,
   as humanity, derived from Adam, unfolded itself in his descendants.
   Christ, therefore, saves us, not so much by what He did, as by what He
   is. He made no satisfaction to the divine justice; no expiation for
   sin; no fulfilling of the law. There is, therefore, really no
   justification, no real pardon even, in the ordinary sense of the word.
   There is a healing of the soul, and with that healing the removal of
   the evils incident to disease. Those who become partakers of this new
   principle of life, which is truly human and truly divine, become one
   with Christ. All the merit, righteousness, excellence, and power,
   inherent in this "divine-human life" of course belong to those who
   partake of that life. This righteousness, excellence, etc., are our
   own. They are subjective in us, and form our character, just as the
   nature derived from Adam was ours, with all its corruptions and
   infirmities.

   If asked what is regeneration according to this system, the proper
   answer would probably be, that it is an obsolete term. There is no room
   for the thing usually signified by the word, and no reason for
   retaining the word itself. Regeneration is a work of the Holy Spirit.
   But this system in its integrity does not acknowledge the Holy Spirit
   as a distinct person or agent. And those who are constrained to make
   the acknowledgment of his personality, are evidently embarrassed by the
   admission. What the Scriptures and the Church attribute to the Spirit
   working with the freedom of a personal agent, when and where he sees
   fit, this system attributes to the "theanthropic-life" of Christ,
   working as a new force, according to the natural laws of development.
   [46]

   The impression made upon the readers of the modern theologians of this
   school, is that made by any other form of philosophical disquisition.
   It has not, and from its nature it cannot have anything more than human
   authority. This system may be adopted as a matter of opinion, but it
   cannot be an object of faith. And therefore it cannot support the hopes
   of a soul conscious of guilt. In turning from such writings to the Word
   of God, the transition these theologians would have us believe, is from
   gnw/sij to pi,stij; but to the consciousness of the Christian, it is
   like the transition from the confusion of tongues at Babel, where no
   man understood his fellow, to the symphonious utterance of those "who
   spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost."

   Doctrine of Ebrard.

   Of the writers who belong to the general class of "speculative"
   theologians, some adhere much more nearly to the Scriptures than
   others. Dr. J. H. A. Ebrard, of Erlangen, has already been repeatedly
   referred to as addicted to the Reformed faith; and where he consciously
   departs from it, he considers himself as only carrying out its
   legitimate principles. His "Dogmatik" has, in fact, a far more
   Scriptural character than most of the modern German systems. In Ebrard,
   as in others, we find a compromise attempted between the Church
   doctrine of regeneration, and the modern theory of the incarnation of
   God in the race of man. Not only is a distinction made between
   repentance, conversion, and regeneration; but also true repentance and
   genuine conversion are made to precede regeneration. The two former
   take place in the sphere of the consciousness. In all the states and
   exercises connected with repentance and conversion, the soul is active
   and coöperative; and the only influence exercised by God or his Spirit,
   is mediate and moral. It is not until the sinner has obeyed the command
   to repent, to believe in Christ, and to return unto God, that God gives
   the soul that divine something which makes it a new creature, and
   effects its living organic union with Christ. In this latter process
   the soul is simply passive. God is the only agent. What is said to be
   communicated to the soul is Christ; the person of Christ; the life of
   Christ; his substance, or a new substance. A distinction, however, is
   made between essence and substance. Ebrard insists [47] that the most
   hidden, substantial germ of our being is born again in regeneration --
   not merely changed, but new-born. Nevertheless, he says that the
   "essentia animæ humanæ" is not changed, and assents to the statement by
   Bucan, "Renovatio fit non quoad essentiam ut deliravit Illyricus, sed
   quoad qualitates inhærentes." What he asserts, [48] frequently
   elsewhere, is, "That Christ, real and substantial, is born in us. But
   he adds that the words "real and substantial" are used to guard against
   the assumption that regeneration consists simply in some inward
   exercise, or transient state of the consciousness. It is, as he truly
   teaches, much more; something lower than the consciousness; a change in
   the state of the soul, which determines the acts and exercises which
   reveal themselves in the consciousness, and manifest themselves in the
   life. He finds his doctrine of regeneration, not in what Calvin and
   some few of the Reformed theologians taught under that head, but in
   what they teach of the Lord's Supper, and of the mystical union. Calvin
   [49] says, "Sunt qui manducare Christi carnem, et sanguinem ejus
   bibere, uno verbo definiunt, nihil esse aliud, quam in Christum ipsum
   credere. Sed mihi expressius quiddam ac sublimius videtur voluisse
   docere Christus . . . . nempe vera sui participatione nos vivificari. .
   . .Quemadmodum enim non aspectus sed esus panis corpori alimentum
   sufficit, ita vere ac penitus participem Christi animam fieri convenit,
   ut ipsius virtute in vitam spiritualem vegetetur." "We have here
   certainly," says Ebrard, [50] "the doctrine of a secret, mystical
   communication of Christ's substance to the substantial centre in man
   (the anima'), which develops itself on the one hand in the physical,
   and on the other, in the noetic life." These writers are correct in
   denying that regeneration is a mere change in the purposes, or
   feelings, or conscious states of any kind in man; and also in affirming
   that it involves the communication of a new and abiding principle of
   life to the soul. But they depart from Scripture and from the faith of
   the Church universal in substituting "the theanthropic nature of
   Christ," "his divine-human life," "generic humanity healed and exalted
   to the power of a divine life" (i.e., deified), for the Holy Ghost.
   This substitution is made avowedly in obedience to modern science, to
   the new philosophy which has discovered a true anthropology and
   revealed "the real oneness of God and man." As already remarked, it is
   assumed that this communication of the "theanthropic nature of Christ"
   carried with it his merits as well as his blessedness and power. All we
   have of Christ, we have within us. And if we can discover little of
   God, and little God-like in our souls, so much the worse. It is all we
   have to expect, until our inner life is further developed. The Christ
   within (as some of the Friends also teach), is, according to this
   system, all the Christ we have. Ebrard, therefore, in one view
   identifies regeneration and justification. "Regeneration," he says,
   [51] "as the act of Christ, is the cause (causa efficiens') of
   justification; He communicates his life to us, and awakens a new life
   in us. This is justification, an inward subjective change, which
   involves merit as well as holiness. This confounding the work of the
   Holy Spirit in regeneration, with the judicial, objective act of
   justification, belongs to the system. At least it is only on the ground
   of this infused life that we are pronounced righteous in the sight of
   God. What we receive is "the real divine-human life of Christ," and
   "whatever there may be of merit, virtue, efficacy or moral value it any
   way, in the mediatorial work of Christ, it is all lodged in the life,
   by the power of which alone this work has been accomplished, and in the
   presence of which only it can have either reality or stability. The
   imagination that the merits of Christ's life may be sundered from his
   life itself, and conveyed over to his people under this abstract form,
   on the ground of a merely outward legal constitution, is unscriptural
   and contrary to all reason at the same time." [52] Regeneration
   consisting in the communicating the life of Christ, his substance, to
   the soul, and this divine-human life comprehending all the merit,
   virtue, or efficacy belonging to Christ and his work, -- regeneration
   involves justification, of which it is the ground and the cause.

   Doctrine of Delitzsch.

   Delitzsch devotes one division of his "Biblical Psychology" to the
   subject of regeneration. He begins the discussion with a discourse on
   Christ's person. "When we wish to consider the new spiritual life of
   the redeemed man, we proceed from the divine human archetype, the
   person of the Redeemer." [53] Man was, as to his spirit and soul,
   originally constituted in the image of God; the spirit was the image
   "of His triune nature and the latter [the soul] of His sevenfold
   doxa.'" Man was free to conform his life to the spirit, or divine
   principle within him, or to allow the control of his life to be assumed
   by the soul. Utter ruin was the consequence of the fall. This could be
   corrected and man redeemed only by "a new beginning of similar creative
   intensity." [54] This new beginning was effected in the incarnation.
   The Son of God became man, not by assuming our nature, in the ordinary
   sense of those words, but by ceasing to be almighty, omniscient, and
   omnipresent, and contracting Himself to the limits of humanity. It was
   a human life into which He thus entered; a life including a spirit,
   soul, and body. There is no dualism in Christ's person, as between the
   corporeal and spiritual, or between the human and divine. It is the
   divine nature in the form of humanity, or this divine-human nature,
   which is purely and simply, though perfectly, human, which is
   communicated to the people of God in their regeneration. To this
   fellowship in the life of Christ, faith is indispensable, and therefore
   Ebrard says, infants cannot be the subjects of regeneration, while
   Delitzsch, a Lutheran, maintains that infants are capable of exercising
   faith, and therefore are capable of being regenerated. What is received
   from Christ, or that of which his people are made partakers, is "the
   Spirit, the soul, the body of Christ." [55] The new man, or second
   Adam, was made a "life-giving spirit," and gradually subdues the old
   man, or our Adamic nature, and brings the whole man (pneuma, psuche,
   and soma), spirit, soul, and body, up to the standard of the life of
   Christ, in whom the divine and human are merged into one, or rather
   appear in their original oneness.

   The communication of the theanthropic life to the soul is an act of the
   divine Spirit in which we have neither agency nor consciousness.
   Delitzsch infers from what our Lord said to Nicodemus, John iii. that
   "The operation of the Spirit of regeneration is, therefore, (1.) A free
   one, withdrawn from the power of human volition, of human special
   agency. (2.) A mysterious one, lying beyond human consciousness, and
   only to be recognized by its effects." [56] "It is peculiar to all
   God's creative agencies, that the creature which is thereby brought
   into existence, or in which this or that is brought into existence, has
   no consciousness of what is occurring." [57]

   Various as are the modifications of this doctrine as presented by
   different writers of this general school, regeneration is by all of
   them understood to be the communication of the life of Christ to the
   soul. By the life of Christ is meant his manhood, his human nature,
   which was at the same time divine, and therefore is theanthropic. It
   may be called human, and it may be called divine, for although being
   one, one life, it is truly divine by being perfectly human. We are all
   partakers of humanity as polluted and degraded by the apostasy of Adam.
   Christ, or rather, the Eternal Son of God, assumed human nature, in
   that He became man, and being God, humanity in Him was filled with the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge and grace and power; of that humanity
   we must partake in order to have any part in the salvation of Christ.
   The communication of this life to us, which is our regeneration, is
   through the Church, which is his body, because animated by his human
   life. As we derive our deteriorated humanity by descent from Adam, we
   are made partakers of this renovated, divine humanity by union with the
   Church, in which Christ as a man, and God-man, lives and dwells. And as
   the communication of humanity as it existed in fallen Adam to his
   descendants is by a natural process of organic development; so the
   communication of the renovated humanity as it exists in Christ, to his
   people, and through the world, is also a natural process. It supposes
   no special interference or intervention on the part of God, any more
   than any other organic development in the vegetable or animal world.
   The only thing supernatural about it is the starting point in Christ.

   Doctrine of the Latin Church.

   In the later Latin Church the word regeneration is used as synonymous
   with justification, and is taken in a wide sense as including
   everything involved in the translation of the soul from the kingdom of
   darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son. In regeneration the sinner
   becomes a child of God. It is made therefore, to include, (1.) The
   removal of the "reatus" or guilt of sin. (2.) The cleansing away of
   inherent moral corruption. (3.) The "infusion of new habits of grace;"
   and (4.) Adoption, or recognition of the renewed as sons of God. The
   Council of Trent says, [58] "Justificatio . . . non est sola peccatorum
   remissio, sed et sanctificatio, et renovatio interioris hominis per
   voluntariam susceptionem gratiæ, et donorum, unde homo ex injusto fit
   justus, et ex inimico amicus, ut sit heres secundum spem vitæ æternæ."
   The instrumental cause of justification in this sense, is declared to
   be "sacramentum baptismi, quod est sacramentum fidei, sine qua nulli
   umquam contigit justificatio." As to the effect of baptism, it is
   taught [59] that it takes away not only guilt, but everything of the
   nature of sin, and communicates a new life. "Si quis per Jesu Christi
   Domini gratiam; quæ in baptismate confertur, reatum originalis peccati
   remitti negat, aut etiam asserit, non tolli totum id, quod veram, et
   propriam peccati rationem habet; sed illud dicit tantum radi, aut non
   imputari: anathema sit. In renatis enim nihil odit Deus, quia nihil est
   damnationis iis qui vere consepulti sunt cum Christo per baptisma in
   mortem: qui non secundum carnem ambulant, sed veterem hominem exuentes,
   et novum, qui secundum Deum creatus est, induentes, innocentes,
   immaculati, puri, innoxii, ac Deo dilecti effecti sunt, heredes quidem
   Dei, coheredes autem Christi, ita ut nihil prorsus eos ab ingressu
   coeli remoretur." [60]

   Regeneration, therefore, as effected in baptism, is the removal of the
   guilt and pollution of sin, the infusion of new habits of grace, and
   introduction into the family of God. It is in baptism that all the
   benefits of the redemption of Christ are conveyed to the soul, and this
   is its regeneration or birth into the kingdom of God.

   Doctrine of the Church of England.

   1. There has always been a class of theologians in the English Church
   who hold the theology of the Church of Rome in its leading
   characteristics. They accept, therefore, the definition of
   regeneration, or justification, as they call it, as given by the
   Council of Trent, and quoted above.

   2. Others make a distinction between conversion and regeneration. The
   latter is that grace which attends baptism, and as that sacrament
   without sacrilege cannot be repeated, so regeneration can be
   experienced only once. Conversion is "a change of heart and life from
   sin to holiness." "To the heathen and infidel conversion is absolutely
   and always necessary to salvation." To the baptized Christian
   conversion is not always necessary. "Some persons have confused
   conversion with regeneration, and have taught that all men, the
   baptized, and therefore in fact regenerate, must be regenerated
   afterwards, or they cannot be saved. Now this is in many ways false:
   for regeneration, which the Lord Jesus Christ himself has connected
   with holy baptism, cannot be repeated: moreover, not all men (though
   indeed most men do) fall into such sin after baptism, that conversion,
   or as they term it, regeneration, is necessary to their salvation; and
   if a regeneration were necessary to them, it could only be obtained
   through repetition of baptism, which were an act of sacrilege." "They
   who object to the expression baptismal regeneration, by regeneration
   mean, for the most part, the first influx of irresistible and
   indefectible grace; grace that cannot be repelled by its subject, and
   which must issue in its final salvation. Now, of such grace our Church
   knows nothing, and of course, therefore, means not by regeneration at
   baptism, the first influx of such grace. That the sins, original and
   actual, of the faithful recipient of baptism, are washed away, she doth
   indeed believe; and also that grace is given to him by the immediate
   agency of the Holy Spirit; yet so that the conscience thus cleansed may
   be again defiled, and that the baptized person may, and often does, by
   his own fault, fall again into sin, in which if he die he shall without
   doubt perish everlastingly; his condemnation not being avoided, but
   rather increased, by his baptismal privilege." [61]

   3. A third form of doctrine on this subject, held by some divines of
   this church, is that regeneration properly expresses an external change
   of relation, and not an internal change of the state of the soul and of
   its relation to God. As a proselyte was regenerated when he professed
   himself a Jew, so any one initiated into the visible Church is thereby
   regenerated. This is held to be entirely different from spiritual
   renovation. Regeneration, in this outward sense, is admitted to be by
   baptism; renovation is by the Spirit.

   4. A large class of English theologians have ever remained faithful to
   the evangelical doctrine on this subject, in accordance with the views
   of the Reformers in their Church, who were in full sympathy both in
   doctrine and in ecclesiastical and Christian fellowship with other
   Protestant churches.

   § 3. The Evangelical Doctrine.

   In the Lutheran Symbols the doctrine of Regeneration, which is made to
   include conversion, is thus stated: "Conversio hominis talis est
   immutatio, per operationem Spiritus Sancti, in hominis intellectu,
   voluntate et corde, qua homo (operatione videlicet Spiritus Sancti)
   potest oblatam gratiam apprehendere." [62]

   "Hominis autem nondum renati intellectus et voluntas tantum sunt
   subjectum convertendum, sunt enim hominis spiritualiter mortui
   intellectus et voluntas, in quo homine Spiritus Sanctus conversionem et
   renovationem operatur, ad quod opus hominis convertendi voluntas nihil
   confert, sed patitur, ut Deus in ipsa operetur, donec regeneretur.
   Postea vero in aliis sequentibus bonis operibus Spiritui Sancto
   cooperatur, ea faciens, quæ Deo grata sunt." [63]

   "Sicut igitur homo, qui corporaliter mortuus est, seipsum propriis
   viribus præparare aut accommodare non potest, ut vitam externam
   recipiat: ita homo spiritualiter in peccatis mortuus, seipsum propriis
   viribus ad consequendam spiritualem et coelestem justitiam et vitam
   præparare, applicare, aut vertere non potest, nisi per Filium Dei a
   morte peccati liberetur et vivificetur." [64]

   "Rejicimus errorem eorum qui fingunt, Deum in conversione et
   regeneratione hominis substantiam et essentiam veteris Adami, et
   præcipue animam rationalem penitus abolere, novamque anima essentiam ex
   nihilo, in illa conversione et regeneratione creare." [65]

   With these statements the doctrines taught in the Symbols and by the
   theologians of the Reformed churches, perfectly agree. It is sufficient
   to quote the standards of our own Church. The "Westminster Confession"
   says, "Man, by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all
   ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying salvation; so as a
   natural man being altogether averse from that which is good, and dead
   in sin, is not able, by his own strength, to convert himself, or to
   prepare himself thereunto." "When God converts a sinner, and translates
   him into the state of grace, He freeth him from his natural bondage
   under sin, and by his grace alone enables him freely to will and to do
   that which is spiritually good." "All those whom God hath predestinated
   unto life, and those only, He is pleased, in his appointed and accepted
   time, effectually to call, by his Word and Spirit, out of that state of
   sin and death in which they are by nature, to grace and salvation by
   Jesus Christ; enlightening their minds, spiritually and savingly, to
   understand the things of God, taking away their heart of stone, and
   giving unto them an heart of flesh; renewing their wills, and by his
   Almighty power, determining them to that which is good, and effectually
   drawing them to Jesus Christ; yet so as they come most freely, being
   made willing by his grace." "This effectual call is of God's free and
   special grace alone, not from anything at all foreseen in man, who is
   altogether passive therein, until being quickened and renewed by the
   Holy Ghost, he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and embrace the
   grace offered and conveyed in it." [66]

   The Larger Catechism [67] says, "What is effectual calling? Effectual
   calling is the work of God's almighty power and grace, whereby (out of
   his free and especial love to his elect, and from nothing in them
   moving Him thereunto) He doth in his accepted time invite and draw them
   to Jesus Christ by his Word and Spirit; savingly enlightening their
   minds, renewing and powerfully determining their wills, so as they
   (although in themselves dead in sin) are hereby made willing and able,
   freely to answer his call, and to accept and embrace the grace offered
   and conveyed therein."

   Exposition of the Doctrine.

   According to the common doctrine of Protestants, i.e., of Lutherans and
   Reformed, as appears from the above quotations --

   Regeneration an Act of God.

   1. Regeneration is an act of God. It is not simply referred to Him as
   its giver, and, in that sense, its author, as He is the giver of faith
   and of repentance. It is not an act which, by argument and persuasion,
   or by moral power, He induces the sinner to perform. But it is an act
   of which He is the agent. It is God who regenerates. The soul is
   regenerated. In this sense the soul is passive in regeneration, which
   (subjectively considered) is a change wrought in us, and not an act
   performed by us.

   Regeneration an Act of God's Power.

   2. Regeneration is not only an act of God, but also an act of his
   almighty power. Agreeably to the express declarations of the
   Scriptures, it is so presented in the Symbols of the Protestant
   churches. If an act of omnipotence, it is certainly efficacious, for
   nothing can resist almighty power. The Lutherans indeed deny this. But
   the more orthodox of them mean simply that the sinner can keep himself
   aloof from the means through which, or, rather, in connection with
   which it pleases God to exercise his power. He can absent himself from
   the preaching of the Word, and the use of the sacraments. Or he may
   voluntarily place himself in such an inward posture of resistance as
   determines God not to exert his power in his regeneration. The
   assertion that regeneration is an act of God's omnipotence, is, and is
   intended to be, a denial that it is an act of moral suasion. It is an
   affirmation that it is "physical" in the old sense of that word, as
   opposed to moral; and that it is immediate, as opposed to mediate, or
   through or by the truth. When either in Scripture or in theological
   writings, the word regeneration is taken in a wide sense as including
   conversion or the voluntary turning of the soul to God, then indeed it
   is said to be by the Word. The restoration of sight to the blind by the
   command of Christ, was an act of omnipotence. It was immediate. Nothing
   in the way of instrumentary or secondary coöperating influence
   intervened between the divine volition and the effect. But all
   exercises of the restored faculty were through and by the light. And
   without light sight is impossible. Raising Lazarus from the dead was an
   act of omnipotence. Nothing intervened between the volition and the
   effect. The act of quickening was the act of God. In that matter
   Lazarus was passive. But in all the acts of the restored vitality, he
   was active and free. According to the evangelical system it is in this
   sense that regeneration is the act of God's almighty power. Nothing
   intervenes between his volition that the soul, spiritually dead, should
   live, and the desired effect. But in all that belongs to the
   consciousness; all that precedes or follows the imparting of this new
   life, the soul is active and is influenced by the truth acting
   according to the laws of our mental constitution.

   Regeneration in the Subjective Sense of the Word not an Act.

   3. Regeneration, subjectively considered, or viewed as an effect or
   change wrought in the soul, is not an act. It is not a new purpose
   created by God (if that language be intelligible), or formed by the
   sinner under his influence. Nor is it any conscious exercise of any
   kind. It is something which lies lower than consciousness.

   Not a Change of Substance.

   4. It is not, however, according to the Church doctrine, any change in
   the substance of the soul. This is rejected universally as Manicheism,
   and as inconsistent with the nature of sin and holiness. It is, indeed,
   often assumed that there is nothing in the soul but its substance and
   its acts; and, therefore, if regeneration be not a change in the acts,
   it must be a change of the substance of the soul. This assumption,
   however, is not only arbitrary, but it is also opposed to the intimate
   convictions of all men. That is, of all men in their normal state, when
   not speculating or theorizing. That such is the common judgment of men
   has already been proved under the heads of original righteousness and
   original sin. Every one recognizes, in the first place, that such
   constitutional principles as parental love, the social affections, a
   sense of justice, pity, etc., are immanent states of the soul which can
   be resolved neither into its essence nor acts. So also acquired habits
   are similar permanent and immanent states which are not acts, much less
   modifications or changes of the essence. The same is true of
   dispositions, amiable and unamiable. The refinement of taste and
   feeling due to education and culture, is not a change in the essence of
   the mind. It cannot reasonably be denied that a state of mind produced
   by culture, may be produced by the volition of God. What is true in
   every other department of our inner life, is true of our moral and
   religious nature. Besides those acts and states which reveal themselves
   in the consciousness, there are abiding states, dispositions,
   principles, or habits, as they are indifferently called, which
   constitute character and give it stability, and are the proximate
   determining cause why our voluntary exercises and conscious states are
   what they are. This is what the Bible calls the heart, which has the
   same relation to all our acts that the nature of a tree, as good or
   bad, has to the character of its fruit. A good tree is known to be good
   if its fruit be good. But the goodness of the fruit does not constitute
   or determine the goodness of the tree, but the reverse. In like manner,
   it is not good acts which make the man good; the goodness of the man
   determines the character of his acts.

   It is a New Life.

   5. While denying that regeneration is a change either in the essence or
   acts of the soul, evangelical Christians declare it to be, in the
   language of Scripture, "a quickening," a zoopoiein, a communication of
   a new principle of life. It is hard, perhaps impossible, to define what
   life is. Yet every man is familiar with its manifestations. He sees and
   knows the difference between death and life, between a dead and living
   plant or animal. And, therefore, when the Bible tells us that in
   regeneration God imparts a new form of life to the soul, the language
   is as intelligible as human language can be in relation to such a
   subject. We know that when a man is dead as to the body he neither
   sees, feels, nor acts. The objects adapted to impress the senses of the
   living make no impression upon him. They awaken no corresponding
   feeling, and they call forth no activity. The dead are insensible and
   powerless. When the Scriptures declare that men are spiritually dead
   they do not deny to them physical, intellectual, social, or moral life.
   They admit that the objects of sense, the truths of reason, our social
   relations and moral obligations, are more or less adequately
   apprehended; these do not fail to awaken feeling and to excite to
   action. But there is a higher class of objects than these, what the
   Bible calls "The things of God, "The things of the Spirit," "The things
   pertaining to salvation." These things, although intellectually
   apprehended as presented to our cognitive faculties, are not
   spiritually discerned by the unrenewed man. A beautiful object in
   nature or art may be duly apprehended as an object of vision by an
   uncultivated man, who has no perception of its æsthetic excellence, and
   no corresponding feeling of delight in its contemplation. So it is with
   the unrenewed man. He may have an intellectual knowledge of the facts
   and doctrines of the Bible, but no spiritual discernment of their
   excellence, and no delight in them. The same Christ, as portrayed in
   the Scriptures, is to one man without form or comeliness that we should
   desire Him; to another He is the chief among ten thousand and the one
   altogether lovely; "God manifest in the flesh," whom it is impossible
   not to adore, love, and obey.

   This new life, therefore, manifests itself in new views of God, of
   Christ, of sin, of holiness, of the world, of the gospel, and of the
   life to come; in short, of all those truths which God has revealed as
   necessary to salvation. This spiritual illumination is so important and
   so necessary and such an immediate effect of regeneration, that
   spiritual knowledge is not only represented in the Bible as the end of
   regeneration (Col. iii. 10; 1 Tim. ii. 4), but the whole of conversion
   (which is the effect of regeneration) is summed up in knowledge. Paul
   describes his conversion as consisting in Christ's being revealed to
   Him (Gal. i. 16); and the Scriptures make all religion, and even
   eternal life, to be a form of knowledge. Paul renounced everything for
   the excellency of the knowledge of Christ (Phil. iii. 8), and our Lord
   says that the knowledge of Himself and of the Father is eternal life.
   (John xvii. 8). The whole process of salvation is described as a
   translation from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light.
   There is no wonder, therefore, that the ancients called regeneration a
   photismos, an illumination. If a man born blind were suddenly restored
   to sight, such a flood of knowledge and delight would flow in upon him,
   through the organ of vision, that he might well think that all living
   consisted in seeing. So the New Testament writers represent the change
   consequent on regeneration, the opening the eyes on the certainty,
   glory, and excellence of divine things, and especially of the
   revelation of God in the person of his Son, as comprehending almost
   everything which pertains to spiritual life. Inseparably connected with
   this knowledge and included in it, is faith, in all the forms and
   exercises in which spiritual truths are its objects. Delight in the
   things thus revealed is the necessary consequence of spiritual
   illumination; and with delight come satisfaction and peace, elevation
   above the world, or spiritual mindedness, and such a sense of the
   importance of the things not seen and eternal, that all the energies of
   the renewed soul are (or, it is acknowledged, they should be) devoted
   to securing them for ourselves and others.

   This is one of the forms in which the Bible sets forth the doctrine of
   regeneration. It is raising the soul dead in sin to spiritual life. And
   this spiritual life unfolds or manifests itself just as any other form
   of life, in all the exercises appropriate to its nature.

   It is a New Birth.

   The same doctrine on this subject is taught in other words when
   regeneration is declared to be a new birth. At birth the child enters
   upon a new state of existence. Birth is not its own act. It is born. It
   comes from a state of darkness, in which the objects adapted to its
   nature cannot act on it or awaken its activities. As soon as it comes
   into the world all its faculties are awakened; it sees, feels, and
   hears, and gradually unfolds all its faculties as a rational and moral,
   as well as physical being. The Scriptures teach that it is thus in
   regeneration. The soul enters upon a new state. It is introduced into a
   new world. A whole class of objects before unknown or unappreciated are
   revealed to it, and exercise upon it their appropriate influence. The
   "things of the Spirit" become the chief objects of desire and pursuit,
   and all the energies of the new-born soul are directed towards the
   spiritual, as distinguished from the seen and temporal. This
   representation is in accordance with the evangelical doctrine on this
   subject. It is not consistent with any of the false theories of
   regeneration, which regard regeneration as the sinner's own act; as a
   mere change of purpose; or as a gradual process of moral culture.

   A New Heart.

   Another mode in which this doctrine is set forth is found in those
   passages in which God is represented as giving his people a new heart.
   The heart in Scripture is that which thinks, feels, wills, and acts. It
   is the soul; the self. A new heart is, therefore, a new self, a new
   man. It implies a change of the whole character. It is a new nature.
   Out of the heart proceed all conscious, voluntary, moral exercises. A
   change of heart, therefore, is a change which precedes these exercises
   and determines their character. A new heart is to a man what goodness
   is to the tree in the parable of our Lord.

   In regeneration, therefore, there is a new life communicated to the
   soul; the man is the subject of a new birth; he receives a new nature
   or new heart, and becomes a new creature. As the change is neither in
   the substance nor in the mere exercises of the soul, it is in those
   immanent dispositions, principles, tastes, or habits which underlie all
   conscious exercises, and determine tht character of the man and of all
   his acts.

   The whole Soul the Subject of this change.

   6. According to the evangelical doctrine the whole soul is the subject
   of regeneration. It is neither the intellect to the exclusion of the
   feelings, nor the feelings to the exclusion of the intellect; nor is it
   the will alone, either in its wider or in its more limited sense, that
   is the subject of the change in question. This is evident, --

   (1.) Because the soul is a unit, and is so recognized in Scripture. Its
   faculties are not so dissociated that one can be good and another bad,
   one saved and another lost, one active in the sphere of morals and
   religion and the others inactive. In every such exercise the
   intelligence, the feelings, the will, and the conscience, or moral
   consciousness, are of necessity involved.

   (2.) In the description of this work all the faculties of the soul are
   represented as affected. The mind is illuminated, the eyes of the
   understanding are opened; the heart is renewed; the will is conquered,
   or, the man is made willing.

   (3.) When Lazarus was restored to life, it was not one member of the
   body, or one faculty that received the vivifying influence. It was not
   the heart that was set in motion, the brain and lungs being restored by
   its action. It was the whole man that was made alive. And it is the
   whole soul that is regenerated.

   (4.) This is further evident from the effects ascribed to regeneration.
   These effects are not confined to any one department of our nature.
   Regeneration secures right knowledge as well as right feeling; and
   right feeling is not the effect of right knowledge, nor is right
   knowledge the effect of right feeling. The two are the inseparable
   effects of a work which affects the whole soul.

   (5.) When our Lord teaches that the tree must be made good in order
   that the fruit should be good, it was not any one part of the tree
   which must be changed, but the whole tree. In like manner it is the
   soul, in the centre and unity of its life, that is the subject of that
   life-giving power of the Holy Ghost, by which it becomes a new
   creature. The doctrine that regeneration is a change affecting only one
   of the faculties of the soul has its foundation entirely outside of the
   Scriptures. It is simply an inference from a particular psychological
   theory, and has no authority in theology.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. Objection.

   The same objections which are urged against other doctrines of grace
   are pressed against the Augustinian view of the nature of regeneration.
   These objections are of three classes.

   Denial of Supernaturalism.

   1. The first class of objections are founded on the denial of Theism;
   or at least on the denial of the Scriptural doctrine of the relation of
   God to the world. It is an assumption common to most of the forms of
   modern philosophy that the only agency of the Supreme Being (whether
   personal or impersonal) is according to law. It is ordered, uniform,
   and in, with, and through second causes, if such causes are admitted.
   Everything is natural, and nothing supernatural, either in the outward
   world or in the sphere of things spiritual. There can be no creation
   "ex nihilo," no miracles, no immediate revelation, no inspiration in
   the church sense of that term; no supernatural work upon the heart, and
   therefore no regeneration in the sense of an immediate operation of
   almighty power on the soul. Those who depart from their principles so
   far as to admit the person of Christ to be supernatural in its origin
   contend that the supernatural in Him becomes natural, and that from Him
   onward the diffusion of spiritual life is by a regular process of
   development, as simply natural as the development of humanity from Adam
   through all his posterity.

   This is purely a philosophical theory. It has no authority for
   Christians. As it is contrary to the express teaching of the Scriptures
   it cannot be adopted by those who recognize them as the infallible rule
   of faith and practice. As it contradicts the moral and religious
   convictions arising from the constitution of our nature, it must be
   hurtful in all its tendencies, and can be adopted by those only who
   sacrifice to speculation their interior life.

   Resting on False Psychological Theories.

   2. A second class of objections are founded on certain psychological
   theories on free agency, on the nature of the soul, and on the
   conditions of moral obligation. No theories on these, or any other
   subjects, have any authority, except those which underlie and are
   necessarily assumed in the facts and doctrines of the Scripture. If any
   theory teaches that plenary ability is essential to free agency; that
   God cannot control with certainty the acts of free agents without
   destroying their liberty; or that free acts cannot be foreseen,
   predicted, or foreordained, then such theory must be false if the
   Scriptures assert facts which imply the contrary. If a theory teaches
   that men are responsible only for acts of the will, under their own
   control, that theory must be rejected if the Bible teaches that we are
   responsible for states of mind over which the will has no direct power.
   The facts involved in the evangelical doctrine of regeneration, as
   stated above, contradict the theories on which the arguments of the
   Remonstrants, Pelagians, and others against that doctrine rest, and
   therefore those theories must share the fate of every doctrine which
   contradicts established facts. This has been demonstrated over and over
   in different ages of the Church. The principles involved in these
   objections have been discussed in the preceding pages, and need not be
   again considered.

   Objections founded on the Divine Perfection.

   3. A third class of objections are drawn from the supposed
   inconsistency of this doctrine with the moral perfections of God. If
   all men are dead in sin, destitute of the power to restore themselves
   to life, then not only is it unjust that they should be condemned, but
   it is also incompatible with the divine rectitude that God should exert
   his almighty power in the regeneration of some, while He leaves others
   to perish. Justice, it is said, demands that all should have an equal
   opportunity; that all should have, by nature or from grace, power to
   secure their own salvation. It is obvious that such objections do not
   bear peculiarly against the Augustinian system. They are urged by
   atheists against Theism. If there be a personal God of infinite power,
   why does He permit sin and misery to hold joint supremacy on earth; why
   are good and evil so unequally distributed, and why is the distribution
   so arbitrary?

   Deists make the same objections against the divine authority of the
   Bible. They cannot receive it as the Word of God because it represents
   the Creator and Governor of the world as placing men under
   circumstances which secure in some way the universality of sin, and
   then punishing them with inexorable severity even for their idle words.

   It is also plain that the different anti-Augustinian systems afford no
   real relief from these difficulties. Admitting that regeneration is the
   sinner's own act; admitting that every man has all the knowledge and
   all the ability necessary to secure his salvation, it remains true that
   few are saved, and that God does not interpose to prevent the great
   majority of adult men in the present state of the world perishing in
   their sins.

   Augustinians do not deny these difficulties. They only maintain that
   they are not peculiar to their system; and they rest content with the
   solution of them given in the Scriptures. That solution agrees with all
   the facts of consciousness and experience, so far as consciousness and
   experience extend. The Bible teaches that man was created holy; that by
   his voluntary transgression of the divine law he apostatized from God;
   that in consequence of this apostasy all men come into the world in a
   state of spiritual death, both guilty and polluted; that God exercises
   no influence to lead them into sin, but on the contrary, by his truth,
   his providence, and by his Spirit exerts all that influence over them
   which should induce rational beings to repent and seek his pardoning
   mercy and sanctifying grace; that all those who sincerely and
   faithfully seek reconciliation with God in the way of his appointment
   He actually saves; that of his sovereign grace He, in the exercise of
   his mighty power, renews and sanctifies a multitude which no man can
   number, who would otherwise have continued in their sins. With these
   representations of the Scriptures everything within the sphere of our
   knowledge agrees. Consciousness and experience testify that we are an
   apostate race; that all men are sinners, and, being sinners, have
   forfeited all claims on the favour of God; that in continuing in sin
   and in rejecting the overtures of mercy men act voluntarily, following
   the desires of their own hearts. Every man's conscience, moreover,
   teaches him that he has never sought the salvation of his soul with the
   sincerity and perseverance with which men seek the things of the world,
   and yet failed in his efforts. Every man who comes short of eternal
   life knows that the responsibility rests upon himself. On the other
   hand, the experience of every believer is a witness to him that it is
   of God and not of himself that he is in Christ (1 Corinthians i. 30);
   every believer knows that if God had left him to himself he wodd have
   continued in unbelief and sin. Why God intervenes to save one and not
   another, when all are equally undeserving; why the things of God are
   revealed unto babes while hidden from the wise and prudent, can only be
   answered in the language of our Lord, "Even so, Father, for so it
   seemed good in thy sight." (Matthew xi. 26.)

   The more popular and common objections that the Augustinian doctrine of
   regeneration leads to the neglect of the means of grace, "to waiting
   for God's time," to indifference or despair; that it is inconsistent
   with exhortations and commands addressed to sinners to repent and
   believe, and incompatible with moral responsibility, have already been
   repeatedly considered. It is enough to say once more that these
   objections are founded on the assumption that inability, even when it
   arises out of our own sinfulness, is incompatible with obligation.
   Besides, it is the natural and actual tendency of a sense of
   helplessness under a burden of evil, to lead to earnest and importunate
   application for relief to Him who is able to afford it, and by whom it
   is offered.

CHAPTER XVI.

  FAITH
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Preliminary Remarks.

   The first conscious exercise of the renewed soul is faith, as the first
   conscious act of a man born blind whose eyes have been opened, is
   seeing. The exercise of vision in such a man is indeed attended by so
   many new sensations and emotions that he cannot determine how much of
   this new experience comes through the eye, and how much from other
   sources. It is so with the believer. As soon as his eyes are opened by
   the renewing of the Holy Ghost he is in a new world. Old things have
   passed away, all things are become new. The apprehension of "the things
   of God" as true lies at the foundation of all the exercises of the
   renewed soul. The discussions on the question, Whether faith precedes
   repentance, or repentance faith, can have no place if the meaning of
   the words be agreed upon. Unless faith be limited to some of its
   special exercises there can be no question that in the order of nature
   it must precede repentance. Repentance is the turning of the soul from
   sin unto God, and unless this be produced by the believing apprehension
   of the truth it is not even a rational act. As so much prominence is
   assigned to faith in the Scriptures, as all the promises of God are
   addressed to believers, and as all the conscious exercises of spiritual
   life involve the exercise of faith, without which they are impossible,
   the importance of this grace cannot be overestimated. To the theologian
   and to the practical Christian it is indispensable that clear and
   correct ideas should be entertained on the subject. It is one of
   special difficulty. This difficulty arises partly from the nature of
   the subject; partly from the fact that usage has assigned the word
   faith so many different meanings; partly from the arbitrary definitions
   given of it by philosophers and theologians; and partly from the great
   diversity of aspects under which it is presented in the Word of God.

   The question, What is Faith? is a very comprehensive one In one view it
   is a metaphysical question. What is the psychological name of the act
   or state of the mind which we designate faith, or belief? In this
   aspect the discussion concerns the philosopher as much as the
   theologian. Secondly, faith may be viewed as to its exercise in the
   whole sphere of religion and morality. Thirdly, it may be considered as
   a Christian grace, the fruit of the Spirit; that is, those exercises of
   faith which are peculiar to the regenerated people of God. This is what
   is meant by saving faith. Fourthly, it may be viewed in its relation to
   justification, sanctification, and holy living, or, as to those special
   exercises of faith which are required as the necessary conditions of
   the sinner's acceptance with God, or as essential to holiness of heart
   and life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. The Psychological Nature of Faith.

   Faith in the widest sense of the word, is assent to the truth, or the
   persuasion of the mind that a thing is true. In ordinary popular
   language we are said to believe whatever we regard as true. The primary
   element of faith is trust. The Hebrew word 'mn means to sustain, to
   uphold. In the Niphal, to be firm, and, in a moral sense, to be
   trustworthy. In the Hiphil, to regard as firm, or trustworthy, to place
   trust or confidence in. In like manner the Greek pisteuo (from pistis,
   and that from peitho, to persuade), means to trust, i.e., to be
   persuaded that a person or thing is trustworthy. Hence the epithet
   pistos is applied to any one who is, and who shows himself to be,
   worthy of trust. In Latin credere (whence our word credit) has the same
   meaning. In mercantile matters it means to lend, to trust to; and then
   in general, to exercise trust in. "Crede mihi," trust me, rely on my
   word. Fides (from fido, and that from peitho), is also trust,
   confidence exercised in regard to any person or thing; then the
   disposition, or virtue which excites confidence; then the promise,
   declaration, or pledge which is the outward ground of confidence. In
   the cognate words, fidens, fidelis, fiducia, the same idea is
   prominent. The German word "Glaube" has the same general meaning. It is
   defined by Heinsius (Wörterbuch): "der Zustand des Gemüthes, da man
   eine Sache für wahr hält und sich darauf verlässt," i.e., "that state
   of mind in which a man receives and relies upon a thing as true." The
   English word "faith" is said to be from the Anglo-Saxon "fægan" to
   covenant. It is that state ef mind which a covenant requires or
   supposes; that is, it is confidence in a person or thing as
   trustworthy. "To believe," is defined by the Latin "credere, fidem dare
   sive habere." "The etymologists," says Richardson, "do not attempt to
   account for this important word: it is undoubtedly formed on the Dut.
   Leven; Ger. Leben; A.-S. Lif-ian, Be-lif-ian; Goth. Liban, vivere, to
   live, or be-live, to dwell. Live or leve, be- or bi-live or leve, are
   used indifferently by old writers, whether to denote vivere or
   credere. . . . . To believe, then, is to live by or according to, to
   abide by; to guide, conduct, regulate, govern, or direct the life by;
   to take, accept, assume or adopt as a rule of life; and, consequently,
   to think, deem, or judge right; to be firmly persuaded of, to give
   credit to; to trust, or think trustworthy; to have or give faith or
   confidence; to confide, to think or deem faithful."

   The Primary Idea of Faith is Trust.

   From all this it appears that the primary idea of faith is trust. The
   primary idea of truth is that which is trustworthy; that which sustains
   our expectations, which does not disappoint, because it really is what
   it is assumed or declared to be. It is opposed to the deceitful, the
   false, the unreal, the empty, and the worthless. To regard a thing as
   true, is to regard it as worthy of trust, as being what it purports to
   be. Faith, in the comprehensive and legitimate meaning of the word,
   therefore, is trust.

   In accordance with this general idea of faith, Augustine [68] says,
   "Credere, nihil aliud est, quam cum assensione cogitare." Thus, also,
   Reid [69] says, "Belief admits of all degrees, from the slightest
   suspicion to the fullest assurance. . . . . There are many operations
   of the mind in which . . . . we find belief to be an essential
   ingredient. . . . . Belief is an ingredient in consciousness, in
   perception, and in remembrance. . . . . We give the name of evidence to
   whatever is a ground of belief. . . . . What this evidence is, is more
   easily felt than described. . . . . The common occasions of life lead
   us to distinguish evidence into different kinds, . . . . such as the
   evidence of sense, the evidence of memory, the evidence of
   consciousness, the evidence of testimony, the evidence of axioms, the
   evidence of reasoning. . . . . They seem to me to agree only in this,
   that they are all fitted by nature to produce belief in the human
   mind."

   The more limited Sense of the Word.

   There is, however, in most cases a great difference between the general
   signification of a word and its special and characteristic meaning.
   Although, therefore, there is an element cf belief in all our
   cognitions, there is an important difference between what is strictly
   and properly called faith, and those states or acts of the mind which
   we designate as sight or perception, intuition, opinions, conclusions,
   or apodictic judgments. What that characteristic difference is, is the
   point to be determined. There are modes of statement on this subject
   current among a certain class of philosophers and theologians, which
   can hardly be regarded as definitions of faith. They take the word out
   of its ordinary and established meaning, or arbitrarily limit it to a
   special sphere of our mental operations. Thus Morell [70] says, "Faith
   is the intuition of eternal verities." But eternal verities are not the
   only objects of faith; nor is intuition the only mode of apprehending
   truth which is of the nature of belief. The same objections bear
   against the assertion that "Faith is the organ for the supernatural and
   divine; "or, as Eschenmayer expresses it, [71] "Ein vom Denken, Fühlen
   und Wollen verschiedenes, eigenthümliches Organ für das Ewige und
   Heilige; a special organ for the eternal and the holy." The
   supernatural and divine, however, are not the exclusive objects even of
   religious faith. It is by faith we know that the worlds were made by
   the word of God; it was by faith Noah prepared the ark, and Abraham,
   being called of God, went out not knowing whither he went. The objects
   of faith in these cases are not what is meant by "eternal verities." It
   is, moreover, an arbitrary assumption that faith is "a special organ,"
   even when things supernatural and divine are its object. Our nature is
   adapted to the reception of all kinds of truth of which we can have any
   idea. But it is not necessary to assume a special organ for historical
   truths, a special organ for scientific truths, and another for the
   general truths of revelation, and still another for "the eternal and
   the holy." God has constituted us capable of belief, and the complex
   state of mind involved in the act of faith is of course different
   according to the nature of the truth believed, and the nature of the
   evidence on which our faith is founded. But this does not necessitate
   the assumption of a distinct organ for each kind of truth.

   Faith not to be regarded as simply a Christian Grace.

   No less unsatisfactory are those descriptions of faith which regard it
   only in its character as a Christian and saving grace. Delitzsch, for
   example, [72] describes faith as the most central act of our being; the
   return to God, the going out of our inner life to Him. "This longing
   after God s free, merciful love, as his own Word declares it, a
   longing, reaching forth, and grasping it; this naked, unselfish
   craving, feeling itself satisfied with nothing else than God's promised
   grace; this eagerness, absorbing every ray of light that proceeds from
   God's reconciled love; this convinced and safety-craving appropriation
   and clinging to the word of grace; this is faith. According to its
   nature, it is the pure receptive correlative of the word of promise; a
   means of approaching again to God, which, as the word itself, is
   appointed through the distance of God in consequence of sin; for faith
   has to confide in the word, in spite of all want of comprehension, want
   of sight, want of experience. No experimental actus reflexi belong to
   the nature of faith. It is, according to its nature, actia directa, to
   wit, fiducia supplex." All this is doubtless true of the believer. He
   does thus long after God, and appropriate the assurance of his love,
   and cling to his promises of grace; but faith has a wider range than
   this. There are exercises of faith not included in this description,
   recorded in Scripture, and especially in the eleventh chapter of the
   Epistle to the Hebrews.

   Erdmann [73] says that religious faith, the faith on which the
   Scriptures lay so much stress, is, "Bewusstseyn der Versöhnung mit
   Gott, consciousness of reconciliation with God." He insists that faith
   cannot be separated from its contents. It is not the man who holds this
   or that to be true, who is a believer; but the man who is convinced of
   a specific truth, namely, that he is reconciled with God. Calling faith
   a consciousness is not a definition of its nature. And limiting it to a
   consciousness of reconciliation with God is contrary to the usage of
   Scripture and of theology.

   Definitions of Faith founded on its Subjective Nature.

   The more common and generally received definitions of faith, may
   perhaps be reduced to three classes, all of which include the general
   idea of persuasion of the truth. But some seek the distinguishing
   character of faith in its subjective nature, others, in the nature of
   its object; others, in the nature of the evidence, or ground on which
   it rests.

   Faith as distinguished from Opinion and Knowledge.

   To the first of these classes belong the following definitions: Faith
   or belief is said to be a persuasion of the truth stronger than
   opinion, and weaker than knowledge. Metaphysicians divide the objects
   of our cognitions into the possible, the real, and the necessary. With
   regard to the merely possible we can form only conjectures, or
   opinions, more or less plausible or probable. With regard to things
   which the mind with greater or less confidence views as certain,
   although it cannot justify that confidence to itself or others, i.e.,
   cannot demonstrate the certainty of the object, it is said to believe.
   What it is perfectly assured of, and can demonstrate to be true so as
   to coerce conviction, it is said to know. Thus Locke defines faith to
   be the assent of the mind to propositions which are probably, but not
   certainly true. Bailey [74] says, "I propose to confine it [belief or
   faith] first, to the effect on the mind of the premises in what is
   termed probable reasoning, or what I have named contingent reasoning --
   in a word the premises in all reasoning, but that which is
   demonstrative; and secondly, to the state of holding true when that
   state, far from being the effect of any premises discerned by the mind,
   is dissociated from all evidence." To believe is to admit a thing as
   true, according to Kant, on grounds sufficient subjectively,
   insufficient objectively. Or, as more fully stated, "Holding for true,
   or the subjective validity of a judgment in relation to conviction
   (which is, at the same time, objectively valid) has the three following
   degrees: opinion, belief, and knowledge. Opinion is a consciously
   insufficient judgment, subjectively as well as objectively. Belief is
   subjectively sufficient, but is recognized as being objectively
   insufficient. Knowledge is both subjectively and objectively
   sufficient. Subjective sufficiency is termed conviction (for myself);
   objective sufficiency is termed certainty (for all)." [75] Erdmann [76]
   says, "Man versteht unter Glauben eine jede Gewissheit, die geringer
   ist als das Wissen, und etwa stärker ist als ein blesses Meinen oder
   Fürmöglichhalten (z. B. ich glaube, dass es heute regnen wird)." "By
   faith is understood any persuasion which is weaker than knowledge, but
   somewhat stronger than a mere deeming possible or probable, as, e.g., I
   believe it will rain to-day." This he gives as the commonly accepted
   meaning of the word, although he utterly repudiates it as a definition
   of religious faith.

   It is urged in support of this definition of faith that with regard to
   everything of which we are not absolutely sure, and yet are persuaded
   or convinced of its truth, we say we believe. Thus with respect to
   things remembered; if the recollection is indistinct and uncertain, we
   say we think, e.g., we think we saw a certain person at a given time
   and place; we are not sure, but such is our impression. If our
   persuasion of the fact be stronger, we say we believe it. If we have,
   and can have, no doubt about it, we say we know it. In like manner the
   testimony of our senses may be so weak as to produce only a probability
   that the thing is as it appears; if clearer, it produces a belief more
   or less decided; if so clear as to preclude all doubt, the effect is
   knowledge. If we see a person at a distance, and we are entirely
   uncertain who it is, we can only say we think it is some one whom we
   know. If that persuasion becomes stronger, we say, we believe it is he.
   If perfectly sure, we say, we know it. In all these cases the only
   difference between opinion, belief, and knowledge, is their relative
   strength. The objects are the same, their relation to the mind is the
   same, and the ground or evidence on which they severally rest is of the
   same kind. It is said that it would be incorrect to say, "We believe
   that we slept in our house last night;" if perfectly sure of the fact.
   If a witness in a court of justice simply says, "I believe I was at a
   certain place at a given time," his testimony would be of no value. He
   must be able to say that he is sure of the fact -- that he knows it.

   Objections to this Definition.

   Of this definition of faith, it may be remarked, --

   1. That the meaning which it assigns to the word is certainly
   legitimate, sustained by established usage. The states of mind
   expressed by the words, I think a thing to be true; I believe it; I
   know it, are distinguished from each other simply by the different
   degrees of certainty which enter into them respectively. The probable
   ground of this use of the word to believe, is, that there is more of
   the element of trust (or a voluntarily giving to evidence a greater
   influence on the mind than of necessity belongs to it), manifest in our
   consciousness, than is expressed by saying we think, or, we know.
   However this may be, it cannot be denied that the word belief often
   expresses a degree of conviction greater than opinion and less than
   knowledge.

   2. But this is not the distinguishing characteristic of faith, or its
   differentia. There are exercises of faith into which this uncertainty
   does not enter. Some of the strongest convictions of which the mind is
   capable are beliefs. Even our assurance of the veracity of
   consciousness, the foundation of all other convictions, is of the
   nature of faith. So the primary truths which are, and must be assumed
   in all our researches and arguments, are beliefs. They are taken on
   trust. They cannot be proved. If any man denies them, there is nothing
   more to be said. He cannot be convinced. Sir William Hamilton [77]
   says, "St. Austin accurately says, We know what rests upon reason; we
   believe what rests upon authority.' But reason itself must at last rest
   upon authority; for the original data of reason do not rest on reason,
   but are necessarily accepted by reason on the authority of what is
   beyond itself. These data are, therefore, in rigid propriety, beliefs
   or trusts. Thus it is that, in the last resort, we must, perforce,
   philosophically admit, that belief is the primary condition of reason,
   and not reason the ultimate ground of belief. We are compelled to
   surrender the proud Intellige ut credas of Abelard, to content
   ourselves with the humble Crede ut intelligas of Anselm."

   The same is true in other spheres. The effect on the mind produced by
   human testimony is universally recognized as faith. If that testimony
   is inadequate it does not preclude doubt; but it may be so strong as to
   make all doubt impossible. No sane man ean doubt the existence of such
   cities as London and Paris. But to most men that existence is not a
   matter of knowledge either intuitive or discursive. It is something
   taken on trust, on the authority of others; which taking on trust is
   admitted by philosophers, theologians, and the mass of men, to be a
   form of faith. Again, in some moral states of mind a man's conviction
   of the reality of a future state of reward and punishment is as strong
   as his belief in his own existence, and much stronger than his
   confidence in the testimony of his senses. And yet a future state of
   existence is not a matter of knowledge. It is an object of faith, or a
   thing believed. We accordingly find that the Scriptures teach that
   there is a full assurance of faith; a faith which precludes the
   possibility of doubt. Paul says, "I know whom I have believed, and am
   persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him
   against that day." (2 Tim. i. 12.) As Job had said ages before, "I know
   that my Redeemer liveth." The Apostle declares, Hebrews xi. 1, faith to
   be an hupostasis and elenchos, than which no stronger terms could be
   selected to express assured conviction. The power, also, which the
   Bible attributes to faith as the controlling principle of life, as
   overcoming the world, subduing kingdoms, stopping the mouths of lions,
   quenching the violence of fire, turning to flight the armies of the
   aliens, is proof enough that it is no weak persuasion of the truth.
   That definition, therefore, which makes the characteristic of faith to
   be a measure of confidence greater than opinion, but less than
   knowledge, cannot be deemed satisfactory.

   Faith not a Voluntary Conviction.

   A second definition of faith, founded on its nature, is that which
   makes it "a voluntary conviction or persuasion of the truth." This is a
   very old view of the matter. According to Theodoret, [78] pistis estin
   hekousios tes psuches sunkatatheitis, i.e., "a voluntary assent of the
   mind." And Thomas Aquinas says, [79] "Credere est actus intellectus
   assentientis veritati divinæ ex imperio voluntatis a Deo motæ per
   gratiam." [80] He distinguishes between knowledge and faith by
   representing the former as the conviction produced by the object itself
   seen intuitively or discursively ("sicut patet in principiis
   primis, . . . . vel . . . . sicut patet de conclusionibus") to be true;
   whereas in the latter the mind is not sufficiently moved to assent "ab
   objecto proprio, sed per quandam electionem, voluntarie declinans in
   unam partem magis quam in alteram. Et siquidem hæc sit cum dubitatione
   et formidine alterius partis, erit opinio. Si autem sit cum certitudine
   absque tali formidine, erit fides."

   This definition admits of different explanations. The word "voluntary,"
   if its meaning be determined by the wide sense of the word "will,"
   includes every operation of the mind not purely intellectual. And
   therefore to say that faith is a voluntary assent is to say that faith
   is not merely a speculative assent, an act of the judgment pronouncing
   a thing to be true, but includes feeling. Nitsch, therefore, defines
   faith to be a "gefühlsmassiges Erkennen." "Die Einheit des Gefühls und
   der Erkenntniss; [81] a knowledge or persuasion of truth combined with
   feeling, -- the unity of feeling and knowledge." But if the word "will"
   be taken in the sense of the power of self-determination, then nothing
   is voluntary which does not involve the exercise of that power. If in
   this sense faith be voluntary, then we must have the power to believe
   or disbelieve at pleasure. If we believe the truth, it is because we
   choose or determine ourselves to receive it; if we reject it, it is
   because we will to disbelieve it. The decision is determined neither by
   the nature of the object nor by the nature or degree of the evidence.
   Sometimes both of these meanings of the word voluntary seem to be
   combined by those who define faith to be a voluntary assent of the
   mind, or an assent of the intellect determined by the will. This
   appears from what Aquinas, for example, says when he discusses the
   question whether faith is a virtue. He argues that if faith be a
   virtue, which he admits it to be, it must include love, because love is
   the form or principle of all the virtues; and it must be
   self-determined because there could be no virtue in faith if it were
   the inevitable effect of the evidence or testimony. If a virtue, it
   must include an act of self-determination; we must decide to do what we
   have the power not to do.

   Remarks on this Definition of Faith.

   This definition of faith contains many elements of truth. In the first
   place: it is true that faith and feeling are often inseparable. They
   together constitute that state of mind to which the name faith is
   given. The perception of beauty is of necessity connected with the
   feeling of delight. Assent to moral truth involves the feeling of moral
   approbation. In like manner spiritual discernment (faith when the fruit
   of the Spirit) includes delight in the things of the Spirit, not only
   as true, but as beautiful and good. This is the difference between a
   living and dead faith. This is the portion of truth involved in the
   Romish doctrine of a formed and unformed faith. Faith (assent to the
   truth) connected with love is the fides formata; faith without love is
   fides informis. While, however, it is true that faith is often
   necessarily connected with feeling, and, therefore, in one sense of the
   term, is a voluntary assent, yet this is not always the csse. Whether
   feeling attends and enters into the exercise of faith, depends upon its
   object (or the thing believed) and the evidence on which it is founded.
   When the object of faith is speculative truth, or some historical event
   past or future; or when the evidence or testimony on which faith is
   founded is addressed only to the understanding and not to the
   conscience or to our emotional or religious nature, then faith does not
   involve feeling. We believe the great mass of historical facts to which
   we assent as true, simply on historical testimony, and without any
   feeling entering into, or necessarily connected with it. The same is
   true with regard to a large part of the contents of the Bible. They, to
   a great extent, are historical, or the predictions of historical
   events. When we believe what the Scriptures record concerning the
   creation, the deluge, the calling of Abraham, the overthrow of the
   cities of the plain, the history of Joseph, and the like, our faith
   does not include feeling. It is not an exercise of the will in either
   sense of that word. It is simply a rational conviction founded on
   sufficient evidence. It may be said, as Aquinas does say, that it is
   love or reverence towards God which inclines the will to believe such
   facts on the authority of his Word. But wicked men believe them, and
   cannot help believing them. A man can hardly be found who does not
   believe that the Israelites dwelt in Egypt, escaped from bondage, and
   took possession of the land of Canaan.

   In the second place, it is true not only that faith is in many cases
   inseparable from feeling, but also that feeling has much influence in
   determining our faith. This is especially true when moral and religious
   truths are the objects of faith. Want of congeniality with the truth
   produces insensibility to the evidence by which it is supported. Our
   Lord said to the Jews, "Ye believe not, because ye are not of my
   sheep." (John x. 26.) And in another place, "If any man will do his
   will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God." (vii. 17.)
   And the Apostle says of those that are lost, "The god of this world
   hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the
   glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
   them." (2 Cor. iv. 4.) The truth was present, attended by appropriate
   and abundant evidence, but there was no susceptibility. The defect was
   in the organ of vision, not in the want of light. The Scriptures
   uniformly refer the unbelief of those who reject the gospel to the
   state of their hearts. There can be no doubt that all the true children
   of God received Christ as their God and Saviour on the evidence which
   He gave of him divine character and mission, and that He was rejected
   only by the unrenewed and the wicked, and because of their wickedness.
   Hence unbelief is so great a sin. Men are condemned because they
   believe not on the only begotten Son of God. (John iii. 18.) All this
   is true. It is true of saving faith. But it is not true of all kinds of
   even religious faith; that is, of faith which has religious truth for
   its object. And, therefore, it cannot furnish the differentia or
   criterion to distinguish faith from other forms of assent to truth.
   There are states of mind not only popularly, but correctly called
   belief, of which it is not true that love, or congeniality, is an
   element. There is such a thing as dead faith, or orthodoxy. There is
   such a thing as speculative faith. Simon Magus believed. Even the
   devils believe. And if we turn to other than religious truths it is
   still more apparent that faith is not necessarily a voluntary assent of
   the mind. A man may hear of something most repugnant to his feelings,
   as, for example, of the triumph of a rival. He may at first refuse to
   believe it; but the testimony may become so strong as to force
   conviction. This conviction is, by common consent, faith or belief. It
   is not sight; it is not intuition; it is not a deduction; it is belief;
   a conviction founded on testimony. This subject, i.e., the connection
   between faith and feeling, will come up again in considering other
   definitions.

   In the third place, if we take the word voluntary in the sense which
   implies volition or self-determination, it is still more evident that
   faith cannot be defined as voluntary assent. It is, indeed, a proverb
   that a man convinced, against his will remains unconvinced. But this is
   only a popular way of expressing the truth just conceded, namely, that
   the feelings have, in many cases, great influence in determining our
   faith. But, as just remarked, a man may be constrained to believe
   against his will. He may struggle against conviction; he may determine
   he will not believe, and yet conviction may be forced upon him.
   Napoleon, at the battle of Waterloo, hears that Grouchy is approaching.
   He gladly believes it. Soon the report reaches him that the advancing
   columns are Prussians. This he will not believe. Soon, however, as
   courier after courier confirms the unwelcome fact, he is forced to
   believe it. It is not true, therefore, that in faith as faith there is
   always, as Aquinas says, an election "voluntarie declinans in unam
   partem magis quam in alteram." There is another frequent experience. We
   often hear men say they would give the world if they could believe. The
   dying Grotius said he would give all his learning for the simple faith
   of his unlettered servant. To tell a man he can believe if he will is
   to contradict his consciousness. He tries to believe. He earnestly
   prays for faith; but he cannot exercise it. It is true, as concerns the
   sinner in relation to the gospel, that this inability to believe arises
   from the state of his mind. But this state of the mind lies below the
   will. It cannot be determined or changed by the exercise of any
   voluntary power. On these grounds the definition of faith, whether as
   generic or religious, as a voluntary assent to truth, must be
   considered unsatisfactory.

   Definitions founded on the Object of Faith.

   The preceding definitions are all founded on the assumed subjective
   nature of faith. The next definition is of a different kind. It is
   founded on the nature of its object. Faith is said to be the persuasion
   of the truth of things not seen. This is a very old and familiar
   definition. "Quid est fides," asks Augustine, [82] "nisi credere quod
   non vides." And Lombard [83] says, "Fides est virtus qua creduntur quæ
   non videntur." Hence faith is said to be swallowed up in vision; and
   the one is contrasted with the other; as when the Apostle says, "We
   walk by faith, not by sight." And in Hebrews, eleventh chapter, all the
   objects of faith under the aspect in which it is considered in that
   chapter, are included under the categories of ta elpizomena and ta ou
   blepomena, "things hoped for, and things not seen." The latter includes
   the former. "We hope," says the Apostle, "for that we see not." (Romans
   viii. 25.) The word sight, in this connection, may be taken in three
   senses. First, in its literal sense. We are not said to believe what we
   see with our eyes. What we see we know to be true. We believe that the
   planet Saturn is surrounded by a belt, and that Jupiter has four
   satellites, on the unanimous testimony of astronomers. But if we look
   through a telescope and see the belt of the one and the satellites of
   the other, our faith passes into knowledge. We believe there is such a
   city as Rome, and that it contains the Colosseum, Trajan's Arch, and
   other monuments of antiquity. If we visit that city and see these
   things for ourselves, our faith becomes knowledge. The conviction is no
   stronger in the one case than in the other. We are just as sure there
   is such a city before having seen it, as though we had been there a
   hundred times. But the conviction is of a different kind. Secondly, the
   mind is said to see when it perceives an object of thought to be true
   in its own light, or by its own radiance. This mental vision may be
   either immediate or mediate -- either intuitive or through a process of
   proof. A child may believe that the angles of a triangle are together
   equal to two right angles, on the authority of his teacher. When he
   understands the demonstration of that proposition, his faith becomes
   knowledge. He sees it to be true. The objects of sense-perception, the
   objects of intuition, and what we recognize as true on a process of
   proof, are not, according to this definition of the term, objects of
   faith. We know what we see to be true; we believe when we recognize as
   true what we do not see. It is true that the same thing may be an
   object of faith and an object of knowledge, but not at the same time.
   We may recognize as true the being of God, or the immortality of the
   soul, because the propositions, "God is," "the soul is immortal," are
   susceptible of proof. The arguments in support of those propositions
   may completely satisfy our minds. But they are truths of revelation to
   be believed on the authority of God. These states of mind which we call
   knowledge and faith, are not identical, neither are they strictly
   coexisting. The effect produced by the demonstration is one thing. The
   effect produced by the testimony of God's word, is another thing. Both
   include a persuasion of the truth. But that persuasion is in its nature
   different in the one case from what it is in the other, as it rests on
   different grounds. When the arguments are before the mind, the
   conviction which they produce is knowledge. When the testimony of God
   is before the mind, the conviction which it produces is faith. On this
   subject Thomas Aquinas says, [84] "Necessarium est homini accipere per
   modum fidei non solum ea, quæ sunt supra rationem: sed etiam ea, quæ
   per rationem cognosci possunt. Et hoc propter tria, Primo quidem, ut
   citius homo ad veritatis divinæ cognitionem perveniat. . . . . Secundo,
   ut cognitio Dei sit communior. Multi enim in studio scientiæ proficere
   non possunt. . . . . Tertio modo proptor certitudinem. Ratio enim
   humana in rebus divinis est multum deficiens."

   Thirdly, under the "things not seen," some would include all things not
   present to the mind. A distinction is made between presentative and
   representative knowledge. In the former the object is present at the
   time; we perceive it, we are conscious of it. In representative
   knowledge there is an object now present, representing an absent
   object. Thus we have the conception of a person or thing. That
   conception is present, but the thing represented is absent. It is not
   before the mind. It belongs to the category of things not seen. The
   conception which is present is the object of knowledge; the thing
   represented is an object of faith. That is, we know we have the
   conception; we believe that the thing which it represents, does or did
   exist. If we visit a particular place while present to our senses we
   know that it exists; when we come away and form an idea or conception
   of it, that is, when we recall it by an effort of memory, then we
   believe in its existence. "Whenever we have passed beyond presentative
   knowledge, and are assured of the reality of an absent object, there
   faith . . . . has entered as an element." [85]

   Sir William Hamilton [86] says, "Properly speaking, we know only the
   actual and the present, and all real knowledge is an immediate
   knowledge. What is said to be mediately known, is, in truth, not known
   to be, but only believed to be." This, it may be remarked in passing,
   would apply to all the propositions of Euclid. For they are "mediately
   known," i.e., seen to be true by means of a process of proof. Speaking
   of memory, Hamilton says, "It is not a knowledge of the past at all;
   but a knowledge of the present and a belief of the past." "We are
   said," according to Dr. McCosh, "to know ourselves, and the objects
   presented to the senses and the representations (always however as
   presentations) in the mind; but to believe in objects which we have
   seen in time past, but which are not now present, and in objects which
   we have never seen, and very specially in objects which we can never
   fully know, such as an Infinite God." [87]

   Objections to this Definition.

   According to this view, we know what is present to the mind, and
   believe what is absent. The first objection to this representation is
   the ambiguity of the words present and absent as thus used. When is an
   object present? and when is it absent? It is easy to answer this
   question when the object is something material or an external event.
   Such objects are present ("præsensibus") when they affect the senses;
   and absent when they do not. A city or building is present when we
   actually see it; absent, when we leave the place where it is, and
   recall the image of it. But how is it with propositions? The Bible says
   all men are sinners. The truth thus announced is present to the mind.
   We do not know it. We cannot prove it. But we believe it upon the
   authority of God. The Scriptures teach that Christ died as a ransom for
   many. Here, not only the historical fact that He died is announced, but
   the purpose for which He died. Here again, we have a truth present to
   the mind, which is an object of faith.

   The second objection is involved in the first. The terms present and
   absent are not only ambiguous in this connection, but it is not true,
   as just stated, that an object must be absent in order to be an object
   of faith. The differentia, in other words, between knowledge and faith,
   is not found in the presence or absence of their objects. We can know
   what is absent, and we can believe what is present.

   The third objection is, that the conviction we have of the reality or
   truth of what we distinctly remember is knowledge, and not
   distinctively faith, unless we choose to establish a new and arbitrary
   definition of the word knowledge. We know what is perceived by the
   senses; we know what the mind sees, either intuitively or discursively,
   is and must be true; and we know what we distinctly remember. The
   conviction is in all these cases of the same nature. In all it resolves
   itself into confidence in the veracity of consciousness. We are
   conscious that we perceive sensible objects. We are conscious that we
   cognize certain truths. We are conscious that we remember certain
   events. In all these cases this consciousness involves the conviction
   of the reality or truth of what is seen, mentally apprehended or
   remembered. This conviction is, or may be, as strong in any one of
   these cases as in either of the others; and it rests in all ultimately
   on the same ground. There is, therefore, no reason for calling one
   knowledge and the other belief. Memory is as much a knowledge of the
   past, as other forms of consciousness are a knowledge of the present.

   The fourth objection is that to deny that memory gives us the knowledge
   of the past, is contrary to established usage. It is true we are said
   to believe that we remember such and such events, when we are uncertain
   about it. But this is because in one of the established meanings of the
   word, belief expresses a less degree of certainty than knowledge. But
   men never speak of believing past events in their experience concerning
   which they are absolutely certain. We know that we were alive
   yesterday. No man says he believes he has seen his father or mother or
   any intimate friend, whom he had known for years. Things distinctly
   remembered are known, and not merely believed.

   The definition which makes faith to be the persuasion of the truth of
   things not seen, is, however, correct, if by "things not seen" are
   meant things which are neither objects of the senses, nor of intuition,
   nor of demonstrative proof. But it does not seem to be correct to
   include among the "things not seen," which are the special objects of
   faith, things remembered and not now present to mind. This definition
   of faith, while correct in limiting it as to its objects to things not
   seen, in the sense above stated, is nevertheless defective in not
   assigning the ground of our conviction of their truth. Why do we
   believe things to be true, which we have never seen and which we cannot
   prove? Different answers are given to that question; and, therefore,
   the definition which gives no answer to it, must be considered
   defective.

   Definitions founded on the Nature of the Evidence on which Faith rests.

   Some of the definitions of faith, as we have seen, are founded on its
   subjective nature; others on its objects. Besides these there are
   others which seek its distinguishing characteristic in the ground on
   which the conviction which it includes, rests. The first of these is
   that which makes faith to be a conviction or persuasion of truth
   founded on feeling. This is by many regarded as the one most generally
   received. Hase [88] says, "Every cultivated language has a word for
   that form of conviction which, in opposition to the self-evident and
   demonstrable, rests on moral and emotional grounds." That word in Greek
   is pistis; in English "faith." In his "Hutterus Redivivus," [89] he
   says, "The common idea of faith is: unmittelbar Fürwahrhalten, ohne
   Vermittelung eines Schlussbeweises, durch Neigung und Bedürfniss,"
   i.e., "A persuasion of the truth, without the intervention of argument,
   determined by inclination and inward necessity." He quotes the
   definition of faith by Twesten, as "a persuasion or conviction of truth
   produced by feeling;" and that of Nitzsch, given above, "the unity of
   knowledge and feeling." Strauss [90] says, "The way in which a man
   appropriates the contents of a revelation, the inward ascent which he
   yields to the contents of the Scriptures and the doctrine of the
   Church, not because of critical or philosophical research, but often in
   opposition to them overpowered by a feeling which the Evangelical
   Church calls the testimony of the Spirit, but which in fact is only the
   perception of the identity of his own religious life with that
   portrayed in the Scripture and prevailing in the Church, -- this assent
   determined by feeling -- in ecclesiastical language, is called Faith."
   Again, [91] he says, "The pious man receives religious truth because he
   feels its reality, and because it satisfies his religious wants," and,
   therefore, he adds, "No religion was ever propagated by means of
   arguments addressed to the understanding, or of historical or
   philosophical proofs, and this is undeniably true of Christianity."
   Every preacher of a new religion assumes in those to whom he presents
   it, an unsatisfied religious necessity, and all he has to do is to make
   them feel that such necessity is met by the religion which he proposes.
   Celsus, he tells us, made it a ground of reproach against the
   Christians that they believed blindly, that they could not justify the
   doctrines which they held at the bar of reason. To this Origen
   answered, that this was true only of the people; that with the
   educated, faith was elevated into knowledge, and Christianity
   transformed into a philosophy. The Church was divided between believers
   and knowers. The relation between faith and knowledge, between religion
   and philosophy, has been the subject of controversy from that day to
   this. Some took the ground of Origen and of the Alexandrian school
   generally, that it is incumbent on educated Christians to justify their
   doctrines at the bar of reason, and prove them to be true of
   philosophical grounds. Others held that the truths of revelation were,
   at least in many cases, of a kind which did not admit of philosophical
   demonstration, although they were not on that account to be regarded as
   contrary to reason, but only as beyond its sphere. Others, again,
   taught that there is a direct conflict between faith and knowledge;
   that what the believing Christian holds to be true, can be shown by the
   philosopher to be false. This is Strauss's own doctrine, and,
   therefore, he concludes his long discussion of this point by saying,
   "The believer should let the knower go his own way in peace, just as
   the knower does the believer. We leave them their faith, let them leave
   us our philosophy. . . . . There have been enough of false irenical
   attempts. Henceforth only separation of opposing principles can lead to
   any good." [92] On the same page he admits the great truth, "That human
   nature has one excellent characteristic: what any man feels is for him
   a spiritual necessity, he allows no man to take from him."

   Remarks on this Definition.

   With regard to the definition of faith which makes it a conviction
   founded on feeling, it may be remarked, --

   First, That there are forms of faith of which this is not true. As
   remarked above, when treating of the cognate definition of faith as a
   voluntary assent of the mind, it is not true of faith in general. We
   often believe unwillingly, and what is utterly repugnant to our
   feelings.

   Secondly, It is not true even of religious faith, or faith which has
   religious truth for its object. For there may be faith without love,
   i.e., a speculative, or dead faith.

   Thirdly, It is not true of many of the exercises of faith in good men.
   Isaac believed that Jacob would be preferred to Esau, sorely against
   his will. Jacob believed that his descendants would be slaves in Egypt.
   The prophets believed in the seventy years captivity of their
   countrymen. The Apostles believed that a great apostasy in the Church
   was to occur between their age and the second coming of the Lord. The
   answer of Thomas Aquinas to this, is, that a man is constrained by his
   will (i.e., his feelings) to believe in the Scriptures, and then he
   believes all the Scriptures contain. So that his faith, even in the
   class of truths just referred to, rests ultimately on feeling. But this
   answer is unsatisfactory. For if the question is asked, Why did the
   prophets believe in the captivity, and the Apostles in the apostasy?
   the answer would be, not from the effect of these truths upon their
   feelings, but on the authority of God. And if it be further asked, Why
   did they believe the testimony of God? the answer may be because God's
   testimony carries conviction. He can make his voice heard even by the
   deaf or the dead. Or, the answer may be, because they were good men.
   But in either case, the question carries us beyond the ground of their
   faith. They believe because God had revealed the facts referred to.
   Their goodness may have rendered them susceptible to the evidence
   afforded, but it did not constitute that evidence.

   Fourthly, It is admitted that the exercise of saving faith, i.e., of
   that faith which is the fruit of the Spirit and product of
   regeneration, is attended by feeling appropriate to its object. But
   this is to be referred to the nature of the object. If we believe a
   good report, the effect is joy; if an evil report, the effect is
   sorrow. The perception of beauty produces delight; of moral excellence,
   a glow of approbation, of spiritual things, in many cases. a joy that
   is unspeakable and full of glory.

   Fifthly, It is also true that all these truths, if not all truth, have
   a sell-evidencing light, which cannot be apprehended without a
   conviction that it really is what it is apprehended as being. It may
   also be admitted, that so far as the consciousness of true believers is
   concerned, the evidence of truth is the truth itself; in other words,
   that the ground of their faith is, in one sense, subjective. They see
   the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, and therefore believe
   that He is God manifested in the flesh. They see that the
   representations made by the Scriptures of the sinfulness, guilt, and
   helplessness of fallen man, correspond with their own inward
   experience, and they are therefore constrained to receive these
   representations as true. They see that the plan of salvation proposed
   in the Bible suits their necessities, their moral judgments and
   religious aspirations, they therefore embrace it. All this is true, but
   it does not prove faith to be a conviction founded on feeling; for
   there are many forms of faith which confessedly are not founded on
   feeling; and even in the case of true believers, their feelings are not
   the ultimate ground of faith. They always fall back on the authority of
   God, who is regarded as the author of these feelings, through which the
   testimony of the Spirit is revealed to the consciousness. "We may be
   moved and induced," says the "Westminster Confession," [93] "by the
   testimony of the Church to an high and reverend esteem of the Holy
   Scripture; and the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the
   doctrine, the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the
   scope of the whole (which is to give all glory to God), the full
   discovery it makes of the only way of man's salvation, the many other
   incomparable excellences, and the entire perfection thereof, are
   arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence itself to be the word of
   God; yet, notwithstanding, our full persuasion and assurance of the
   infallible truth and divine authority thereof is from the inward work
   of the Holy Spirit, bearing witness by and with the word in our
   hearts." The ultimate ground of faith, therefore, is the witness of the
   Spirit.

   Faith a Conviction of the Truth founded on Testimony.

   The only other definition of faith to be considered, is that which
   makes it, a conviction of truth founded on testimony. We have already
   seen that Augustine says, "We know what rests upon reason; we believe
   what rests upon authority." A definition to which Sir William Hamilton
   gives his adhesion. [94] In the Alexandrian School also, the Christian
   pistis, was Auctoritäts-Glaube, a faith founded on authority, opposed,
   on the one hand, to the heathen episteme, and on the other to the
   Christian gnosis, or philosophical explanation and proof of the truths
   believed. Among the school-men also, this was the prevalent idea. When
   they defined faith to be the persuasion of things not seen, they meant
   things which we receive as true on authority, and not because we either
   know or can prove them. Hence it was constantly said, faith is human
   when it rests on the testimony of men; divine when it rests on the
   testimony of God. Thomas Aquinas [95] says, "Non fides, de qua
   loquimur, assentit alicui, nisi quia est a Deo revelatum." "Faith, of
   which we speak, assents to nothing except because it is revealed by
   God." We believe on the authority of God, and not because we see, know,
   or feel a thing to be true. This is the purport of the teaching of the
   great body of the scholastic divines. Such also was the doctrine of the
   Reformers, and of the theologians of the subsequent age, both Lutheran
   and Reformed. Speaking of assent, which he regards as the second act or
   element of faith, Aquinas says, "Hic actus fidei non rerum evidentia
   aut causarum et proprietatum notitia, sed Dei dicentis infallibili
   auctoritate." Turrettin [96] says, "Non quæritur, An fides sit
   scientia, quæ habeat evidentiam: Sic enim distinguitur a scientia, quæ
   habet assensum certum et evidentem, qui nititur ratione clara et certa,
   et ab opinione, quæ nititur ratione tantum probabili; ubi fides notat
   assensum certum quidem, sed inevidentem, qui non ratione, sed
   testimonio divino nititur." De Moor [97] says, "Fides subjectiva est
   persuasio de veritate rei, alterius testimonio nixa, quomodo fides illa
   generatim descripta, scientiæ et conjecturæ opponitur. . . . .
   Dividitur . . . . in fidem divinam, quæ nititur testimonio divino, et
   humanam, quæ fundata est in testimonio humano fide accepto." Owen, [98]
   "All faith is an assent upon testimony; and divine faith is an assent
   upon a divine testimony." John Howe [99] asks, "Why do I believe Jesus
   to be the Christ? Because the eternal God hath given his testimony
   concerning Him that so He is." "A man's believing comes all to nothing
   without this, that there is a divine testimony." Again, [100] "I
   believe such a thing, as God reveals it, because it is reported to me
   upon the authority of God." Bishop Pearson [101] says, "When anything
   propounded to us is neither apparent to our sense, nor evident to our
   understanding, in and of itself, neither certainly to be collected from
   any clear and necessary connection with the cause from which it
   proceedeth, or the effects which it naturally produceth, nor is taken
   up upon any real arguments or reference to other acknowledged truths,
   and yet notwithstanding appeareth to us true, not by a manifestation,
   but attestation of the truth, and so moveth us to assent not of itself,
   but by virtue of the testimony given to it; this is said properly to be
   credible; and an assent unto this, upon such credibility, is in the
   proper notion faith or belief."

   This View almost universally Held.

   This view of the nature of faith is all but universally received, not
   by theologians only, but by philosophers, and the mass of Christian
   people. The great question has ever been, whether we are to receive
   truth on authority, or only upon rational evidence. Leibnitz begins his
   "Discours de la Conformité de la Foi avec la Raison," by saying, "Je
   suppose, que deux vérités ne sauroient se contredire; que l'objet de la
   foi est la vérité que Dieu a révélée d'une manière extraordinaire, et
   que la raison est l'enchainment des vérités, mais particulièrement
   (lorsqu'elle est comparés avec la foi) de celles où l'esprit humain
   peut atteindre naturellement, sans être aidé des lumières de la foi."
   [102]

   It has already been admitted that the essential element of faith is
   trust; and, therefore, in the general sense of the word to believe, is
   to trust. Faith is the reliance of the mind on anything as true and
   worthy of confidence. In this wide sense of the word, it matters not
   what may be the objects, or what the grounds of this trust. The word,
   however, is commonly used in reference to truths which we receive on
   trust without being able to prove them. Thus we are said to believe in
   our own existence, the reality of the external world, and all the
   primary truths of the reason. These by common consent are called
   beliefs. Reason begins with believing, i.e., with taking on trust what
   it neither comprehends nor proves. Again, it has been admitted that the
   word belief is often and legitimately used to express a degree of
   certainty less than knowledge and stronger than probability; as when we
   say, we are not sure, but we believe that a certain thing happened.

   The Strict Sense of the Word "Faith."

   But in the strict and special sense of the word, as discriminated from
   knowledge or opinion, faith means the belief of things not seen, on the
   ground of testimony. By testimony, however, is not meant merely the
   affirmation of an intelligent witness. There are other methods by which
   testimony may be given than affirmation. A seal is a form of testimony;
   so is a sign. So is everything which pledges the authority of the
   attester to the truth to be established. When Elijah declared that
   Jehovah was God, and Baal a lie, he said, "The God that answereth by
   fire, let him be God." The descent of the fire was the testimony of God
   to the truth of the prophet's declaration. So in the New Testament God
   is said to have borne witness to the truth of the Gospel by signs, and
   wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost (Heb. ii. 4);
   and the Spirit of God is said to witness with our spirits that we are
   the children of God (Rom. viii. 16). The word in these cases is
   marture, w, to testify. This is not a lax or improper use of the word
   testimony; for an affirmation is testimony only because it pledges the
   authority of him who makes it to the truth. And therefore whatever
   pledges that authority, is as truly of the nature of testimony, as an
   affirmation. When, therefore, it is said that faith is founded on
   testimony, it is meant that it is not founded on sense, reason, or
   feeling, but on the authority of him by whom it is authenticated.

   Proof from the General Use of the Word.

   That such is the foundation and the distinctive characteristic of
   faith, may be argued, -- 1. From the general use of the word We are
   said to know what we see or can prove; and to believe what we regard as
   true on the authority of others. This is admitted to be true of what is
   called historical faith. This includes a great deal; all that is
   recorded of the past; all that is true of present actualities, which
   does not fall within the sphere of our personal observation; all the
   facts of science as received by the masses; and almost all the contents
   of the Bible, whether of the Old or of the New Testament. The
   Scriptures are a record of the history of the creation, of the fall,
   and of redemption. The Old Testament is the history of the preparatory
   steps of this redemption. The New Testament is a history of the
   fulfilment of the promises and types of the Old in the incarnation,
   life, sufferings, death, and resurrection of the Son of God. Whoever
   believes this record has set to his seal that God is true, and is a
   child of God.

   Proof from Consciousness.

   2. In the second place, consciousness teaches us that such is the
   nature of faith not only when historical facts are its objects, but
   when propositions are the things believed. The two indeed are often
   inseparable. That God is the creator of the world, is both a fact and a
   doctrine. It is as the Apostle says, a matter of faith. We believe on
   the authority of the Scriptures, which declare that "In the beginning
   God created the heaven and the earth." That God set forth his Son to be
   a propitiation for our sins, is a doctrine. It rests solely on the
   authority of God. We receive it upon his testimony. So with all the
   great doctrines of grace; of regeneration, of justification, of
   sanctification, and of a future life. How do we know that God will
   accept all who believe in Christ? Who can know the things of God, save
   the Spirit of God, and he to whom the Spirit shall reveal them (1 Cor.
   ii. 10, 11)? From the nature of the case, "the things of the Spirit,"
   the thoughts and purposes of God, can be known only by revelation, and
   they can be received only on the authority of God. They are objects
   neither of sense nor of reason.

   Proof from Scripture.

   3. It is the uniform teaching of the Bible that faith is founded on the
   testimony or authority of God.

   The first proof of this is the fact that the Scriptures come to us
   under the form of a revelation of things we could not otherwise know.
   The prophets of the Old Testament were messengers, the mouth of God, to
   declare what the people were to believe and what they were to do. The
   New Testament is called "The testimony of Jesus." Christ came, not as a
   philosopher, but as a witness. He said to Nicodemus, "We speak that we
   do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our
   witness." (John iii. 11). "He that cometh from above is above
   all. . . . . And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and
   no man receiveth his testimony. He that hath received his testimony
   hath set to his seal that God is true (verses 31-33). In like manner
   the Apostles were witnesses. As such they were ordained (Luke xxiv.
   48). After his resurrection, and immediately before his ascension, our
   Lord said to them, "Ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost
   is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem,
   and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the
   earth. (Acts i. 8). When they declared the death and resurrection of
   Christ, as facts to be believed, they said, "Whereof we are witnesses"
   (Acts ii. 32, iii. 15, v. 32). In this last passage the Apostles say
   they were witnesses not only of the fact of Christ's resurrection but
   that God had "exalted" Him "with his right hand to be a prince and a
   saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins."
   See Acts x. 39-43, where it is said, "He commanded us to preach unto
   the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to
   be the judge of quick and dead. To him give all the prophets witness,
   that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive
   remission of sins."

   The great complaint against the Apostles, especially in the Grecian
   cities, was that they did not present their doctrines as propositions
   to be proved; they did not even state the philosophical grounds on
   which they rested, or attempt to sustain them at the bar of reason. The
   answer given to this objection by St. Paul is twofold: First, that
   philosophy, the wisdom of men, had proved itself utterly incompetent to
   solve the great problems of God and the universe, of sin and
   redemption. It was in fact neither more nor less than foolishness, so
   far as all its speculations as to the things of God were concerned.
   Secondly, that the doctrines which He taught were not the truths of
   reason, but matters of revelation; to be received not on rational or
   philosophical grounds, but upon the authority of God; that they, the
   Apostles, were not philosophers, but witnesses; that they did not argue
   using the words of man's wisdom, but that they simply declared the
   counsels of God, and that faith in their doctrines was to rest not on
   the wisdom of men, but on the powerful testimony of God.

   The second proof, that the Scriptures teach that faith is the reception
   of truth on the ground of testimony or on the authority of God, is,
   that the thing which we are commanded to do, is to receive the record
   which God has given of his Son. This is faith; receiving as true what
   God has testified, and because He has testified it. "He that believeth
   not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that
   God gave of his Son." The Greek here is, hou pepisteuken eis ten
   marturian hen memartureken ho Theos peri tou huiou hautou, "believeth
   not the testimony which God testified concerning his Son." "And this is
   the testimony, (he marturian) that God hath given to us eternal life,
   and this life ii in his Son" (1 John v. 10, 11). There could hardly be
   a more distinct statement of the Scriptural doctrine as to the nature
   of faith. Its object is what God has revealed. Its ground is the
   testimony of God. To receive that testimony, is to set to our seal that
   God is true. To reject it, is to make God a liar. "If we receive the
   witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness
   of God which he hath testified of his son."

   Such is the constant teaching of Scripture. The ground on which we are
   authorized and commanded to believe is, not the conformity of the truth
   revealed to our reason, nor its effect upon our feelings, nor its
   meeting the necessities of our nature and condition, but simply, "Thus
   saith the Lord." The truths of revelation do commend themselves to the
   reason; they do powerfully and rightfully affect our feelings; they do
   meet all the necessities of our nature as creatures and as sinners; and
   these considerations may incline us to believe, may strengthen our
   faith, lead us to cherish it, and render it joyful and effective; but
   they are not its ground. We believe on the testimony or authority of
   God.

   It is objected to this view that we believe the Bible to be the Word of
   God on other ground than testimony. The fulfilment of prophecies, the
   miracles of its authors, its contents, and the effects which it
   produces, are rational grounds for believing it to be from God. To this
   objection two answers may be made: First, that supernatural
   occurrences, such as prophecies and miracles, are some of the forms in
   which the divine testimony is given. Paul says that God bears "witness
   both with signs and wonders" (Hebrews ii. 4). And, secondly, that the
   proximate end of these manifestations of supernatural foresight and
   power was to authenticate the divine mission of the messengers of God.
   This being established, the people were called upon to receive their
   message and to believe on the authority of God, by whom they were sent.

   The third proof, that the Scriptures teach that faith is a reception of
   truth on the ground of testimony, is found in the examples and
   illustrations of faith given in the Scriptures. Immediately after the
   fall the promise was made to our first parents that the seed of the
   woman should bruise the serpent's head. On what possible ground could
   faith in this promise rest except on the authority of God. When Noah
   was warned of God of the coming deluge, and commanded to prepare the
   ark, he believed, not because he saw the signs of the approaching
   flood, not because his moral judgment assured him that a just God would
   in that way avenge his violated law; but simply on the testimony of
   God. Thus when God promised to Abraham the possession of the land of
   Canaan, that he, a childless old man, should become the father of many
   nations, that through his seed all the nations of the earth should be
   blessed, his faith could have no other foundation than the authority of
   God. So of every illustration of faith given by the Apostle in the
   eleventh chapter of his epistle to the Hebrews. The same is true of the
   whole Bible. We have no foundation for our faith in a spiritual world,
   in the heaven and hell described in Scripture, in the doctrines of
   redemption, in the security and ultimate triumph of the Church other
   than the testimony of God. If faith does not rest on testimony it has
   nothing on which to rest. Paul tells us that the whole Gospel rests on
   the fact of Christ's resurrection from the dead. If Christ be not risen
   our faith is vain, and we are yet in our sins. But our assurance that
   Christ rose on the third day rests solely upon the testimony which God
   in various ways has given to that fact.

   This is a point of great practical importance. If faith, or only
   persuasion of the truths of the Bible, rests on philosophical grounds,
   then the door is opened for rationalism; if it rests on feeling, then
   it is open to mysticism. The only sure, and the only satisfying
   foundation is the testimony of God, who cannot err, and who will not
   deceive.

   Faith may, therefore, be defined to be the persuasion of the truth
   founded on testimony. The faith of the Christian is the persuasion of
   the truth of the facts and doctrines recorded in the Scriptures on the
   testimony of God.

   § 3. Different Kinds of Faith.

   Though the definition above given be accepted, it is to be admitted
   that there are different kinds of faith. In other words, the state of
   mind which the word designates is very different in one case from what
   it is in others. This difference arises partly from the nature of its
   objects, and partly from the nature or form of the testimony on which
   it is founded. Faith in a historical fact or speculative truth is one
   thing; faith in æsthetic truth another thing; faith in moral truth
   another thing; faith in spiritual truth, and especially faith in the
   promise of salvation made to ourselves another thing. That is, the
   state of mind denominated faith is very different in any one of these
   cases from what it is in the others. Again, the testimony which God
   bears to the truth is of different kinds. In one form it is directed
   especially to the understanding; in another to the conscience; in
   another to our regenerated nature. This is the cause of the difference
   between speculative, temporary, and saving faith.

   Speculative or Dead Faith.

   There are many men who believe the Bible to be the Word of God; who
   receive all that it teaches; and who are perfectly orthodox in their
   doctrinal belief. If asked why they believe, they may be at a loss for
   an answer. Reflection might enable them to say they believe because
   others believe. They receive their faith by inheritance. They were
   taught from their earliest years thus to believe. The Church to which
   they belong inculcates this faith, and it is enjoined upon them as true
   and necessary. Others of greater culture may say that the evidence of
   the divine origin of the Bible, both external and internal, satisfies
   their minds, and produces a rational conviction that the Scriptures are
   a revelation from God, and they receive its contents on his authority.
   Such a faith as this, experience teaches, is perfectly compatible with
   a worldly or wicked life. This is what the Bible calls a dead faith.

   Temporary Faith.

   Again, nothing is more common than for the Gospel to produce a
   temporary impression, more or less deep and lasting. Those thus
   impressed believe. But, having no root in themselves, sooner or later
   they fall away. It is also a common experience that men utterly
   indifferent or even skeptical, in times of danger, or on the near
   approach of death, are deeply convinced of the certainty of those
   religious truths previously known, but hitherto disregarded or
   rejected. This temporary faith is due to common grace; that is, to
   those influences of the Spirit common in a measure greater or less to
   all men, which operate on the soul without renewing it, and which
   reveal the truth to the conscience and cause it to produce conviction.

   Saving Faith.

   That faith which secures eternal life; which unites us to Christ as
   living members of his body; which makes us the sons of God; which
   interests us in all the benefits of redemption; which works by love,
   and is fruitful in good works; is founded, not on the external or the
   moral evidence of the truth, but on the testimony of the Spirit with
   and by the truth to the renewed soul.

   What is meant by the Testimony of the Spirit

   It is necessary, before going further, to determine what is meant by
   the testimony of the Spirit, which is said to be the ground of saving
   faith.

   God, or the Spirit of God, testifies to the truth of the Scriptures and
   of the doctrines which they contain. This testimony, as has been seen,
   is partly external, consisting in prophecies and miracles, partly in
   the nature of the truths themselves as related to the intellectual and
   moral elements of the soul, and partly special and supernatural.
   Unrenewed men may feel the power of the two former kinds of testimony,
   and believe with a faith either merely intellectual and speculative, or
   with what may be called from its ground, a moral faith, which is only
   temporary. The spiritual form of testimony is confined to the
   regenerated. It is, of course, inscrutable. The operations of the
   Spirit do not reveal themselves in the consciousness otherwise than by
   their effects. We know that men are born of the Spirit, that the Spirit
   dwells in the people of God and continually influences their thoughts,
   feelings, and actions. But we know this only from the teaching of the
   Bible, not because we are conscious of his operations. "The wind
   bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst
   not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that
   is born of the Spirit." (John iii. 8.)

   This witness of the Spirit is not an affirmation that the Bible is the
   Word of God. Neither is it the production of a blind, unintelligent
   conviction of that fact. It is not, as is the case with human
   testimony, addressed from without to the mind, but it is within the
   mind itself. It is an influence designed to produce faith. It is called
   a witness or testimony because it is so called in Scripture; and
   because it has the essential nature of testimony, inasmuch as it is the
   pledge of the authority of God in support of the truth.

   The effects of this inward testimony are, (1.) What the Scriptures call
   "spiritual discernment." This means two things: A discernment due to
   the influence of the Spirit; and a discernment not only of the truth,
   but also of the holiness, excellence, and glory of the things
   discerned. The word spiritual, in this sense, means conformed to the
   nature of the Spirit. Hence the law is said to be spiritual, i.e.,
   holy, just, and good. (2.) A second effect flowing necessarily from the
   one just mentioned is delight and complacency, or love. (3.) The
   apprehension of the suitableness of the truths revealed, to our nature
   and necessities. (4.) The firm conviction that these things are not
   only true, but divine. (5.) The fruits of this conviction, i.e., of the
   faith thus produced, good works, -- holiness of heart and life.

   When, therefore, a Christian is asked, Why he believes the Scriptures
   and the doctrines therein contained, his simple answer is, On the
   testimony or authority of God. How else could he know that the worlds
   were created by God, that our race apostatized from God, that He sent
   his Son for our redemption, that faith in Him will secure salvation.
   Faith in such truths can have no other foundation than the testimony of
   God. If asked, How God testifies to the truth of the Bible? If an
   educated man whose attention has been called to the subject, he will
   answer, In every conceivable way: by signs, wonders, and miracles; by
   the exhibition which the Bible makes of divine knowledge, excellence,
   authority, and power. If an uneducated man, he may simply say, "Whereas
   I was blind, now I see." Such a man, and indeed every true Christian,
   passes from a state of unbelief to one of saving faith, not by any
   process of research or argument, but of inward experience. The change
   may, and often does, take place in a moment. The faith of a Christian
   in the Bible is, as before remarked, analogous to that which all men
   have in the moral law, which they recognize not only as truth, but as
   having the authority of God. What the natural man perceives with regard
   to the moral law the renewed man is enabled to perceive in regard to
   "the things of the Spirit," by the testimony of that Spirit with and by
   the truth to his heart.

   Proof from Express Declarations of Scripture.

   1. That this is the Scriptural doctrine on the subject is plain from
   the express declarations of the Scriptures. Our Lord promised to send
   the Spirit for this very purpose. "He will reprove the world of sin,"
   especially of the sin of not believing in Christ; "and of
   righteousness," that is, of his righteousness, -- the rightfulness of
   his claims to be regarded and received as the Son of God, God manifest
   in the flesh, and the Saviour of the world, "and of judgment," that is,
   of the final overthrow of the kingdom of darkness and triumph of the
   kingdom of light. (John xvi. 8.) Faith, therefore, is always
   represented in Scripture as one of the fruits of the Spirit, as the
   gift of God, as the product of his energy (pistis tes energeias tou
   Theou) (Colossians ii. 12). Men are said to believe in virtue of the
   same power which wrought in Christ, when God raised Him from the dead.
   (Eph i. 19, 20.) The Apostle Paul elaborately sets forth the ground of
   faith in the second chapter of First Corinthians. He declares that he
   relied for success not on the enticing words of man's wisdom, but on
   the demonstration of the Spirit, in order that the faith of the people
   might rest not on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God. Faith was
   not to rest on argument, on historical or philosophical proof, but on
   the testimony of the Spirit. The Spirit demonstrates the truth to the
   mind, i.e., produces the conviction that it is truth, and leads the
   soul to embrace it with assurance and delight. Passages have already
   been quoted which teach that faith rests on the testimony of God, and
   that unbelief consists in rejecting that testimony. The testimony of
   God is given through the Spirit, whose office it is to take of the
   things of Christ and show them unto us. The Apostle John tells his
   readers, "Ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all
   things. . . . . The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in
   you: and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing
   teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it
   hath taught you, ye shall abide in him." (1 John ii. 20, 27.) This
   passage teaches, (1.) That true believers receive from Christ (the Holy
   One) an unction. (2.) That this unction is the Holy Ghost. (3.) That it
   secures the knowledge and conviction of the truth. (4.) That this
   inward teaching which makes them believers is abiding, and secures them
   from apostasy.

   1 Corinthians ii. 14.

   Equally explicit is the passage in 1 Corinthians ii. 14, "The natural
   man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are
   foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are
   spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet
   he himself is judged of no man." The things of the Spirit, are the
   things which the Spirit has revealed. Concerning these things, it is
   taught: (1.) that the natural or unrenewed man does not receive them.
   (2.) That the spiritual man, i.e., the man in whom the Spirit dwells,
   does receive them. (3.) That the reason of this difference is that the
   former has not, and that the latter has, spiritual discernment. (4.)
   This spiritual discernment is the apprehension of the truth and
   excellence of the things discerned. (5.) It is spiritual, as just
   stated, both because due to the operation of the Spirit, and because
   the conformity of the truths discerned to the nature of the Spirit, is
   apprehended.

   When Peter confessed that Jesus was the Christ the Son of the living
   God, our Lord said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and
   blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in
   heaven." (Matt. xvi. 17.) Other men had the same external evidence of
   the divinity of Christ that Peter had. His faith was due not to that
   evidence alone, but to the inward testimony of God. Our Lord rendered
   thanks that God had hidden the mysteries of his kingdom from the wise
   and prudent and revealed them unto babes. (Matt. xi. 25.) The external
   revelation was made to both classes. Besides this external revelation,
   those called babes received an inward testimony which made them
   believers. Hence our Lord said, No man can come unto me except he be
   drawn or taught of God. (John vi. 44, 45.) The Apostle tells us that
   the same Gospel, the same objective truths, with the same external and
   rational evidence, which was an offence to the Jew and foolishness to
   the Greek, was to the called the wisdom and the power of God. Why this
   difference? Not the superior knowledge or greater excellence of the
   called, but the inward divine influence, the klesis, of which they were
   the subjects. Paul's instantaneous conversion is not to be referred to
   any rational process of argument; nor to his moral suceptibility to the
   truth; nor to the visible manifestation of Christ, for no miracle, no
   outward light or splendour could change the heart and transform the
   whole character in a moment. It was, as the Apostle himself tells us
   (Gal. i. 15, 16), the inward revelation of Christ to him by the special
   grace of God. It was the testimony of the Spirit, which being inward
   and supernatural, enabled him to see the glory of God in the face of
   Jesus Christ. The Psalmist prayed that God would open his eyes that he
   might see wondrous things out of his law. The Apostle prayed for the
   Ephesians that God would give them the Holy Spirit, that the eyes of
   their souls might be opened, that they might know the things freely
   given to them of God. (Eph. i. 17, 18.) Everywhere in the Bible the
   fact that any one believes is referred not to his subjective state, but
   to the work of the Spirit on his heart.

   Proof from the Way the Apostles acted.

   2. As the Scriptures thus expressly teach that the ground of true or
   saving faith is the inward witness of the Spirit, the Apostles always
   acted on that principle. They announced the truth and demanded its
   instant reception, under the pain of eternal death. Our Lord did the
   same. "He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
   believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." (John iii. 18.)
   Immediate faith was demanded. Being demanded by Christ, and at his
   command by the Apostles, that demand must be just and reasonable. It
   could, however, be neither unless the evidence of the truth attended
   it. That evidence could not be the external proofs of the divinity of
   Christ and his Gospel, for those proofs were present to the minds of
   comparatively few of the hearers of the Gospel; nor could it be
   rational proof or philosophical arguments, for still fewer could
   appreciate such evidence, and if they could it would avail nothing to
   the production of saving faith. The evidence of truth, to which assent
   is demanded by God the moment it is announced, must be in the truth
   itself. And if this assent be obligatory, and dissent or unbelief a
   sin, then the evidence must be of a nature, to which a corrupt state of
   the soul renders a man insensible. "If our gospel be hid," says the
   Apostle, "it is hid to them that are lost: in whom the God of this
   world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light
   of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine
   unto them. . . . . [But] God, who commanded the light to shine out of
   darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge
   of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." (2 Cor. iv. 3-6.) It
   is here taught, (1.) That wherever and whenever Christ is preached, the
   evidence of his divinity is presented. The glory of God shines in his
   face. (2.) That if any man fails to see it, it is because the God of
   this world hath blinded his eyes. (3.) That if any do perceive it and
   believe, it is because of an inward illumination produced by Him who
   first commanded the light to shine out of darkness.

   Proof from the Practice in the Church.

   3. As Christ and the Apostles acted on this principle, so have all
   faithful ministers and missionaries from that day to this. They do not
   expect to convince and convert men by historical evidence or by
   philosophical arguments. They depend on the demonstration of the
   Spirit.

   Proof from Analogy.

   4. This doctrine, that the true and immediate ground of faith in the
   things of the Spirit is the testimony of the Spirit, producing
   spiritual discernment, is sustained by analogy. If a man cannot see the
   splendour of the sun, it is because he is blind. If he cannot perceive
   the beauties of nature and of art, it is because he has no taste. If he
   cannot apprehend "the concord of sweet sounds," it is because he has
   not a musical ear. If he cannot see the beauty of virtue, or the divine
   authority of the moral law, it is because his moral sense is blunted.
   If he cannot see the glory of God in his works and in his Word, it is
   because his religious nature is perverted. And in like manner, if he
   cannot see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, it is because
   the god of this world has blinded his eyes.

   No one excuses the man who can see no excellence in virtue, and who
   repudiates the authority of the moral law. The Bible and the
   instinctive judgment of men, condemn the atheist. In like manner the
   Scriptures pronounce accursed all who do not believe that Jesus is the
   Christ the Son of the living God. This is the denial of supreme
   excellence; the rejection of the clearest manifestation of God ever
   made to man. The solemn judgment of God is, "If any man love not the
   Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema maranatha." (1 Cor. xvi. 22.) In
   this judgment the whole intelligent universe will ultimately acquiesce.

   Faith in the Scriptures, therefore, is founded on the testimony of God.
   By testimony, as before stated, is meant attestation, anything which
   pledges the authority of the attester in support of the truth to be
   established. As this testimony is of different kinds, so the faith
   which it produces, is also different. So far as the testimony is merely
   external, the faith it produces is simply historical or speculative. So
   far as the testimony is moral, consisting in the power which the Spirit
   gives to the truth over the natural conscience, the faith is temporary,
   depending on the state of mind which is its proximate cause. Besides
   these, there is the inward testimony of the Spirit, which is of such a
   nature and of such power as to produce a perfect revoluticn in the
   soul, compared in Scripture to that effected by opening the eyes of the
   blind to the reality, the wonders, and glories of creation. There is,
   therefore, all the difference between a faith resting on this inward
   testimony of the Spirit, and mere speculative faith, that there is
   between the conviction a blind man has of the beauties of nature,
   before and after the opening of his eyes. As this testimony is
   informing, enabling the soul to see the truth and excellence of the
   "things of the Spirit," so far as the consciousness of the believer is
   concerned, his faith is a form of knowledge. He sees to be true, what
   the Spirit reveals and authenticates.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. Faith and Knowledge.

   The relation of faith to knowledge is a wide field. The discussions on
   the subject have been varied and endless. There is little probability
   that the points at issue will ever be settled to the satisfaction of
   all parties. The ground of faith is authority. The ground of knowledge
   is sense or reason. We are concerned here only with Christian faith,
   i.e., the faith which receives the Scriptures as the Word of God and
   all they teach as true on his authority.

   Is a Supernatural Revelation needed?

   The first question is, Whether there is any need of a supernatural
   revelation, whether human reason be not competent to discover and to
   authenticate all needful truth. This question has already been
   considered under the head of Rationalism, where it was shown, (1.) That
   every man's consciousness tells him that there are questions concerning
   God and his own origin and destiny, which his reason cannot answer.
   (2.) That he knows à priori, that the reason of no other man can
   satisfactorily answer them. (3.) That he knows from experience that
   they never have been answered by the wisdom of men, and (4.) That the
   Scriptures declare that the world by wisdom knows not God, that the
   wisdom of the world is foolishness in his estimation, and that God has
   therefore himself made known truths undiscoverable by reason, for the
   salvation of man.

   Must the Truths of Revelation be Demonstrable by Reason?

   A second question is, Whether truths, supernaturally revealed, must be
   able to authenticate themselves at the bar of reason before they can be
   rationally received; so that they are received, not on the ground of
   authority, but of rational proof. This also has been previously
   discussed. It has been shown that the assumption that God can reveal
   nothing which human reason cannot, when known, demonstrate to be true,
   assumes that human reason is the measure of all truth; that there is no
   intelligence in the universe higher than that of man; and that God
   cannot have purposes and plans, the grounds or reasons of which we are
   competent to discover and appreciate. It emancipates the from the
   authority of God, refusing to believe anything except the authority of
   reason. Why may we not believe on the testimony of God that there is a
   spiritual world, as well as believe that there is such a nation as the
   Chinese on the testimony of men? No man acts on the principle of
   believing only what he can understand and prove, in any other
   department. There are multitudes of truths which every sane man
   receives on trust, without being able either to prove or comprehend
   them. If we can believe only what we can prove at the bar of reason to
   be true, then the kingdom of heaven would be shut against all but the
   wise. There could be no Christian who was not also a philosopher. In
   point of fact no man acts on this principle. It is assumed in the pride
   of reason, or as an apology for rejecting unpalatable truths, but men
   believe in God, in sin, in freedom of the will, in responsibility,
   without the ability of comprehending or reconciling these truths with
   each other or with other facts of consciousness or experience.

   May not Revealed Truths be Philosophically vindicated?

   A third question is, Whether, admitting a supernatural revelation, and
   moreover admitting the obligation to receive on the authority of God
   the doctrines which revelation makes known, the revealed doctrines may
   not be philosophically vindicated, so as to commend them to the
   acceptance of those who deny revelation. May not the Scriptural
   doctrines concerning God, creation, providence, the trinity, the
   incarnation, sin, redemption, and the future state, be so stated and
   sustained philosophically. as to constrain acquiescence in them as
   truths of the reason. This was the ground taken in the early Church by
   the theologians of the Alexandrian School, who undertook to elevate the
   pistis of the people into a gnosis for the philosophers. Thus the
   sacred writers were made Platonists, and Christianity was transmuted
   into Platonism. A large part of the mental activity of the School-men,
   during the Middle Ages, was expended in the same way. They received the
   Bible as a supernatural revelation from God. They received the Church
   interpretation of its teachings. They admitted their obligation to
   believe its doctrines on the authority of God and of the Church.
   Nevertheless they held that all these doctrines could be
   philosophically proved. In later times Wolf undertook to demonstrate
   all the doctrines of Christianity on the principles of the Leibnitzian
   philosophy. In our own day this principle and these attempts have been
   carried further than ever. Systems of theology, constructed on the
   philosophy of Hegel, of Schelling, and of Schleiermacher, have almost
   superseded the old Biblical systems. If any man of ordinary culture and
   intelligence should take up a volume of what is called "Speculative
   Theology," (that is, theology presented in the forms of the speculative
   philosophy,) he would not understand a page and would hardly understand
   a sentence. He could not tell whether the theology which it proposed to
   present was Christianity or Buddhism. Or, at best, he would find a few
   drops of Biblical truth so diluted by floods of human speculation that
   the most delicate of chemical tests would fail to detect the divine
   element.

   Attempts to do this Futile.

   All such attempts are futile. The empirical proof of this is, that no
   such attempt has ever succeeded. The experiment has been made hundreds
   of times, and always with the same result. Where are now the
   philosophical expositions and vindications of Scripture doctrines by
   the Platonizing fathers; by the Schoolmen; by the Cartesians; by the
   Leibnitzians? What power over the reason, the conscience, or the life,
   has any of the speculative systems of our day? Who, beyond the devotees
   of the systems which they represent, understand or adopt the theology
   of Daub, of Marheinecke, of Lange, and others? Strauss, therefore, is
   right when he repudiates all these vain attempts to reconcile
   Christianity with philosophy, or to give a form to Christian doctrine
   which satisfies the philosophical thinker. [103]

   But apart from this argument from experience, the assumption is
   preposterous that the feeble intellect of man can explain, and from its
   own resources, vindicate and prove the deep things of God. An infant
   might as well undertake to expound Newton's "Principia." If there are
   mysteries in nature, in every blade of grass, in the insect, in the
   body and in the soul of man, there must be mysteries in religion. The
   Bible and our consciousness teach us that God is incomprehensible, and
   his ways past finding out; that we cannot explain either his nature or
   his acts; we know not how he creates, upholds, and governs without
   interfering with the nature of his creatures; how there can be three
   persons in the Godhead; how in the one person of Christ there can be
   two intelligences and two wills; how the Spirit inspires, renews,
   sanctifies, or comforts. It belongs to the "self-deifying" class of
   philosophers to presume to know all that God knows, and to banish the
   incomprehensible from the religion which he has revealed. "To the
   school of Hegel," says Bretschneider, "there are mysteries in religion
   only for those who have not raised themselves to the Hegelian grade of
   knowledge. For the latter all is clear; all is knowledge; and
   Christianity is the solution, and therefore the revelation of all
   mysteries." [104] This may be consistent in those who hold that man is
   God in the highest form of his existence, and the philosopher the
   highest style of man. Such an assertion, however, by whomsoever it may
   be made, is the insanity of presumption.

   May what is True in Religion be False in Philosophy?

   A fourth question included in this general subject is, Whether there is
   or may be a real conflict between the truths of reason and those of
   revelation? Whether that which is true in religion may be false in
   philosophy? To this question different answers have been given.

   The Fathers on this Question.

   First, while the Greek fathers were disposed to bring religion and
   philosophy into harmony, by giving a philosophical form to Christian
   doctrines, the Latins were inclined to represent the two as
   irreconcilable. "What," asks Tertullian, "has Athens to do with
   Jerusalem? The academy with the Church? What have heretics to do with
   Christians? Our instruction is from the porch of Solomon, who himself
   taught that the Lord was to be sought in the simplicity of the
   heart. . . . . We need no seeking for truth after Christ; no research
   after the Gospel. When we believe, we desire nothing beyond faith,
   because we believe that there is nothing else we should do. . . . . To
   know nothing beyond is to know all things." [105] He went so far as to
   say, "Prorsus credibile est, quia ineptum est; . . . . certum est, quia
   impossibile est." [106] Without going to this extreme, the theologians
   of the Latin Church, those of them at least most zealous for Church
   doctrines, were inclined to deny to reason even the prerogative of a
   judicium contradictionis. They were constrained to take this ground
   because they were called upon to defend doctrines whici contradicted
   not only reason but the senses. When it was objected to the doctrine
   that the consecrated wafer is the real body of Christ, that our senses
   pronounce it to be bread, and that it is impossible that a human body
   should be in heaven and in all parts of the earth at the same time,
   what could they say but that the senses and reason are not to be
   trusted in the sphere of faith? That what is false to the reason and
   the senses may be true in religion?

   Lutheran Teaching on this Point.

   The Lutherans were under the same necessity. Their doctrine of the
   person of Christ involves the denial of the primary truth, that
   attributes cannot be separated from the substance of which they are the
   manifestation. Their doctrine concerning the Lord's Supper involves the
   assumption of the ubiquity of Christ's body, which seems to be a
   contradiction in terms.

   Luther's utterances on this subject are not very consistent. When
   arguing against the continued obligation of monastic vows, he did not
   hesitate to say that what was contrary to reason was contrary to God.
   "Was nun der Vernunft entgegen ist, ist gewiss dass es Gott viehmehr
   entgegen ist. Denn wie sollte es nicht wider die göttliche Wahrheit
   seyn, das wider Vernunft und menschliche Wahrheit ist." [107] But in
   the sacramentarian controversy he will not allow reason to be heard.
   "In the things of God," he says, reason or nature is
   stock-star-and-stone blind. "It is, indeed," he adds, "audacious enough
   to plunge in and stumble as a blind horse; but all that it explains or
   concludes is as certainly false and wrong as that God lives." [108] In
   another place he says that reason, when she attempts to speculate about
   divine things, becomes a fool; which, indeed, is very much what Paul
   says. (Rom. i. 22, 1 Cor. i. 18-31.)

   The Lutheran theologians made a distinction between reason in the
   abstract, or reason as it was in man before the fall, and reason as it
   now is. They admit that no truth of revelation can contradict reason as
   such; but it may contradict the reason of men all of whose faculties
   are clouded and deteriorated by sin. By this was not meant simply that
   the unrenewed man is opposed to the truth of God; that "the things of
   the Spirit" are foolishness to him, that it seems to him absurd that
   God should be found in fashion as a man; that He should demand a
   satisfaction for sin; or save one man and not another, according to his
   own good pleasure. This the Bible clearly teaches and all Christians
   believe. In all this there is no contradiction between reason and
   religion. The being of God is foolishness to the atheist; and personal
   immortality is foolishness to the pantheist. Yet who would admit that
   these doctrines are contrary to reason? The Lutheran theologians
   intended to teach, not only that the mysteries of the Bible are above
   reason, that they can neither be understood nor demonstrated; and not
   only that "the things of the Spirit" are foolishness to the natural
   man, but that they are really in conflict with the human understanding;
   that by a correct process of reasoning they can be demonstrated to be
   false; so that in the strict sense of the terms what is true in
   religion is false in philosophy. "The Sorbonne," says Luther, "has
   pronounced a most abominable decision in saying that what is true in
   religion is also true in philosophy; and moreover condemning as
   heretics all who assert the contrary. By this horrible doctrine it has
   given it to be clearly understood that the doctrines of faith are to be
   subjected to the yoke of human reason." [109]

   Sir William Hamilton.

   Secondly, the ground taken by Sir William Hamilton on this subject is
   not precisely the same with that taken by the Lutherans. They agree,
   indeed, in this, that we are bound to believe what (at the bar of
   reason) we can prove to be false, but they differ entirely as to the
   cause and nature of this conflict between reason and faith. According
   to the Lutherans, it arises from the corruption and deterioration of
   our nature by the fall. It is removed in part in this world by
   regeneration, and entirely hereafter by the perfection of our
   sanctification. According to Hamilton, this conflict arises from the
   necessary limitation of human thought. God has so made us that reason,
   acting according to its own laws, of necessity arrives at conclusions
   directly opposed to the doctrines of religion both natural and
   revealed. We can prove demonstrably that the Absolute being cannot
   know, cannot be a cause, cannot be conscious. It may be proved with
   equal clearness that the Infinite cannot be a person, or possess moral
   attributes. Here, then, what is true in religion, what we are bound to
   believe, and what in point of fact all men, in virtue of the
   constitution of their nature do believe, can be proved to be false.
   There is thus an irreconcilable conflict between our intellectual and
   moral nature. But as, according to the idealist, reason forces us to
   the conclusion that the external world does not exist, while,
   nevertheless, it is safe and proper to act on the assumption that it
   is, and is what it appears to be; so, according to Hamilton, it is not
   only safe, but obligatory on us to act on the assumption that God is a
   person, although infinite, while our reason demonstrates that an
   infinite person is a contradiction. The conflict between reason and
   faith is avowed, while the obligation of faith on the testimony of our
   moral and religious nature and of the Word of God is affirmed. This
   point has been already discussed.

   The View of Speculative Philosophers.

   Thirdly, we note the view taken by the speculative philosophers. They,
   too, maintain that reason demonstrates the doctrines of revelation and
   even of natural religion to be false. But they do not recognize their
   obligation to receive them as objects of faith. Being contrary to
   reason, those doctrines are false, and being false, they are, by
   enlightened men, to be rejected. If any cling to them as a matter of
   feeling, they are to be allowed to do so, but they must renounce all
   claim to philosophic insight.

   May the Objects of Faith be above, and yet not against Reason?

   A fifth question is, Whether the objects of faith may be above, and yet
   not contrary to reason? The answer to this question is to be in the
   affirmative, for the distinction implied is sound and almost
   universally admitted. What is above reason is simply incomprehensible.
   What is against reason is impossible. It is contrary to reason that
   contradictions should be true; that a part should be greater than the
   whole; that a thing should be and not be at the same time; that right
   should be wrong and wrong right. It is incomprehensible how matter
   attracts matter; how the mind acts on the body, and the body on the
   mind. The distinction between the incomprehensible and the impossible,
   is therefore plain and admitted. And the distinction between what is
   above reason, and what is against reason, is equally obvious and just.
   The great body of Christian theologians have ever taken the ground that
   the doctrines of the Bible are not contrary to reason, although above
   it. That is, they are matters of faith to be received on the authority
   of God, and not because they can be either understood or proved. As it
   is incomprehensible how a soul and body can be united in one conscious
   life; so it is incomprehensible how a divine and human nature can be
   united in one person m Christ. Neither is impossible, and therefore
   neither is contrary to reason. We know the one fact from consciousness;
   we believe the other on the testimony of God. It is impossible, and
   therefore contrary to reason, that three should be one. But it is not
   impossible that the same numerical essence should subsist in three
   distinct persons. Realists tell us that humanity, as one numerical
   essence, subsists in all the millions of human individuals. Thomas
   Aquinas takes the true ground when he says: "Ea quæ sunt supra naturam,
   sola fide tenemus. Quod autem credimus, auctoritati debemus. Unde in
   omnibus asserendis sequi debemus naturam rerum, præter ea, quæ
   auctoritate divina traduntur, quæ sunt supra naturam." [110] "Quæ
   igitur fidei sunt, non sunt tentanda probare nisi per auctoritates his,
   qui auctoritates suscipiunt. Apud alios vero sufficit defendere non
   esse impossibile quod prædicat fides." [111] "Quidquid in aliis
   scientiis invenitur veritati hujus scientiæ [sacræ doctrinæ] repugnans,
   totum condemnatur ut falsum." [112]

   The Objects of Faith are consistent with Reason.

   While, therefore, the objects of faith as revealed in the Bible, are
   not truths of the reason, i.e., which the human reason can discover, or
   comprehend, or demonstrate, they are, nevertheless, perfectly
   consistent with reason. They involve no contradictions or absurdities;
   nothing impossible, nothing inconsistent with the intuitions either of
   the intellect or of the conscience; nothing inconsistent with any well
   established truth, whether of the external world or of the world of
   mind. On the contrary, the contents of the Bible, so far as they relate
   to things within the legitimate domain of human knowledge, are found to
   be consistent, and must be consistent, with all we certainly know from
   other sources than a divine revelation. All that the Scriptures teach
   concerning the external world accords with the facts of experience.
   They do not teach that the earth is a plane; that it is stationary in
   space; that the sun revolves around it. On the other hand, they do
   teach that God made all plants and animals, each after its own kind;
   and, accordingly, all experience shows that species are immutable. All
   the anthropological doctrines of the Bible agree with what we know of
   man from consciousness and observation. The Bible teaches that God made
   of one blood all nations which dwell on the face of the earth. We
   accordingly find that all the varieties of our race have the same
   anatomical structure; the same physical nature; the same rational and
   moral faculties. The Bible teaches that man is a free, accountable
   agent; that all men are sinners; that all need redemption, and that no
   man can redeem himself or find a ransom for his brother. With these
   teachings the consciousness of all men agrees. All that the Scriptures
   reveal concerning the nature and attributes of Gods corresponds with
   our religious nature, satisfying, elevating, and sanctifying all our
   powers and meeting all our necessities. If the contents of the Bible
   did not correspond with the truths which God has revealed in his
   external works and the constitution of our nature, it could not be
   received as coming from Him, for God cannot contradict himself.
   Nothing, therefore, can be more derogatory to the Bible than the
   assertion that its doctrines are contrary to reason.

   Faith in the Irrational impossible.

   The assumption that reason and faith are incompatible; that we must
   become irrational in order to become believers is, however it may be
   intended, the language of infidelity; for faith in the irrational is of
   necessity itself irrational. It is impossible to believe that to be
   true which the mind sees to be false. This would be to believe and
   disbelieve the same thing at the same time. If, therefore, as modern
   philosophers assert, it is impossible that an infinite being can be a
   person, then faith in the personality of God is impossible. Then there
   can be no religion, no sin, no accountability, no immortality. Faith is
   not a blind, irrational conviction. In order to believe, we must know
   what we believe, and the grounds on which our faith rests. And,
   therefore, the refuge which some would take in faith, from the
   universal scepticism to which they say reason necessarily leads, is
   insecure and worthless.

   While admitting that the truths of revelation are to be received upon
   the authority of God; that human reason can neither comprehend nor
   prove them; that a man must be converted and become as a little child
   before he can truly receive the doctrines of the Bible; and admitting,
   moreover, that these doctrines are irreconcilable with every system of
   philosophy, ever framed by those who refuse to be taught of God, or who
   were ignorant of his Word, yet it is ever to be maintained that those
   doctrines are unassailable; that no created intellect can prove them to
   be impossible or irrational. Paul, while spurning the wisdom of the
   world, still claimed that he taught the highest wisdom, even the wisdom
   of God. (1 Cor. ii. 6, 7.) And who will venture to say that the wisdom
   of God is irrational?

   Knowledge essential to Faith.

   A sixth question, included under the head of the relation of faith to
   knowledge is, Whether knowledge is essential to faith? That is, whether
   a truth must be known in order to be believed? This Protestants affirm
   and Romanists deny.

   Protestants of course admit that mysteries, or truths which we are
   unable to comprehend, may be, and are, proper objects of faith. They
   repudiate the rationalistic doctrine that we can believe only what we
   understand and what we can prove, or, at least, elucidate so that it
   appears to be true in its own light. What Protestants maintain is that
   knowledge, i.e., the cognition of the import of the proposition to be
   believed, is essential to faith; and, consequently, that faith is
   limited by knowledge. We can believe only what we know, i.e., what we
   intelligently apprehend. If a proposition be announced to us in an
   unknown language, we can affirm nothing about it. We can neither
   believe nor disbelieve it. Should the man who makes the declaration,
   assert that it is true, if we have confidence in his competency and
   integrity, we may believe that he is right, but the proposition itself
   is no part of our faith. The Apostle recognizes this obvious truth when
   he says, "Except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood
   (eusemon logon), how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall
   speak into the air. . . . . If I know not the meaning of the voice, I
   shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall
   be a barbarian unto me. . . . . When thou shalt bless with the Spirit,
   how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned, say Amen at thy
   giving of thanks? seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?" (1
   Cor. xiv. 9-16.) To say Amen, is to assent to, to make one's own.
   According to the Apostle, therefore, knowledge, or the intelligent
   apprehension of the meaning of what is proposed, is essential to faith.
   If the proposition "God is a Spirit," be announced to the unlearned in
   Hebrew or Greek, it is impossible that they should assent to its truth.
   If they understand the language, if they know what the word "God"
   means, and what the word "Spirit" means, then they may receive or
   reject the truth which that proposition affirms. The declaration "Jesus
   is the Son of God," admits of different interpretations. Some say the
   term Son is an official title, and therefore the proposition "Jesus is
   the Son of God," means that Jesus is a ruler. Others say it is a term
   of affection, then the proposition means that Jesus was the special
   object of the love of God. Others say that it means that Jesus is of
   the same nature with God; that He is a divine person. If this be the
   meaning of the Spirit in declaring Jesus to be the Son of God, then
   those who do not attach that sense to the words, do not believe the
   truth intended to be taught. When it is said God set forth Christ to be
   a propitiation for our sins, if we do not understand what the word
   propitiation means, the proposition to us means nothing, and nothing
   cannot be an object of faith.

   Knowledge the Measure of Faith.

   It follows from what has been said, or rather is included in it, that
   knowledge being essential to faith, it must be the measure of it. What
   lies beyond the sphere of knowledge, lies beyond the sphere of faith.
   Of the unseen and eternal we can believe only what God has revealed;
   and of what God has revealed, we can believe only what we know. It has
   been said that he who believes the Bible to be the Word of God, may
   properly be said to believe all it teaches, although much of its
   instructions may be to him unknown. But this is not a correct
   representation. The man who believes the Bible, is prepared to believe
   on its authority whatever it declares to be true. But he cannot
   properly be said to believe any more of its contents than he knows. If
   asked if he believed that men bitten by poisonous serpents were ever
   healed by merely looking at a brazen serpent, he might, if ignorant of
   the Pentateuch, honestly answer, No. But should he come to read and
   understand the record of the healing of the dying Israelites, as found
   in the Bible, he would rationally and sincerely, answer, Yes. This
   disposition to believe whatever the Bible teaches, as soon as we know
   what is taught, may be called an implicit faith, but it is no real
   faith. It has none of its characteristics and none of its power.

   Proof that Knowledge is Essential to Faith.

   That knowledge, in the sense above stated, is essential to faith is
   obvious, --

   1. From the very nature of faith. It includes the conviction of the
   truth of its object. It is an affirmation of the mind that a thing is
   true or trustworthy, but the mind can affirm nothing of that of which
   it knows nothing.

   2. The Bible everywhere teaches that without knowledge there can be no
   faith. This, as just stated, is the doctrine of the Apostle Paul. He
   condemned the speaking in an unknown tongue in a promiscuous assembly,
   because the hearers could not understand what was said; and if they did
   not know the meaning of the words uttered, they could neither assent to
   them, nor be profited by them. In another place (Rom. x. 14) he asks,
   "How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?" "Faith,"
   he says, "cometh by hearing." The command of Christ was to preach the
   Gospel to every creature; to teach all nations. Those who received the
   instructions thus given, should, He assured his disciples, be saved;
   those who rejected them, should be damned. This takes for granted that
   without the knowledge of the Gospel, there can be no faith. On this
   principle the Apostles acted everywhere. They went abroad preaching
   Christ, proving from the Scriptures that He was the Son of God and
   Saviour of the world. The communication of knowledge always preceded
   the demand for faith.

   3. Such is the intimate connection between faith and knowledge, that in
   the Scriptures the one term is often used for the other. To know
   Christ, is to believe upon Him. To know the truth, is intelligently and
   believingly to apprehend and appropriate it. Conversion is effected by
   knowledge. Paul says he was made a believer by the revelation of Christ
   within him. The Spirit is said to open the eyes of the understanding.
   Men are said to be renewed so as to know. We are translated from the
   kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light. Believers are children
   of the light. Men are said to perish for the lack of knowledge. Nothing
   is more characteristic of the Bible than the importance which it
   attaches to the knowledge of the truth. We are said to be begotten by
   the truth; to be sanctified by the truth; and the whole duty of
   ministers and teachers is said to be to hold forth the word of life. It
   is because Protestants believe that knowledge is essential to faith,
   that they insist so strenuously on the circulation of the Scriptures
   and the instruction of the people.

   Romish Doctrine on this Subject.

   Romanists make a distinction between explicit and implicit faith. By
   the former is meant, faith in a known truth; by the latter faith in
   truths not known. They teach that only a few primary truths of religion
   need be known, and that faith without knowledge, as to all other
   truths, is genuine and sufficient. On this subject Thomas Aquinas says,
   "Quantum ad prima credibilia, quæ sunt articuli fidei, tenetur homo
   explicite credere. Quantum autem ad alia credibilia non tenetur homo
   explicite credere, sed solum implicite, vel in præparatione animi, in
   quantum paratus est credere quidquid divina Scriptura continet." [113]
   Implicit faith is defined as, "Assensus, qui omnia, quamvis ignota, quæ
   ab ecclesia probantur, amplectitur." [114] Bellarmin [115] says, "In eo
   qui credit, duo sunt, apprehensio et judicium, sive assensus: sed
   apprehensio non est fides, sed aliud fidem præcedens. Possunt enim
   infideles apprehendere mysteria fidei. Præterea, apprehensio non
   dicitur proprie notitia. . . . . Mysteria fidei, quæ rationem superant,
   credimus, non intelligimus, ac per hoc fides distingintur contra
   scientiam, et melius per ignorantiam, quam per notitiam definitur." The
   faith required of the people is simply, A general intention to believe
   whatever the Church believes." [116] The Church teaches that there are
   seven sacraments. A man who has no idea what the word sacrament means,
   or what rites are regarded by the Church as having a sacramental
   character, is held to believe that orders, penance, matrimony, and
   extreme unction, are sacraments. So, of all other doctrines of the
   Church. True faith is said to be consistent with absolute ignorance.
   According to this doctrine, a man may be a true Christian, if he
   submits to the Church, although in his internal convictions and modes
   of thought, he be a pantheist or pagan.

   It is to this grave error as to the nature of faith, that much in the
   character and practice of the Romish Church is to be referred, --

   1. This is the reason why the Scriptures are withheld from the people.
   If knowledge is not necessary to faith, there is no need that the
   people should know what the Bible teaches.

   2. For the same reason the services of public worship are conducted in
   an unknown language.

   3. Hence, too, the symbolism which characterizes their worship. The end
   to be accomplished is a blind reverence and awe. For this end there is
   no need that these symbols should be understood. It is enough that they
   affect the imagination.

   4. To the same principle is to be referred the practice of reserve in
   preaching. The truth may be kept back or concealed. The cross is held
   up before the people, but it is not necessary that the doctrine of the
   sacrifice for sin made thereon should be taught. It is enough if the
   people are impressed; it matters not whether they believe that the
   sign, or the material, or the doctrine symbolized, secures salvation.
   Nay, the darker the mind, the more vague and mysterious the feeling
   excited, and the more blind the submission rendered, the more genuine
   is the exercise of faith. "Religious light," says Mr. Newman, "is
   intellectual darkness." [117]

   5. It is on the same principle the Roman Catholic missions have always
   been conducted. The people are converted not by the truth, not by a
   course of instruction, but by baptism. They are made Christians by
   thousands, not by the intelligent adoption of Christianity as a system
   of doctrine, of that they may be profoundly ignorant, but by simple
   submission to the Church and its prescribed rites. The consequence has
   been that the Catholic missions, although continued in some instances
   for more than a hundred years, take no hold on the people, but almost
   uniformly die out, as soon as the supply of foreign ministers is cut
   off.

   § 5. Faith and Feeling.

   It has already been seen, --

   1. That faith, the act of believing, cannot properly be defined as the
   assent of the understanding determined by the will. There are,
   unquestionably, many cases in which a man believes against his will.

   2. It has also been argued that it is not correct to say that faith is
   assent founded on feeling. On this point it was admitted that a man's
   feelings have great influence upon his faith; that it is comparatively
   easy to believe what is agreeable, and difficult to believe what is
   disagreeable. It was also admitted that in saving faith, the gift of
   God, resting on the inward illuminating testimony of the Holy Spirit,
   there is a discernment not only of the truth but of the divine
   excellence of the things of the Spirit, which is inseparably connected
   with appropriate feeling. It was moreover conceded that, so far as the
   consciousness of the believer is concerned, he seems to receive the
   truth on its own evidence, on its excellence and power over his heart
   and conscience. This, however, is analogous to other facts in his
   experience. When a man repents and believes, he is conscious only of
   his own exercises and not of the supernatural influences of the Spirit,
   to which those exercises owe their origin and nature. Thus also in the
   exercise of faith, consciousness does not reach the inward testimony of
   the Spirit on which that faith is founded. Nevertheless,
   notwithstanding these admissions, it is still incorrect to say that
   faith is founded on feeling, because it is only of certain forms or
   exercises of faith that this can even be plausibly said; and because
   there are many exercises of even saving faith (that is, of faith in a
   true believer,) which are not attended by feeling. This is the case
   when the object of faith is some historical fact. Besides, the
   Scriptures clearly teach that the ground of faith is the testimony of
   God, or demonstration of the Spirit. He has revealed certain truths,
   and attends them with such an amount and kind of evidence, as produces
   conviction, and we receive them on his authority.

   3. Faith is not necessarily connected with feeling. Sometimes it is,
   and sometimes it is not. Whether it is or not, depends, (a.) On the
   nature of the object. Belief in glad tidings is of necessity attended
   by joy; of evil tidings with grief. Belief in moral excellence involves
   a feeling of approbation. Belief that a certain act is criminal,
   involves disapprobation. (b.) On the proximate ground of faith. If a
   man believes that a picture is beautiful on the testimony of competent
   judges, there is no æsthetic feeling connected with his faith. But if
   he personally perceives the beauty of the object, then delight is
   inseparable from the conviction that it is beautiful. In like manner if
   a man believes that Jesus is God manifest in the flesh, on the mere
   external testimony of the Bible, he experiences no due impression from
   that truth. But if his faith is founded on the inward testimony of the
   Spirit, by which the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ is
   revealed to him, then he is filled with adoring admiration and love.

   Religious Faith more than Simple Assent.

   4. Another question agitated on this subject is, Whether faith is a
   purely intellectual exercise; or Whether it is also an exercise of the
   affections. This is nearly allied to the preceding question, and must
   receive substantially the same answer. Bellarmin, [118] says, "Tribus
   in rebus ab hæreticis Catholici dissentiunt; Primum, in objecto fidei
   justificantis, quod hæretici restringunt ad solam promissionem
   misericordiæ specialis, Catholici tam late patere volunt, quam late
   patet verbam. . . . Deinde in facultate et potentia animi quæ sedes est
   fidei. Siquidem illi fidem collocant in voluntate [seu in corde] cum
   fiduciam esse definiunt; ac per hoc eam cum spe confundunt. Fiducia
   enim nihil est aliud, nisi spes roborata. . . . Catholici fidem in
   intellectu sedem habere docent. Denique, in ipso actu intellectus. Ipsi
   enim per notitiam fidem definiunt, nos per assensum. Assentimur enim
   Deo, quamvis ea nobis credenda proponat, quæ non intelligimus."
   Regarding faith as a mere intellectual or speculative act, they
   consistently deny that it is necessarily connected with salvation.
   According to their doctrine, a man may have true faith, i.e., the faith
   which the Scriptures demand, and yet perish. On this point the Council
   of Trent says: "Si quis dixerit, amissa per peccatum gratia, simul et
   fidem semper amitti, aut fidem, quæ remanet, non esse veram fidem,
   licet non sit viva; aut eum, qui fidem sine caritate habet, non esse
   Christianum; anathema sit." [119]

   Protestant Doctrine.

   On the other hand Protestants with one voice maintain that the faith
   which is connected with salvation, is not a mere intellectual exercise.
   Calvin says: [120] "Verum observemus, fidei sedem non in cerebro esse,
   sed in corde: neque vero de eo contenderim, qua in parte corporis sita
   sit fides: sed quoniam cordis nomen pro serio et sincero affectu fere
   capitur, dico firmam esse et efficacem fiduciam, non nudam tantum
   notionem." He also says: [121] "Quodsi expenderent illud Pauli, Corde
   creditur ad justitiam (Rom. x. 10): fingere desinerent frigidam illam
   qualitatem. Si una hæc nobis suppeteret ratio, valere deberet ad litem
   finiendam: assensionem scilicet ipsam sicuti ex parte attigi, et fusius
   iterum repetam, cordis esse magis quam cerebri, et affectus magis quam
   intelligentiæ."

   The answer in the Heidelberg Catechism, to the question, What is Faith?
   is, "It is not merely a certain knowledge, whereby I receive as true
   all that God has revealed to us in his Word, but also a cordial trust,
   which the Holy Ghost works in me by the Gospel, that not only to
   others, but to me also, the forgiveness of sin, and everlasting
   righteousness and life are given by God, out of pure grace, and only
   for the sake of Christ's merit." [122]

   That saving faith is not a mere speculative assent of the
   understanding, is the uniform doctrine of the Protestant symbols. On
   this point, however, it may be remarked, in the first place, that, as
   has often been stated before, the Scriptures do not make the sharp
   distinction between the understanding, the feelings, and the will,
   which is common in our day. A large class of our inward acts and states
   are so complex as to be acts of the whole soul, and not exclusively of
   any one of its faculties. In repentance there is of necessity an
   intellectual apprehension of ourselves as sinners, of the holiness of
   God, of his law to which we have failed to be conformed and of his
   mercy in Christ; there is a moral disapprobation of our character and
   conduct; a feeling of sorrow, shame, and remorse; and a purpose to
   forsake sin and lead a holy life. Scarcely less complex is the state of
   mind expressed by the word faith as it exists in a true believer. In
   the second place, there is a distinction to be made between faith in
   general and saving faith. If we take that element of faith which is
   common to every act of believing; if we understand by it the
   apprehension of a thing as true and worthy of confidence, whether a
   fact of history or of science, then it may be said that faith in its
   essential nature is intellectual, or intelligent assent. But if the
   question be, What is that act or state of mind which is required in the
   Gospel, when we are commanded to believe; the answer is very different.
   To believe that Christ is "God manifest in the flesh," is not the mere
   intellectual conviction that no one, not truly divine, could be and do
   what Christ was and did; for this conviction demoniacs avowed; but it
   is to receive Him as our God. This includes the apprehension and
   conviction of his divine glory, and the adoring reverence, love,
   confidence, and submission, which are due to God alone. When we are
   commanded to believe in Christ as the Saviour of men, we are not
   required merely to assent to the proposition that He does save sinners,
   but also to receive and rest upon Him alone for our own salvation.
   What, therefore, the Scriptures mean by faith, in this connection, the
   faith which is required for salvation, is an act of the whole soul, of
   the understanding, of the heart, and of the will.

   Proof of the Protestant Doctrine.

   The Protestant doctrine that saving faith includes knowledge, assent,
   and trust, and is not, as Romanists teach, mere assent, in sustained by
   abundant proofs.

   1. In the first place, it is proved from the nature of the object of
   saving faith. That object is not merely the general truth of Scripture,
   not the fact that the Gospel reveals God's plan of saving sinners; but
   it is Christ himself; his person and work, and the offer of salvation
   to us personally and individually. From the nature of the case we
   cannot, as just remarked, believe in Christ on the inward testimony of
   the Spirit which reveals his glory and his love, without the feelings
   of reverence, love, and trust mingling with the act and constituting
   its character. Nor is it possible that a soul oppressed with a sense of
   sin should receive the promise of deliverance from its guilt and power,
   without any feeling of gratitude and confidence. The act of faith in
   such a promise is in its nature an act of appropriation and confidence.

   2. We accordingly find that in many cases in the Bible the word trust
   is used instead of faith. The same act or state of mind which in one
   place is expressed by the one word, is in others expressed by the
   other. The same promises are made to trust as are made to faith. The
   same effects are attributed to the one, that are attributed to the
   other.

   3. The use of other words and forms of expression as explanatory of the
   act of faith, and substituted for that word, shows that it includes
   trust as an essential element of its nature. We are commanded to look
   to Christ, as the dying Israelites looked up to the brazen serpent.
   This looking involved trusting; and looking is declared to be
   believing. Sinners are exhorted to flee to Christ as a refuge. The
   man-slayer fled to the city of refuge because he relied upon it as a
   place of safety. We are said to receive Christ, to rest upon Him, to
   lay hold of Him. All these, and other modes of expression which teach
   us what we are to do when we are commanded to believe, show that trust
   is an essential element in the act of saving faith.

   4. The command to believe is expressed by the word pisteu,w not only
   when followed by the accusative, but also when followed by the dative
   and by the prepositions epi, eis, en. But the literal meaning of
   pisteuein eis, or epi, or en, is not simply to believe, but to believe
   upon, to confide in, to trust. Faith in a promise made to ourselves,
   from the nature of the case, is an act of confidence in him who makes
   the promise.

   5. Unbelief is, therefore, expressed by doubt, fear, distrust and
   despair.

   6 The believer knows from his own experience that when he believes he
   receives and rests on Jesus Christ for salvation, as He is freely
   offered to us in the Gospel.

   The controversy between Romanists and Protestants on this subject turns
   on the view taken of the plan of salvation. If, as Protestants hold,
   every man in order to be saved, must receive the record which God has
   given of his Son; must believe that He is God manifest in the flesh,
   the propitiation for our sins, the prophet, priest, and king of his
   people, then it must be admitted that faith involves trust in Christ as
   to us the source of wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
   redemption. But if, as Romanists teach, the benefits of redemption are
   conveyed only through the sacraments, effective ex opere operato, then
   faith is the opposite of infidelity in its popular sense. If a man is
   not a believer, he is an infidel, i.e., a rejecter of Christianity. The
   object of faith is divine revelation as contained in the Bible. It is a
   simple assent to the fact that the Scriptures are from God, and that
   the Church is a divinely constituted and supernaturally endowed
   institute for the salvation of men. Believing this, the sinner comes to
   the Church and receives through her ministrations, in his measure, all
   the benefits of redemption. According to this system the nature and
   office of faith are entirely different from what they are according to
   the Protestant theory of the Gospel.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 6. Faith and Love.

   As to the relation between faith and love there are three different
   views: --

   1. That love is the ground of faith; that men believe the truth because
   they love it. Faith is founded on feeling. This view has already been
   sufficiently discussed.

   2. That love is the invariable and necessary attendant and consequent
   of saving faith. As no man can see and believe a thing to be morally
   good without the feeling of approbation; so no one can see and believe
   the glory of God as revealed in the Scriptures without adoring
   reverence being awakened in his soul; no one can believe unto salvation
   that Christ is the Son of God and the Son of Man; that He loved us and
   gave Himself for us, and makes us kings and priests unto God, without
   love and devotion, in proportion to the clearness and strength of this
   faith, filling the heart and controlling the life. Hence faith is said
   to work by love and to purify the heart. Romanists, indeed, render
   pistis di' agapes energoumene in this passage (Gal. v. 6), "faith
   perfected or completed by love." But this is contrary to the constant
   usage of the word energeisthai in the New Testament, which is always
   used in a middle sense, "vim suam exserere." According to the Apostle's
   teaching in Rom. vii. 4-6, love without faith, or anterior to it, is
   impossible. Until we believe, we are under the condemnation of the law.
   While under condemnation, we are at enmity with God. While at enmity
   with God, we bring forth fruit unto death. It is only when reconciled
   to God and united to Christ, that we bring forth fruit unto God.
   Believing that God loves us we love Him. Believing that Christ gave
   Himself for us, we devote our lives to Him. Believing that the fashion
   of this world passes away, that the things unseen are eternal, those
   who have that faith which is the substance of things hoped for, and the
   evidence of things not seen, set their affections on things above where
   Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. This necessary connection
   between faith and love, has already been sufficiently insisted upon.

   Romanists make Love the Essence of Faith.

   3. The third doctrinal view on this subject is that of the Romanists,
   who make love the essence of faith. In other words, love with them is
   the form (in the scholastic sense of the word) of faith; it is that
   which gives it being or character as a Christian virtue or grace. While
   on the one hand they teach, as we have seen with the Council of Trent,
   that faith is in itself mere intellectual assent, without any moral
   virtue, and which may be exercised by the unrenewed or by those in a
   state of mortal sin; on the other hand, they hold that there is such a
   Christian grace as faith; but in that case, faith is only another name
   for love. This is not the distinction between a living and dead faith
   which the Scriptures and all Evangelical Christians recognize. With
   Romanists the fides informis is true faith, and the fides formata is
   love. On this point, Peter Lombard [123] says: "Fides qua dicitur
   [creditur?], si cum caritate sit, virtus est, quia caritas ut ait
   Ambrosius mater est omnium virtutum, quæ omnes informat, sine qua nulla
   vera virtus est." Thomas Aquinas [124] says: "Actus fidei ordinatur ad
   objectum voluntatis, quod est bonum, sicut ad finem. Hoc autem bonum
   quod est finis fidei, scilicet bonum divinum, est proprium objectum
   charitatis: et ideo charitas dicitur forma fidei, in quantum per
   charitatem actus fidei perficitur et formatur." Bellarmin [125] says:
   "Quod si charitas est forma fidei, et fides non justificat formaliter,
   nisi ab ipsa caritate formata certe multo magis charitas ipsa
   justificat. . . . . Fides quæ agitur, ac movetur, formatur, et quasi
   animatur per dilectionem. . . . . Apostolus Paulus . . . . explicat
   dilectionem formam esse extrinsecam fidei non intrinsecam, quæ det
   illi, non ut sit, sed ut moveatur." All this is intelligible and
   reasonable, provided we admit subjective justification, and the merit
   of good works. If justification is sanctification, then it may be
   admitted that love has more to do with making men holy, than faith
   considered as mere intellectual assent. And if it be conceded that we
   are accepted by God on the ground of our own virtue, then it may be
   granted that love is more valuable than any mere exercise of the
   intellect. Romanists argue, "Maxima virtus maxime justificat. Dilectio
   est maxima virtus. Ergo maxime justificat." It was because this
   distinction between a "formed and unformed faith" was made in the
   interest of justification on the ground of our own character and merit,
   that Luther, with his usual vehement power, says: "Ipsi duplicem
   faciunt fidem, informem et formatam, hanc pestilentissimam et satanicam
   glossam non possum non vehementer detestari." It is only as connected
   with false views of justification that this question has any real
   importance. For it is admitted by all Protestants that saving faith and
   love are inseparably connected; that faith without love, i.e., that a
   faith which does not produce love and good works, is dead. But
   Protestants are strenuous in denying that we are justified on account
   of love, which is the real meaning of the Romanists when they say
   "fides non justificat formaliter, nisi ab ipsa caritate formata."

   § 7. The Object of Saving Faith.

   Fides Generalis.

   It is conceded that all Christians are bound to believe, and that all
   do believe everything taught in the Word of God, so far as the contents
   of the Scriptures are known to them. It is correct, therefore, to say
   that the object of faith is the whole revelation of God as contained in
   his Word. As the Bible is with Protestants the only infallible rule of
   faith and practice, nothing not expressly taught in Scripture, or
   deduced therefrom by necessary inference, can be imposed on the people
   of God as an article of faith. This is "the liberty wherewith Christ
   has made us free," and in which we are bound to stand fast. This is our
   protection on the one hand, against the usurpations of the Church.
   Romanists claim for the Church the prerogative of infallible and
   authoritative teaching. The people are bound to believe whatever the
   Church, i.e., its organs the bishops, declare to be a part of the
   revelation of God. They do not, indeed, assume the right "to make" new
   articles of faith. But they claim the authority to decide, in such a
   way as to bind the conscience of the people, what the Bible teaches;
   and what by tradition the Church knows to be included in the teaching
   of Christ and his Apostles. This gives them latitude enough to teach
   for doctrines the commandments of men. Bellarmin [126] says: "Omnium
   dogmatum firmitas pendet ab auctoritate præsentis ecclesiæ." On the
   other hand, however, it is not only against the usurpations of the
   Church, that the principle above mentioned is our security, but also
   against the tyranny of public opinion. Men are as impatient of
   contradiction now as they ever were. They manifest the same desire to
   have their own opinions enacted into laws, and enforced by divine
   authority. And they are as fierce in their denunciations of all who
   venture to oppose them. Hence they meet in conventions or other
   assemblies, ecclesiastical or voluntary, and decide what is true and
   what is false in doctrine, and what is right and what is wrong in
   morals. Against all undue assumptions of authority, true Protestants
   hold fast to the two great principles, -- the right of private
   judgment, and that the Scriptures are the only infallible rule of faith
   and practice. The object of faith, therefore, is all the truths
   revealed in the Word of God. All that God in the Bible declares to be
   true, we are bound to believe. This is what theologians call fides
   generalis.

   Fides Specialis.

   But, besides this, there is a fides specialis necessary to salvation.
   In the general contents of the Scriptures there are certain doctrines
   concerning Christ and his work, and certain promises of salvation made
   through Him to sinful men, which we are bound to receive and on which
   we are required to trust. The special object of faith, therefore, is
   Christ, and the promise of salvation through Him. And the special
   definite act of faith which secures our salvation is the act of
   receiving and resting on Him as He is offered to us in the Gospel. This
   is so clearly and so variously taught in the Scriptures as hardly to
   admit of being questioned.

   Christ's Testimony.

   In the first place, our Lord repeatedly declares that what men are
   required to do, and what they are condemned because they do not do, is
   to believe on Him. He was lifted up, "That whosoever believeth in him
   should not perish, but have eternal life." (John iii. 15.) "He that
   believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is
   condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only
   begotten Son of God." (v. 18.) "He that believeth on the Son hath
   everlasting life: but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life;
   but the wrath of God abideth on him." (v. 36.) "This is the will of him
   that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him,
   may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day."
   (John vi. 40.) "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me
   hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life. . . . . This is the
   bread which cometh down from heaven, . . . . any man eat of this bread,
   he shall live forever." (vers. 47-51.) In another place our Lord says,
   "This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
   (John vi. 29.) The passages, however, in which faith in Christ is
   expressly demanded as the condition of salvation, are too numerous to
   be cited.

   We are said to be saved by receiving Christ.

   That Christ is the immediate object of saving faith is also taught in
   all those passages in which we are said to receive Christ, or the
   testimony of God concerning Christ, and in which this act of receiving
   is said to secure our salvation. For example, in John i. 12, "As many
   as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God." "I
   am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not." (John v. 43.) "If
   we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this
   is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son. He that
   believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that
   believeth not God has made him a liar; because he believeth not the
   record that God gave of his Son." (1 John v. 9, 10.) "He that hath the
   Son hath life; he that hath not the Son of God hath not life." (v. 12.)
   "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God." (v. 1.)
   It is, therefore, receiving Christ; receiving the record which God has
   given of his Son; believing that He is the Christ the Son of the living
   God, which is the specific act required of us in order to salvation.
   Christ, therefore, is the immediate object of those exercises of faith
   which secure salvation. And, therefore, faith is expressed by looking
   to Christ; coming to Christ; committing the soul to Him, etc.

   Teaching of the Apostles

   Accordingly the Apostle teaches we are justified "by the faith of
   Christ." It is not faith as a pious disposition of the mind not faith
   as general confidence in God; not faith in the truth of divine
   revelation; much less faith "in eternal verities," or the general
   principles of truth and duty, but that faith of which Christ is the
   object. Romans iii. 22: "The righteousness of God which is by faith of
   Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe." Galatians ii.
   16: "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but
   by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ,
   that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works
   of the law." iii. 24: "The law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto
   Christ, that we might be justified by faith." v. 26: "For ye are all
   the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." Galatians ii. 20: "I
   live by the faith of the Son of God," etc., etc.

   Christ our Ransom.

   Christ declares that He gave Himself as a ransom for many; He was set
   forth as a propitiation for sins; He offered Himself as a sacrifice
   unto God. It is through the merit of his righteousness and death that
   men are saved. All these representations which pervade the Scriptures
   necessarily assume that the faith which secures salvation must have
   special reference to Him. If He is our Redeemer, we must receive and
   trust Him as such. If He is a propitiation for sins, it is through
   faith in his blood that we are reconciled to God. The whole plan of
   salvation, as set forth in the Gospel, supposes that Christ in his
   person and work is the object of faith and the ground of confidence.

   We live in Christ by Faith.

   The same thing follows from the representations given of the relation
   of the believer to Christ. We are in Him by faith. He dwells in us. He
   is the head from whom we, as members of his body, derive our life. He
   is the vine, we are the branches. It is not we that live, but Christ,
   who liveth in us. These and other representations are utterly
   inconsistent with the doctrine that it is a vague general faith in God
   or in the Scriptures which secures our salvation. It is a faith which
   terminates directly on Christ, which takes Him to be our God and
   Saviour. God sent his Son into the world, clothed in our nature, to
   reveal his will, to die for our sins and to rise again for our
   justification. In Him dwells the fulness of the Godhead, from his
   fulness we are filled. He to us is wisdom, righteousness,
   sanctification, and redemption. Those who receive this Saviour as being
   all He claimed to be, and commit their souls into his hands to be used
   in his service and saved to his glory, are, in the Scriptural sense of
   the term, believers. Christ is not only the object of their faith, but
   their whole inward, spiritual life terminates on Him. Nothing,
   therefore, can be more foreign to the Gospel than the Romish doctrine,
   substantially revived by the modern philosophy which turns the mind
   away from the historical, really existing, objective Christ, to the
   work within us; leaving us nothing to love and trust, but what is in
   our own miserable hearts.

   Christ is not received in a Special Office alone.

   Admitting that Christ is the immediate and special object of those acts
   of faith which secure salvation, it is asked, Whether it is Christ in
   all his offices, or Christ in his priestly office, especially, that is
   the object of justifying faith? This seems an unnecessary question. It
   is not raised in the Bible; nor does it suggest itself to the believer.
   He receives Christ. He does not ask himself for what special function
   of his saving work he thus accepts Him. He takes Him as a Saviour, as a
   deliverer from the guilt and power of sin, from the dominion of Satan,
   and from all the evils of his apostasy from God. He takes Him as his
   wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. He takes Him as
   his God and Saviour, as the full, complete, satisfying, life-giving
   portion of the soul. If this complex act of apprehension and surrender
   were analyzed it doubtless would be found to include submission to all
   his teaching, reliance on his righteousness and intercession,
   subjection to his will, confidence in his protection, and devotion to
   his service. As He is offered to us as a prophet, priest, and king, as
   such He is accepted. And as He is offered to us as a source of life,
   and glory, and blessedness, as the supreme object of adoration and
   love, as such He is joyfully accepted.

   Is the Sinner required to believe that God loves him?

   Again, it is questioned, Whether the object of saving faith is that God
   is reconciled to us; that our sins are forgiven; that we are the
   objects of the saving love of God? This is not the question above
   considered, namely, Whether, as Romanists say, the object of faith is
   the whole revelation of God, or, as Protestants contend, Christ and the
   promise of redemption through Him, although many of the arguments of
   the Romanists are directed against the special form of the doctrine
   just stated. They argue that it is contradictory to say that we are
   pardoned because we believe; and, in the same breath, to say that the
   thing to be believed is that our sins are already pardoned. Again, they
   argue that the only proper object of faith is some revelation of God,
   but it is nowhere revealed that we individually are reconciled to God,
   or that our sins are pardoned, or that we are the objects of that
   special love which God has to his own people.

   In answer to the first of these objections, the Reformed theologians
   were accustomed to say, that a distinction is to be made between the
   remission of sin de jure already obtained through the death of Christ,
   and remission de facto through the efficacious application of it to us.
   In the former sense, "remissio peccatorum jam impetrata" is the object
   of faith. In the latter sense, it is "remissio impetranda," because
   faith is the instrumental cause of justification, and must precede it.
   "Unde," says Turrettin, [127] "ad obtinendam remissionem peccatorum,
   non debeo credere peccata mihi jam remissa, ut perperam nobis
   impingunt; sed debeo credere peccata mihi credenti et poenitenti, juxta
   promissionem factam credentibus et poenitentibus, remissum iri
   certissime, quæ postea actu secundari et reflexo ex sensu fidei credo
   mihi esse remissa."

   The second objection was answered by distinguishing between the direct
   and the reflex act of faith. By the direct act of faith we embrace
   Christ as our Saviour; by the reflex act, arising out of the
   consciousness of believing, we believe that He loved us and died for
   us, and that nothing can ever separate us from his love. These two acts
   are inseparable, not only as cause and effect, antecedent and
   consequent; but they are not separated in time, or in the consciousness
   of the believer. They are only different elements of the complex act of
   accepting Christ as He is offered in the Gospel. We cannot separate the
   joy and gratitude with which a great favour is accepted. Although a
   psychological analysis might resolve these emotions into the effects of
   the act of acceptance, they belong, as revealed in consciousness, to
   the very nature of the act. It is a cordial and grateful acceptance of
   a promise made to all who embrace it. If a general promise of pardon be
   made to criminals on the condition of the confession of guilt, every
   one of their number who makes the confession knows or believes that the
   promise is made to him. On this point the early Reformed and Lutheran
   theologians were agreed in teaching that when the sinner exercises
   saving faith. He believes that for Christ's sake he is pardoned and
   accepted of God. In other words, that Christ loved him and gave Himself
   for him. We have already seen that the "Heidelberg Catechism," [128]
   the symbolical book of so large a portion of the Reformed Church,
   declared saving faith to be "Certa fiducia, a Spiritu Sancto per
   evangelium in corde meo accensa, qua in Deo acquiesco, certo statuens,
   non solum aliis, sed mihi quoque remissionem peccatorum æternam,
   justitiam et vitam donatam esse idque gratis, ex Dei misericordia,
   propter unius Christi meritum." In the "Apology of the Augsburg
   Confession of the Lutheran Church" it is said, [129] "Nos præter illam
   fidem [fidem generalem] requirimus, ut credat sibi quisque remitti
   peccata." Calvin says, [130] "Gratiæ promissione opus est, qua nobis
   testificetur se propitium esse Patrem: quando nec aliter ad eum
   appropinquare possumus, et in eam solam reclinare cor hominis
   potest. . . . . Nunc justa fidei definitio nobis constabit, si dicamus
   esse divinæ erga nos benevolentiæ firmam certamque cognitionem, quæ
   gratuitæ in Christo promissionis veritate fundata, per Spiritum Sanctum
   et revelatur mentibus nostris et cordibus obsignatur." "Hic præcipuus
   fidei cardo vertitur, ne quas Dominus offert misericordiæ promissiones,
   extra nos tantum veras esse arbitremur, in nobis minime: sed ut potius
   eas intus complectendo nostras faciamus. . . . . In summa, vere fidelis
   non est nisi qui solida persuasione Deum sibi propitium benevolumque
   patrem esse persuasus, de ejus benignitate omnia sibi pollicetur: nisi
   qui divinæ erga se benevolentiæ promissionibus fretus, indubitatam
   salutis expectationem præsumit."

   This is strong language. The doctrine, however, is not that faith
   implies assurance. The question concerns the nature of the object seen,
   not the clearness of the vision; what it is that the soul believes, not
   the strength of its faith. This Calvin himself elsewhere beautifully
   expresses, saying, "When the least drop of faith is instilled into our
   minds, we begin to see the serene and placid face of our reconciled
   Father; far off and on high, it may be, but still it is seen." A man in
   a dungeon may see only a ray of light streaming through a crevice. This
   is very different from broad daylight. Nevertheless, what he sees is
   light. So what the penitent sinner believes is, that God for Christ's
   sake is reconciled to him. It may be with a very dim and doubtful
   vision, he apprehends that truth; but that is the truth on which his
   trust is stayed.

   Proof of this Doctrine.

   This is involved in the appropriation of the general promise of the
   Gospel. The Scriptures declare that God is love; that He set forth his
   Son to be a propitiation for sin; that in Him He is reconciled; that He
   will receive all who come to Him through Christ. To appropriate these
   general declarations, is to believe that they are true, not only in
   relation to others, but to ourselves that God is reconciled to us. We
   have no right to exclude ourselves. This self-exclusion is unbelief. It
   is refusing to take of the waters of life, freely offered to all.

   Galatians ii. 20.

   Accordingly the Apostle in Galatians ii. 20, says, "The life which I
   now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved
   me, and gave Himself for me." The object of the Apostle's faith,
   therefore, the truths which he believed, and faith in which gave life
   to his soul, were, (1.) That Christ is the Son of God; (2.) That He
   loved him; (3.) That He gave Himself for him. The faith by which a
   believer lives, is not specifically different in its nature or object
   from the faith required of every man in order to his salvation. The
   life of faith is only the continued repetition, it may be with ever
   increasing strength and clearness, of those exercises by which we first
   receive Christ, in all his fuiness and in all his offices, as our God
   and Saviour. "Qui fit ut vivamus Christi fide? quia nos dilexit, et se
   ipsum tradidit pro nobis. Amor, inquam, quo nos complexus est Christus,
   fecit ut se nobis coadunaret. Id implevit morte sua nam se ipsum
   tradendo pro nobis, non secus atque in persona nostra passus
   est. . . . . Neque parum energiæ habet pro me: quia non satis fuerit
   Christum pro mundi salute mortuum reputare, nisi sibi quisque effectum
   ac possessionem hujus gratiæ privatim vindicet." [131]

   It is objected to this view of the case that by the "love of God," or
   "of Christ," in the above statement, is not meant the general
   benevolence or philanthropy of God, but his special, electing, and
   saving love. When Paul said he lived by the faith of Christ who loved
   him, and gave Himself for him, he meant something more than that Christ
   loved all men and therefore him among the rest. He evidently believed
   himself to be a special object of the Saviour's love. It was this
   conviction which gave power to his faith. And a like conviction enters
   into the faith of every true believer. But to this it is objected that
   faith must have a divine revelation for its object. But there is no
   revelation of God's special love to individuals, and, therefore, no
   individual has any Scriptural ground to believe that Christ loved him,
   and gave Himself for him. Whatever force there may be in this
   objection, it bears against Paul's declaration and experience. He
   certainly did believe that Christ loved him and died for him. It will
   not do to say that this was a conclusion drawn from his own experience;
   or to assume that the Apostle argued himself into the conviction that
   Christ loved him. Christ specially loves all who believe upon Him. I
   believe upon Him. Therefore Christ specially loves me. But a conclusion
   reached by argument is not an object of faith. Faith must rest on the
   testimony of God. It must be, therefore, that God in some way testifies
   to the soul that it is the object of his love. This he does in two
   ways. First, by the general invitations and promises of the Gospel. The
   act of appropriating, or of accepting these promises, is to believe
   that they belong to us as well as to others. Secondly, by the inward
   witness of the Spirit. Paul says (Rom. v. 5), "The love of God is shed
   abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us." That
   is, the Holy Ghost convinces us that we are the objects of God's love.
   This is done, not only by the various manifestations of his love in
   providence and redemption, but by his inward dealings with the soul.
   "He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him,
   and will manifest myself to him." (John xiv. 21). This manifestation is
   not outward through the word. It is inward. God has fellowship or
   intercourse with the souls of his people. The Spirit calls forth our
   love to God, and reveals his love to us. Again, in Romans viii. 16, the
   Apostle says, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that
   we are the children of God." This does not mean that the Spirit excites
   in us filial feelings toward God, from whence we infer that we are his
   children. The Apostle refers to two distinct sources of evidence of our
   adoption. The one is that we can call God Father; the other, the
   testimony of the Spirit. The latter is joined with the former. The word
   is summarturei, unites in testifying. Hence we are said to be sealed,
   not only marked and secured, but assured by the Spirit; and the Spirit
   is a pledge, an assurance, that we are, and ever shall be, the objects
   of God's saving love. (Eph. i. 13, 14; iv. 30. 2 Cor. i. 22.)

   This is not saying that a man must believe that he is one of the elect.
   Election is a secret purpose of God. The election of any particular
   person is not revealed, and, therefore, is not an object of faith. It
   is a thing to be proved, or made sure, as the Apostle Peter says, by
   the fruits of the Spirit. All that the doctrine of the Reformers on
   this subject includes is, that the soul in committing itself to Christ
   does so as to one who loved it and died for its salvation. The woman
   healed by touching our Saviour's garment, believed that she was an
   object of his compassionate love, because all who touched Him with
   faith were included in that number. Her faith included that conviction.

   § 8. Effects of Faith.

   Union with Christ.

   The first effect of faith, according to the Scriptures, is union with
   Christ. We are in Him by faith. There is indeed a federal union between
   Christ and his people, founded on the covenant of redemption between
   the Father and the Son in the counsels of eternity. We are, therefore,
   said to be in Him before the foundation of the world. It is one of the
   promises of that covenant, that all whom the Father had given the Son
   should come to Him; that his people should be made willing in the day
   of his power. Christ has, therefore, been exalted to the right hand of
   God, to give repentance and the remission of sins. But it was also, as
   we learn from the Scriptures, included in the stipulations of that
   covenant, that his people, so far as adults are concerned, should not
   receive the saving benefits of that covenant until they were united to
   Him by a voluntary act of faith. They are "by nature the children of
   wrath, even as others." (Eph. ii. 8.) They remain in this state of
   condemnation until they believe. Their union is consummated by faith.
   To be in Christ, and to believe in Christ, are, therefore, in the
   Scriptures convertible forms of expression. They mean substantially the
   same thing and, therefore, the same effects are attributed to faith as
   are attributed to union with Christ.

   Justification an Effect of Faith.

   The proximate effect of this union, and, consequently, the see. ond
   effect of faith, is justification. We are "justified by the faith of
   Christ." (Gal. ii. 16.) "There is therefore now no condemnation to them
   which are in Christ Jesus." (Rom. vii. 1.) "He that believeth on him is
   not condemned." (John iii. 18.) Faith is the condition on which God
   promises in the covenant of redemption, to impute unto men the
   righteousness of Christ. As soon, therefore, as they believe, they
   cannot be condemned. They are clothed with a righteousness which
   answers all the demands of justice. "Who shall lay anything to the
   charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that
   condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again,
   who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for
   us." (Rom. viii. 33, 34.)

   Participation of Christ's Life an Effect of Faith.

   The third effect of faith, or of union with Christ, is a participation
   of his life. Those united with Christ, the Apostle teaches (Rom. vi.
   4-10), so as to be partakers of his death, are partakers also of his
   life. "Because I live, ye shall live also." (John xiv. 19.) Christ
   dwells in our hearts by faith. (Eph. iii. 17.) Christ is in us. (Rom.
   viii. 10.) It is not we that live, but Christ liveth in us. (Gal. ii.
   20.) Our Lord's illustration of this vital union is derived from a vine
   and its branches. (John xv. 1-6.) As the life of the vine is diffused
   through the branches, and as they live only as connected with the vine,
   so the life of Christ is diffused through his people, and they are
   partakers of spiritual and eternal life, only in virtue of their union
   with Him. Another familiar illustration of this subject is derived from
   the human body. The members derive their life from the head, and perish
   if separated from it. (Eph. i. 22; 1 Cor. xii. 12-27, and often). In
   Ephesians iv. 15, 16, the Apostle carries out this illustration in
   detail. "The head, even Christ: from whom the whole body fitly joined
   together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according
   to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase
   of the body unto the edifying of itself in love." As the principle of
   animal life located in the head, through the complicated yet ordered
   system of nerves extending to every member, diffuses life and energy
   through the whole body; so the Holy Spirit, given without measure to
   Christ the head of the Church, which is his body, diffuses life and
   strength to every member. Hence, according to Scripture, Christ's
   dwelling in us is explained as the Spirit's dwelling in us. The
   indwelling of the Spirit is the indwelling of Christ. If God be in you;
   if Christ be in you; if the Spirit be in you, -- all mean the same
   thing. See Romans viii. 9-11.

   To explain this vital and mystical union between Christ and his people
   as a mere union of thought and feeling, is utterly inadmissible. (1.)
   In the first place, it is contrary to the plain meaning of his words.
   No one ever speaks of Plato's dwelling in men; of his being their life,
   so that without him they can do nothing; and much less, so that
   holiness, happiness, and eternal life depend upon that union. (2.) Such
   interpretation supposes that our relation to Christ is analogous to the
   relation of one man to another. Whereas it is a relation between men
   and a divine person, who has life in Himself, and gives life to as many
   as He wills. (3.) It ignores all that the Scriptures teach of the work
   of the Holy Spirit and of his dwelling in the hearts of men. (4.) It
   overlooks the supernatural character of Christianity, and would reduce
   it to a mere philosophical and ethical system.

   Peace as the Fruit of Faith.

   The fourth effect of faith is peace. "Being justified by faith, we have
   peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ." (Rom. v. 1.) Peace
   arises from a sense of reconciliation. God promises to pardon, to
   receive into his favour, and finally to save all who believe the record
   which He has given of his Son. To believe, is therefore to believe this
   promise; and to appropriate this promise to ourselves is to believe
   that God is reconciled to us. This faith may be weak or strong. And the
   peace which flows from it may be tremulous and intermitting, or it may
   be constant and assured.

   Assurance.

   To make assurance of personal salvation essential to faith, is contrary
   to Scripture and to the experience of God's people. The Bible speaks of
   a weak faith. It abounds with consolations intended for the doubting
   and the desponding. God accepts those who can only say, "Lord, I
   believe; help thou mine unbelief." Those who make assurance the essence
   of faith, generally reduce faith to a mere intellectual assent. They
   are often censorious, refusing to recognize as brethren those who do
   not agree with them, and sometimes they are antinomian.

   At the same time, Scripture and experience teach that assurance is not
   only attainable, but a privilege and a duty. There may indeed be
   assurance, where there is no true faith at all; but where there is true
   faith, the want of assurance is to be referred either to the weakness
   of faith, or to erroneous views of the plan of salvation. Many sincere
   believers are too introspective. They look too exclusively within, so
   that their hope is graduated by the degree of evidence of regeneration
   which they find in their own experience. This, except in rare cases,
   can never lead to the assurance of hope. We may examine our hearts with
   all the microscopic care prescribed by President Edwards in his work on
   "The Religious Affections," and never be satisfied that we have
   eliminated every ground of misgiving and doubt. The grounds of
   assurance are not so much within, as without us. They are, according to
   Scripture, (1.) The universal and unconditional promise of God that
   those who come to Him in Christ, He will in no wise cast out; that
   whosoever will, may take of the water of life without money and without
   price. We are bound to be assured that God is faithful and will
   certainly save those who believes (2.) The infinite, immutable, and
   gratuitous love of God. In the first ten verses of the fifth chapter of
   the Epistle to the Romans, and in the eighth chapter of that epistle
   from the thirty-first verse to the end, the Apostle dwells on these
   characteristics of the love of God, as affording an immovable
   foundation of the believer's hope. (3.) The infinite merit of the
   satisfaction of Christ, and the prevalence of his continued
   intercession. Paul, in Romans viii. 34, especially emphasizes these
   points. (4.) The covenant of redemption in which it is promised that
   all given by the Father to the Son, shall come to Him, and that none of
   them shall be lost. (5.) From the witness of the Spirit, Paul says, "We
   . . . . rejoice in hope of the glory of God," because the love of God
   is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost given unto us. That is,
   the Holy Ghost assures us that we are the objects of that love which he
   goes on to describe as infinite, immutable, and gratuitous. (Rom. v.
   3-5.) And again, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit
   that we are the children of God." If, therefore, any true believer
   lacks the assurance of faith, the fault is in himself and not in the
   plan of salvation, or in the promises of God.

   Sanctification a Fruit of Faith.

   The fifth effect of faith is sanctification. "Which are sanctified,"
   says our Lord "by faith that is in me." Although in this verse (Acts
   xxvi. 18), the words "by faith" do not qualify the preceding clause,
   "are sanctified," alone, but are to be referred to all the preceding
   particulars, illumination, deliverance from Satan, forgiveness of sins,
   and the eternal inheritance, yet the immediate antecedent is not to be
   omitted. We are sanctified by faith as is elsewhere clearly taught.
   "Faith which worketh by love and purifies the heart." (Gal. v. 6, and
   Acts xv. 9.)

   The relation of faith to sanctification is thus set forth in the
   Scriptures, --

   1. We are justified by faith. So long as we are under the law, we are
   under the curse, and bring forth fruit unto death. There is, and can be
   no love to God, and no holy living until we are delivered from his
   wrath due to us for sin. We are freed from the law, delivered from its
   condemnation, by the body or death of Christ. It is by faith in Him as
   the end of the law for righteousness, that we personally are freed from
   condemnation and restored to the favour of God. See all this clearly
   taught in Romans vi., and in the first six verses of the seventh
   chapter. It is thus by faith we pass from judicial death to judicial
   life, or justification. This is the first and indispensable step of
   sanctification so far as it reveals itself in the consciousness of the
   believer.

   2. It is by faith that we receive the indwelling of the Spirit. Christ
   (or the Spirit of Christ) dwells in our hearts by faith. Faith is the
   indispensable condition (so far as adults are concerned) of this
   indwelling of the Spirit. And the indwelling of the Spirit is the
   source of all spiritual life. Faith is indeed the fruit of the Spirit,
   and therefore the gift of the Spirit must precede the exercise of
   faith. It is nevertheless true that faith is the condition of the
   indwelling of the Spirit, and consequently of spiritual life. Life must
   precede breathing, and yet breathing is the necessary condition of
   living.

   3. Faith is not only the condition of the Spirit's dwelling in us as
   the source of spiritual life, but we live by faith. That is, the
   continuance and exercise of spiritual life involve and suppose the
   constant exercise of faith. We live by exercising faith in God, in his
   attributes, in his providence, in his promises, and in all the truths
   which He has revealed. Especially is this life sustained by those
   exercises of faith of which Christ is the object; his divine and
   mysteriously constituted person, as God manifest in the flesh his
   finished work for our redemption; his constant intercession; his
   intimate relation to us not only as our prophet, priest, and king, but
   as our living head in whom our life is hid in God, and from whom it
   flows into our souls. We are thus sanctified by faith, because it is
   through faith that all the religious affections and all the activities
   of spiritual life are called into exercise.

   4. We are sanctified by faith, as it is the substance of things hoped
   for, and the evidence of things not seen. "The things of God," the
   truths which He has revealed concerning the spiritual and eternal world
   exist for us while in this world, only as the objects of faith. But
   faith is to the soul what the eye is to the body. It enables us to see
   the things unseen and eternal. It gives them substance, reality, and
   therefore power, -- power in some little measure in proportion to their
   value. Thus the things seen and temporal lose their dominant power over
   the soul. They are not worthy to be compared with the things which God
   has prepared for them that love Him. The believer, -- the ideal, and at
   times the actual believer, as we learn from Scripture and from history,
   is raised above the things of time and sense, overcomes the world, and
   becomes heavenly minded. He lives in heaven, breathes its atmosphere,
   is pervaded by its spirit, and has a prelibation of its joys. This
   renders him pure, spiritual, humble, self-denying, laborious, meek,
   gentle, forgiving, as well as firm and courageous. The whole of the
   eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews is devoted to the
   illustration of the power of faith especially in this aspect. The
   Apostle shows that in times past, even under the dim light of the
   former dispensation, it enabled Noah to stand alone against the world,
   Abraham to offer up his only son, Moses to prefer the reproach of
   Christ to the treasures of Egypt; that others through faith subdued
   kingdoms, wrought righteousness, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched
   the violence of fire; that others were by faith made strong out of
   weakness, waxed valiant in fight; that others submitted to the trial of
   cruel mockings and scourgings that others by faith endured to be
   stoned, sawn asunder, or slain with the sword; and that yet others
   through faith consented to wander about in sheepskins and goatskins,
   destitute, afflicted, and tormented. All these, we are told, through
   faith obtained a good report.

   5. Faith sanctifies because it is the necessary condition of the
   efficacy of the means of grace. It is through the Word, sacraments, and
   prayer, that God communicates constant supplies of grace. They are the
   means of calling the activities of spiritual life into exercise. But
   these means of grace are inoperative unless they are received and used
   by faith. Faith does not, indeed, give them their power, but it is the
   condition on which the Spirit of God renders them efficacious.

   That good works are the certain effects of faith is included in the
   doctrine that we are sanctified by faith. For it is impossible that
   there should be inward holiness, love, spirituality, brotherly
   kindness, and zeal, without an external manifestation of these graces
   in the whole outward life. Faith, therefore, without works, is dead. We
   are saved by faith. But salvation includes deliverance from sin. If,
   therefore, our faith does not deliver us from sin, it does not save us.
   Antinomianism involves a contradiction in terms.

   Certainty of Salvation.

   A sixth effect attributed to faith in the Scriptures is security, or,
   certainty of salvation. "God so loved the world, that he gave his only
   begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
   have everlasting life." (John iii. 16.) "He that heareth my word, and
   believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not
   come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life." (John v.
   24.) "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat
   of this bread, he shall live forever." (John vi. 51.) "All that the
   Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in
   no wise cast out. . . . . And this is the will of him that sent me,
   that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have
   everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day." (John vi.
   37, 40.) "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them. and they follow me:
   and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither
   shall any man pluck them out of my hand." (John x. 27, 28.)

   The Eighth Chapter of Romans.

   The whole of the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans is
   designed to prove the certain salvation of all who believe. The
   proposition to be established is, that there is "no condemnation to
   them which are in Christ Jesus." That is, they can never perish; they
   can never be so separated from Christ as to come into condemnation. The
   Apostle's first argument to establish that proposition, is, that
   believers are delivered from the law by the sacrifice of Christ. The
   believer, therefore, is not under the law which condemns, as Paul had
   before said (Rom. vi. 14), "Ye are not under the law, but under grace."
   But if not under the law he cannot be condemned. The law has had its
   course, and found full satisfaction in the work of Christ, who is the
   end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth. He
   renders every one righteous, in the sight of the law, who believes on
   Him. This is the first reason which the Apostle gives why those who are
   in Christ shall never be condemned.

   His second argnment is that they have already within them the principle
   of eternal life. That principle is the Spirit of God; "the life-giving"
   as He was designated by the ancient Church. To be carnally minded is
   death. To be spiritually minded is life and peace. Sin is death;
   holiness is life. It is a contradiction to say that those in whom the
   Spirit of life dwells, should die. And, therefore, the Apostle says,
   Although the body dies, the soul lives. And if the Spirit of Him who
   raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, He that raised up Christ
   from the dead shall also quicken even your mortal bodies by his Spirit
   that dwelleth in you. The indwelling of the Spirit, therefore, secures
   not only the life of the soul, but also the ultimate and glorious life
   of the body.

   The third argument for the security of believers, is, that they are the
   sons of God. As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons
   of God. That is, they are partakers of his nature, the special objects
   of his love, and entitled to the inheritance which He gives. If sons
   then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. According to the
   Apostle's mode of thinking, that any of the sons of God should perish,
   is impossible. If sons they shall certainly be saved.

   The fourth argument is from the purpose of God. Those whom He has
   predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son, them He calls to
   the exercise of faith and repentance; and whom He thus calls He
   justifies, He provides for them and imputes to them a righteousness
   which satisfies the demands of the law, and which entitles them in
   Christ and for his sake to eternal life; and those whom He justifies He
   glorifies. There is no flaw in this chain. If men were predestinated to
   eternal life on the ground of their repenting and believing through
   their own strength, or through a cooperation with the grace of God
   which others fail to exercise, then their continuance in a state of
   grace might be dependent on themselves. But if faith and repentance are
   the gifts of God, the results of his effectual vocation, then bestowing
   those gifts is a revelation of the purpose of God to save those to whom
   they are given. It is an evidence that God has predestinated them to be
   conformed to the image of his Son, i.e., to be like Him in character,
   destiny, and glory, and that He will infallibly carry out his purpose.
   No one can pluck them out of his hands.

   Paul's fifth argument is from the love of God. As stated above, [132]
   the Apostle argues from the greatness, the freeness, and the
   immutability of that love that its objects never can be lost. "He that
   spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he
   not with him also freely give us all things." If He has done the
   greater, will He not do the less? If he gave even his own Son, will He
   not give us faith to receive and constancy to persevere even unto the
   end? A love so great as the love of God to his people cannot fail of
   its object. This love is also gratuitous. It is not founded on the
   attractiveness of its objects. He loved us "while we were yet sinners;"
   "when we were enemies." "Much more, then, being now justified by his
   blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. For if, when we were
   enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more,
   being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life." God's love in this
   aspect is compared to parental love. A mother does not love her child
   because it is lovely. Her love leads her to do all she can to render it
   attractive and to keep it so. So the love of God, being in like manner
   mysterious, unaccountable by anything in its objects, secures his
   adorning his children with the graces of his Spirit, and arraying them
   in all the beauty of holiness. It is only the lamentable mistake that
   God loves us for our goodness, that can lead any one to suppose that
   his love is dependent on our self-sustained attractiveness, when we
   should look to his fatherly love as the source of all goodness, and the
   ground of the assurance that He will not allow Satan or our own evil
   hearts to destroy the lineaments of his likeness which He has impressed
   upon our souls. Having loved his own, He loves them to the end. And
   Christ prays for them that their faith may not fail.

   It must be remembered that what the Apostle argues to prove is not
   merely the certainty of the salvation of those that believe but their
   certain perseverance in holiness. Salvation in sin, according to Paul's
   system, is a contradiction in terms. This perseverance in holiness is
   secured partly by the inward secret influence of the Spirit, and partly
   by all the means adapted to secure that end -- instructions,
   admonitions, exhortations, warnings, the means of grace, and the
   dispensations of his providence. Having, through love, determined on
   the end, He has determined on the means for its accomplishment.

   The sixth argument of the Apostle is that, as the love of God is
   infinitely great and altogether gratuitous, it is also immutable, and,
   therefore, believers shall certainly be saved. Hence the conclusion, "I
   am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
   principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
   height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us
   from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."

   It will be seen that the Apostle does not rest the perseverance of the
   saints on the indestructible nature of faith, or on the imperishable
   nature of the principle of grace in the heart, or on the constancy of
   the believer's will, but solely on what is out of ourselves.
   Perseverance, he teaches us, is due to the purpose of God, to the work
   of Christ, to the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and to the primal
   source of all, the infinite, mysterious, and immutable love of God. We
   do not keep ourselves; we are kept by the power of God, through faith
   unto salvation. (1 Peter i. 5.)

CHAPTER XVII.

  JUSTIFICATION
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Symbolical Statement of the Doctrine.

   Justification is defined in the Westminster Catechism, "An act of God's
   free grace, wherein He pardoneth all our sins, and accepteth us as
   righteous in his sight, only for the righteousness of Christ imputed to
   us, and received by faith alone."

   The Heidelberg Catechism in answer to the question, "How dost thou
   become righteous before God?" answers, "Sola fide in Jesum Christum,
   adeo ut licet mea me conscientia accuset, quod adversus omnia mandata
   Dei graviter peccaverim, nec ullum eorum servaverim, adhæc etiamnum ad
   omne malum propensus sim, nihilominus tamen (modo hæc beneficia vera
   animi fiducia amplectar), sine ullo meo merito, ex mera Dei
   misericordia, mihi perfecta satisfactio, justitia, et sanctitas
   Christi, imputetur ac donetur; perinde ac si nec ullum ipse peccatum
   admisissem, nec ulla mihi labes inhæreret; imo vero quasi eam
   obedientiam, quam pro me Christus præstitit, ipse perfecte
   præstitissem." And in answer to the question, Why faith alone
   justifies? it says. "Non quod dignitate meæ fidei Deo placeam, sed quod
   sola satisfactio, justitia ac sanctitas Christi, mea justitia sit coram
   Deo. Ego vero eam non alia ratione, quam fide amplecti, et mihi
   applicare queam."

   The Second Helvetic Confession, [133] says "Justificare significat
   Apostolo in disputatione de justificatione, peccata remittere, a culpa
   et poena absolvere, in gratiam recipere, et justum pronunciare. Etenim
   ad Romanos dicit apostolus, Deus est, qui justificat, quis ille, qui
   condemnet?' opponuntur justificare et condemnare. . . . . Etenim
   Christus peccata mundi in se recepit et sustulit, divinæque justitiæ
   satisfecit. Deus ergo propter solum Christum passum et resuscitatum,
   propitius est peccatis nostris, nec illa nobis imputat, imputat autem
   justitiam Christi pro nostra: ita ut jam simus non solum mundati a
   peccatis et purgati, vel sancti, sed etiam donati justitia Christi,
   adeoque absoluti a peccatis, morte vel condemnatione, justi denique ac
   hæredes vitæ æternæ. Proprie ergo loquendo, Deus solus nos justificat,
   et duntaxat propter Christum justificat, non imputans nobis peccata,
   sed imputans ejus nobis justitiam." [134]

   These are the most generally received and authoritative standards of
   the Reformed Churches, with which all other Reformed symbols agree. The
   Lutheran confessions teach precisely the same doctrine on this subject.
   [135] "Unanimi consensu, docemus et confitemur. . . . . quod homo
   peccator coram Deo justificetur, hoc est, absolvatur ab omnibus suis
   peccatis et a judicio justissimæ condemnationis, et adoptetur in
   numerum filiorum Dei atque hæres æternæ vitæ scribatur, sine ullis
   nostris meritis, aut dignitate, et absque ullis præcedentibus,
   præsentibus, aut sequentibus nostris operibus, ex mera gratia,
   tantummodo propter unicum meritum, perfectissimam obedientiam,
   passionem acerbissimam, mortem et resurrectionem Domini nostri, Jesu
   Christi, cujus obedientia nobis ad justitiam imputatur." [136]

   Again, "Credimus, docemus, et confitemur, hoc ipsum nostram esse coram
   Deo justitiam, quod Dominus nobis peccata remittit, ex mera gratia,
   absque ullo respectu præcedentium, præsentium, aut consequentium
   nostrorum operum, dignitatis, aut meriti. Ille enim donat atque imputat
   nobis justitiam obedientiæ Christi; propter eam justitiam a Deo in
   gratiam recipimur et justi reputamur." [137] "Justificari significat
   hic non ex impio justum effici, sed usu forensi justum pronuntiari."
   And "Justificare hoc loco (Rom. v. 1.) forensi cousuetudine significat
   reum absolvere et pronuntiare justum, sed propter alienam justitiam,
   videlicet Christi, quæ aliena justitia communicatur nobis per fidem."
   [138] So also "Vocabulum justificationis in hoc negotio significat
   justum pronuntiare, a peccatis et æternis peccatorum suppliciis
   absolvere, propter justitiam Christi, quæ a Deo fidei imputatur." [139]

   Hase, [140] concisely states the Lutheran doctrine on this subject in
   these words: "Justificatio est actus forensis, quo Deus, sola gratia
   ductus, peccatori, propter Christi meritum fide apprehensum, justitiam
   Christi imputat, peccata remittit, eumque sibi reconciliat."

   The" Form of Concord" says, "Hic articulus, de justitia fidei,
   præcipuus est (ut Apologia loquitur) in tota doctrina Christiana, sine
   quo conscientiæ perturbatæ nullam veram et firmam consolationem habere,
   aut divitias gratiæ Christi recte agnoscere possunt. Id D. Lutherus suo
   etiam testimonio confirmavit, cum inquit: Si unicus his articulus
   sincerus permanserit, etiam Christiana Ecclesia sincera, concors et
   sine omnibus sectis permanet: sin vero corrumpitur, impossibile est, ut
   uni errori aut fanatico spiritui recte obviam iri possit." [141] The
   Lutheran theologians, therefore, speak of it as the "akropolis totius
   Christianæ religionis, ac nexus, quo omnia corporis doctrinæ Christianæ
   membra continentur, quoque rupto solvuntur." [142]

   President Edwards.

   This statement of the doctrine of justification has retained symbolical
   authority in the Lutheran and Reformed churches, to the present day.
   President Edwards, who is regarded as having initiated certain
   departures from some points of the Reformed faith, was firm in his
   adherence to this view of justification, which he held to be of vital
   importance. In his discourse on "Justification by Faith alone," he thus
   defines justification: "A person is said to be justified when he is
   approved of God as free from the guilt of sin and its deserved
   punishment; and as having that righteousness belonging to him that
   entitles to the reward of life. That we should take the word in such a
   sense and understand it as the judge's accepting a person as having
   both a negative and positive righteousness belonging to him, and
   looking on him therefore as not only quit or free from any obligation
   to punishment, but also as just and righteous, and so entitled to a
   positive reward, is not only most agreeable to the etymology and
   natural import of the word, which signifies to make righteous, or to
   pass one for righteous in judgment, but also manifestly agreeable to
   the force of the word as used in Scripture." He then shows how it is,
   or why faith alone justifies. It is not on account of any virtue or
   goodness in faith, but as it unites us to Christ, and involves the
   acceptance of Him as our righteousness. Thus it is we are justified "by
   faith alone, without any manner of virtue or goodness of our own."

   The ground of justification is the righteousness of Christ imputed to
   the believer. "By that righteousness being imputed to us," says
   Edwards, "is meant no other than this, that that righteousness of
   Christ is accepted for us, and admitted instead of that perfect
   inherent righteousness that ought to be in ourselves: Christ's perfect
   obedience shall be reckoned to our account, so that we shall have the
   benefit of it, as though we had performed it ourselves: and so we
   suppose that a title to eternal life is given us as the reward of this
   righteousness. . . . The opposers of this doctrine suppose that there
   is an absurdity in it: they say that to suppose that God imputes
   Christ's obedience to us, is to suppose that God is mistaken, and
   thinks that we performed that obedience that Christ performed. But why
   cannot that righteousness be reckoned to our account, and be accepted
   for us, without any such absurdity? Why is there any more absurdity in
   it, than in a merchant's transferring debt or credit from one man's
   account to another, when one man pays a price for another, so that it
   shall be accepted, as if that other had paid it? Why is there any more
   absurdity in supposing that Christ's obedience is imputed to us, than
   that his satisfaction is imputed? If Christ has suffered the penalty of
   the law for us, and in our stead, then it will follow, that his
   suffering that penalty is imputed to us, i.e., that it is accepted for
   us, and in our stead, and is reckoned to our account, as though we had
   suffered it. But why may not his obeying the law of God be as
   rationally reckoned to our account, as his suffering the penalty of the
   law?" [143]

   Points included in the above Statement of the Doctrine.

   According to the above statements, justification is, --

   1. An act, and not, as sanctification, a continued and progressive
   work.

   2. It is an act of grace to the sinner. In himself he deserves
   condemnation when God justifies him.

   3. As to the nature of the act, it is, in the first place, not an
   efficient act, or an act of power. It does not produce any subjective
   change in the person justified. It does not effect a change of
   character, making those good who were bad, those holy who were unholy.
   That is done in regeneration and sanctification. In the second place,
   it is not a mere executive act, as when a sovereign pardons a criminal,
   and thereby restores him to his civil rights, or to his former status
   in the commonwealth. In the third place, it is a forensic, or judicial
   act, the act of a judge, not of a sovereign. That is, in the case of
   the sinner, or, in foro Dei, it is an act of God not in his character
   of sovereign, but in his character of judge. It is a declarative act in
   which God pronounces the sinner just or righteous, that is, declares
   that the claims of justice, so far as he is concerned, are satisfied,
   so that he cannot be justly condemned, but is in justice entitled to
   the reward promised or due to perfect righteousness.

   4. The meritorious ground of justification is not faith; we are not
   justified on account of our faith, considered as a virtuous ot holy act
   or state of mind. Nor are our works of any kind the ground of
   justification. Nothing done by us or wrought in us satisfies the
   demands of justice, or can be the ground or reason of the declaration
   that justice as far as it concerns us is satisfied. The ground of
   justification is the righteousness of Christ, active and passive, i.e.,
   including his perfect obedience to the law as a covenant, and his
   enduring the penalty of the law in our stead and on our behalf.

   5. The righteousness of Christ is in justification imputed to the
   believer. That is, is set to his account, so that he is entitled to
   plead it at the bar of God, as though it were personally and inherently
   his own.

   6. Faith is the condition of justification. That is, so far an adults
   are concerned, God does not impute the righteousness of Christ to the
   sinner, until and unless, he (through grace) receives and rests on
   Christ alone for his salvation.

   That such is the doctrine of the Reformed and Lutheran churches on this
   important doctrine, cannot be disputed. The statements of the standards
   of those churches are so numerous, explicit, and discriminating as to
   preclude all reasonable doubt on this subject. That such is the
   doctrine of the Word of God appears from the following considerations.

   It will not be necessary to discuss all the points above specified
   separately, as some of them are necessarily included in others. The
   following propositions include all the essential points of the
   doctrine.

   § 2. Justification is a Forensic Act.

   By this the Reformers intended, in the first place, to deny the Romish
   doctrine of subjective justification. That is, that justification
   consists in an act or agency of God making the sinner subjectively
   holy. Romanists confound or unite justification and sanctification.
   They define justification as "the remission of sin and infusion of new
   habits of grace." By remission of sin they mean not simply pardon, but
   the removal of everything of the nature of sin from the soul.
   Justification, therefore, with them, is purely subjective, consisting
   in the destruction of sin and the infusion of holiness. In opposition
   to this doctrine, the Reformers maintained that by justification the
   Scriptures mean something different from sanctification. That the two
   gifts, although inseparable, are distinct, and that justification,
   instead of being an efficient act changing the inward character of the
   sinner, is a declarative act, announcing and determining his relation
   to the law and justice of God.

   In the second place, the Symbols of the Reformation no less explicitly
   teach that justification is not simply pardon and restoration. It
   includes pardon, but it also includes a declaration that the believer
   is just or righteous in the sight of the law. He has a right to plead a
   righteousness which completely satisfies its demands.

   And, therefore, in the third place, affirmatively, those Symbols teach
   that justification is a judicial or forensic act, i.e., an act of God
   as judge proceeding according to law, declaring that the sinner is
   just, i.e., that the law no longer condemns him, but acquits and
   pronounces him to be entitled to eternal life.

   Here, as so often in other cases, the ambiguity of words is apt to
   create embarrassment. The Greek word dikaios and the English word
   righteous, have two distinct senses. They sometimes express moral
   character. When we say that God is righteous, we mean that He is right.
   He is free from any moral imperfection. So when we say that a man is
   righteous, we generally mean that he is upright and honest; that he is
   and does what he ought to be and do. In this sense the word expresses
   the relation which a man sustains to the rule of moral conduct. At
   other times, however, these words express, not moral character, but the
   relation which a man sustains to justice. In this sense a man is just
   with regard to whom justice is satisfied; or, against whom justice has
   no demands. The lexicons, therefore, tell us that dikaios sometimes
   means, leges observans; at others insons, culpa vacans (free from guilt
   or obligation to punishment) -- judicio Dei insons. Pilate (Matt.
   xxvii. 24) said, "I am innocent of the blood of this just person;"
   i.e., of this person who is tree from guilt; free from anything which
   justifies his condemnation to death. "Christ, also," says the Apostle,
   "hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust;" the innocent
   for the guilty. See Romans ii. 18; v. 19. "As by one man's disobedience
   many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made
   righteous." "As the predicate of judicandus in his relation to the
   judge, righteousness' expresses, not a positive virtue, but a judicial
   negative freedom from reatus. In the presence of his judge, he is tsryq
   who stands free from guilt and desert of punishment (straflos), either
   because he has contracted no guilt (as, e.g., Christ), or, because in
   the way demanded by the Judge (under the Old Testament by expiatory
   sacrifice) he has expiated the guilt contracted." [144] If, therefore,
   we take the word righteous in the former of the two senses above
   mentioned, when it expresses moral character, it would be a
   contradiction to say that God pronounces the sinner righteous. This
   would be equivalent to saying that God pronounces the sinner to be not
   a sinner, the wicked to be good, the unholy to be holy. But if we take
   the word in the sense in which the Scriptures so often use it, as
   expressing relation to justice, then when God pronounces the sinner
   righteous or just, He simply declares that his guilt is expiated, that
   justice is satisfied, that He has the righteousness which justice
   demands. This is precisely what Paul says, when he says that God
   "justifieth the ungodly." (Rom. iv. 5.) God does not pronounce the
   ungodly to be godly; He declares that notwithstanding his personal
   sinfulness and unworthiness, he is accepted as righteous on the ground
   of what Christ has done for him.

   Proof of the Doctrine just stated.

   That to justify means neither simply to pardon, nor to make inherently
   righteous or good is proved, --

   From the Usage of Scripture.

   1. By the uniform usage of the word to justify in Scripture it is never
   used in either of those senses, but always to declare or pronounce
   just. It is unnecessary to cite passages in proof of a usage which is
   uniform. The few following examples are enough. Deuteronomy xxv. 1, "If
   there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that
   the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and
   condemn the wicked." Exodus xxiii. 7, "I will not justify the wicked."
   Isaiah v. 23, "Which justify the wicked for reward." Proverbs xvii. 15,
   "He that justifieth the wicked" is "abomination to the Lord." Luke x.
   29, "He willing to justify himself." Luke xvi. 15, "Ye are they which
   justify yourselves before men." Matthew xi. 19, "Wisdom is justified of
   her children." Galatians ii. 16, "A man is not justified by the works
   of the law," v. 6, "Whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are
   fallen from grace." Thus men are said to justify God. Job xxxii. 2,
   "Because he justified himself, rather than God." Psalms li. 4, "That
   thou mightest be justified when thou speakest." Luke vii. 29, "All the
   people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God." The only
   passage in the New Testament where the word dikaioo is used in a
   different sense is Revelation xxii. 11, 6, ho dikaios, dikaiotheto eti,
   "He that is righteous, let him be righteous still." Here the first
   aorist passive appears to be used in a middle sense, Let him show
   himself righteous, or continue righteous.' Even if the reading in this
   passage were undoubted, this single case would have no force against
   the established usage of the word. The reading, however, is not merely
   doubtful, but it is, in the judgment of the majority of the critical
   editors, Tischendorf among the rest, incorrect. They give, as the true
   text, dikaiosunen poiesato eti. Even if this latter reading be, as De
   Wette thinks, a gloss, it shows that ho dikaios dikaiotheto eti was as
   intolerable to a Greek ear as the expression, He that is righteous, let
   him justify himself still,' would be to us.

   The usage of common life as to this word is just as uniform as that of
   the Bible. It would be a perfect solecism to say of a criminal whom the
   executive had pardoned, that he was justified, or that a reformed
   drunkard or thief was justified. The word always expresses a judgment,
   whether of the mind, as when one man justifies another for his conduct,
   or officially of a judge. If such be the established meaning of the
   word, it ought to settle all controversy as to the nature of
   justification. We are bound to take the words of Scripture in their
   true established sense. And, therefore, when the Bible says, "God
   justifies the believer," we are not at liberty to say that it means
   that He pardons, or that He sanctifies him. It means, and can mean only
   that He pronounces him just.

   Justification the Opposite of Condemnation.

   2. This is still further evident from the antithesis between
   condemnation and justification. Condemnation is not the opposite either
   of pardon or of reformation. To condemn is to pronounce guilty; or
   worthy of punishment. To justify is to declare not guilty; or that
   justice does not demand punishment; or that the person concerned cannot
   justly be condemned. When, therefore, the Apostle says (Rom. vii. 1),
   "There is therefore, now no condemnation to them which are in Christ
   Jesus," he declares that they are absolved from guilt; that the penalty
   of the law cannot justly be inflicted upon them. "Who," he asks, "shall
   lay anything to the charge of God's elect? God who justifieth? Who is
   he that condemneth? Christ who died?" (vers. 33, 34.) Against the elect
   in Christ no ground of condemnation can be presented. God pronounces
   them just, and therefore no one can pronounce them guilty.

   This passage is certainly decisive against the doctrine of subjective
   justification in any form. This opposition between condemnation and
   justification is familiar both in Scripture and in common life. Job ix.
   20, "If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me." xxxiv. 17,
   "And wilt thou condemn him that is most just." If to condemn does not
   mean to make wicked, to justify does not mean to make good. And if
   condemnation is a judicial, as opposed to an executive act, so is
   justification. In condemnation it is a judge who pronounces sentence on
   the guilty. In justification it is a judge who pronounces or who
   declares the person arraigned free from guilt and entitled to be
   treated as righteous.

   Argument from Equivalent Forms of Expression.

   3. The forms of expression which are used as equivalents of the word
   "justify" clearly determine the nature of the act. Thus Paul speaks of
   "the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness
   without works." (Rom. iv. 6.) To impute righteousness is not to pardon;
   neither is it to sanctify. It means to justify, i.e., to attribute
   righteousness. The negative form in which justification is described is
   equally significant. "Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,
   and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
   not impute sin." (Rom. iv. 7, 8.) As "to impute sin" never means and
   cannot mean to make wicked; so the negative statement "not to impute
   sin cannot mean to sanctify. And as "to impute sin" does mean to lay
   sin to one's account and to treat him accordingly; so to justify means
   to lay righteousness to one's account and treat him accordingly. "God
   sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world He that believeth
   on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned
   already." (John iii. 17, 18.)

   For "as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to
   condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came
   upon all men unto justification of life." (Rom. v. 18.) It was krima, a
   judicial sentence, which came on men for the offence of Adam, and it is
   a judicial sentence (justification, a dikaiosis) which comes for the
   righteousness of Christ, or, as is said in ver. 16 of the same chapter,
   it was a krima eis katakrima, a condemnatory sentence that came for one
   offence; and charisma eis dikaioma, a sentence of gratuitous
   justification from many offences. Language cannot be plainer. If a
   sentence of condemnation is a judicial act, then justification is a
   judicial act.

   Argument from the Statement of the Doctrine.

   4. The judicial character of justification is involved in the mode in
   which the doctrine is presented in the Bible. The Scriptures speak of
   law, of its demands, of its penalty, of sinner. as arraigned at the bar
   of God, of the day of judgment. The question is, How shall man be just
   with God? The answer to this question determines the whole method of
   salvation. The question is not, How a man can become holy? but, How can
   he become just? How can he satisfy the claims which justice has against
   him? It is obvious that if there is no such attribute as justice in
   God; if what we call justice is only benevolence, then there is no
   pertinency in this question. Man is not required to be just in order to
   be saved. There are no claims of justice to be satisfied. Repentance is
   all that need be rendered as the condition of restoration to the favour
   of God. Or, any didactic declaration or exhibition of God's
   disapprobation of sin, would open the way for the safe pardon of
   sinners. Or, if the demands of justice were easily satisfied; if
   partial, imperfect obedience and fatherly chastisements, or
   self-inflicted penances, would suffice to satisfy its claims, then the
   sinner need not be just with God in order to be saved. But the human
   soul knows intuitively that these are refugee of lies. It knows that
   there is such an attribute as justice. It knows that the demands
   thereof are inexorable because they are righteous. It knows that it
   cannot be saved unless it be justified, and it knows that it cannot be
   declared just unless the demands of justice are fully satisfied. Low
   views of the evil of sin and of the justice of God lie at the
   foundation of all false views of this great doctrine.

   The Apostle's Argument in the Epistle to the Romans.

   The Apostle begins the discussion of this subject by assuming that the
   justice of God, his purpose to punish all sin, to demand perfect
   conformity to his law, is revealed from heaven, i.e., so revealed that
   no man, whether Jew or Gentile, can deny it. (Rom. i. 18.) Men, even
   the most degraded pagans, know the righteous judgment of God that those
   who sin are worthy of death, (ver. 32.) He next proves that all men are
   sinners, and, being sinners are under condemnation. The whole world is
   "guilty before God." (iii. 19.) From this he infers, as intuitively
   certain (because plainly included in the premises), that no flesh
   living can be justified before God "by the deeds of the law," i.e., on
   the ground of his own character and conduct. If guilty he cannot be
   pronounced not guilty, or just. In Paul's argument, to justify is to
   pronounce just. Dikaios is the opposite of hupodikos (i.e., "reus,
   satisfactionem alteri debens"). That is, righteous is the opposite of
   guilty. To pronounce guilty is to condemn. To pronounce righteous,
   i.e., not guilty, is to justify. If a man denies the authority of
   Scripture; or if he feels at liberty, while holding what he considers
   the substance of Scripture doctrines, to reject the form, it is
   conceivable that he may deny that justification is a judicial act; but
   it seems impossible that any one should deny that it is so represented
   in the Bible. Some men professing to believe the Bible, deny that there
   is anything supernatural in the work of regeneration and
   sanctification. Being born of the Spirit;' quickened by the mighty
   power of God;' created anew in Christ Jesus,' are only, they say,
   strong oriental expressions for a self-wrought reformation. By a
   similar process it is easy to get rid, not only of the doctrine of
   justification as a judicial act, but of all other distinguishing
   doctrines of the Scriptures. This, however, is not to interpret, but to
   pervert.

   The Apostle, having taught that God is just, i.e., that He demands the
   satisfaction of justice, and that men are sinners and can render no
   such satisfaction themselves, announces that such a righteousness has
   been provided, and is revealed in the Gospel. It is not our own
   righteousness, which is of the law, but the righteousness of Christ,
   and, therefore, the righteousness of God, in virtue of which, and on
   the ground of which, God can be just and yet justify the sinner who
   believes in Christ. As long as the Bible stands this must stand as a
   simple statement of what Paul teaches as to the method of salvation.
   Men may dispute as to what he means, but this is surely what he says.

   Argument from the Ground of Justification.

   5. The nature of justification is determined by its ground. This indeed
   is an anticipation of another part of the subject, but it is in point
   here. If the Bible teaches that the ground of justification, the reason
   why God remits to us the penalty of the law and accepts us as righteous
   in his sight, is something out of ourselves, something done for us, and
   not what we do or experience, then it of necessity follows that
   justification is not subjective. It does not consist in the infusion of
   righteousness, or in making the person justified personally holy. If
   the "formal cause" of our justification be our goodness; then we are
   justified for what we are. The Bible, however, teaches that no man
   living can be justified for what he is. He is condemned for what he is
   and for what he does. He is justified for what Christ has done for him.

   Justification not mere Pardon.

   For the same reason justification cannot be mere pardon. Pardon does
   not proceed on the ground of a satisfaction. A prisoner delivered by a
   ransom is not pardoned. A debtor whose obligations have been cancelled
   by a friend, becomes entitled to freedom from the claims of his
   creditor. When a sovereign pardons a criminal, it is not an act of
   justice. It is not on the ground of satisfaction to the law. The Bible,
   therefore, is reaching that justification is on the ground of an
   atonement or satisfaction; that the sinner's guilt is expiated; that he
   is redeemed by the precious blood of Christ; and that judgment is
   pronounced upon him as righteous, does thereby teach that justification
   is neither pardon nor infusion of righteousness.

   Argument from the Immutability of the Law.

   6. The doctrine that justification consists simply in pardon, and
   consequent restoration, assumes that the divine law is imperfect and
   mutable. In human governments it is often expedient and right that men
   justly condemned to suffer the penalty of the law should be pardoned.
   Human laws must be general. They cannot take in all the circumstances
   of each particular case. Their execution would often work hardship or
   injustice. Human judgments may therefore often be set aside. It is not
   so with the divine law. The law of the Lord is perfect. And being
   perfect it cannot be disregarded. It demands nothing which ought not to
   be demanded. It threatens nothing which ought not to be inflicted. It
   is in fact its own executioner. Sin is death. (Rom. vii. 6.) The
   justice of God makes punishment as inseparable from sin, as life is
   from holiness. The penalty of the law is immutable, and as little
   capable of being set aside as the precept. Accordingly the Scriptures
   everywhere teach that in the justification of the sinner there is no
   relaxation of the penalty. There is no setting aside, or disregarding
   the demands of the law. We are delivered from the law, not by its
   abrogation, but by its execution. (Gal. ii. 19.) We are freed from the
   law by the body of Christ. (Rom. vii. 4.) Christ having taken our
   places bore our sins in his own body on the tree. (1 Pet. ii. 24.) The
   handwriting which was against us, he took out of the way, nailing it to
   his cross. (Col. ii. 14.) We are therefore not under the law, but under
   grace. (Rom. vi. 14.) Such representations are inconsistent with the
   theory which supposes that the law may be dispensed with; that the
   restoration of sinners to the favour and fellowship of God, requires no
   satisfaction to its demands; that the believer is pardoned and restored
   to fellowship with God, just as a thief or forger is pardoned and
   restored to his civil rights by the executive in human governments.
   This is against the Scriptures. God is just in justifying the sinner.
   He acts according to justice.

   It will be seen that everything in this discussion turns on the
   question, Whether there is such an attribute in God as justice? If
   justice be only "benevolence guided by wisdom," then there is no
   justification. What evangelical Christians so regard, is only pardon or
   sanctification. But if God, as the Scriptures and conscience teach, be
   a just God, as immutable in his justice as in his goodness and truth,
   then there can be no remission of the penalty of sin except on the
   ground of expiation, and no justification except on the ground of the
   satisfaction of justice, and therefore justification must be a judicial
   act, and neither simply pardon nor the infusion of righteousness. These
   doctrines sustain each other. What the Bible teaches of the justice of
   God, proves that justification is a judicial declaration that justice
   is satisfied. And what the Bible teaches of the nature of
   justification, proves that justice in God is something more than
   benevolence. It is thus that all the great doctrines of the Bible are
   concatenated.

   Argument from the Nature of our Union with Christ.

   7. The theory which reduces justification to pardon and its
   consequences, is inconsistent with what is revealed concerning our
   union with Christ. That union is mystical, supernatural,
   representative, and vital. We were in Him before the foundation of the
   world (Eph. i. 4); we are in Him as we were in Adam (Rom. v. 12, 21; 1
   Cor. xv. 22); we are in Him as the members of the body are in the head
   (Eph. i. 23, iv. 16; 1 Cor. xii. 12, 27, and often); we are in Him as
   the branches are in the vine (John xv. 1-12). We are in Him in such a
   sense that his death is our death, we were crucified with Him (Gal. ii.
   20; Rom. vi. 1-8) ; we are so united with Him that we rose with Him,
   and sit with Him in heavenly places. (Eph. ii. 1-6.) In virtue of this
   union we are (in our measure) what He is. We are the sons of God in
   Him. And what He did, we did. His righteousness is our righteousness.
   His life is our life. His exaltation is our exaltation. Such is the
   pervading representation of the Scriptures. All this is overlooked by
   the advocates of the opposite theory. According to that view, Christ is
   no more united to his people, except in sentiment, than to other men.
   He has simply done what renders it consistent with the character of God
   and the interests of his kingdom, to pardon any and every man who
   repents and believes. His relation is purely external. He is not so
   united to his people that his merit becomes their merit and his life
   their life. Christ is not in them the hope of glory. (Col. i. 27.) He
   is not of God made unto them wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
   redemption. (1 Cor. i. 30.) They are not so in Him that, in virtue of
   that union, they are filled with all the fulness of God. (Col. ii. 10;
   and Eph. iii. 19.) On the other hand, the Protestant doctrine of
   justification harmonizes with all these representations. If we are so
   united to Christ as to be made partakers of his life, we are also
   partakers of his righteousness. What He did in obeying and suffering He
   did for his people. One essential element of his redeeming work was to
   satisfy the demands of justice in their behalf, so that in Him and for
   his sake they are entitled to pardon and eternal life.

   Arguments from the Effects ascribed to Justification.

   8. The consequences attributed to justification are inconsistent with
   the assumption that it consists either in pardon or in the infusion of
   righteousness. Those consequences are peace, reconciliation, and a
   title to eternal life. "Being justified by faith," says the Apostle,
   "we have peace with God." (Rom. v. 1.) But pardon does not produce
   peace. It leaves the conscience unsatisfied. A pardoned criminal is not
   only just as much a criminal as he was before, but his sense of guilt
   and remorse of conscience are in no degree lessened. Pardon can remove
   only the outward and arbitrary penalty. The sting of sin remains. There
   can be no satisfaction to the mind until there is satisfaction of
   justice. Justification secures peace, not merely because it includes
   pardon, but because that pardon is dispensed on the ground of a full
   satisfaction of justice. What satisfies the justice of God, satisfies
   the conscience of the sinner. The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from
   all sin (1 John i. 7) by removing guilt, and thus producing a peace
   which passes all understanding. When the soul sees that Christ bore his
   sins upon the cross, and endured the penalty which he had incurred;
   that all the demands of the law are fully satisfied; that God is more
   honoured in his pardon than in his condemnation; that all the ends of
   punishment are accomplished by the work of Christ, in a far higher
   degree than they could be by the death of the sinner; and that he has a
   right to plead the infinite merit of the Son of God at the bar of
   divine justice, then he is satisfied. Then he has peace. He is humble;
   he does not lose his sense of personal demerit, but the conscience
   ceases to demand satisfaction. Criminals have often been known to give
   themselves up to justice. They could not rest until they were punished.
   The infliction of the penalty incurred gave them peace. This is an
   element in Christian experience. The convinced sinner never finds peace
   until he lays his burden of sin on the Lamb of God; until he apprehends
   that his sins have been punished, as the Apostle says (Rom. viii. 3),
   in Christ.

   Again, we are said to be reconciled to God by the death of his Son.
   (Rom. v. 10.) But pardon does not produce reconciliation. A pardoned
   criminal may be restored to his civil rights, so far as the penalty
   remitted involved their forfeiture, but he is not reconciled to
   society. He is not restored to its favour. Justification, however, does
   secure a restoration to the favour and fellowship of God. We become the
   sons of God by faith in Jesus Christ. (Gal. iii. 26.) No one can read
   the eighth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans without being convinced
   that in Paul's apprehension a justified believer is something more than
   a pardoned criminal. He is a man whose salvation is secure because he
   is free from the law and all its demands; because the righteousness of
   the law (i.e., all its righteous requirements) has been fulfilled him;
   because thereby he is so united to Christ as to become a partaker of
   his life; because no one can lay anything to the charge of those for
   whom Christ died and whom God has justified; and because such believers
   being justified are revealed as the objects of the mysterious,
   immutable, and infinite love of God.

   Again, justification includes or conveys a title to eternal life.
   Pardon is purely negative. It simply removes a penalty. It confers no
   title to benefits not previously enjoyed. Eternal life, however, is
   suspended on the positive condition of perfect obedience. The merely
   pardoned sinner has no such obedience. He is destitute of what, by the
   immutable principles of the divine government, is the indispensable
   condition of eternal life. He has no title to the inheritance promised
   to the righteous. This is not the condition of the believer. The merit
   of Christ is entitled to the reward. And the believer, being partaker
   of that merit, shares in that title. This is constantly recognized in
   the Scriptures. By faith in Christ we become the sons of God. But
   sonship involves heirship, and heirship involves a title to the
   inheritance. "If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs
   with Christ." (Rom. viii. 17.) This is the doctrine taught in Romans v.
   12-21. For the offence of one, judgment passed on all men to
   condemnation. For the righteousness of one, the sentence of
   justification of life has passed on all; that is, of a justification
   which entitles to life. As the sin of Adam was the judicial ground of
   our condemnation (i.e., was the ground on which justice demanded
   condemnation), so the righteousness of Christ is the judicial ground of
   justification. That is, it is the ground on which the life promised to
   the righteous should in justice be granted to the believer. The Church
   in all ages has recognized this truth. Believers have always felt that
   they had a title to eternal life. For this they have praised God in the
   loftiest strains. They have ever regarded it as intuitively true that
   heaven must be merited The only question was, Whether that merit was in
   them or in Christ. Being in Christ, it was a free gift to them; and
   thus righteousness and peace kissed each other. Grace and justice unite
   in placing the crown of righteousness on the believer's head.

   It is no less certain that the consequences attributed to justification
   do not flow from the infusion of righteousness. The amount of holiness
   possessed by the believer does not give him peace. Even perfect
   holiness would not remove guilt. Repentance does not atone for the
   crime of murder. It does not still the murderer's conscience; nor does
   it satisfy the sense of justice iu the public mind. It is the proton
   pseudos of Romanism, and of every theory of subjective justification,
   that they make nothing of guilt, or reduce it to a minimum. If there
   were no guilt, then infusion of righteousness would be all that is
   necessary for salvation. But if there be justice in God then no amount
   of holiness can atone for sin, and justification cannot consist in
   making the sinner holy. Besides this, even admitting that the past
   could be ignored, that the guilt which burdens the soul could be
   overlooked or so easily removed, subjective righteousness, or holiness,
   is so imperfect that it could never give the believer peace. Let the
   holiest of men look within himself and say whether what he sees there
   satisfies his own conscience. If not, how can it satisfy God. He is
   greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things. No man, therefore, can
   have peace with God founded on what he is or on what he does. Romanists
   admit that nothing short of perfect holiness justifies or gives peace
   to the soul. In answer to the Protestant argument founded on that
   admission, Bellarmin says: [145] "Hoc argumentum, si quid probat,
   probat justitiam actualem non esse perfectam: non autem probat,
   justitiam habitualem, qua formaliter justi sumus, . . . . non esse ita
   perfectam, ut absolute, simpliciter, et proprie justi nominemur, et
   simus. Non enim formaliter justi sumus opere nostro, sed opere Dei, qui
   simul maculas peccatorum tergit, et habitum fidei, spei, et caritatis
   infundit. Dei autem perfecta sunt opera. . . . . Unde parvuli
   baptizati, vere justi sunt, quamvis nihil operis fecerint." Again,
   "Justitia enim actualis, quamvis aliquo modo sit imperfecta, propter
   admixtionem venalium delictorum, et egeat quotidiana remissione
   peccati, tamen non propterea desinit esse vera justitia, et suo etiam
   quodam modo perfecta." No provision is made in this system for guilt.
   If the soul is made holy by the infusion of habits, or principles, of
   grace, it is just in the sight of God. No guilt or desert of punishment
   remains. "Reatus," says Bellarmin, [146] . . . . . "est relatio," but
   if the thing of which it is a relation be taken away, where is the
   relation. It is impossible that such a view of justification can give
   peace. It makes no provision for the satisfaction of justice, and
   places all our hopes upon what is within, which our conscience
   testifies cannot meet the just requirements of God.

   Neither can the theory of subjective justification account for
   reconciliation with God, and for the same reasons. What is infused, the
   degree of holiness imparted, does not render us the objects of divine
   complacency and love. His love to us is of the nature of grace; love
   for the unlovely. We are reconciled to God by the death of his Son.
   That removes the obstacle arising from justice to the outflow toward us
   of the mysterious, unmerited love of God. We are accepted in the
   beloved. We are not in ourselves fit for fellowship with God. And if
   driven to depend on what is within, on our subjective righteousness,
   instead of peace we should have despair.

   Again, justification according to the Scriptures gives a title to
   eternal life. For this our own righteousness is utterly inadequate. So
   far from anything in us being meritorious, or entitled to reward, the
   inward state and the exercises of the holiest of men, come so far short
   of perfection as to merit condemnation. In us there is no good thing.
   When we would do good, evil is present with us. There is ever a law in
   our members warring against the law of the mind. Indwelling sin
   remains. It forced even Paul to cry out, "O wretched man that I am! who
   shall deliver me from the body of this death." (Rom. vii. 24.) "Nullum
   unquam exstitisse pii hominis opus, quod, si severo Dei judicio
   examinaretur, non esset damnabile." [147] Ignoring this plain truth of
   Scripture and of Christian experience expressing itself in daily and
   hourly confession, humiliation, and prayers for forgiveness, the
   doctrine of subjective justification assumes that there is no sin in
   the believer, or no sin which merits the condemnation of God, but on
   the contrary that there is in him what merits eternal life. The
   Romanists make a distinction between a first and second justification.
   The first they admit to be gratuitous, and to be founded on the merit
   of Christ, or rather, to be gratuitously bestowed for Christ's sake.
   This consists in the infusion of habitual grace (i.e., regeneration).
   This justifies in rendering the soul subjectively just or holy. The
   second justification is not a matter of grace. It is founded on the
   merit of good works, the fruits of regeneration. But if these fruits
   are, as our consciousness testifies, deified by sin, how can they merit
   eternal life? How can they cancel the handwriting which is against us?
   How can they be the ground of Paul's confident challenge, "Who shall
   lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" It is not what is within
   us, but what is without us; not what we are or do, but what Christ is
   and has done, that is the ground of confidence and of our title to
   eternal life. This is the admitted doctrine of the Protestant
   Reformation. "Apud theologos Augustanæ confessionis extra controversiam
   positum est," says the "Form of Concord," [148] "totam justitiam
   nostram extra nos, et extra omnium hominum merita, opera, virtutes
   atque dignitatem quærendam, eamque in solo Domino nostro, Jesu Christo
   consistere." As high as the heavens are above the earth, so high is a
   hope founded on the work of Christ for us, above a hope founded on the
   merit of anything wrought in us. Calvin teaches the same doctrine as
   Luther. [149] He quotes Lombard as saying that our justification in
   Christ may be interpreted in two ways: "Primum, mors Christi nos
   justificat, dum per eam excitatur caritas in cordibus nostris, qua
   justi efficimur: deinde quod per eandem exstinctum est peccatum; quo
   nos captivos distinebat diabolus, ut jam non habeat unde nos damnet."
   To which Calvin replies, "Scriptura autem, quem de fidei justitia
   loquitur, longe alio nos ducit: nempe ut ab intuitu operum nostrorum
   aversi, in Dei misericordiam ac Christi perfectionem, tantum
   respiciamus. . . . . Hic est fidei sensus, per quem peccator in
   possessionem venit suæ salutis, dum ex Evangeli doctrina agnoscit Deo
   se reconciliatum: quod intercedente Christi justitia, impetrata
   peccatorum remissione, justificatus sit: et quanquam Spiritu Dei
   regeneratus, non in bonis operibus, quibus incumbit, sed sola Christi
   justitia repositam sibi perpetuam justitiam cogitat."

   That justification is not merely pardon, and that it is not the
   infusion of righteousness whereby the sinner is made inherently just or
   holy, but a judgment on the part of God that the demands of the law in
   regard to the believer are satisfied, and that he has a right to a
   righteousness which entitles him to eternal life, has been argued, (1.)
   From the uniform usage of Scripture both in the Old and New Testament.
   (2.) From the constant opposition between justification and
   condemnation. (3.) From equivalent forms of expression. (4.) From the
   whole design and drift of the Apostle's argument in his Epistles to the
   Romans and to the Galatians. (5.) From the ground of justification,
   namely, the righteousness of Christ. (6.) From the immutability of the
   law and the justice of God. (7.) From the nature of our union with
   Christ. (8.) From the fact that peace, reconciliation with God, and a
   title to eternal life which according to Scripture, are the
   consequences of justification, do not flow either from mere pardon or
   from subjective righteousness, or from sanctification. That this is the
   doctrine of Protestants, both Lutheran and Reformed, cannot with any
   show of reason be disputed.

   Calvin's Doctrine.

   It is true, indeed, that by the earlier Reformers, and especially by
   Calvin, justification is often said to consist in the pardon of sin.
   But that that was not intended as a denial of the judicial character of
   justification, or as excluding the imputation of the righteousness of
   Christ by which the believer is counted just in the sight of the law,
   is obvious, --

   1. From the nature of the controversy in which those Reformers were
   engaged. The question between them and the Romanists was, Does
   justification consist in the act of God making the sinner inherently
   just or holy? or, Does it express the judgment of God by which the
   believer is pronounced just. What Calvin denied was that justification
   is a making holy. What he affirmed was that it was delivering the
   believer from the condemnation of the law and introducing him into a
   state of favour with God. The Romanists expressed their doctrine by
   saying that justification consists in the remission of sin and the
   infusion of charity or righteousness. But by the remission of sin they
   meant the removal of sin; the putting off the old man. In other words,
   justification with them consisted (to use the scholastic language then
   in vogue) in the removal of the habits of sin and the infusion of
   habits of grace. In those justified, therefore, there was no sin, and,
   therefore, nothing to punish. Pardon, therefore, followed as a
   necessary consequence. It was a mere accessary. This view of the matter
   makes nothing of guilt; nothing of the demands of justice. Calvin
   therefore, insisted that besides the subjective renovation connected
   with the sinner's conversion, his justdication concerned the removal of
   guilt, the satisfaction of justice, which in the order of nature,
   although not of time, must precede the communication of the life of God
   to the soul. That Calvin did not differ from the other Reformers and
   the whole body of the Reformed Church on this subject appears from his
   own explicit declarations, and from the perfectly unambiguous
   statements of the Confessions to which he gave his assent. Thus he
   says, [150] "Porro ne impingamus in ipso limine (quod fieret si de re
   incognita disputationem ingrediremur) primum explicemus quid sibi
   velint istæ loquutiones, Hominem coram Deo justificari, Fide
   justificari, vel operibus. Justificari coram Deo dicitur qui judicio
   Dei et censetur justus, et acceptus est ob suam justitiam: siqui dem ut
   Deo abominabilis est iniquitas, ita nec peccator in ejus oculis potest
   invenire gratiam, quatenus est peccator, et quamdiu talis censetur.
   Proinde ubicunque peccatum est, illic etiam se profert ira et ultio
   Dei. Justificatur autem qui non loco peccatoris, sed justi habetur,
   eoque nomine consistit coram Dei tribunali, ubi peccatores omnes
   corruunt. Quemadmodum si reus innocens ad tribunal æqui judicis
   adducatur, ubi secundum innocentiam ejus judicatum fuerit, justificatus
   apud judicem dicitur: sic apud Deum justificatur, qui numero peccatorum
   exemptus, Deum habet suæ justitiæ testem et assertorem. Justificari,
   ergo, operibus ea ratione dicetur, in cujus vita reperietur ea puritas
   ac sanctitas quæ testimonium justitiæ apud Dei thronum mereatur: seu
   qui operum suorum integritate respondere et satisfacere illius judicio
   queat. Contra, justificabitur ille fide, qui operum justitia exclusus,
   Christi justitiam per fidem apprehendit, qua vestitus in Dei conspectu
   non ut peccator, sed tanquam justus apparet. Ita nos justificationem
   simpliciter interpretamur acceptionem, qua nos Deus in gratiam receptos
   pro justos habet. Eamque in peccatorum remissione ac justitiæ Christi
   imputatione positam ease dicimus."

   This passage is decisive as to the views of Calvin; for it is
   professedly a formal statement of the "Status Questionis" given with
   the utmost clearness and precision. Justification consists "in the
   remission of sins and the imputation of the righteousness of Christ."
   "He is justified in the sight of God, who is taken from the class of
   sinners, and has God for the witness and assertor of his
   righteousness."

   § 3. Works not the Ground of Justification.

   In reference to men since the fall the assertion is so explicit and so
   often repeated, that justification is not of works, that that
   proposition has never been called in question by any one professing to
   receive the Scriptures as the word of God. It being expressly asserted
   that the whole world is guilty before God, that by the works of the law
   no flesh living can be justified, the only question open for discussion
   is, What is meant by works of the law?

   To this question the following answers have been given, First, that by
   works of the law are meant works prescribed in the Jewish law. It is
   assumed that as Paul's controversy was with those who taught that
   unless men were circumcised and kept the law af Moses, they could not
   be saved (Acts xv. 1, 24), all he intended to teach was the reverse of
   that proposition. He is to be understood as saying that the observance
   of Jewish rites and ceremonies is not essential to salvation; that men
   are not made righteous or good by external ceremonial works, but by
   works morally good. This is the ground taken by Pelagians and by most
   of the modern Rationalists. It is only a modification of this view that
   men are not justified, that is, that their character before God is not
   determined so much by their particular acts or works, as by their
   general disposition and controlling principles. To be justified by
   faith, therefore, is to be justified on the ground of our trust, or
   pious confidence in God and truth. Thus Wegscheider [151] says,
   "Homines non singulis quibusdam recte factis operibusque operatis, nec
   propter meritum quoddam iis attribuendum, sed sola vera fide, i.e.,
   animo ad Christi exemplum ejusdemque præcepta composito et ad Deum et
   sanctissimum et benignissimum converso, ita, ut omnia cogitata et facta
   ad Deum ejusque voluntatem sanctissimam pie referant, Deo vere
   probantur et benevolentiæ Dei confisi spe beatitatis futuræ pro
   dignitate ipsorum morali iis concedendæ certissima imbuuntur."
   Steudlin, [152] expresses the same view. "All true reformation, every
   good act," he says, "must spring from faith, provided we understand by
   faith the conviction that something is right, a conviction of general
   moral and religious principles." Kant says that Christ in a religious
   aspect is the ideal of humanity. When a man so regards him and
   endeavours to conform his heart and life to that ideal, he is justified
   by faith. [153] According to all these views, mere ceremonial works are
   excluded, and the ground of justification is made to be our own natural
   moral character and conduct.

   Romish Doctrine.

   Secondly. The doctrine of Romanists on this subject is much higher.
   Romanism retains the supernatural element of Christianity throughout.
   Indeed it is a matter of devout thankfulness to God that underneath the
   numerous grievous and destructive errors of the Romish Church, the
   great truths of the Gospel are preserved. The Trinity, the true
   divinity of Christ, the true doctrine concerning his person as God and
   man in two distinct natures and one person forever; salvation through
   his blood, regeneration and sanctification through the almighty power
   of the Spirit, the resurrection of the body, and eternal life, are
   doctrines on which the people of God in that communion live, and which
   have produced such saintly men as St. Bernard, Fénélon, and doubtless
   thousands of others who are of the number of God's elect. Every true
   worshipper of Christ must in his heart recognize as a Christian
   brother, wherever he may be found, any one who loves, worships, and
   trusts the Lord Jesus Christ as God manifest in the flesh and the only
   Saviour of men. On the matter of justification the Romish theologians
   have marred and defaced the truth as they have almost all other
   doctrines pertaining to the mode in which the merits of Christ are made
   available to our salvation. They admit, indeed, that there is no good
   in fallen man; that he can merit nothing and claim nothing on the
   ground of anything he is or can do of himself. He is by nature dead in
   sin; and until made partaker of a new life by the supernatural power of
   the Holy Ghost, he can do nothing but sin. For Christ's sake, and only
   through his merits, as a matter of grace, this new life is imparted to
   the soul in regeneration (i.e., as Romanists teach, in baptism). As
   life expels death; as light banishes darkness, so the entrance of this
   new divine life into the soul expels sin (i.e., sinful habits), and
   brings forth the fruits of righteousness. Works done after regeneration
   have real merit, "meritum condigni," and are the ground of the second
   justification the first justification consisting in making the soul
   inherently just by the infusion of righteousness. According to this
   view, we are not justified by works done before regeneration, but we
   are justified for gracious works, i.e., for works which spring from the
   principle of divine life infused into the heart. The whole ground of
   our acceptance with God is thus made to be what we are and what we do.

   Remonstrant Doctrine.

   Thirdly. According to the Remonstrants or Arminians the works which are
   excluded from our justification are works of the law as distinguished
   from works of the Gospel. In the covenant made with Adam God demanded
   perfect obedience as the condition of life. For Christ's sake, God in
   the Gospel has entered into a new covenant with men, promising them
   salvation on the condition of evangelical obedience. This is expressed
   in different forms. Sometimes it is said that we are justified on
   account of faith. Faith is accepted in place of that perfect
   righteousness demanded by the Adamic law. But by faith is not meant the
   act of receiving and resting upon Christ alone for salvation. It is
   regarded as a permanent and controlling state of mind. And therefore it
   is often said that we are justified by a "fides obsequiosa," an
   obedient faith; a faith which includes obedience. At other times, it is
   said that we are justified by evangelical obedience, i.e., that kind
   and measure of obedience which the Gospel requires, and which men since
   the fall, in the proper use of "sufficient grace" granted to all men,
   are able to render. Limborch says, "Sciendum, quando dicimus, nos fide
   justificari, nos non excludere opera, quæ fides exigit et tanquam
   foecunda mater producit; sed ea includere." And again, "Est itaque
   [fides] talis actus, qui, licet in se spectatus perfectus nequaquam
   sit, sed in multis deficiens, tamen a Deo, gratiosa et liberrima
   voluntate, pro pleno et perfecto acceptatur, et propter quem Deus
   homini gratiose remissionem peccatoram et vitæ æternæ premium conferre
   vult." Again, [154] God, he says, demands, "obedientiam fidei, hoc est,
   non rigidam et ab omnibus æqualem, prout exigebat lex; sed tantam,
   quantam fides, id est, certa de divinis promissionibus persuasio, in
   unoquoque efficere potest." Therefore justification, he says, [155]
   "Est gratiosa æstimatio, seu potius acceptatio justitiæ nostræ
   imperfectæ pro perfecta, propter Jesum Christum."

   Protestant Doctrine.

   Fourthly. According to the doctrine of the Lutherans and Reformed, the
   works excluded from the ground of our justification are not only ritual
   or ceremonial works, nor merely works done before regeneration, nor the
   perfect obedience required by the law given to Adam, but works of all
   kinds, everything done by us or wrought in us. That this is the
   doctrine of the Bible is plain, --

   1. Because the language of Scripture is unlimited. The declaration is,
   that we are not justified "by works." No specific kind of works is
   designated to the exclusion of all others. But it is "works;" what we
   do; anything and everything we do. It is, therefore, without authority
   that any man limits these general declarations to any particular class
   of works.

   2. The word law is used in a comprehensive sense. It includes all
   revelations of the will of God as the rule of man's obedience and,
   therefore, by "works of the law" must be intended all kinds of works.
   As nomos means that which binds, it is used for the law of nature, or
   the law written on the heart (Rom. ii. 14), for the Decalogne, for the
   law of Moses, for the whole of the Old Testament Scriptures. (Rom. iii.
   19.) Sometimes one, and sometimes another of these aspects of the law
   is specially referred to. Paul assures the Jews that they could not be
   justified by the works of the law, which was especially binding on
   them. He assures the Gentiles that they could not be justified by the
   law written on their hearts. He assures believers under the Gospel that
   they cannot be justified by works of the law binding on them. The
   reason given includes all possible works That reason is, that all human
   obedience is imperfect; all men are sinners: and the law demands
   perfect obedience. (Gal. iii. 10.) Therefore, it is that "by the deeds
   of the law there shall no flesh be justified." (Rom. iii. 20.)

   3. The law of which Paul speaks is the law which says, "Thou shalt not
   covet" (Rom. vii. 7); the law which is spiritual (ver. 14); which is
   "holy, and just, and good" (ver. 12); the law of which the great
   command is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
   thy neighbour as thyself. Besides, what are called works of the law are
   in Titus iii. 5 called "works of righteousness." Higher works than
   these there cannot be. The Apostle repudiates any ground of confidence
   in his "own righteousness" (Phil. iii. 9), i.e., own excellence,
   whether habitual or actual. He censures the Jews because they went
   about to establish their own righteousness, and would not submit to the
   righteousness of God. (Rom. x. 3.) From these and many similar passages
   it is clear that it is not any one or more specific kinds of work which
   are excluded from the ground of justification, but all works, all
   personal excellence of every kind.

   4. This is still further evident from the contrast constantly presented
   between faith and works. We are not justified by works, but by faith in
   Jesus Christ. (Gal. ii. 16, and often elsewhere.) It is not one kind of
   works as opposed to another; legal as opposed to evangelical; natural
   as opposed to gracious; moral as opposed to ritual; but works of every
   kind as opposed to faith.

   5 The same is evident from what is taught of the gratuitous nature of
   our justification. Grace and works are antithetical. "To him that
   worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt." (Rom. iv.
   4.) "If by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no
   more grace." (Rom. xi. 6.) Grace of necessity excludes works of every
   kind, and more especially those of the highest kind, which might have
   some show of merit. But merit of any degree is of necessity excluded,
   if our salvation be by grace.

   6. When the positive ground of justification is stated, it is always
   declared to be not anything done by us or wrought in us, but what was
   done for us. It is ever represented as something external to ourselves.
   We are justified by the blood of Christ (Rom. v. 9); by his obedience
   (Rom. v. 19); by his righteousness (ver. 18). This is involved in the
   whole method of salvation. Christ saves us as a priest; but a priest
   does not save by making those who come to him good. He does not work in
   them, but for them. Christ saves us by a sacrifice; but a sacrifice is
   effectual, not because of its subjective effect upon the offerer, but
   as an expiation, or satisfaction to justice. Christ is our Redeemer; he
   gave himself as a ransom for many. But a ransom does not infuse
   righteousness. It is the payment of a price. It is the satisfaction of
   the claims of the captor upon the captive. The whole plan of salvation,
   therefore, as presented in the Bible and as it is the life of the
   Church, is changed, if the ground of our acceptance with God be
   transferred from what Christ has done for us, to what is wrought in us
   or done by us. The Romish theologians do not agree exactly as to
   whether habitual or actual righteousness is the ground of
   justification. Bellarmin says it is the former. [156] He says, "Solam
   esse habitualem justitiam, per quam formaliter justi nominamur, et
   sumus: justitiam vero actualem, id est, opera vere justa justificare
   quidem, ut sanctus Jacobus loquitur, cum ait cap. 2 ex operibus hominem
   justificari, sed meritorie, non formaliter." This he says is clearly
   the doctrine of the Council of Trent, which teaches, [157] "Causam
   formalem justificationis esse justitiam, sive caritatem, quam Deus
   unicuique propriam infundit, secundum mensuram dispositionum, et quæ in
   cordibus justificatorum innæret." This follows also, he argues, from
   the fact that the sacraments justify, [158] "per modum instrumenti ad
   infusionem justitiæ habitualis." This, however, only amounts to the
   distinction, already referred to, between the first and second
   justification. The infusion of righteousness renders the soul
   inherently righteous; then good works merit salvation. The one is the
   formal, the other the meritorious cause of the sinner's justification.
   But according to the Scriptures, both habitual and actual
   righteousness, both inherent grace and its fruits are excluded from any
   share in the ground of our justification.

   7. This still further and most decisively appears from the grand
   objection to his doctrine which Paul was constantly called upon to
   answer. That objection was, that if our personal goodness or moral
   excellence is not the ground of our acceptance with God, then all
   necessity of being good is denied, and all motive to good works is
   removed. We may continue in sin that grace may abound. This objection
   has been reiterated a thousand times since it was urged against the
   Apostles. It seems so unreasonable and so demoralizing to say as Paul
   says, Romans iii. 22, that so far as justification is concerned there
   is no difference between Jew and Gentile; between a worshipper of the
   true God and a worshipper of demons; between the greatest sinner and
   the most moral man in the world, that men have ever felt that they were
   doing God service in denouncing this doctrine as a soul-destroying
   heresy. Had Paul taught that men are justified for their good moral
   works as the Pelagians and Rationalists say; or for their evangelical
   obedience as the Remonstrants say; or for their inherent righteousness
   and subsequent good works as the Romanists say, there would have been
   no room for this formidable objection. Or, if through any
   misapprehension of his teaching, the objection had been urged, how easy
   had it been for the Apostle to set it aside. How obvious would have
   been the answer, I do not deny that really good works are the ground of
   our acceptance with God. I only say that ritual works have no worth in
   his sight, that He looks on the heart; or, that works done before
   regeneration have no real excellence or merit; or, that God is more
   lenient now than in his dealing with Adam; that He does not demand
   perfect obedience, but accepts our imperfect, well-meant endeavours to
   keep his holy commandments.' How reasonable and satisfactory would such
   an answer have been. Paul, however, does not make it. He adheres to his
   doctrine, that our own personal moral excellence has nothing to do with
   our justification; that God justifies the ungodly, that He receives the
   chief of sinners. He answers the objection in deed, and answers it
   effectually; but his answer supposes him to teach just what Protestants
   teach, that we are justified without works, not for our own
   righteousness, but gratuitously, without money and without price,
   solely on the ground of what Christ has done for us. His answer is,
   that so far from its being true that we must be good before we can be
   justified, we must be justified before we can be good; that so long as
   we are under the curse of the law we bring forth fruit unto death; that
   it is not until reconciled unto God by the death of his Son, that we
   bring forth fruit unto righteousness; that when justified by the
   righteousness of Christ, we are made partakers of his Spirit; being
   justified we are sanctified; that union with Christ by faith secures
   not only the imputation of his righteousness to our justification, but
   the participation of his life unto our sanctification, so that as
   surely as He lives and lives unto God, so they that believe on Him
   shall live unto God; and that none are partakers of the merit of his
   death who do not become partakers of the power of his life. We do not,
   therefore, he says, make void the law of God. Yea, we establish the
   law. We teach the only true way to become holy; although that way
   appears foolishness unto the wise of this world, whose wisdom is folly
   in the sight of God.

   § 4. The Righteousness of Christ the Ground of Justification.

   The imperative question remains, How shall a man be just with God? If
   our moral excellence be not the ground on which God pronounces us just,
   what is that ground? The grand reason why such different answers are
   given to this question is, that it is understood in different senses.
   The Scriptural and Protestant answer is absurd, if the question means
   what Romanists and others understand it to mean. If "just" means good,
   i.e., it the word be taken in its moral, and not in its judicial sense,
   then it is absurd to say that a man can be good with the goodness of
   another; or to say that God can pronounce a man to be good who is not
   good. Bellarmin says an Ethiopian clothed in a white garment is not
   white. Curcellæus, the Remonstrant, says, "A man can no more be just
   with the justice of another, than he can be white with the whiteness of
   another." Moehler [159] says, it is impossible that anything should
   appear to God other than it really is; that an unjust man should appear
   to him, or be pronounced by him just. All this is true in the sense
   intended by these writers, "The judgment of God is according to truth."
   (Rom. ii. 2.) Every man is truly just whom He justifies or dodares to
   be just. It is in vain to dispute until the "status quæstionis" be
   clearly determined. The word dikaios, "righteous," or "just," has two
   distinct senses, its above stated. It has a moral, and also a legal,
   forensic, or judicial sense. It sometimes expresses moral character,
   sometimes simply a relation to law and justice. In one sense to
   pronounce a man just, is to declare that he is morally good. In another
   sense, it is to declare that the claims of justice against him are
   satisfied, and that he is entitled to the reward promised to the
   righteous. When God justifies the ungodly, he does not declare that he
   is godly, but that his sins are expiated, and that he has a title
   founded in justice to eternal life. In this there is no contradiction
   and no absurdity. If a man under attainder appear before the proper
   tribunal, and show cause why the attainder should in justice be
   reversed, and he be declared entitled to his rank, titles, and estates,
   a decision in his favour would be a justification. It would declare him
   just in the eye of the law, but it would declare nothing and effect
   nothing as to his moral character. In the like manner, when the sinner
   stands at the bar of God, he can show good reason why he cannot be
   justly condemned, and why he should be declared entitled to eternal
   life. Now the question is, "On what ground can God pronounce a sinner
   just in this legal or forensic sense?" It has been shown that to
   justify, according to uniform Scriptural usage, is to pronounce just in
   the sense stated, that it is not merely to pardon, and that it is not
   to render inherently righteous or holy. It has also been shown to be
   the doctrine of Scripture, what indeed is intuitively true to the
   conscience, that our moral excellence, habitual or actual, is not and
   cannot be the ground of any such judicial declaration. What then is the
   ground? The Bible and the people of God, with one voice answer, "The
   righteousness of Christ." The ambiguity of words, the speculations of
   theologians, and misapprehensions, may cause many of the people of God
   to deny in words that such is the proper answer, but it is nevertheless
   the answer rendered by every believer's heart. He relies for his
   acceptance with God, not on himself but on Christ, not on what he is or
   has done, but on what Christ is and has done for him.

   Meaning of the Terms.

   By the righteousness of Christ is meant all he became, did, and
   suffered to satisfy the demands of divine justice, and merit for his
   people the forgiveness of sin and the gift of eternal life. The
   righteousness of Christ is commonly represented as including his active
   and passive obedience. This distinction is, as to the idea, Scriptural.
   The Bible does teach that Christ obeyed the law in all its precepts,
   and that he endured its penalty, and that this was done in such sense
   for his people that they are said to have done it. They died in Him.
   They were crucified with Him. They were delivered from the curse of the
   law by his being made a curse for them. He was made under the law that
   he might redeem those who were under the law. We are freed from the law
   by the body of Christ. He was made sin that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in Him. He is the end of the law for righteousness
   to all them that believe. It is by his obedience that many are made
   righteous. (Rom. v. 19.) We obeyed in Him, according to the teaching of
   the Apostle, in Romans v. 12-21, in the same sense in which we sinned
   in Adam. The active and passive obedience of Christ, however, are only
   different phases or aspects of the same thing. He obeyed in suffering.
   His highest acts of obedience were rendered in the garden, and upon the
   cross. Hence this distinction is not so presented in Scripture as
   though the obedience of Christ answered one purpose, and his sufferings
   another and a distinct purpose. We are justified by his blood. We are
   reconciled unto God by his death. We are freed from all the demands of
   the law by his body (Rom. vii. 4), and we are freed from the law by his
   being made under it and obeying it in our stead. (Gal. iv. 4, 5.) Thus
   the same effect is ascribed to the death or sufferings of Christ, and
   to his obedience, because both are forms or parts of his obedience or
   righteousness by which we are justified. In other words the obedience
   of Christ includes all He did in satisfying the demands of the law.

   The Righteousness of Christ is the Righteousness of God.

   The righteousness of Christ on the ground of which the believer's
   justified is the righteousness of God. It is so designated in Scripture
   not only because it was provided and is accepted by Him; it is not only
   the righteousness which avails before God, but it is the righteousness
   of a divine person; of God manifest in the flesh. God purchased the
   Church with his own blood. (Acts xx. 28.) It was the Lord of glory who
   was crucified. (1 Cor. ii. 8.) He who was in the form of God and
   thought it not robbery to be equal with God, became obedient unto
   death, even the death of the cross (Phil. ii. 6-8.) He who is the
   brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person,
   who upholds all things by the word of his power; whom angels worship;
   who is called God; who in the beginning laid the foundations of the
   earth, and of whose hands the heavens are the workmanship; who is
   eternal and immutable, has, the Apostle teaches, by death destroyed him
   who has the power of death and delivered those who through fear of
   death (i.e., of the wrath of God) were all their lifetime subject to
   bondage. (Heb. i., ii.) He whom Thomas recognized and avowed to be his
   Lord and God was the person into whose wounded side he thrust his hand.
   He whom John says he saw, looked upon, and handled, he declares to be
   the true God and eternal life. The soul, in which personality resides,
   does not die when the man dies, yet it is the soul that gives dignity
   to the man, and which renders his life of unspeakably greater value in
   the sight of God and man, than the life of any irrational creature. So
   it was not the divine nature in Christ in which his personality
   resides, the eternal Logos, that died when Christ died. Nevertheless
   the hypostatic union between the Logos and the human nature of Christ,
   makes it true that the righteousness of Christ (his obedience and
   sufferings) was the righteousness of God. This is the reason why it can
   avail before God for the salvation of the whole world. This is the
   reason why the believer, when arrayed in this righteousness, need fear
   neither death nor hell. This is the reason why Paul challenges the
   universe to lay anything to the charge of God's elect.

   § 5. Imputation of Righteousness.

   The righteousness of Christ is imputed to the believer for his
   justification. The word impute is familiar and unambiguous. To impute
   is to ascribe to, to reckon to, to lay to one's charge. When we say we
   impute a good or bad motive to a man, or that a good or evil action is
   imputed to him, no one misunderstands our meaning. Philemon had no
   doubt what Paul meant when he told him to impute to him the debt of
   Onesimus. "Let not the king impute anything unto his servant." (1 Sam.
   xxii. 15.) "Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me." (2 Sam. xix. 19.)
   "Neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it." (Lev. vii.
   18.) "Blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood." (Lev.
   xvii. 4.) "Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not
   iniquity." (Ps. xxxii. 2.) "Unto whom God imputeth righteousness
   without works." (Rom. iv. 6.) God is "in Christ not imputing their
   trespasses unto them." (2 Cor. v. 19.)

   The meaning of these and similar passages of Scripture has never been
   disputed. Everyone understands them. We use the word impute in its
   simple admitted sense, when we say that the righteousness of Christ is
   imputed to the believer for his justification.

   It seems unnecessary to remark that this does not, and cannot mean that
   the righteousness of Christ is infused into the believer or in any way
   so imparted to him as to change, or constitute His moral character.
   Imputation never changes the inward, subjective state of the person to
   whom the imputation is made. When sin is imputed to a man he is not
   made sinful; when the zeal of Phinehas was imputed to him, he was not
   made zealous. When you impute theft to a man, you do not make him a
   thief. When you impute goodness to a man, you do not make him good. So
   when righteousness is imputed to the believer, he does not thereby
   become subjectively righteous. If the righteousness be adequate, and if
   the imputation be made on adequate grounds and by competent authority,
   the person to whom the imputation is made has the right to be treated
   as righteous. And, therefore, in the forensic, although not in the
   moral or subjective sense, the imputation of the righteousness of
   Christ does make the sinner righteous. That is, it gives him a right to
   the full pardon of all his sins and a claim in justice to eternal life.

   That this is the simple and universally accepted view of the doctrine
   as held by all Protestants at the Reformation, and by them regarded as
   the corner-stone of the Gospel, has already been sufficiently proved by
   extracts from the Lutheran and Reformed Symbols, and has never been
   disputed by any candid or competent authority. This has continued to be
   the doctrine of both the great branches of the Protestant Church, so
   far as they pretend to adhere to their standards. Schmid [160] proves
   this by a whole catena of quotations so far as the Lutheran Church is
   concerned. Schweizer [161] does the same for the Reformed Church. A few
   citations, therefore, from authors of a recognized representative
   character will suffice as to this point. Turrettin with his
   characteristic precision says: "Cum dicimus Christi justitiam ad
   justificationem nobis imputari, et nos per justitiam illam imputatam
   justos esse coram Deo, et non per justitiam ullam quæ nobis inhæreat;
   Nihil aliud volumus, quam obedientiam Christi Deo Patri nomine nostro
   præstitam, ita nobis a Deo donari, ut vere nostra censeatur, eamque
   esse unicam et solam illam justitiam propter quam, et cujus merito,
   absolvamur a reatu peccatorum nostrum, et jus ad vitam obtinemus; nec
   ullam in nobis esse justitiam, aut ulla bona opera, quibus beneficia
   tanta promereamur, quæ ferre possint severum judicii divini examen, si
   Deus juxta legis suæ rigorem nobiscum agere vellet nihil nos illi posse
   opponere, nisi Christi meritum et satisfactionem, in qua sola,
   peccatorum conscientia territi, tutum adversus iram divinam perfugium,
   et animarum nostrarum pacem invenire possumus." [162]

   On the following page he refers to Bellarmin, [163] who says, "Si
   [Protestantes hoc] solum vellent, nobis imputari Christi merita, quia
   [a Deo] nobis donata sunt, et possumus ea [Deo] Patri offere pro
   peccatis nostris, quoniam Christus suscepit super se onus satisfaciendi
   pro nobis, nosque Deo Patri reconciliandi, recta esset eorum
   sententia." On this Turrettin remarks, "Atqui nihil aliud volumus; Nam
   quod addit, nos velle ita imputari nobis Christi justitiam, ut per eam
   formaliter justi nominemur et simus,' hoc gratis et falso supponit, ex
   perversa et præpostera sua hypothesi de justificatione morali. Sed
   quæritur, Ad quid imputatio ista fiat? An ad justificationem et vitam,
   ut nos pertendimus, An vero tantum ad gratiæ internæ et justitiæ
   inhærentis infusionem, ut illi volunt; Id est, an ita imputentur et
   communicentur nobis merita Christi, ut sint causa meritoria sola nostræ
   justificationis, nec ulla alia detur justitia propter quam absolvamur
   in conspectu Dei; quod volumus; An vero ita imputentur, ut sint
   conditiones causæ formalis, id. justitiæ inhærentis, ut ea homo donari
   possit, vel causæ extrinsecæ, quæ mereantur infusionem justitiæ, per
   quam justificatur homo; ut ita non meritum Christi proprie, sed
   justitia inhærens per meritum Christi acquisita, sic causa propria et
   vera, propter quam homo justificatur; quod illi statuunt." It may be
   remarked in passing that according to the Protestant doctrine there is
   properly no "formal cause" of justification. The righteousness of
   Christ is the meritorious, but not the formal cause of the sinner's
   being pronounced righteous. A formal cause is that which constitutes
   the inherent, subjective nature of a person or thing. The formal cause
   of a man's being good, is goodness, of his being holy, holiness; of his
   being wicked, wickedness. The formal cause of a rose's being red, is
   redness; and of a wall's being white, is whiteness. As we are not
   rendered inherently righteous by the righteousness of Christ, it is
   hardly correct to say that his righteousness is the formal cause of our
   being righteous. Owen, and other eminent writers do indeed often use
   the expression referred to, but they take the word "formal" out of its
   ordinary scholastic sense.

   Campegius Vitringa [164] says: "Tenendum est certissimum hoc
   fundamentum, quod justificare sit vocabulum forense, notetque in
   Scriptura actum judicis, quo causam alicujus in judicio justam esse
   declarat; sive eum a crimine, cujus postulatus est, absolvat (quæ est
   genuina, et maxime propria vocis significatio), sive etiam jus ad hanc,
   vel illam rem ei sententia addicat, et adjudicet."

   "17. Per justificationem peccatoris intelligimus actum Dei Patris, ut
   judicis, quo peccatorem credentem, natura filium iræ, neque ullum jus
   ex se habentem bona coelestia petendi, declarat immunem esse ab omni
   reatu, et condemnatione, adoptat in filium, et in eum ex gratia confert
   jus ad suam communionem, cum salute æterna, bonisque omnibus cum ea
   conjunctis, postulandi."

   "27. Teneamus nullam carnem in se posse reperire et ex se producere
   causam, et fundamentum justificationis. 29. Quærendum igitur id,
   propter quod peccator justificatur, extra peccatorem in obedientia
   Filli Dei, quam præstitit Patri in humana natura ad mortem, imo ad
   mortem crucis, et ad quam præstandam se obstrinxerat in sponsione.
   (Rom. v. 19.)" "32. Hæc [obedientia] imputatur peccatori a Deo judice
   ex gratia juxta jus sponsionis, de quo ante dictum."

   Owen in his elaborate work on justification, [165] proves that the word
   to justify, "whether the act of God towards men, or of men towards God,
   or of men among themselves, or of one towards another, be expressed
   thereby, is always used in a forensic' sense, and does not denote a
   physical operation, transfusion, or transmutation." He thus winds up
   the discussion: "Wherefore as condemnation is not the infusing of a
   habit of wickedness into him that is condemned, nor the making of him
   to be inherently wicked, who was before righteous, but the passing a
   sentence upon a man with respect to his wickedness; no more is
   justification the change of a person from inherent unrighteousness to
   righteousness, by the infusion of a principle of grace, but a
   sentential declaration of him to be righteous." [166]

   The ground of this justification in the case of the believing inner is
   the imputation of the righteousness of Christ. This is set forth at
   length. [167] "The judgment of the Reformed Churches herein," he says,
   "is known to all and must be confessed, unless we intend by vain cavils
   to increase and perpetuate contentions. Especially the Church of
   England is in her doctrine express as to the imputation of the
   righteousness of Christ, both active and passive, as it is usually
   distinguished. This has been of late so fully manifested out of her
   authentic writings, that is, the Articles of Religion' and Books of
   Homilies,' and other writings publicly authorized, that it is
   altogether needless to give any further demonstration of it."

   President Edwards in his sermon on justification [168] sets forth the
   Protestant doctrine in all its fulness. "To suppose," he says, "that a
   man is justified by his own virtue or obedience, derogates from the
   honour of the Mediator, and ascribes that to man's virtue that belongs
   only to the righteousness of Christ. It puts man in Christ's stead, and
   makes him his own saviour, in a respect in which Christ only is the
   Saviour: and so it is a doctrine contrary to the nature and design of
   the Gospel, which is to abase man, and to ascribe all the glory of our
   salvation to Christ the Redeemer. It is inconsistent with the doctrine
   of the imputation of Christ's righteousness, which is a gospel
   doctrine. Here I would (1.) Explain what we mean by the imputation of
   Christ's righteousness. (2.) Prove the thing intended by it to be true.
   (3.) Show that this doctrine is utterly inconsistent with the doctrine
   of our being justified by our own virtue or sincere obedience.

   "First. I would explain what we mean by the imputation of Christ's
   righteousness. Sometimes the expression is taken by our divines in a
   larger sense, for the imputation of all that Christ did and suffered
   for our redemption, whereby we are free from guilt, and stand righteous
   in the sight of God; and so implies the imputation both of Christ's
   satisfaction and obedience. But here I intend it in a stricter sense,
   for the imputation of that righteousness or moral goodness that
   consists in the obedience of Christ. And by that righteousness being
   imputed to us, is meant no other than this, that that righteousness of
   Christ is accepted for us, and admitted instead of that perfect
   inherent righteousness that ought to be in ourselves: Christ's perfect
   obedience shall be reckoned to our account so that we shall have the
   benefit of it, as though we had performed it ourselves: and so we
   suppose that a title to eternal life is given us as the reward of this
   righteousness." In the same connection, he asks, "Why is there any more
   absurdity in supposing that Christ's obedience is imputed to us, than
   that his satisfaction is imputed? If Christ has suffered the penalty of
   the law for us, and in our stead, then it will follow that his
   suffering that penalty is imputed to us, i.e., that it is accepted for
   us, and in our stead, and is reckoned to our account, as though we had
   suffered it. But why may not his obeying the law of God be as
   rationally reckoned to our account as his suffering the penalty of the
   law." He then goes on to argue that there is the same necessity for the
   one as for the other.

   Dr. Shedd says, "A second difference between the Anselmic and the
   Protestant soteriology is seen in the formal distinction of Christ's
   work into his active and his passive righteousness. By his passive
   righteousness is meant his expiatory sufferings, by which He satisfied
   the claims of justice, and by hie active righteousness is meant his
   obedience to the law as a rule of life and conduct. It was contended by
   those who made this distinction, that the purpose of Christ as the
   vicarious substitute was to meet the entire demands of the law for the
   sinner. But the law requires present and perfect obedience, as well as
   satisfaction for past disobedience. The law is not completely fulfilled
   by the endurance of penalty only. It must also be obeyed Christ both
   endured the penalty due to man for disobedience, and perfectly obeyed
   the law for him; so that He was a vicarious substitute in reference to
   both the precept and the penalty of the law. By his active obedience He
   obeyed the law, and by his passive obedience He endured the penalty. In
   this way his vicarious work is complete." [169]

   The earlier Symbols of the Reformation do not make this distinction. So
   far as the Lutheran Church is concerned, it first appears in the "Form
   of Concord" (A.D. 1576). Its statement is as follows: "That
   righteousness which is imputed to faith, or to believers, of mere
   grace, is the obedience, suffering, and resurrection of Christ, by
   which He satisfied the law for us, and expiated our sins. For since
   Christ was not only man, but truly God and man in one undivided person,
   He was no more subject to the law than He was to suffering and death
   (if his person, merely, be taken into account), because He was the Lord
   of the law Hence, not only that obedience to God his Father which He
   exhibited in his passion and death, but also that obedience which He
   exhibited in voluntarily subjecting Himself to the law and fulfilling
   it for our sakes, is imputed to us for righteousness, so that God on
   account of the total obedience which Christ accomplished (præstitit)
   for our sake before his heavenly Father, both in acting and in
   suffering, in life and in death, may remit our sins to us, regard us as
   good and righteous, and give us eternal salvation." [170] In this point
   the Reformed or Calvinistic standards agree.

   It has already been remarked that the distinction between the active
   and passive obedience of Christ is, in one view, unimportant. As Christ
   obeyed in suffering, his sufferings were as much a part of his
   obedience as his observance of the precepts of the law. The Scriptures
   do not expressly make this distinction, as they include everything that
   Christ did for our redemption under the term righteousness or
   obedience. The distinction becomes important only when it is denied
   that his moral obedience is any part of the righteousness for which the
   believer is justified, or that his whole work in making satisfaction
   consisted in expiation or bearing the penalty of the law. This is
   contrary to Scripture, and vitiates the doctrine of justification as
   presented in the Bible.

   § 6. Proof of the Doctrine.

   That the Protestant doctrine as above stated is the doctrine of the
   word of God appears from the following considerations: --

   1. The word dikaioo, as has been shown, means to declare dikaios. No
   one can be truthfully pronounced dikaios to whom dikaiosune cannot
   rightfully be ascribed. The sinner (ex vi verbi) has no righteousness
   of his own. God, therefore, imputes to him a righteousness which is not
   his own. The righteousness thus imputed is declared to be the
   righteousness of God, of Christ, the righteousness which is by faith.
   This is almost in so many words the declaration of the Bible on the
   subject. As the question, What is the method of justification? is a
   Biblical question, it must be decided exegetically, and not by
   arguments drawn from assumed principles of reason. We are not at
   liberty to say that the righteousness of one man cannot be imputed to
   another; that this would involve a mistake or absurdity; that God's
   justice does not demand a righteousness such as the law prescribes, as
   the condition of justification; that He may pardon and save as a father
   without any consideration, unless it be that of repentance; that it is
   inconsistent with his grace that the demands of justice should be met
   before justification is granted; that this view of justification makes
   it a sham, a calling a man just, when he is not just etc. All this
   amounts to nothing. It all pertains to that wisdom which is foolishness
   with God. All we have to do is to determine, (1.) What is the meaning
   of the word to justify as used in Scripture? (2.) On what ground does
   the Bible affirm that God pronounces the ungodly to be just? If the
   answer to these questions be what the Church in all ages, and
   especially the Church of the Reformation has given, then we should rest
   satisfied. The Apostle in express terms says that God imputes
   righteousness to the sinner. (Rom. iv. 6, 24.) By righteousness every
   one admits is meant that which makes a man righteous, that which the
   law demands. It does not consist in the sinner's own obedience, or
   moral excellence, for it is said to be "without works;" and it is
   declared that no man can be justified on the ground of his own
   character or conduct. Neither does this righteousness consist in faith;
   for it is "of faith," "through faith," "by faith." We are never said to
   be justified on account of faith. Neither is it a righteousness, or
   form of moral excellence springing from faith, or of which faith is the
   source or proximate cause; because it is declared to be the
   righteousness of God; a righteousness which is revealed; which is
   offered; which must be accepted as a gift. (Rom. v. 17.) It is declared
   to be the righteousness of Christ; his obedience. (Rom. v. 19.) It is,
   therefore, the righteousness of Christ, his perfect obedience in doing
   and suffering the will of God, which is imputed to the believer, and on
   the ground of which the believer, although in himself ungodly, is
   pronounced righteous, and therefore free from the curse of the law and
   entitled to eternal life.

   The Apostle's Argument.

   2. All the points above stated are not only clearly affirmed by the
   Apostle but they are also set forth in logical order, and elaborately
   sustained and vindicated in the Epistle to the Romans. The Apostle
   begins with the declaration that the Gospel "is the power of God unto
   salvation." It is not thus divinely efficacious because of the purity
   of its moral precepts; nor because it brings immortality to light; nor
   because it sets before us the perfect example of our Lord Jesus Christ;
   nor because it assures us of the love of God; nor because of the
   elevating, sanctifying, life-giving influence by which it is attended.
   There is something preliminary to all this. The first and indispensable
   requisite to salvation is that men should be righteous before God. They
   are under his wrath and curse. Until justice is satisfied, until God is
   reconciled, there is no possibility of any moral influence being of any
   avail. Therefore the Apostle says that the power of the Gospel is due
   to the fact that "therein is the righteousness of God revealed." This
   cannot mean the goodness of God, for such is not the meaning of the
   word. It cannot in this connection mean his justice, because it is a
   righteousness which is "of faith;" because the justice of God is
   revealed from heaven and to all men; because the revelation of justice
   terrifies and drives away from God; because what is here called the
   righteousness of God, is elsewhere contrasted with our "own
   righteousness" (Rom. x. 8; Phil. iii. 9); and because it is declared to
   be the righteousness of Christ (Rom. v. 18), which is (Rom. v. 19)
   explained by his "obedience," and in Romans v. 9 and elsewhere declared
   to be "his blood." This righteousness of Christ is the righteousness of
   God, because Christ is God; because God has provided, revealed, and
   offers it; and because it avails before God as a sufficient ground on
   which He can declare the believing sinner righteous. Herein lies the
   saving power of the Gospel. The question, How shall man be just with
   God? had been sounding in the ears of men from the beginning. It never
   had been answered. Yet it must be answered or there can be no hope of
   salvation. It is answered in the Gospel, and therefore the Gospel is
   the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; i.e., to
   every one, whether Jew or Gentile, bond or free, good or bad, who,
   instead of going about to establish his own righteousness, submits
   himself in joyful confidence to the righteousness which his God and
   Saviour Jesus Christ has wrought out for sinners, and which is freely
   offered to them in the Gospel without money and without price.

   This is Paul's theme, which he proceeds to unfold and establish, as has
   been already stated under a previous head. He begins by asserting, as
   indisputably true from the revelation of God in the constitution of our
   nature, that God is just, that He will punish sin; that He cannot
   pronounce him righteous who is not righteous. He then shows from
   experience and from Scripture, first as regards the Gentiles, then as
   regards the Jews, that there is none righteous, no not one; that the
   whole world is guilty before God. There is therefore no difference,
   since all have sinned.

   Since the righteousness which the law requires cannot be found in the
   sinner nor be rendered by him, God has revealed another righteousness
   (Rom. iii. 21); "the righteousness of God," granted to every one who
   believes. Men are not justified for what they are or for what they do,
   but for what Christ has done for them. God has set Him forth as a
   propitiation for sin, in order that He might be just and yet the
   justifier of them that believe.

   The Apostle teaches that such has been the method of justification from
   the beginning. It was witnessed by the law and the prophets. There had
   never, since the fall, been any other way of justification possible for
   men. As God justified Abraham because he believed in the promise of
   redemption through the Messiah; so He justifies those now who believe
   in the fulfilment of that promise. (Rom. iv. 3, 9, 24.) It was not
   Abraham's believing state of mind that was taken for righteousness. It
   is not faith in the believer now; not faith as a virtue, or as a source
   of a new life, which renders us righteous. It is faith in a specific
   promise. Righteousness, says the Apostle, is imputed to us, "if we
   believe on Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead." (Rom. iv.
   24.) Or, as he expresses it in Romans x. 9, "If thou shalt confess with
   thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God
   hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved." The promise which
   Abraham believed, is the promise which we believe (Gal. iii. 14); and
   the relation of faith to justification, in his case, is precisely what
   it is in ours. He and we are justified simply because we trust in the
   Messiah for our salvation. Hence, as the Apostle says, the Scriptures
   are full of thanksgiving to God for gratuitous pardon, for free
   justification, for the imputation of righteousness to those who have no
   righteousness of their own. This method of justification, he goes on to
   show, is adapted to all mankind. God is not the God of the Jews only
   but also of the Gentiles. It secures peace and reconciliation with God.
   (Rom. v. 1-3.) It renders salvation certam, for if we are saved not by
   what we are in ourselves, but for what Christ has done for us, we may
   be sure that if we are "justified by his blood, we shall be saved from
   wrath through him." (Rom. v. 9.) This method of justification, he
   further shows, and this only, secures sanctification, namely, holiness
   of heart and life. it is only those who are reconciled to God by the
   death of his Son, that are "saved by his life." (v. 10.) This idea he
   expands and vindicates in the sixth and seventh chapters of this
   Epistle.

   The Parallel between Adam and Christ.

   3. Not content with this clear and formal statement of the truth that
   sinners can be justified only through the imputation of a righteousness
   not their own; and that the righteousness thus imputed is the
   righteousness (active and passive if that distinction be insisted upon)
   of the Lord Jesus Christ; he proceeds to illustrate this doctrine by
   drawing a parallel between Adam and Christ. The former, he says, was a
   type of the latter. There is an analogy between our relation to Adam
   and our relation to Christ. We are so united to Adam that his first
   transgression was the ground of the sentence of condemnation being
   passed on all mankind, and on account of that condemnation we derive
   from him a corrupt nature so that all mankind descending from him by
   ordinary generation, come into the world in a state of spiritual death.
   In like manner we are so united to Christ, when we believe, that his
   obedience is the ground on which a sentence of justification passes
   upon all thus in Him, and in consequence of that sentence they derive
   from Him a new, holy, divine, and imperishable principle of spiritual
   life. These truths are expressed in explicit terms. "The judgment was
   by one (offence) to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences
   unto justification." (Rom. v. 16.) "Therefore as by the offence of one
   judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the
   righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification
   of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
   the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." (v. 18, 19.) These
   two great truths, namely, the imputation of Adam's sin and the
   imputation of Christ's righteousness, have graven themselves on the
   consciousness of the Church universal. They have been reviled,
   misrepresented, and denounced by theologians, but they have stood their
   ground in the faith of God's people, just as the primary truths of
   reason have ever retained control over the mass of men, in spite of all
   the speculations of philosophers. It is not meant that the truths just
   mentioned have always been expressed in the terms just given; but the
   truths themselves have been, and still are held by the people of God,
   wherever found, among the Greeks, Latins, or Protestants. The fact that
   the race fell in Adam; that the evils which come upon us on account of
   his transgression are penal; and that men are born in a state of sin
   and condemnation, are outstanding facts of Scripture and experience,
   and are avowed every time the sacrament of baptism is administered to
   an infant. No less universal is the conviction of the other great
   truth. It is implied in every act of saving faith which includes trust
   in what Christ has done for us as the ground of our acceptance with
   God, as opposed to anything done by us or wrought in us. As a single
   proof of the hold which this conviction has on the Christian
   consciousness, reference may be made to the ancient direction for the
   visitation of the sick, attributed to Anselm, but of doubtful
   authorship: "Dost thou believe that thou canst not be saved, but by the
   death of Christ? The sick man answereth, Yes. Then let it be said unto
   him, Go to, then, and whilst thy soul abideth in thee, put all thy
   confidence in this death alone, place thy trust in no other thing,
   commit thyself wholly to this death, cover thyself wholly with this
   alone, cast thyself wholly on this death, wrap thyself wholly in this
   death. And if God would judge them, say, Lord, I place the death of our
   Lord Jesus Christ between me and thy judgment, and otherwise I will not
   contend, or enter into judgment with thee. And if He shall say unto
   thee, that thou art a sinner, say, I place the death of our Lord Jesus
   Christ between me and my sins. If He shall say unto thee, that thou
   hast deserved damnation, say, Lord, I put the death of our Lord Jesus
   Christ between thee and all my sins; and I offer his merits for my own,
   which I should have, and have not. If He say that He is angry with
   thee: say, Lord, I place the death of our Lord Jesus Christ between me
   and thy anger." [171]

   Such being the real and only foundation of a sinner's hope towards God,
   it is of the last importance that it should not only be practically
   held by the people, but that it should also be clearly presented and
   maintained by the clergy. It is not what we do or are, but solely what
   Christ is and has done that can avail for our justification before the
   bar of God.

   Other Passages teaching the same Doctrine.

   4. This doctrine of the imputation of the righteousness of Christ; or,
   in other words, that his righteousness is the judicial ground of the
   believer's justification, is not only formally and argumentatively
   presented as in the passages cited, but it is constantly asserted or
   implied in the word of God. The Apostle argues, in the fourth chapter
   of his Epistle to the Romans, that every assertion or promise of
   gratuitous forgiveness of sin to be found in the Scriptures involves
   this doctrine. He proceeds on the assumption that God is just; that He
   demands a righteousness of those whom He justifies. If they have no
   righteousness of their own, one on just grounds must be imputed to
   them. If, therefore, He forgives sin, it must be that sin is covered,
   that justice has been satisfied. "David, also," he says, "describeth
   the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness
   without works; saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,
   and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
   not impute sin." (Rom. iv. 6-8.) Not to impute sin implies the
   imputation of righteousness.

   In Romans v. 9, we are said to be "justified by his blood." In Romans
   iii. 25, God is said to have set Him forth as a propitiation for sin,
   that He might be just in justifying the ungodly. As to justify does not
   mean to pardon, but judicially to pronounce righteous, this passage
   distinctly asserts that the work of Christ is the ground on which the
   sentence of justification is passed. In Romans x. 3, 4, he says of the
   Jews, "They being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to
   establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto
   the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for
   righteousness to every one that believeth." It can hardly be questioned
   that the word (dikaiosune) righteousness must have the same meaning in
   both members of the first of these verses. If a man's "own
   righteousness" is that which would render him righteous, then "the
   righteousness of God," in this connection, must be a justifying
   righteousness. It is called the righteousness of God, because, as said
   before, He is its author. It is the righteousness of Christ. It is
   provided, offered, and accepted of God. Here then are two
   righteousnesses; the one human, the other divine; the one valueless,
   the other infinitely meritorious. The folly of the Jews, and of
   thousands since their day, consists in refusing the latter and trusting
   to the former. This folly the Apostle makes apparent in the fourth
   verse. The Jews acted under the assumption that the law as a covenant,
   that is, as prescribing the conditions of salvation, was still in
   force, that men were still bound to satisfy its demands by their
   personal obedience in order to be saved, whereas Christ had made an end
   of the law. He had abolished it as a covenant, in order that men might
   be justified by faith. Christ, however, has thus made an end of the
   law, not by merely setting it aside, but by satisfying its demands. He
   delivers us from its curse, not by mere pardon, but by being made a
   curse for us. (Gal. iii. 13.) He redeems us from the law by being made
   under it (Gal. iv. 4, 5), and fulfilling all righteousness.

   In Philippians iii. 8, 9, the Apostle says, he "suffered the loss of
   all things," that he might be found in Christ, not having his "own
   righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith
   of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith." Here again
   one's own righteousness is contrasted with that which is of God. The
   word must have the same sense in both members. What Paul trusted to,
   was not his own righteousness, not his own subjective goodness, but a
   righteousness provided for him and received by faith. De Wette (no
   Augustinian) on this passage says, the righteousness of God here
   means," a righteousness received from God (graciously imputed) on
   condition of faith" ("die von Gott empfangene (aus Gnaden zugerechnete)
   Gerechtigkeit um des Glaubenswillen.")

   The Apostle says (1 Cor. i. 30), Christ of God is made unto us wisdom,
   and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption." In this
   enumeration sanctification and righteousness are distinguished. The one
   renders us holy; the other renders us just, i.e., satisfies the demands
   of justice. As Christ is to us the source of inward spiritual life, so
   He is the giver of that righteousness which secures our justification.
   Justification is not referred to sanctification as its proximate cause
   and ground. On the contrary, the gift of righteousness precedes that of
   sanctification. We are justified in order that we may be sanctified.
   The point here, however, is that righteousness is distinguished from
   anything and everything in us which can recommend us to the favour of
   God. We are accepted, justified, and saved, not for what we are, but
   for what He has done in our behalf. God "made him to be sin for us, who
   knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." (2
   Cor. v. 21.) As Christ was not made sin in a moral sense; so we are not
   (in justification) made righteousness in a moral sense. As He was made
   sin in that He "bare our sins;" so we are made righteousness in that we
   bear his righteousness. Our sins were the judicial ground of his
   humiliation under the law and of all his sufferings; so his
   righteousness is the judicial ground of our justification. In other
   words, as our sins were imputed to Him; so his righteousness is imputed
   to us. If imputation of sin did not render Him morally corrupt; the
   imputation of righteousness does not make us holy or morally good.

   Argument from the General Teachings of the Bible.

   5. It is unnecessary to dwell upon particular passages in support of a
   doctrine which pervades the whole Scriptures. The question is, What is
   the ground of the pardon of sin and of the acceptance of the believe as
   righteous (in the forensic or judicial sense of the word), in the sight
   of God? Is it anything we do, anything experienced by us, or wrought in
   us; or, is it what Christ has done for us? The whole revelation of God
   concerning the method of salvation shows that it is the latter and not
   the former. In the first place, this is plain from what the Scriptures
   teach of the covenant of redemption between the Father and the Son.
   That there was such covenant cannot be denied if the meaning of the
   words be once agreed upon. It is plain from Scripture that Christ came
   into the world to do a certain work, on a certain condition. The
   promise made to Him was that a multitude whom no man can number, of the
   fallen race of man, should be saved. This included the promise that
   they should be justified, sanctified, and made partakers of eternal
   life. The very nature of this transaction involves the idea of
   vicarious substitution. It assumes that what He was to do was to be the
   ground of the justification, sanctification, and salvation of his
   people.

   In the second place this is involved in the nature of the work which He
   came to perform. He was to assume our nature, to be born of a woman, to
   take part of flesh and blood with all their infirmities, yet without
   sin. He was to take his place among sinners; be made subject to the law
   which they are bound to obey, and to endure the curse which they had
   incurred. If this be so, then what He did is the ground of our
   salvation from first to last; of our pardon, of our reconciliation with
   God, of the acceptance of our persons, of the indwelling of the Spirit,
   of our being transformed into His image, and of our admission into
   heaven. "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name give
   glory," has, therefore, been the spontaneous language of every believer
   from the beginning until now.

   In the third place, the manner in which Christ was to execute the work
   assigned as described in the prophets, and the way in which it was
   actually accomplished as described by Himself and by his Apostles,
   prove that what He did and suffered is the ground of our salvation. He
   says that He came "to give his life a ransom for many." (Matt. xx. 28.)
   "There is one God," says the Apostle, "and one mediator between God and
   men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave Himself a ransom for all." (1 Tim.
   ii. 5, 6.) The deliverance effected by a ransom has no reference to the
   character or conduct of the redeemed. Its effects are due exclusively
   to the ransom paid. It is, therefore, to deny that Christ was a ransom,
   that we are redeemed by his blood, to affirm that the proximate ground
   of our deliverance from the curse of the law and of our introduction
   into the liberty of the sons of God, is anything wrought in us or done
   by us. Again, from the beginning to the end of the Bible, Christ is
   represented as a sacrifice. From the first institution of sacrifices in
   the family of Adam; during the patriarchal period; in all the varied
   and costly ritual of the Mosaic law; in the predictions of the
   prophets; in the clear didactic statements of the New Testament, it is
   taught with a constancy, a solemnity, and an amplitude, which proves it
   to be a fundamental and vital element of the divine plan of redemption,
   that the Redeemer was to save his people by offering himself as a
   sacrifice unto God in their behalf. There is no one characteristic of
   the plan of salvation more deeply engraven on the hearts of Christians,
   which more effectually determines their inward spiritual life, which so
   much pervades their prayers and praises, or which is so directly the
   foundation of their hopes, as the sacrificial nature of the death of
   Christ. Strike from the Bible the doctrine of redemption by the blood
   of Christ, and what have we left? But if Christ saves us as a
   sacrifice, then it is what He does for us, his objective work, and
   nothing subjective, nothing in us, which is the ground of our
   salvation, and of all that salvation includes. For even our
   sanctification is due to his death. His blood cleanses from all sin. (1
   John i. 7.) It cleanses from the guilt of sin by expiation; and secures
   inward sanctification by securing the gift of the Holy Spirit.

   Again, the whole Bible is full of the idea of substitution. Christ took
   our place. He undertook to do for us what we could not do for
   ourselves. This is taught in every possible way. He bore our sins. He
   died for us and in our place. He was made under the law for us. He was
   made a curse for us. He was made sin for us that we might be made the
   righteousness of God in Him. The chastisement of our peace was laid on
   Him. Everything, therefore, which the Bible teaches of the method of
   salvation, is irreconcilable with the doctrine of subjective
   justification in all its forms. We are always and everywhere referred
   to something out of ourselves as the ground of our confidence toward
   God.

   In the fourth place, the effects ascribed to the work of Christ, as
   before remarked, are such as do not flow from anything in the believer
   himself, but must be referred to what has been done for him. These
   effects are expiation of sin, propitiation, the gift and indwelling of
   the life-giving Spirit of God; redemption, or deliverance from all
   forms of evil; and a title to eternal life and actual participation in
   the exaltation, glory, and blessedness of the Son of God. It is out of
   all question that these wonderful effects should be referred to what we
   personally are; to our merit, to our holiness, to our participation of
   the life of Christ. In whatever sense these last words may be
   understood, they refer to what we personally are or become. His life in
   us is after all a form of our life. It constitutes our character. And
   it is self-evident to the conscience that our character is not, and
   cannot be the ground of our pardon, of God's peculiar love, or of our
   eternal glory and blessedness in heaven.

   In the fifth place, the condition on which our participation of the
   benefits of redemption is suspended, is inconsistent with any form of
   the doctrine of subjective justification. We are never said to be
   justified on account of faith, considered either as an act or as a
   principle, as an exercise or as a permanent state of the mind. Faith is
   never said to be the ground of justification Nor are we saved by faith
   as the source of holiness or of spiritual life in the soul, or as the
   organ of receiving the infused life of God. We are saved simply "by"
   faith, by receiving and resting upon Christ alone for salvation. The
   thing received is something out of ourselves. It is Christ, his
   righteousness, his obedience, the merit of his blood or death. We look
   to Him. We flee to Him. We lay hold on Him. We hide ourselves in Him.
   We are clothed in his righteousness. The Romanist indeed says, that an
   Ethiopian in a white robe does not become white. True, but a suit of
   armor gives security from the sword or spear, and that is what we need
   before attending to the state of our complexion. We need protection
   from the wrath of God in the first instance. The inward transformation
   of the soul into his likeness is provided for by other means.

   In the sixth place and finally, the fact that we are saved by grace
   proves that the ground of salvation is not in ourselves. The grace of
   God, his love for the unlovely, for the guilty and polluted, is
   represented in the Bible as the most mysterious of the divine
   perfections. It was hidden in God. It could not be discovered by
   reason, neither was it revealed prior to the redemption of man. The
   specific object of the plan of salvation is the manifestation of this
   most wonderful, most attractive, and most glorious attribute of the
   divine nature. Everything connected with our salvation, says the
   Apostle, is intended for the "praise of the glory of his grace" (Eph.
   i. 6.) God hath quickened us, he says, and raised us up, and made us
   sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, in order "that in the
   ages to come, he might show the exceeding riches of his grace, in his
   kindness toward us, through Christ Jesus."

   From their nature, grace and works are antithetical. The one excludes
   the other. What is of grace, is not of works. And by works in
   Scripture, in relation to this subject, is meant not individual acts
   only, but states of mind, anything and everything internal of which
   moral character can be predicated. When, therefore, it is said that
   salvation is of grace and not of works, it is thereby said that it is
   not founded upon anything in the believer himself. It was not any moral
   excellence in man, that determined God to interpose for his redemption,
   while He left the apostate angels to their fate. This was a matter of
   grace. To deny this, and to make the provision of a plan of salvation
   for man a matter of justice, is in such direct contradiction to
   everything in the Bible, that it hardly ever has been openly asserted.
   The gift of his Son for the redemption of man is ever represented as
   the most wonderful display of unmerited love. That some and not all men
   are actually saved, is expressly declared to be not of works, not on
   account of anything distinguishing favourably the one class from the
   other, but a matter of pure grace. When a sinner is pardoned and
   restored to the favour of God, this again is declared to be of grace.
   If of grace it is not founded upon anything in the sinner himself. Now
   as the Scriptures not only teach that the plan of salvation is thus
   gratuitous in its inception, execution, and application, but also
   insist upon this characteristic of the plan as of vital importance, and
   even go so far as to teach that unless we consent to be saved by grace,
   we cannot be saved at all, it of necessity follows that the doctrine of
   subjective justification is contrary to the whole spirit of the Bible.
   That doctrine in all its forms teaches that that which secures our
   acceptance with God, is something in ourselves, something which
   constitutes character. If so, then salvation is not of grace; and if
   not of grace, it is unattainable by sinners.

   § 7. The Consequences of the Imputation of Righteousness.

   It is frequently said that justification consists in the pardon of sin
   and in the imputation of righteousness. This mode of statement is
   commonly adopted by Lutheran theologians. This exhibition of the
   doctrine is founded upon the sharp distinction made in the "Form of
   Concord" between the passive and active obedience of Christ. To the
   former is referred the remission of the penalty due to us for sin; to
   the latter our title to eternal life. The Scriptures, however, do not
   make this distinction so prominent. Our justification as a whole is
   sometimes referred to the blood of Christ, and sometimes to his
   obedience. This is intelligible because the crowning act of his
   obedience, and that without which all else had been unavailing, was his
   laying down his life for us. It is, perhaps, more correct to say that
   the righteousness of Christ, including all He did and suffered in our
   stead, is imputed to the believer as the ground of his justification,
   and that the consequences of this imputation are, first, the remission
   of sin, and secondly, the acceptance of the believer as righteous. And
   if righteous, then he is entitled to be so regarded and treated.

   By the remission of sin Romanists understand the removal of the
   pollution of sin. So that their definition of justification as
   consisting in the remission of sin and infusion of righteousness, is
   only a statement of the negative and positive aspects of
   sanctification, i.e., putting off the old man and putting on the new
   man. The effect of remission is constantly declared to be that nothing
   of the nature of sin remains in the soul. The Council of Trent says,
   "Justificatio . . . . non est sola peccatorum remissio, sed et
   sanctificatio, et renovatio interioris hominis per voluntariam
   susceptionem gratiæ et donorum. . . . . Quanquam nemo possit esse
   justus, nisi cui merita passionis Domini nostri Jesu Christi
   communicantur: id tamen in hac impii justificatione fit, dum ejusdem
   sanctissimæ passionis merito per Spiritum Sanctum caritas Dei
   diffunditur in cordibus eorum, qui justificantur, atque ipsis inhæret."
   "Quibus verbis justificationis impii descriptio insinuatur, ut sit
   translatio ab eo statu, in quo homo nascitur filius primi Adæ, in
   statum gratiæ et adoptionis filiorum Dei, per secundum Adam Jesum
   Christum, salvatorem nostrum: quæ quidem translatio post evangelium
   promulgatum sine lavacro regenerationis, aut ejus voto fieri non
   potest." [172] By "status gratiæ" in this definition is not meant a
   state of favour, but a state of subjective grace or holiness; because
   in other places and most commonly justification is said to consist in
   the infusion of grace. In this definition, therefore, the pardon of sin
   in the proper sense of the words is not included. Bellarmin [173] says
   this translation into a state of adoption as sons of God, "non potest
   . . . . fieri, nisi homo per remissionem peccati desinat esse impius;
   et per infusionem justitiæ incipiat esse pius. Sed sicut aër cum
   illustratur a sole per idem lumen, quod recipit, desinit esse
   tenebrosus et incipit esse lucidus: sic etiam homo per eandem justitiam
   sibi a sole justitiæ donatam atque infusam desinit esse injustus,
   delente videlicet lumine gratiæ tenebras peccatorum." The remission of
   sin is therefore defined to be the removal of sin. Bellarmin argues in
   support of this view that guilt is removed by holiness, that guilt is a
   relation; the relation of sin to justice. When the thing itself is
   taken away, the relation itself of course ceases. [174] Hence remission
   of sin, even in the sense of pardon, is effected by the infusion of
   righteousness, as darkness is banished by the introduction of light. It
   is thus, as remarked above, that guilt is either ignored, or reduced to
   a minimum by the Romish theory of justification. There is really no
   satisfaction of justice in the case. The merits of Christ avail to
   secure for man the gift of the Holy Ghost, by whose power as exercised
   in the sacrament of baptism, the soul is made holy, and by the
   introduction of holiness everything of the nature of sin is banished,
   and all ground for the infliction of punishment is removed. A scheme so
   opposed to Scripture, and so inconsistent with even the natural
   conscience, cannot be practically adopted by the mass of the people.
   The conviction is too intimate that the desert of punishment is not
   removed by the reformation, or even by the regeneration of the sinner,
   to allow the conscience to be satisfied with any scheme of salvation
   which does not provide for the expiation of the guilt of sin by what
   really satisfies the justice of God.

   In the Bible, therefore, as well as in common life, pardon is not a
   mere consequence of sanctification. It is exemption from the infliction
   of the deserved penalty of the law. Whether this exemption is a mere
   matter of caprice, or unworthy partiality for the offender, or for
   considerations of expediency, or at the promptings of compassion, or
   upon the ground of an adequate satisfaction to the demands of justice,
   makes no difference so far as the nature of pardon is concerned. It is
   in all cases the remission of a penalty adjudged to be deserved. It is
   in this sense, therefore, that justification is declared to include the
   pardon of sins, founded on the imputation to the believing sinner of
   the perfect righteousness of Christ. It is this that gives the believer
   peace. He sees that he is delivered from "the wrath and curse of God"
   due to him, not by any arbitrary exercise of executive authority, but
   because God, as a righteous judge, can, in virtue of the propitiation
   of Christ, be just and yet justify the ungodly.

   The sins which are pardoned in justification include all sins, past,
   present, and future. It does indeed seem to be a solecism that sins
   should be forgiven before they are committed. Forgiveness involves
   remission of penalty. But how can a penalty be remitted before it is
   incurred? This is only an apparent difficulty arising out of the
   inadequacy of human language. The righteousness of Christ is a
   perpetual donation. It is a robe which hides, or as the Bible expresses
   it, covers from the eye of justice the sins of the believer. They are
   sins; they deserve the wrath and curse of God, but the necessity for
   the infliction of that curse no longer exists. The believer feels the
   constant necessity for confession and prayer for pardon, but the ground
   of pardon is ever present for him to offer and plead. So that it would
   perhaps be a more correct statement to say that in justification the
   believer receives the promise that God will not deal with him according
   to his transgressions, rather than to say that sins are forgiven before
   they are committed.

   This subject is thus presented by the Apostle: believers "are not under
   the law but under grace." (Rom. vi. 14.) They are not under a legal
   system administered according to the principles of retributive justice,
   a system which requires perfect obedience as the condition of
   acceptance with God, and which says, "Cursed is every one that
   continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law
   to do them." They are under grace, that is, under a system in which
   believers are not dealt with on the principles of justice, but on the
   principles of undeserved mercy, in which God does not impute "their
   trespasses unto them." (2 Cor. v. 19.) There is therefore to them no
   condemnation. They are not condemned for their sins, not because they
   are not sins and do not deserve condemnation, but because Christ has
   already made expiation for their guilt and makes continual intercession
   for them.

   The second consequence attributed to the imputation of Christ's
   righteousness, is a title to eternal life. This in the older writers is
   often expressed by the words "adoption and heirship." Being made the
   children of God by faith in Christ Jesus (Gal. iii. 26), they are heirs
   of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ of a heavenly inheritance.
   (Rom. viii. 17.) The mere expiation of guilt confers no title to
   eternal life. The condition of the covenant under which man was placed
   was perfect obedience. This, from all that appears in Scripture, the
   perfection of God requires. As He never pardons sins unless the demands
   of justice be satisfied, so He never grants eternal life unless perfect
   obedience be rendered. Heaven is always represented as a purchased
   possession. In the covenant between the Father and the Son the
   salvation of his people was promised as the reward of his humiliation,
   obedience, and death. Having performed the stipulated conditions. He
   has a claim to the promised recompense. And this claim inures to the
   benefit of his people. But besides this, as the work of Christ
   consisted in his doing all that the law of God, or covenant of works
   requires for the salvation of men, and as that righteousness is freely
   offered to every one that believes, every such believer has as valid a
   claim to eternal life as he would have had, had he personally done all
   that the law demands. Thus broad and firm is the foundation which God
   has laid for the hopes of his people. It is the rock of ages; Jehovah
   our righteousness.

   § 8. Relation of Faith to Justification.

   All who profess to be Christians admit the doctrine of justification by
   faith. There are different views, however, as to the relation between
   faith and justification, as has been already intimated.

   1. Pelagians and rationalists teach that faith in God's being and
   perfection, or in the great principles of moral and religious truth, is
   the source of that moral excellence on account of which we are accepted
   of God. It is perhaps only a different way of expressing the same idea,
   to say that God, in the case of Abraham, and, therefore, of other men,
   accepts the pious state of mind involved in the exercise of faith or
   confidence in God, in lieu of perfect righteousness.

   2. Romanists make faith mere assent. It does not justify as a virtue,
   or as apprehending the offered righteousness of Christ. It is neither
   the formal nor the instrumental cause of justification, it is merely
   the predisposing or occasional cause. A man assents to the truth of
   Christianity, and to the more special truth that the Church is a divine
   institution for saving men. He therefore comes to the Church and
   receives the sacrament of baptism, by which, "ex opere operato," a
   habit of grace, or spiritual life is infused into the soul, which is
   the formal cause of justification; i.e., it renders the soul inherently
   just or holy. In this sense the sinner may be said to be justified by
   faith. This is the first justification. After the man is thus rendered
   holy or regenerated, then the exercises of faith have real merit, and
   enter into the ground of his second justification, by which he becomes
   entitled to eternal life. But here faith stands on a level with other
   Christian graces. It is not the only, nor the most important ground of
   justification. It is in this view inferior to love, from which faith
   indeed derives all its virtue as a Christian grace. It is then "fides
   formata," i.e., faith of which love s the essence, the principle which
   gives it character.

   The Romish Doctrine.

   According to the Romish scheme (1.) God is the efficient cause of
   justification, as it is by his power or supernatural grace that the
   soul is made just. (2.) Christ is the meritorious cause, as it is for
   his sake God grants this saving grace, or influence of the Spirit to
   the children of men. (3.) Inherent righteousness is the formal cause,
   since thereby the soul is made really just or holy. (4.) Faith is the
   occasional and predisposing cause, as it leads the sinner to seek
   justification (regeneration), and disposes God to grant the blessing.
   In this aspect it has the merit of congruity only, not that of
   condignity. (5.) Baptism is the essential instrumental cause, as it is
   only through or by baptism that inherent righteousness is infused or
   justification is effected. So much for the first justification. After
   this justification, which makes the sinner holy, then, (6.) Good works,
   all the fruits and exercises of the new life, have real merit and
   constitute the ground of the Christian's title to eternal life.

   The language of the Council of Trent on this subject is as follows:
   "Hujus justificationis causæ sunt, finalis quidem, gloria Dei et
   Christi, ac vita æterna: efficiens vero, misericors Deus, qui gratuito
   abluit et sanctificat, signans et ungens Spiritu promissionis
   sancto, . . . . meritoria autem dilectissimus unigenitus suus, Dominus
   noster, Jesus Christus, qui, cum essemus inimici, propter nimiam
   caritatem, qua dilexit nos, sua sanctissima passione in ligno crucis
   nobis justificationem [i.e., regeneration] meruit et pro nobis Deo
   Patri satisfecit: instrumentalis item, sacramentum baptismi, quod est
   sacramentum fidei, sine qua nulli unquam contigit justificatio: demum
   unica formalis causa est justitia Dei, non qua ipse justus est, sed qua
   nos justos facit: qua videlicet ab eo donati, renovamur spiritu mentis
   nostræ, et non modo reputamur, sed vere justi nominamur, et sumus,
   justitiam in nobis recipientes, unusquisque suam secundum mensuram,
   quam Spiritus Sanctus partitur singulis prout vult, et secundum
   propriam cujusque dispositionem et cooperationem." Again, it is said:
   "Quæ enim justitia nostra dicitur, quia per eam nobis inhærentem
   justificamur; illa eadem Dei est, quia a Deo nobis infunditur per
   Christi meritum." [175] All this relates to the first justifications or
   regeneration, in which the soul passes from spiritual death to
   spiritual Life. Of the second justification, which gives a title to
   eternal life, Bellarmin says, [176] "Habet communis catholicorum omnium
   sententia, opera bona justorum vere, ac proprie esse merita, et merita
   non cujuscunque præmii, sed ipsius vitæ æternæ." The thirty-second
   canon of the Tridentine Council at this sixth session anathematizes any
   one who teaches a different doctrine. "Si quis dixerit, hominis
   justificati bona opera ita esse dona Dei, ut non sint etiam bona ipsius
   justificati merita; aut ipsum justificatum bonis operibus, quæ ab eo
   per Dei gratiam et Jesu Christi meritum, cujus vivum membrum est,
   fiunt, non vere mereri augmentum gratiæ, vitam æternam, et ipsius vitæ
   æternæ, si tamen in gratia decesserit, consecutionem, atque etiam
   gloriæ augmentum; anathema sit." It appears from all this that,
   according to the doctrine of the Church of Rome, faith has no special
   or direct connection with justification, and that "justification by
   faith" in that Church means something entirely different from what is
   intended by those words in the lips of evangelical Christians.

   Remonstrant View.

   3. According to the Remonstrants or Arminians, faith is the ground of
   justification. Under the Gospel God accepts our imperfect obedience
   including faith and springing from it, in place of the perfect
   obedience demanded by the law originally given to Adam. There is one
   passage in the Bible, or rather one form of expression, which occurs in
   several places, which seems to favour this view of the subject. In
   Romans iv. 3, it is said, "Abraham believed God, and it was counted
   unto him for righteousness;" and again in ver. 22 of that chapter, and
   in Galatians iii. 6. If this phrase be interpreted according to the
   analogy of such passages as Romans ii. 26, "Shall not his
   uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?" it does mean that faith is
   taken or accepted for righteousness. The Bible, however, is the word of
   God and therefore self-consistent. Consequently if a passage admits of
   one interpretation inconsistent with the teaching of the Bible in other
   places, and of another interpretation consistent with that teaching, we
   are bound to accept the latter. This rule, simple and obvious as it is,
   is frequently violated, not only by those who deny the inspiration of
   the Scriptures, but even by men professing to recognize their
   infallible authority. They seem to regard it as a proof of independence
   to make each passage mean simply what its grammatical structure and
   logical connection indicate, without the least regard to the analogy of
   Scripture. This is unreasonable. In Genesis xv. we are told that
   Abraham lamented before the Lord that he was childless, and that one
   born in his house was  to be his heir. And God said unto him, "This
   shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own
   bowels, shall be thine heir. And he brought him forth abroad, and said,
   Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number
   them. And he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. And he believed in
   the Lord: and He counted it to him for righteousness." Taking this
   passage by itself, it is inferred that the object of Abraham's faith
   was the promise of a numerous posterity. Supposing this to be true,
   which it certainly is not, what right has any one to assume that
   Abraham's faith's being imputed to him for righteousness, means
   anything more than when it is said that the zeal of Phinehas was
   imputed for righteousness (Ps. cvi. 31); or when in Deuteronomy xxiv.
   13, it is said that to return a poor man's pledge "shall be
   righteousness unto thee before the Lord thy God." No one supposes that
   one manifestation of zeal, or one act of benevolence, is taken for
   complete obedience to the law. All that the phrase "to impute for
   righteousness" by itself means, according to Old Testament usage, is,
   to esteem as right, to approve. The zeal of Phinehas was right.
   Returning a poor man's pledge was right. These were acts which God
   approved. And so He approved of Abraham's faith. He gained the favour
   of God by believing. Now while this is true, far more, as the Apostle
   teaches, is true. He teaches, first, that the great promise made to
   Abraham, and faith in which secured his justification, was not that his
   natural descendants should be as numerous as the stars of heaven, but
   that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed;
   secondly, that the seed intended was not a multitude, but one person,
   and that that one person was Christ (Gal. iii. 16); and, thirdly, that
   the blessing which the seed of Abraham was to secure for the world was
   redemption. "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being
   made a curse for us: . . . . that the blessing ol Abraham (i.e., the
   promise made to Abraham) might come on" us. The promise made to
   Abraham, therefore, was redemption through Christ. Hence those who are
   Christ's, the Apostle teaches, are Abraham's seed and heirs of his
   promise. What, therefore, Abraham believed, was that the seed of the
   woman, the Shiloh, the promised Redeemer of the world, was to be born
   of him. He believed in Christ, as his Saviour, as his righteousness,
   and deliverer, and therefore it was that he was accepted as righteous,
   not for the merit of his faith, and not on the ground of faith, or by
   taking faith in lieu of righteousness, but because he received and
   rested on Christ alone for his salvation.

   Unless such be the meaning of the Apostle, it is hard to see how there
   is any coherence or force in his arguments. His object is to prove that
   men are justified, not by works, but gratuitously; not for what they
   are or do, but for what is done for them. They are saved by a ransom;
   by a sacrifice. But it is absurd to say that trust in a ransom redeems,
   or is taken in place of the ransom; or that faith in a sacrifice, and
   not the sacrifice itself, is the ground of acceptance. To prove that
   such is the Scriptural method of justification, Paul appeals to the
   case of Abraham. He was not justified for his works, but by faith in a
   Redeemer. He expected to be justified as ungodly. (Rom. iv. 5.) This,
   he tells us, is what we must do. We have no righteousness of our own.
   We must take Christ for our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and
   redemption. In the immediately preceding chapter the Apostle had said
   we are justified by faith in the blood of Christ, as a propitiation for
   sin; and for him to prove this from the fact that Abraham was justified
   on account of his confiding, trusting state of mind, which led him to
   believe that, although a hundred years old, he should be the father of
   a numerous posterity, would be a contradiction.

   Besides, it is to be remembered, not only that the Scriptures never say
   that we are justified "on account" of faith (dia pistin), but always
   "by," or "through" faith (dia or ek pisteos or pistei); but also that
   it is not by faith as such; not by faith in God, nor in the Scriptures;
   and not by faith in a specific divine promise such as that made to
   Abraham of a numerous posterity, or of the possession of the land of
   Canaan; but only by faith in one particular promise, namely, that of
   salvation through Christ. It is, therefore, not on account of the state
   of mind, of which faith is the evidence, nor of the good works which
   are its fruits, but only by faith as an act of trust in Christ, that we
   are justified. This of necessity supposes that He, and not our faith,
   is the ground of our justification. He, and not our faith, is the
   ground of our confidence. How can any Christian wish it to be
   otherwise? What comparison is there between the absolutely perfect and
   the infinitely meritorious righteousness of Christ, and our own
   imperfect evangelical obedience as a ground of confidence and peace!

   This doctrine is moreover dishonouring to the Gospel. It supposes the
   Gospel to be less holy than the law. The law required perfect
   obedience; the Gospel is satisfied with imperfect obedience. And how
   imperfect and insufficient our best obedience is the conscience of
   every believer certifies. If it does not satisfy us, how can it satisfy
   God?

   The grand objection, however, to this Remonstrant doctrine is to the
   relation between faith and justification, is that it is in direct
   contradiction to the plain and pervading teachings of the Word of God.
   The Bible teaches that we are not justified by works. This doctrine
   affirms that we are justified by works. The Bible teaches that we are
   justified by the blood of Christ; that it is for his obedience that the
   sentence of justification is passed on men. This doctrine affirms that
   God pronounces us righteous because of our own righteousness. The Bible
   from first to last teaches that the whole ground of our salvation or of
   our justification is objective, what Christ as our Redeemer, our
   ransom, our sacrifice, our surety, has done for us. This doctrine
   teaches us to look within, to what we are and to what we do, as the
   ground of our acceptance with God. It may safely be said that this is
   altogether unsatisfactory to the awakened conscience. The sinner cannot
   rely on anything in himself. He instinctively looks to Christ, to his
   work done for us as the ground of confidence and peace. This in the
   last resort is the hope of all believers, whatever their theory of
   justification may be. Whether Papist, Remonstrant, or Augustinian, they
   all cast their dying eyes on Christ. "As Moses lifted up the serpent in
   the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; that
   whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life."

   Protestant Doctrine.

   4. The common doctrine of Protestants on this subject is that faith is
   merely the instrumental cause of justification. It is the act of
   receiving and resting upon Christ, and has no other relation to the end
   than any other act by which a proffered good is accepted. This is
   clearly the doctrine of Scripture, (1.) Because we are constantly said
   to be justified by, or through faith. (2.) Because the faith which
   justifies is described as a looking, as a receiving, as a coming, as a
   fleeing for refuge, as a laying hold of, and as a calling upon. (3.)
   Because the ground to which our justification is referred, and that on
   which the sinner's trust is placed, is declared to be the blood, the
   death, the righteousness, the obedience of Christ. (4.) Because the
   fact that Christ is a ransom, a sacrifice, and as such effects our
   salvation, of necessity supposes that the faith which interests us in
   the merit of his work is a simple act of trust. (5.) Because any other
   view of the case is inconsistent with the gratuitous nature of
   justification, with the honour of Christ, and with the comfort and
   confidence of the believer.

   § 9. Objections to the Protestant Doctrine of Justification.

   It is said to lead to Licentiousness.

   1. The first, most obvious, and most persistently urged objection
   against the doctrine of gratuitous justification through the imputation
   of the righteousness of Christ, has already been incidentally
   considered. That objection is that the doctrine leads to license; that
   if good works are not necessary to justification, they are not
   necessary at all; that if God accepts the chief of sinners as readily
   as the most moral of men, on the simple condition of faith in Christ,
   then what profit is there in circumcision? in Judaism? in being in the
   Church? in being good in any form? Why not live in sin that grace may
   abound? This objection having been urged against the Apostle, it needs
   no other answer than that which he himself gave it. That answer is
   found in the sixth and seventh chapters of his Epistle to the Romans,
   and is substantially as follows:

   First, the objection involves a contradiction. To speak of salvation in
   sin is as great an absurdity as to speak of life in death. Salvation is
   deliverance from sin. How then can men be delivered from sin in order
   that they may live in it. Or, as Paul expresses it, "How shall we, that
   are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"

   Secondly, the very act of faith which secures our justification,
   secures also our sanctification. It cannot secure the one without
   securing also the other. This is not only the intention and the desire
   of the believer, but it is the ordinance of God; a necessary feature of
   the plan of salvation, and secured by its nature. We take Christ as our
   Redeemer from sin, from its power as well as from its guilt. And the
   imputation of his righteousness consequent on faith secures the
   indwelling of the Holy Spirit as certainly, and for the very same
   reasons (the covenant stipulations), that it secures the pardon of our
   sins. And, therefore, if we are partakers of his death, we are
   partakers of his life. If we die with Him, we rise with Him. If we are
   justified, we are sanctified. He, therefore, who lives in sin,
   proclaims himself an unbeliever. He has neither part nor lot in the
   redemption of Him who came to save his people from their sins.

   Thirdly, our condition, the Apostle says, is analogous to that of a
   slave, belonging first to one master, then to another. So long as he
   belonged to one man, he was not under the authority of another. But if
   freed from the one and made the slave of the other, then he comes under
   an influence which constrains obedience to the latter. So we were the
   slaves of sin, but now, freed from that hard master, we have become the
   servants of righteousness. For a believer, therefore, to live in sin,
   is just as impossible as for the slave of one man to be at the same
   time the slave of another. We are indeed free; but not free to sin. We
   are only free from the bondage of the devil and introduced into the
   pure, exalted, and glorious liberty of the sons of God.

   Fourthly, the objection as made against the Apostle and as constantly
   repeated since, is urged in the interests of morality and of common
   sense. Reason itself, it is said, teaches that a man must be good
   before he can be restored to the favour of God, and if we teach that
   the number and heinousness of a man's sins are no barrier to his
   justification, and his good works are no reason why he should be
   justified rather than the chief of sinners, we upset the very
   foundations of morality. This is the wisdom of men. The wisdom of God,
   as revealed in the Scriptures, is very different. According to the
   Bible the favour of God is the life of the soul. The light of his
   countenance is to rational creatures what the light of the sun is to
   the earth, the source of all that is beautiful and good. So long,
   therefore, as a soul is under his curse, there is no life-giving or
   life-sustaining intercourse between it and God. In this state it can
   only, as the Apostle expresses it, "bring forth fruit unto death." As
   soon, however, as it exercises faith, it receives the imputation of the
   righteousness of Christ, God's justice is thereby satisfied, and the
   Spirit comes and takes up his dwelling in the believer as the source of
   all holy living. There can therefore be no holiness until there is
   reconciliation with God, and no reconciliation with God except through
   the righteousness imputed to us and received by faith alone. Then
   follow the indwelling of the Spirit, progressive sanctification, and
   all the fruits of holy living.

   It may be said that this scheme involves an inconsistency. there can be
   no holiness until there is reconciliation, and no reconciliation (so
   far as adults are concerned) until there is faith. But faith is a fruit
   of the Spirit, and an act of the renewed soul. Then there is and must
   be, after all, holy action before there is reconciliation. It might be
   enough to say in answer to this objection, that logical order and
   chronological succession are different things; or that the order of
   nature and order of time are not to be confounded. Many things are
   contemporaneous or co-instantaneous which nevertheless stand in a
   certain logical, and even causal relation to each other. Christ
   commanded the man with a withered arm to stretch forth his hand. He
   immediately obeyed, but not before he received strength. He called to
   Lazarus to come forth from the grave; and he came forth. But this
   presupposes a restoration of life. So God commands the sinner to
   believe in Christ; and he thereupon receives Him as his Saviour; though
   this supposes supernatural power or grace.

   Our Lord, however, gives another answer to this objection. He says, as
   recorded in John xvii. 9, "I pray not for the world, but for them which
   thou hast given me; for they are thine." The intercession of Christ
   secures for those given to Him by the Father the renewing of the Holy
   Ghost. The first act of the renewed heart is faith; as the first act of
   a restored eye is to see. Whether this satisfies the understanding or
   not, it remains clear as the doctrine of the Bible that good works are
   the fruits and consequences of reconciliation with God, through faith
   in our Lord Jesus Christ.

   Inconsistent with the Grace of the Gospel.

   2. It is objected that the Protestant doctrine destroys the gratuitous
   nature of justification. If justice be satisfied; if all the demands of
   the law are met, there can, it is said, be no grace in the salvation of
   the sinner. If a man owes a debt, and some one pays it for him, the
   creditor shows no grace in giving an acquittal. This objection is
   familiar, and so also is the answer. The work of Christ is not of the
   nature of a commercial transaction. It is not analogous to a pecuniary
   satisfaction except in one point. It secures the deliverance of those
   for whom it is offered and by whom it is accepted. In the case of guilt
   the demand of justice is upon the person of the offender. He, and he
   alone is bound to answer at the bar of justice. No one can take his
   place, unless with the consent of the representative of justice and of
   the substitute, as well as of the sinner himself. Among men,
   substitution in the case of crime and its penalty is rarely, if ever
   admissible, because no man has the right over his own life or liberty;
   he cannot give them up at pleasure; and because no human magistrate has
   the right to relieve the offender or to inflict the legal penalty on
   another. But Christ had power, i.e., the right (exousia) to lay down
   his life and "power to take it again" And God, as absolute judge and
   sovereign, the Lord of the conscience, and the proprietor of all his
   creatures, was at full liberty to accept a substitute for sinners. This
   is proved beyond contradiction by what God has actually done. Under the
   old dispensation every sacrifice appointed by the law was a substitute
   for him in whose behalf it was offered. In the clearest terms it was
   predicted that the Messiah was to be the substitute of his people; that
   the chastisement of their sins was to be laid on Him, and that He was
   to make his soul an offering for sin. He was hailed as He entered on
   his ministry as the Lamb of God who was to bear the sins of the world.
   He died the just for the unjust. He redeemed us from the curse of the
   law by being made a curse for us. This is what is meant by being a
   substitute. To deny this is to deny the central idea of the Scriptural
   doctrine of redemption. To explain it away, is to absorb as with a
   sponge the life-blood of the Gospel.

   It is the glory, the power, and the preciousness of the Protestant
   doctrine that it makes the salvation of sinners a matter of grace from
   the beginning to the end. On the part of the eternal Father it was of
   grace, i.e., of unmerited, mysterious, and immeasurable love that He
   provided a substitute for sinners, and that He spared not his own Son,
   but freely gave Him up for us all It was a matter of grace, i.e., of
   love to sinners, to the ungodly, to his enemies, that the eternal Son
   of God became man, assumed the burden of our sins, fulfilled all
   righteousness, obeying and suffering even unto death, that we might not
   perish but have eternal life. It is of grace that the Spirit applies to
   men the redemption purchased by Christ; that He renews the heart; that
   He overcomes the opposition of sinners, making them willing in the day
   of his power; that He bears with all their ingratitude, disobedience,
   and resistance, and never leaves them until his work is consummated in
   glory. In all this the sinner is not treated according to his character
   and conduct. He has no claim to any one in this long catalogue of
   mercies. Everything to him is a matter of unmerited grace. Merited
   grace, indeed, is a solecism. And so is merited salvation in the case
   of sinners.

   Grace does not cease to be grace because it is not exercised in
   violation of order, propriety, and justice. It is not the weak fondness
   of a doting parent. It is the love of a holy God, who in order to
   reveal that love and manifest the exceeding glory of that attribute
   when exercised towards the unworthy, did what was necessary to render
   its exercise consistent with the other perfections of the divine
   nature. It was indispensable that God should be just in justifying the
   ungodly, but He does not thereby cease to be gracious, inasmuch as it
   was He who provided the ransom by which the objects of his love are
   redeemed from the curse of the law and the power of sin.

   God cannot declare the Unjust to be Just.

   3. Another standing objection to the Protestant doctrine has been so
   often met, that nothing but its constant repetition justifies a
   repetition of the answer. It is said to be absurd that one man should
   be righteous with the righteousness of another; that for God to
   pronounce the unjust just is a contradiction. This is a mere play on
   words. It is, however, very serious play; for it is caricaturing truth.
   It is indeed certain that the subjective, inherent quality of one
   person or thing cannot by imputation become the inherent characteristic
   of any other person or thing. Wax cannot become hard by the imputation
   of the hardness of a stone, nor can a brute become rational by the
   imputation of the intelligence of a man; nor the wicked become good by
   the imputation of the goodness of other men. But what has this to do
   with one man's assuming the responsibility of another man? If among men
   the bankrupt can become solvent by a rich man's assuming his
   responsibilities, why in the court of God may not the guilty become
   righteous by the Son of God's assuming their responsibilities? If He
   was made sin for us, why may we not be made the righteousness of God in
   Him? The objection assumes that the word "just" or "righteous" in this
   connection, expresses moral character; whereas in the Bible, when used
   in relation to this subject, it is always used in a judicial sense,
   i.e., it expresses the relation of the person spoken of to justice.
   Dikaios is antithetical to hupodikos. The man with regard to whom
   justice is unsatisfied, is hupodikos, "guilty." He with regard to whom
   justice is satisfied, is dikaios, "righteous." To declare righteous,
   therefore, is not to declare holy; and to impute righteousness is not
   to impute goodness; but simply to regard and pronounce chose who
   receive the gift of Christ's righteousness, free from condemnation and
   entitled to eternal life for his sake. Some philosophical theologians
   seem to think that there is real antagonism between love and justice in
   the divine nature, or that these attributes are incompatible or
   inharmonious. This is not so in man, why then should it be so in God?
   The highest form of moral excellence includes these attributes as
   essential elements of its perfection. And the Scriptures represent them
   as mysteriously blended in the salvation of man. The gospel is a
   revelation to principalities and powers in heaven of the polupoikilos
   sophia tou Theou, because therein He shows that He can be just and yet
   justify, love, sanctify, and glorify the chief of sinners. For which
   all sinners should render Him everlasting thanksgiving and praise.

   Christ's Righteousness due for Himself.

   4. It was natural that Socinus, who regarded Christ as a mere man,
   should object to the doctrine of the imputation of his righteousness to
   the believer, that Christ was under the same obligation to obey the law
   and to take his share of human suffering as other men, and therefore
   that his righteousness being due for Himself, could not be imputed to
   others. This objection is substantially urged by some who admit the
   divinity of Christ. In doing so, however, they virtually assume the
   Nestorian, or dualistic view of Christ's person. They argue on the
   assumption that He was a human person, and that he stood, in virtue of
   his assumption of our nature, in the same relation to the law as other
   men. It is admitted, however, that the Son, who became incarnate, was
   from eternity the second person in the Godhead. If, therefore, humanity
   as assumed by him was a person, then we have two persons, -- two
   Christs, -- the one human, the other divine. But if Christ be only one
   person, and if that person be the eternal Son of God, the same in
   substance, and equal in power and glory with the Father, then the whole
   foundation of the objection is gone. Christ sustained no other relation
   to the law, except so far as voluntarily assumed, than that which God
   himself sustains. But God is not under the law. He is Himself the
   primal, immutable, and infinitely perfect law to all rational
   creatures. Christ's subjection to the law therefore, was as voluntary
   as his submitting to the death of the cross. As He did not die for
   Himself, so neither did He obey for Himself. In both forms of his
   obedience He acted for us, as our representative and substitute, that
   through his righteousness many might be made righteous.

   As to the other form of this objection, it has the same foundation and
   admits of the same answer. It is said that the obedience and sufferings
   of Christ, being the obedience and sufferings of a mere man, or at best
   of only the human element in the constitution of his person, could have
   only a human, and, therefore, only a finite value, and consequently
   could be no adequate satisfaction for the sins of the whole world. Our
   Lord told his disciples. "Ye are of more value than many sparrows." If,
   then, in the sight of God a man is of far greater value than irrational
   creatures, why should it be thought incredible that the blood of the
   eternal Son of God should cleanse from all sin? What a man does with
   his hands, the man does; and what Christ through his human nature did,
   in the execution of his mediatorial work, the Son of God did.
   Therefore, men who spake as they were moved by the Holy Spirit did not
   hesitate to say, that the Lord of glory was crucified (1 Cor. ii. 8),
   and that God purchased the Church" with his own blood." (Acts xx. 28.)
   [177] If, then, the obedience rendered, and the sufferings endured,
   were those of a divine person, we can only shut our mouths and bow down
   before God in adoring wonder, with the full assurance that the merit of
   that obedience and of those sufferings, must be abundantly sufficient
   for the justification of every sinner upon earth, in the past, the
   present, or the future.

   Believers continue Guilty, and liable to Punishment.

   5. It is sometimes objected to the Protestant doctrine on this subject,
   that believers not only recognize themselves as justly exposed to
   condemnation for their present shortcomings and transgressions, but
   that the Scriptures so represent them, and constantly speak of God as
   punishing his people for their sins. How is this to be reconciled with
   the doctrine that they are not under condemnation; that, as regards
   them, justice has been fully satisfied, and that no one can justly lay
   anything to the charge of God's elect.

   It must be admitted, or rather it is fully acknowledged that every
   believer feels himself unworthy of the least of God's mercies. He knows
   that if God were to deal with him according to his character and
   conduct, he must inevitably be condemned. This sense of ill-desert or
   demerit, is indelible. It is a righteous judgment which the sinner
   passes, and cannot but pass upon himself. But the ground of his
   justification is not in himself. The believer acknowledges that in
   himself he deserves nothing but indignation and wrath, not only for
   what he has been, but for what he now is. This is what he feels when he
   looks at himself. Nevertheless, he knows that there is no condemnation
   to them that are in Christ Jesus; that Christ has assumed the
   responsibility of answering for him at the bar of God; that He
   constantly pleads his own perfect righteousness, as a reason why the
   deserved penalty should not be inflicted. If punishment were not
   deserved, pardon would not be gratuitous; and if not felt to be
   deserved, deliverance could not be received as a favour. The continued
   sense of ill-desert, on the part of the believer, is in no wise
   inconsistent with the Scriptural doctrine that the claims of justice in
   regard to him have been satisfied by his substitute and advocate. There
   is a great difference, as often remarked, between demerit and guilt.
   The latter is the liability in justice to the penalty of the law. The
   former is personal ill-desert. A criminal who has suffered the legal
   punishment of his crime, is no longer justly exposed to punishment for
   that offence. He however thinks of himself no better than he did
   before. He knows he cannot be subjected to further punishment; but his
   sense of demerit is not thereby lessened. And so it is with the
   believer; he knows that, because of what Christ has done for him, he
   cannot be justly condemned, but he feels and admits that in himself he
   is as hell-deserving as he was from the beginning. The heart of the
   believer solves many difficulties which the speculative understanding
   finds it hard to unravel. And it need not inordinately trouble him, if
   the latter be dissatisfied with the solution, provided he is sure that
   he is under the guidance of the Spirit by the word.

   This Theory concerns only the Outward.

   6. Modern theologians in many instances object to the Protestant
   doctrine of justification, that it is outward; concerns only legal
   relations; disregards the true nature of the mystical union, and
   represents Christ and his righteousness as purely objective, instead of
   looking upon Christ as giving Himself, his life to become the life of
   the believer, and with his life conveying its merits and its power. We
   are not concerned at present with the theory on which this objection is
   founded, but simply with the objection itself. What is urged as an
   objection to the doctrine is true. It does concern what is outward and
   objective; what is done for the sinner rather than what is done within
   him. But then it is to be considered, first, that this is what the
   sinner needs. He requires not only that his nature should be renewed
   and that a new principle of spiritual or divine life should be
   communicated to him; but also that his guilt should be removed, his
   sins expiated, and justice satisfied, as the preliminary condition of
   his enjoying this new life, and being restored to the favour of God.
   And secondly, that such is the constant representation of Scripture,
   our only trustworthy guide in matters of religious doctrine. The Bible
   makes quite as prominent what Christ does for us, as what He does in
   us. It says as much of his objective, expiatory work, as of the
   communication of a higher spiritual life to believers. It is only by
   ignoring this objective work of Christ, or by merging justification
   into inward renovation, that this objection has force or even
   plausibility. Protestants do not depreciate the value and necessity of
   the new life derived from Christ, because, in obedience to the
   Scriptures, they insist so strenuously upon the satisfaction which He
   has rendered by his perfect righteousness to the justice of God.
   Without the latter, the former is impossible.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [177] The text in this passage is indeed disputed. The common text has
   theou "the Church of God;" which is retained by Mill, Bengel, Knapp,
   Hahn, and others in their editions of the New Testament. Many MSS, have
   kuriou kai theou; and others, simply kuriou. The fact that the phrase
   "the Church of God" occurs eleven times in the New Testament, while
   "Church of the Lord" never occurs, is urged as a reason in favour of
   the latter reading, as it is assumed that transcribers would be apt to
   adopt a familiar, rather than unexampled expression. There may be some
   force in this. On the other hand, the presumption is that the sacred
   writers adhere to their own "usus loquendi." The words in Acts xx. 28
   are Paul's words, and as he, at least in ten other cases, speaks of the
   "Church of God," and never once uses the expression "Church of the
   Lord," it is in the highest degree improbable that he uses that phrase
   here. Besides, it is evident that transcribers, critics, and heretics
   would have a strong disposition to get rid of such a phrase as "the
   blood of God." Modern critics do not hesitate to assign, as one of
   their reasons for rejecting the common text, that the expression is
   "too strong." The passage, however, though sacred, is not essential.
   the usage pervades the New Testament of predicating of the person of
   Christ what is true of either element, the human or the divine, of his
   mysteriously constituted personality. In Hebrews i. 3 the person who
   upholds the universe by the word of his power, is said to have purged
   our sins by Himself, i.e., by the sacrifice of Himself. And in ii. 14,
   the person whom the sacred writer had set forth as higher than the
   angels, as God, as creator of heaven and earth, as eternal and
   immutable, is said to have become partaker of flesh and blood, in order
   that by death He might destroy him that had the power of death. And in
   Philippians ii. 6, 9, he who was in the form of God and thought it not
   robbery to be equal with God, became obedient unto death, even the
   death of the cross. Nevertheless, Acts xx. 28 be not essential to prove
   any doctrine, those who believe it as it reads in the common text, to
   be part of the word of God, are bound to stand by it.

   § 10. Departures from the Protestant Doctrine.

   Osiander.

   During the lifetime of the Reformers, a very earnest controversy began
   in the Lutheran Church on the nature of justification. This arose from
   the views of Andreas Osiander, a man of distinguished learning and of a
   speculative turn of mind; eminent first as a preacher, and afterwards
   as a professor in the university of Königsberg. His principal work is
   entitled "De Unico Mediatore Jesu Christo et Justificatione Fidei.
   Confessio Andreæ Osiandri." His difference of opinion from the other
   Reformers so clearly indicated in the following words, in which he
   denounces the errors which he means to oppose: "Omnes horribiliter
   errant. Primo, quia verbum justificare tantum pro justum reputare et
   pronunciare intelligunt, atque interpretantur, et non pro eo, quod est,
   reipsa et in veritate justum efficere. Deinde etiam in hoc quod nullam
   differentiam tenent inter redemptionem et justificationem, quum tamen
   magna differentia sit, sicut vel inde intelligi sit, quod homines furem
   a suspendio redimere possunt, bonum et justum efficere non possunt.
   Porro etiam in hoc, quod nihil certe statuere possunt, quid tandem
   justitia Christi sit, quam per fidem in nobis esse, nobisque imputari
   oporteat. Ac postremo errant omnium rudissime etiam in hoc, quod
   divinam naturam Christi a justificatione separant, et Christum dividunt
   atque solvunt, id quod haud dubie execrandi Satanæ opus est." [178]

   Osiander taught, (1.) That Christ has redeemed us by the satisfaction
   which He rendered to divine justice. (2.) But he denied that this was
   any part of our justification. (3.) He maintained that to justify does
   not mean to declare just, or to render righteous in a judicial or
   forensic sense, but to render inherently or subjectively just and holy.
   (4.) That the righteousness of Christ by which the believer is
   justified, and which he receives by faith, and which is imputed to him
   in the judgment of God, is not, as the Protestants taught, the work of
   Christ, consisting in what He did and suffered as the substitute of
   sinners, nor is it, as Romanists teach, the work of the Holy Spirit
   consisting in the infusion of a holy nature or of new habits of grace,
   but it is the "essential righteousness of God," "the divine essence,
   "God Himself." (5.) That consequently the proximate and real ground of
   our acceptance with God, and of our reception into heaven, is what we
   are, or what we become, in virtue of this in-dwelling of God in the
   soul.

   The speculations of Osiander as to the nature of God and his relation
   to man, might have led him under any circumstances to adopt the
   peculiar views above stated, but the proximate cause was no doubt the
   reaction from the too exclusive prominence given at that time to the
   objective work of Christ. This is not to be wondered at, and perhaps
   was not to be blamed. The Romanists, with whom the Protestants had to
   contend, did not deny the necessity of an inward change in the nature
   of fallen man. But they made this almost all of Christ's redeeming
   work. What He did for the expiation of sin and for meeting the demands
   of justice, was only to open the way for God's giving renewing and
   sanctifying grace to sinners. Men were themselves to merit eternal
   life. It was unavoidable therefore, that the Reformers should
   strenuously insist upon what Christ did for us and that they should
   protest against confounding justification with sanctification.
   Osiander's cast of mind made him revolt at this, and carried him
   completely over to the Romish side, so far as the nature of
   justification is concerned. He said that the Protestant doctrine of
   justification is "colder than ice." It is as though a man should pay
   the ransom of a Turkish slave, and leave him and his children in
   bondage. Still more violent is his denunciation of the doctrine that
   Christ's righteousness, of which we partake through faith, consists of
   his obedience and sufferings. What good can they do us? Christ obeyed
   and suffered centuries ago; we cannot appropriate what He then did and
   make it our own. Imputing it to us does not alter the case. It does not
   make us better. Speculative as well as Biblical reasons, however,
   prevented Osiander from accepting the Romish solution of the
   difficulty. What we are said to receive is "the righteousness of
   Christ," "the righteousness of God;" but sanctifying grace is never
   called the righteousness of God. If, therefore, that righteousness by
   which the believer is constituted righteous, be neither the obedience
   of Christ, nor infused grace, what can it be other than the essential
   righteousness of God, the divine essence itself? Calvin, who in his
   "Institutes" earnestly combats the theory of Osiander, says that he
   invented "monstrum nescio quod essentialis justitiæ." "Dilucide
   exprimit, se non ea justitia contentum, quæ nobis obedientia et
   sacrificio mortis Christi parta est, fingere nos substantialiter in Deo
   justos esse tam essentia quam qualitate infusa. . . . . Substantialem
   mixtionem ingerit, qua Deus se in nos transfundens, quasi partem sui
   faciat. Nam virtute Spiritus sancti fieri, ut coalescamus cum Christo,
   nobisque sit caput et nos ejus membra, fere pro nihilo ducit, nisi ejus
   essentia nobis misceatur." [179]

   But what theory of the nature of God and of his relation to man did
   Osiander hold, which admitted of this doctrine of the infusion of the
   divine essence into the soul? His views on this point were not clearly
   brought out, but the primary idea which underlies his speculation is
   the old doctrine of the oneness of God and man. Man is God in at least
   one form of his existence. He held that Christ is the image, the
   representative, the realized ideal of the Godhead, not as Logos or Son,
   but as Godman, the Theanthropos. As from its nature or from the nature
   of God this idea realized, this manifestation of God in his true idea
   must occur, and therefore the incarnation would have taken place had
   man never sinned. The fall of Adam only modified the circumstances
   attending the incarnation, determining that it should involve suffering
   and death. But the incarnation itself, the appearance of God in fashion
   as a man arose from a law of the divine nature. Adam was created not
   after the image of God as such, but after the image of Christ; in some
   sort, a God-man. The affinity of this theory with the modern
   pantheistic speculations is apparent. Baur, therefore, is doubtless
   right when he says, at the close of his apologetic notice of Osiander's
   doctrine, that his idea of the relation between the divine and human
   "is that which at last found its adequate scientific expression by
   Schleiermacher and Hegel, that Christ as Redeemer is the perfected
   creation of human nature; or, that the divine nature is the truth of
   humanity, and human nature the reality, or existence-form (die
   Wirklichkeit) of the divine nature." [180]

   Stancarus.

   Stancarus, a contemporary and opponent of Osiander, went to the extreme
   of asserting that the righteousness of Christ was the work of his human
   nature exclusively. This doctrine was however repudiated by the
   Romanists as well as by Protestants. If it was Christ's human nature as
   such (and not the divine person) who obeyed, then the human nature in
   Christ was a distinct subsistence, and thus the unity of his person is
   destroyed. Besides, if it was not a divine person in his human nature
   who obeyed and suffered, then we have but a human Saviour, and a
   righteousness of no higher than a human value. We know from Scripture
   that it was the Lord of glory who was crucified, the Son of God who,
   being born of a woman, was made under the law.

   Piscator.

   The first conspicuous departure from the Protestant doctrine of
   justification among the Reformed, was on the part of Piscator, whose
   denial of the imputation of the active obedience of Christ to the
   believer, excited for some years a good deal of discussion, but it
   passed away without leaving any distinct trace in the theology of the
   Reformation. Baur, indeed, assigns to it more importance, as he regards
   it as the first step in the downfall of the whole doctrine of the
   satisfaction of Christ, over which he rejoices. Piscator was a native
   of Strasburg, and a member of the Lutheran Church, to whose service his
   first ministerial and professional labors were devoted. It coming to
   the knowledge of the ecclesiastical authorities that in his exposition
   of the Epistle to the Philippians he denied the ubiquity of the human
   nature of Christ, and taught the doctrine of predestination, he was
   deprived of his position in the Lutheran Church and passed over to the
   Reformed. He was soon appointed one of the professors of the new
   Institution of Hebron founded by the Duke of Nassau. He remained in
   connection with that institution from 1584 until his death in 1625, in
   the seventy-ninth year of his age. He was a prolific writer. Besides a
   new translation of the Bible, he wrote numerous commentaries on books
   of the Old and New Testaments, and conducted many controversies with
   Lutherans and Romanists, before he embroiled himself with the
   theologians of his own church. [181] He took the ground that the
   "imputatio justitiæ" and "remissio peccatorum" are identical; the
   former means nothing more than the latter; and consequently that
   Christ's work consists simply in the expiation of sin. His active
   obedience to the divine law constitutes no part of the righteousness by
   which the believer is justified before God. He admits that Christ
   rendered a twofold obedience, -- the one to the law of God as a rule of
   duty; the other to the special command given to Him as Mediator. He
   came to accomplish a certain work; to do the will of the Father, which
   was to make satisfaction for sin. In this we are interested; but his
   obedience to the moral law was for Himself, and was the necessary
   condition of his satisfaction. He could not have made atonement for
   others had He not been Himself holy. "Tribuitur morti," he says, [182]
   "quod ei tribuendum, nimirum, quod sit plenissima satisfactio pro
   peccatis nostris; sic etiam vitæ obedientiæ tribuitur, quod scriptura
   ei tribuendum perhibet, nimirum, quod sit causa, sine qua non potuerat
   Christus idoneus esse mediator inter Deum et hominem." Although
   Piscator made some effort to prove exegetically that pardon and
   justification, the remission of sin and imputation of righteousness,
   are identical, yet his arguments against the received doctrine, that
   the obedience of Christ is part our justifying righteousness, are not
   Biblical. The question before his mind was not simply, What do the
   Scriptures teach? but, What is true, logical, and symmetrical? He saw
   objections to the imputation of the active obedience of Christ, which
   seemed to him fatal, and on the ground of those objections he rejected
   the doctrine. Thus, for example, he argues that Christ's obedience to
   the law was due from Himself as a man, and therefore not imputable to
   others. He argues thus, [183] "Qui Christum dicunt ubique ut hominem,
   Christum dicunt non hominem, dum enim dico ubique, dico Deum, qui solus
   est in coelo et in terra. Similiter cum dico subjectum legi, dico
   hominem. Qui ergo Christum subjectum legi negant, negant ipsum esse
   hominem." Every man as such in virtue of being a man's individually
   bound to obey the moral law. Christ was a man; therefore He was bound
   to obey the law for Himself. He did not perceive, or was not willing to
   admit, that the word "man" is taken in different senses in the
   different members of this syllogism, and therefore, the conclusion is
   vitiated. In the first clause, "man" means a human person; in the
   second clause, it means human nature. Christ was not a human person,
   although He assumed human nature. He was a man in the sense in which we
   are dust and ashes. But because we are dust, it does not follow that
   all that may be predicated of dust, may be predicated of us; e.g., that
   we have no life, no reason, no immortality. In like manner, although
   the eternal Son of God took upon Himself a true body and a reasonable
   soul, yet as He was a divine person, it does not follow that everything
   that is true of human persons must be true of Him. Piscator also argues
   that the law binds either to punishment or to obedience, but not to
   both at once. Therefore, if Christ's obedience is imputed to us, there
   was no necessity that He should die for us. On the other hand, if He
   died for us, there was no necessity that He should obey for us. The
   principle here assumed may be true with regard to unfallen man. But
   where sin has been committed there is need of expiation as well as of
   obedience, and of obedience as well as expiation, if the reward of
   perfect obedience is to be conferred. Again, he says, if Christ has
   fulfilled the law for us, we are not bound to keep it. This is the old
   objection of the Jews; if justified by grace we may live in sin. But
   Christ has fulfilled the law for us only as a covenant of works. In
   that sense, says the Apostle, we are not under the law, but it does not
   thence follow that we are free from all moral obligation arising from
   our relation to God, as rational creatures. It may be true as Baur,
   himself a thorough skeptic in the English and American sense of that
   word, thinks, that this innovation of Piscator prepared the way for the
   rejection of the whole Scriptural doctrine of satisfaction. Certain it
   is that both Lutherans and Reformed united, with scarcely a dissenting
   voice, in the condemnation of Piscator's doctrine. It was judicially
   repudiated by the national Synod of France on several different
   occasions; first in 1603, again at La Rochelle in 1607, and afterwards
   in 1612 and 1613. The Swiss churches in the "Formula Consensus
   Helvetica," which received symbolical authority in Switzerland,
   pronounced clearly in favour of the old doctrine. This matter was soon
   lost sight of in consequence of the rise of Arminianism of far more
   historical importance.

   The Arminian Doctrine.

   Jacobus Arminius, a man of learning, talents, attractive
   accomplishments, and exemplary character, was born in Holland 1560, and
   died professor in the University of Leyden, in 1609, having filled the
   chair of theology since 1603. His departures from the Reformed
   doctrines in which he had been educated were far less serious than
   those of his successors, although involving them, apparently, by a
   logical necessity. His great difficulty was with the doctrine of
   predestination or the sovereignty of God in election. He could not,
   however, get rid of that doctrine without denying the entire inability
   of man to do what is spiritually good. He, therefore, taught that
   although mankind fell in Adam and are born in a state of sin and
   condemnation, and are of themselves entirely unable to turn from sin to
   holiness, yet that they are able to coöperate with the grace of the
   Holy Spirit given to all men, especially to all who hear the Gospel, in
   sufficient measure to enable them to repent and believe, and to
   persevere in holy living unto the end. But whether any man doe thus
   repent and believe, or, having believed, perseveres in a holy life,
   depends on himself and not on God. The purpose of election, therefore,
   is not a purpose to save, and to that end to give faith and repentance
   to a definite number of individuals, but a purpose to save those who
   repent, believe, and persevere in faith until the end. The work of
   Christ has, therefore, an equal reference to all men. He made full
   satisfaction to God for the sins of all and every man, so that God can
   now consistently offer salvation to all men on the conditions laid down
   in the Gospel.

   This is a self-consistent scheme. One part implies, or necessitates
   admission of the others. The above statement includes all the doctrines
   presented by the followers of Arminius, after his death, to the
   authorities in the form of a Remonstrance, as a justification of their
   views. Hence the Arminians were called Remonstrants. The document just
   mentioned contains the five points on which its authors and their
   associates differed from the Reformed faith. The first relates to
   predestination, which is explained as the purpose "illos in Christo,
   propter Christum et per Christum servare, qui Spiritus Sancti gratia,
   in eundem ejus filjum credunt, et in ea, fideique obedientia, per
   eandem gratiam in finem perseverant: contra vero eos, qui non
   convertentur et infideles, in peccato et iræ subjectos relinquere, et
   condemnare, secundum illud Evang. Joann. iii. 36."

   The second relates to the work of Christ, as to which it is said,
   "Proinde Jesum Christum mundi servatorem pro omnibus et singulis
   mortuum esse, atque ita quidem, ut omnibus per mortem Christi
   reconciliationem et peccatorum remissionem impetravit: ea tamen
   conditione, ut nemo illa remissione peccatorum re ipsa fruatur, præter
   hominem fidelem, et hoc quoque secundum Evang. Joann. iii. 16, et 1
   Joann. ii. 2."

   The third, concerning the sinner's ability, declares, "Hominem vero
   salutarem fidem a se ipso non habere, nec vi liberi sui arbitrii,
   quandoquidem in statu defectionis et peccati nihil boni, quandoquidem
   vere bonum est, quale quid est fides salutaris, ex se possit cogitare,
   vel facere: sed necessarium esse eum a Deo in Christo per Spiritum
   Sanctum regigni et renovari mente, affectibus, seu voluntate et omnibus
   facultatibus, ut aliquid boni possit intelligere, cogitare, velle et
   perficere. Ev. Joann. xv. 5." No Augustinian, whether Lutheran or
   Calvinist, can say more than that, or desire more to be said by others.

   The fourth article, concerning grace, however, shows the point of
   departure: "Hanc Dei gratiam esse initium, progressum ac perfectionem
   omnis boni, atque id eo quidem usque ut ipse homo regenitus absque hac
   præcedentia, sen adventitia excitante, consequente et cooperante
   gratia, neque boni quid cogitare, velle, aut facere possit, neque etiam
   ulli malæ tentatione resistere; adeo quidem ut omnia bona opera, quæ
   excogitare possumus, Dei gratiæ in Christo tribuenda sint; quod vero
   modum operationis illius gratiæ, illa non irresistibilis; de multis
   enim dicitur eos Spiritui Sancto resistere, Act. vii. 51 et alibi
   multis locis." It was not to be expected, in a brief exposition of
   principles designed for the justification of those who hold them, as
   members of a Reformed or Calvinistic church, that doubtful terms should
   be explained. It is beyond controversy, however, and, it is believed,
   is not controverted, that irresistible is here used in the sense of
   certainty efficacious. The Holy Spirit operates on the hearts of all
   men. Some are thereby renewed and brought to faith and repentance;
   others are not. This difference, according to the Remonstrants, is not
   to be referred to the nature of the influence exerted, but to the fact
   that some yield to this grace and coöperate with it; while others
   reject and resist it.

   The fifth article refers to the perseverance of the saints, and is
   indefinite. It admits that the Spirit furnishes grace abundantly
   sufficient to enable the believer to persevere in holiness: "Sed an
   illi ipsi negligentia sua initium sui esse in Christo deserere non
   possint, et præsentem mundum iterum amplecti, a sancta doctrina ipsis
   semel tradita deficere, conscientiæ naufragium facere, a gratia
   excidere; penitus ex sacra Scriptura esset expendum, antequam illud cum
   plena animi tranquillitate et plerophoria docere possent." Of course no
   man who believed the doctrine could write thus, and this doubtful mode
   of expression was soon laid aside, and "falling from grace," in the
   common sense of the phrase, was admitted to be an Arminian doctrine.

   It will be observed that the doctrine of justification is not embraced
   in the five points in the Remonstrance as presented to the authorities
   in Holland, and as made the basis of the decisions of the Synod of
   Dort. The aberration of the Arminians, however, from the faith of the
   Reformed churches, extended to all the doctrines connected with the
   plan of salvation. Arminius himself, at least, held far higher and more
   Scriptural views on original sin, inability, and the necessity of
   supernatural grace, than those which have since become so prevalent
   even among the Reformed or Calvinistic churches themselves. In matters
   concerning the method of salvation, especially as to the nature of
   Christ's work and its application to the believer, they at first
   adhered closely to the language of the Reformed confessions. Thus they
   did not hesitate to say that Christ made full satisfaction for the sins
   of men; that He was a ransom, a sacrifice, a propitiation; that He made
   expiation for sin; that his righteousness or obedience is the ground of
   our acceptance with God; that the faith which saves is not mere assent
   to truth, or pious confidence in God, but specifically faith in Christ
   as the Saviour of men; and that justification is an act of God
   pronouncing the sinner just, or in which He pardons sin and accepts the
   sinner as righteous. All this is satisfactory to the ear. Language,
   however, admits a different interpretations and it soon became apparent
   and avowed that the Remonstrants intended something very different from
   what the Reformed Church meant to express by the same terms.

   1. They said that Christ's work was a satisfaction to divine justice.
   But they did not mean by satisfaction, either a "solutio," a real value
   rendered for what was due; nor even an "acceptio," taking one thing for
   another as an equivalent; but an "acceptilatio," a gracious acceptance
   as a satisfaction of that which in its own nature was no equivalent; as
   though God should accept the life of a brute for that of a man; or
   faith for perfect obedience. Neither did the Remonstrants mean by
   justice the attribute which requires the righteous distribution of
   rewards and punishments, and which renders it necessary that the
   penalty of the law should be executed in case of transgression.

   With regard to this latter point (the nature of justice) the language
   of Grotius, and of the great body of the Remonstrant or Arminian
   theologians, is perfectly explicit. Grotius says: "Poenas infligere,
   aut a poenis aliquem liberare, quem punire possis, quod justificare
   vocat Scriptura, non est nisi rectoris, qua talis primo et per se: ut,
   puta, in familia patris; in republica regis, in universo Dei. . . . .
   Unde sequitur, omnino hic Deum considerandum, ut rectorem." [184]
   Again, [185] "Ratio [cur rectori relaxare legem talem non liceat, nisi
   causa aliqua accedat, si non necessaria, certe sufficiens'] . . . .
   est, quod actus ferendi aut relaxandi legem non sit actus absoluti
   dominii, sed actus imperii, qui tendere debeat ad boni ordinis
   conservationem." [186] "Poena enim omnis propositum habet bonum
   commune." "Prudentia quoque hoc nomine rectorem ad poenam incitat.
   Augetur præterea causa puniendi, ubi lex aliqua publicata est, quæ
   poenam minatur. Nam tunc omissio poenæ ferme aliquid detrahit de legis
   authoritate apud subditos." [187]

   Here everything is purely governmental. It is not justice, in the
   proper and ordinary sense of the word, that is satisfied, but God's
   wise and benevolent regard to the interests of his moral government.
   This changes everything. If God's justice be not satisfied guilt is not
   removed, and sin is not expiated. And therefore conscience is not
   appeased; nor can the real authority and honour of the law be upheld.

   As to the other point, the nature of the satisfaction rendered it was
   not a real equivalent, which by its intrinsic value met the obligations
   of the sinner, but it was something graciously accepted as such.
   Although Grotius rejects the use of the word "acceptilatio," and
   endeavours to show that it does not express his meaning, nevertheless,
   though he repudiates the word, he retains the idea. He says, [188] "Ea
   est pretii natura, ut sui valore aut æstimatione alterum moveat ad
   concedendam rem, aut jus aliquod, puta impunitatem." This amounts to
   the principle of Duns Scotus that a thing avails (is worth) for what
   God pleases to take it. Although Grotius does not carry out the
   principle to the length to which the Schoolmen carried it, and say that
   God might have accepted the death of one man as a satisfaction for the
   sins of the world, or the blood of bulls or of goats as a real
   expiation, nevertheless, he teaches that God graciously accepted
   "aliquid pro aliquo," the death of Christ for the death of all the
   world, not because of its being a real equivalent in itself, but
   because as ruler, having the right to remit sin without any
   satisfaction, He saw that the interests of his government could thereby
   be promoted. Still more clearly is this idea expressed by Limborch:
   [189] "In eo errant quam maxime, quod velint redemtionis pretium per
   omnia equivalens esse debere miseriæ illi, e qua redemtio fit:
   redemtionis pretium enim constitui solet pro libera æstimatione illius,
   qui captivum detinet, non autem solvi pro captivi merito. . . . . Ita
   pretium, quod Christus persolvit, juxta Dei Patris æstimationem
   persolutum est."

   According to Grotius, Christ died as an example, "exemplum poenæ." The
   whole efficacy of his work was its moral impression on the universe. It
   was not an expiation or satisfaction for past sins, but a means of
   deterring from the commission of sin in the future. This, as Baur [190]
   and Strauss [191] remark, is the point in which the theory of Grotius
   and that of Socinus coincide. They both refer the efficacy of Christ's
   work to the moral impression which it makes on the minds of intelligent
   creatures. They refer that moral influence, indeed, to different
   causes, but moral impression is all the efficacy it has. Although the
   word satisfaction is retained by Grotius, the idea attached to it by
   the Church is rejected. The leading Remonstrant or Arminian
   theologians, as Episcopius, Curcellæus, and Limborch, differ from
   Grotius in their mode of presenting this subject. Instead of regarding
   the work of Christ as an example of punishment, designed to deter from
   the commission of sin, they adhere to the Scriptural mode of regarding
   Him as a ransom and sacrifice. The difference however is more in form
   than in reality. They admit that Christ redeems us by giving Himself as
   a ransom for many. But a ransom, as Curcellæus says, is not an
   equivalent; it is anything the holder of the captive sees fit to
   accept. It is admitted, also, that Christ gave Himself as a sacrifice
   for our salvation; but a sacrifice is said not to be a satisfaction to
   justice, but simply the condition on which pardon is granted. Under the
   Old Testament God pardoned sin on the occasion of the sacrifice of
   irrational animals; under the New Testament, on the occasion of the
   sacrifice of Christ. "Sacrificia," says Limborch, [192] "non sunt
   solutiones debitorum, neque plenariæ pro peccatis satisfactiones; sed
   illis peractis conceditur gratuita peccati remissio." "Redemtionis
   pretium constitui solet pro libera æstimatione illius, qui captivum
   detinet." We know, however, from Scripture that a sacrifice was not
   merely an arbitrarily appointed antecedent of gratuitous forgiveness;
   it was not simply an acknowledgment of guilt. We know also that the
   blood of bulls and of goats under the Old Testament could not take away
   sin; it availed only to the purifying of the flesh, or the remission of
   ceremonial penalties. The only efficacy of the Old Testament
   sacrifices, so far as sin committed against God is concerned, was
   sacramental; that is, they signified, sealed, and applied the benefits
   of the only real and effectual expiation for sin, to those who
   believed. As the victim symbolically bore the penalty due to the
   offender, so the eternal Son of God really bore our sins, really became
   a curse for us, and thus made a true and perfect satisfaction to God
   for our offences.

   2. As the Remonstrants denied that Christ's work was a real
   satisfaction for sin, they of necessity denied any real justification
   of the sinner. Justification with them is merely pardon. This is
   asserted by Grotius in the passage above cited; and even the Rev.
   Richard Watson, whose excellent system of theology, or "Theological
   Institutes," is deservedly in high repute among the Wesleyan
   Methodists, not only over and over defines justification as pardon, but
   elaborately argues the question. "The first point," he says, "which we
   find established by the language of the New Testament is, that
   justification, the pardon and remission of sins, the non-imputation of
   sin, and the imputation of righteousness, are terms and phrases of the
   same import." [193] He then goes on to establish that position.

   If therefore, pardon and justification are distinct things, the one the
   executive act of a ruler, the other a judicial act; the one setting
   aside the demands of justice, the other a declaration that justice is
   satisfied; then those who reduce justification to mere pardon, deny the
   doctrine of justification as understood and professed by the Lutheran
   and Reformed churches. It of course is not intended that these
   Remonstrant or Arminian theologians do not hold what they call
   justification; nor is it denied that they at times, at least, express
   their doctrine in the very language of the Symbols of the Protestant
   churches. Thus the Remonstrants [194] say, "Justificatio est actio Dei,
   quam Deus pure pute in sua ipsius mente efficit, quia nihil aliud est,
   quam volitio aut decretum, quo peccata remittere, et justitiam imputare
   aliquando vult iis, qui credunt, id est, quo vult poenas, peccatis
   eorum promeritas, iis non infligere, eosque tanquam justos tractare et
   premio afficere." Nevertheless they tell us that they mean by this only
   pardon. Protestants, when they say justification includes pardon "and"
   the imputation of righteousness, mean two distinct things by pardon and
   imputation of righteousness. The Remonstrants regard them as identical,
   and, therefore, can use the very language of Protestants, while
   rejecting their doctrine. As every one feels and knows that when a
   criminal is pardoned by the executive, and allowed to resume his rights
   of property and right of voting, he is not thereby justified; so every
   candid mind must admit that there is an immense difference between the
   Remonstrant or Arminian doctrine of justification and that held as the
   cardinal principle of the Reformation by both Lutherans and Reformed.

   3. This difference becomes still more apparent when we consider what
   the Remonstrants make the ground of justification As they deny that
   Christ made any real satisfaction to divine justice (as distinguished
   from benevolence), so they deny that the righteousness of Christ is
   imputed to the believer as the ground of his justification. On this
   point, Limborch [195] says, "Hæc autem, quæ nobis imputatur, non est
   Christi justitia; nus quam enim Scriptura docet, Christi justitiam
   nobis imputari; sed tantum fidem nobis imputari in justitiam, et quidem
   propter Christum." And Curcellæus [196] says, "Nullibi docet Scriptura
   justitiam Christi nobis imputari. Et id absurdum est. Nemo enim in se
   injustus aliena justitia potest esse formaliter justus, non magis, quam
   aliena albedine Æthiops esse albus."

   As the righteousness of Christ is not imputed to the believer, the
   ground of his justification, that which is accepted as righteousness,
   is faith and its fruits, or faith and evangelical obedience. On this
   subject Limborch says, [197] that under the new covenant God demands
   "obedientiam fidei, hoc est, non rigidam et omnibus æqualem, prout
   exigebat lex; sed tantam, quantam fides, id est, certa de divinis
   promissionibus persuasio, in unoquoque efficere potest; in qua etiam
   Deus multas imperfectiones et lapsus condonat, modo animo sincero
   præceptorum ipsius observationi incumbamus, et continuo in eadem
   proficere studeamus."

   And again, [198] "Deus non judicat hominum justitiam esse perfectam,
   imo eam judicat esse imperfectam; sed justitiam, quam imperfectam
   judicat, gratiose accipit ac si perfecta esset." He, therefore, [199]
   thus defines justification, "Est gratiosa æstimatio, seu potius
   acceptatio justitiæ nostræ imperfectæ (quæ, si Deus rigide nobiscum
   agere vellet, in judicio Dei nequaquam consistere posset) pro perfecta,
   propter Jesum Christum."

   The same view is presented when he speaks of faith in its relation to
   justification. Faith is said to be imputed for righteousness; but
   Limborch says, [200] "Sciendum, quando dicimus, nos fide justificari,
   nos non excludere opera, quæ fides exigit et tanquam foecunda mater
   producit; sed ea includere." Again, [201] "Fides est conditio in nobis
   et a nobis requisita, ut justificationem consequamur. Est itaque talis
   actus, qui, licet in se spectatus perfectus nequaquam sit, sed in
   multis deficiens, tamen a Deo gratiosa et liberrima voluntate pro pleno
   et perfecto acceptatur et propter quem Deus homini gratiose remissionem
   peccatorum et vitæ æternæ præmium conferre vult."

   Fletcher [202] says, "With respect to the Christless law of
   paradisaical obedience, we entirely disclaim sinless perfection." "We
   shall not be judged by that law; but by a law adapted to our present
   state and circumstances, a milder law, called the law of Christ." "Our
   Heavenly Father never expects of us, in our debilitated state, the
   obedience of immortal Adam in paradise."

   Dr. Peck [203] says, "The standard of character set up in the Gospel
   must be such as is practicable by man, fallen as he is. Coming up to
   this standard is what we call Christian perfection."

   Under the covenant of works as made with Adam, perfect obedience was
   the condition of acceptance with God and of eternal life; under the
   Gospel, for Christ's sake, imperfect, or evangelical obedience, is the
   ground of justification, i.e., it is that (propter quam) on account of
   which God graciously grants us the remission of sin and the reward of
   eternal life.

   We have then the three great systems. First, that of the Romanists,
   which teaches that on account of the work of Christ God grants, through
   Christian baptism, an infusion of divine grace, by which all sin is
   purged from the soul and all ground for the infliction of the penalty
   is removed and the sinner rendered inherently just or holy. This is the
   first justification. Then in virtue of the new principle of spiritual
   life thus imparted, the baptized or regenerated are enabled to perform
   good works, which are really meritorious and on account of which they
   are admitted to heaven.

   Secondly, the Arminian theory, that on account of what Christ has done,
   God is pleased to grant sufficient grace to all men, and to accept the
   imperfect obedience which the believer is thus enabled to render in
   lieu of the perfect obedience required under the covenant made with
   Adam, and on account of that imperfect obedience, eternal life is
   graciously bestowed.

   Thirdly, the Protestant doctrine that Christ, as the representative and
   substitute of sinners or of his people, takes their place under the
   law, and in their name and in their behalf fulfils all righteousness,
   thereby making a real, perfect, and infinitely meritorious satisfaction
   to the law and justice of God, which righteousness is imputed, or set
   to the account of the believer, who is thereupon and on that account
   freely pardoned and pronounced righteous in the sight of God, and
   entitled not only to the remission of sin but also to eternal life.
   Being united to Christ by faith, the believer becomes partaker of his
   life, so that it is not he that lives but Christ that liveth in him,
   and the life which the believer now lives in the flesh is by faith of
   the Son of God, who loved him, and gave Himself for him.

   Comparison of the Different Doctrines.

   The first remark which suggests itself on the comparison of these
   several schemes is, that the relation between the believer and Christ
   is far more close, peculiar, and constant on the Protestant scheme than
   on any other. He is dependent on Him every hour; for the imputation of
   his righteousness; for the supplies of the Spirit of life; and for his
   care, guidance, and intercession. He must look to Him continually; and
   continually exercise faith in Him as an ever present Saviour in order
   to live. According to the other schemes, Christ has merely made the
   salvation of all men possible. There his work ended. According to
   Romanists, He has made it possible that God should give sanctifying
   grace in baptism; according to the Remonstrants, He has rendered it
   possible for Him to give sufficient grace to all men whereby to
   sanctify and save themselves. We are well aware that this is theory;
   that the true people of God, whether Romanists or Remonstrants, do not
   look on Christ thus as a Saviour afar off. They doubtless have the same
   exercises towards Him that their fellow believers have; nevertheless,
   such is the theory. The theory places a great gulf between the soul and
   Christ.

   Secondly, it hardly admits of question that the Protestant view
   conforms to the Scriptural mode of presenting the plan of salvation.
   Christ in the Bible is declared to be the head of his people, their
   representative; they were in Him in such a sense that they died in Him;
   they are raised with Him, and sit with Him in heavenly places. They
   were in Him as the race was in Adam, and as branches are in the vine.
   They individually receive the sprinkling of that blood which cleanses
   from all sin. They are constituted righteous by his obedience. As He
   was made sin for them, so are they made the righteousness of God in
   Him. He is not only an example of punishment as Grotius represents, a
   mere governmental device, but a sacrifice substituted for us, on whose
   head every believer must lay his hand and to whom he must transfer the
   burden of his sins.

   Thirdly, what is included indeed in the above, but is so important and
   decisive as to require distinct and repeated mention; all schemes,
   other than the Protestant, refer the proximate ground of our acceptance
   with God to our own subjective character. It is because of our own
   goodness that we are regarded and treated as righteous. Whereas
   conscience demands, the Scriptures reveal, and the believer
   instinctively seeks something better than that. His own goodness is
   badness. It cannot satisfy his own bleared vision; how then can it
   appear before the eyes of God? It matters not how the Romanist may
   exalt his "inward habits of grace;" or how the Arminian may sublimate
   his evangelical obedience to perfection; neither can satisfy either the
   conscience or God.

   Fourthly, the Protestant doctrine is the only one on which the soul can
   live. This has been urged before when speaking of the work of Christ.
   It is fair to appeal from theology to hymnology from the head to the
   heart; from what man thinks to what God makes men feel. It is enough to
   say on this point, that Lutheran and Reformed Christians can find
   nowhere, out of the Bible, more clear, definite, soul-satisfying
   expression of their doctrinal views upon this subject, than are to be
   found in many, of the hymns of the Latin and Arminian churches. As a
   single example may be cited the following stanzas from John Wesley's
   "Hymns and Spiritual Songs": --


   "Join, earth and heaven to bless

   The Lord our Righteousness.

   The mystery of redemption this,

   This the Saviour's strange design --

   Man's offence was counted his.

   Ours his righteousness divine.


   "In Him complete we shine;

   His death, his life, is mine;

   Fully am I justified,

   Free from sin, and more than free,

   Guiltless, since for me He died;

   Righteous, since He lived for me."

   § 11. Modern Views on Justification.

   Rationalistic Theories.

   These cannot be given in detail. Certain classes of opinions can be
   referred to only in the briefest manner. The Rationalists were divided
   into two classes; first, those who regarded the Scriptures as a
   supernatural revelation of natural religion, or of the truths of
   reason; and secondly, those who denied the supernatural origin of the
   Scriptures altogether, assigning to them no higher authority than
   belongs to the writings of good and wise men.

   The former class came to agree very nearly with the latter as to what
   the Bible actually teaches, or, at least, as to what is by us to be
   regarded and received as true. Those who admitted the divine origin of
   the Scriptures got rid of its distinctive doctrines by the adoption of
   a low theory of inspiration, and by the application of arbitrary
   principles of interpretation. Inspiration was, in the first instance,
   confined to the religious teachings of the Bible, then to the ideas or
   truths, but not to the form in which they were presented, nor to the
   arguments by which they were supported. The fact that Christ saves men
   in some way was admitted, but not as a sacrifice nor as a ransom, nor
   by being a substitute for sinners. The miracles of Christ were
   acknowledged as historical facts, but they were explained as mere
   natural events distorted by the imaginations of spectators and
   historians. It was granted by some that Christ and the Apostles did
   teach the Church doctrines, but this, it was said, was done only by way
   of accommodation to the prejudices, superstitions, or modes of thought
   of the men of that generation. The first step in this process was the
   denial of all distinction between the prophetic, priestly, and kingly
   offices of Christ. In this way a wet sponge was passed over all the
   doctrines of redemption, and their outlines obliterated. This unnatural
   process could not be long continued, and, therefore, the majority of
   Rationalists soon threw off all regard to the normal authority of the
   Bible, and avowed their faith in nothing which did not commend itself
   to their own understanding as true, and for that reason alone.

   As to the doctrine of justification, the whole tendency of the efforts
   during this period was, as Baur correctly says, [204] to make the
   reconciliation of man to God the work of the man himself. "A man was
   entitled to regard himself as reconciled with God as soon as he
   determined to repent and to reform." God was regarded as a father. A
   father is displeased with a son only so long as he is disobedient. The
   only end of any chastisement he may inflict, is the reformation of his
   child. If that be accomplished, all necessity and all propriety of
   punishment cease. Wegscheider, a representative of this class of
   theologians, says, [205] "Quicunque e vita turpi, qua poenas sibi
   contraxit, ad virtutem emerserit, is eadem proportione, qua jam in
   virtutis studio progressus fuerit, in gratiam cum Deo reversus, ab
   eodem præmiis dignus judicabitur."

   Philosophical Theories.

   The philosophical theories on this subject were as different as the
   systems on which they were founded. Some of these systems were
   theistic, others pantheistic, and others monistic, i.e., founded "a the
   oneness of God and man, without denying the distinct personality of
   either.

   The influence of Kant's philosophy upon theology, for a time at least,
   was very great, and in some aspects salutary. As he exalted the power
   of the pure reason, making it give law to the outward, subordinating,
   as his disciples say, the objective to the subjective, so in the sphere
   of religion and morality he exalted the power and authority of the
   practical reason. Everything was subordinate to moral excellence.
   Happiness was not the end. It was only a means of promoting and
   rewarding what is morally good. The attainment of the highest amount of
   moral excellence requires perfect harmony between happiness and
   goodness, that is, that rational creatures should be happy in exact
   proportion to their goodness, and miserable in proportion as they are
   wicked. The punishment of sin is therefore inevitable. It is determined
   by the immutable moral order of the universe, which can no more be
   changed or set aside than any physical law on which the existence or
   order of the external world depends.

   From these principles some of the Kantian theologians inferred that the
   pardon of sin is impossible. Misery is as inseparable from sin as pain
   is from the laceration of the body. If the only punishment of sin,
   however, be its natural consequences, then the removal of sin effects
   the removal of punishment. This determines the view which many of the
   disciples of Kant take of the nature of redemption. It is purely
   subjective. Men are delivered from sin and thereby from its punishment.

   To others, however, this view was unsatisfactory, (1.) Because the
   punishment of sin is not purely or exclusively natural. It is not so
   even in this world, as is proved by the deluge, by the destruction of
   the cities of the plain, and by a thousand other instances. Much less
   is it true with regard to the future world. Conscience is not the only
   worm that never dies, or remorse the only fire which is never quenched.
   (2.) Because this theory reverses the natural order of events. It makes
   reformation precede pardon, whereas pardon must precede reformation. On
   this point Bretschneider [206] quotes even Ewald [207] as saying, "It
   is as unpsychological as it is unchristian so to present Christian
   reformation, that a man must become better before he is forgiven. It is
   precisely through the love of God anticipating our reformation, by
   which the man morally dead is quickened, that the elements of all
   religion, gratitude, trust, and love are called into exercise." This is
   certainly Paul's doctrine. (3.) The theory in question overlooks guilt,
   responsibility to justice for sins already committed. (4.) The ends of
   punishment (according to the Kantians) are, first, the satisfaction of
   the moral excellence of God, who by necessity of his moral perfection
   must punish sin; secondly, the improvement of the offender; and
   thirdly, the upholding the moral order of the universe. The two former
   of these ends, Bretschneider says, may be answered by the reformation
   of the sinner. When a man ceases to sin, he ceases to be opposed to
   God, and God ceases to be opposed to him. But the third end of
   punishment, namely, preserving the moral order of the universe, is not
   answered by the sinner's reformation. He is not the only person to be
   considered. The interests of morality would suffer, if he were rendered
   happy notwithstanding his past transgression. The question then is, is
   there any way in which the authority of the moral law can be sustained,
   and yet the sinner be forgiven and rendered blessed? The Church answer
   to this question, the disciples of Kant reject as contrary to reason;
   but reason, says Bretschneider, has nothing to object to the doctrine
   stated generally that God can consistently pardon sin for Christ's
   sake. He sums up under the following heads, what reason may accept in
   regard to this whole subject. (1.) That the divine nature of Christ
   rendered his sufferings more important for the spiritual world and more
   available for man than they otherwise would have been. (2.) We cannot
   properly say that He suffered the penalty of the law, or the punishment
   of our sins, but that He endured his unmerited sufferings for the good
   of the world. (3.) That He did not make satisfaction for sin, but
   rendered secure the moral order of the universe. (4.) Although He did
   not make satisfaction, He procured or mediated our pardon. He is not
   our sponsor, but our "mediator salutis." (5.) The expression "the merit
   of Christ" does not mean any good imputed to us, or any title belonging
   to us, but simply the claim of Christ that his sufferings shall avail
   to the good of men. (6.) The word "reconciliation" is anthropopathic.
   It does not express any change in God; but either objectively the
   possibility of pardon, or subjectively the hope of pardon. (7.) "To
   impute the merit of Christ" does not mean that God regards Christ's
   obedience as our obedience, or his sufferings as our punishment, but
   simply that, through love, God has determined to render his sufferings
   available for the good of men. (8.) That Christ's death was vicarious
   in so far that in consequence thereof sin may be pardoned in the
   renewed. (9.) Justification is the application to individuals of the
   general declaration of God that He will save all who strive to reform.
   This is the highest form in which theologians regarded as rationalistic
   are willing to receive the doctrines of atonement and justification.

   Speculative Theologians.

   The views of the speculative theologians on these points have already
   been presented in the chapters on the person of Christ and on his work,
   as fully as is proper in such a work as this.

   However much this class of theologians may differ as to their
   philosophical principles, or as to the length to which they carry those
   principles in their explanation of Christian doctrine, they agree,
   first, in rejecting the Church view of the plan of salvation; they deny
   that Christ obeyed the law and bore its penalty vicariously, or as the
   substitute of sinners; they deny that his righteousness is imputed to
   the believer as the ground of his justification; they deny that saving
   faith consists in receiving and resting on the righteousness of Christ
   as something objective; they deny that justification is a forensic or
   judicial act in which God pronounces the sinner just, not on the ground
   of his subjective state or character, but on the ground of what Christ
   has done for him. All this they pronounce mechanical, external,
   magical, unreal, and unsatisfactory. On the other hand, they agree in
   representing justification as an act by which the sinner is made
   inherently or subjectively just; and consequently that his acceptance
   with God, and his title to eternal life, are founded on what he is;
   they agree in regarding faith as that state of mind which renders the
   sinner receptive of the infusion of whatever it is that renders him
   thus subjectively righteous in the sight of God. What that is, is the
   main point on which their representations differ. Those who regard man
   as only a form of the manifestation of God, say that one man's being
   justified and not another, means that God is more fully developed in
   the one than in the other; or that the one realizes more truly the idea
   of man than the other; and this, after all, consists in one's coming to
   the consciousness of his oneness with God, which others have not
   attained. "The most universal and essential idea of redemption and
   reconciliation is man's becoming one with God. The necessary objective
   assumption, on which alone the individual can be one with God, or
   redeemed and reconciled, is the truth, that man as such is one with God
   (dass der Mensch an sich mit Gott Eins ist)." [208] This, according to
   one view, is an eternal process; God is ever becoming man, and man is
   ever returning into God. According to Schleiermacher, as already
   repeatedly stated, this manifestation of God in man was hindered and
   could never become perfect by a process of natural development; and,
   therefore, by a new creative act Christ was produced, in whom the idea
   of man was fully realized, or in whom the oneness of God and man was
   clearly exhibited, and from Him a new process of development commenced
   as perfectly natural as the process before his advent, and the
   redemption of man consists in the communication of the sinlessness and
   blessedness of Christ to the individual. This is expressed commonly by
   saying that the life of Christ, -- not the Holy Spirit as derived from
   Him; not his divine nature; not his humanity; but his divine-human
   life, -- is communicated to the Church and to all its members. In other
   words, as Christ is God in human form, so is every believer. The
   incarnation goes forward in the Church. In the language of the older
   mystics, what is communicated is "the essential righteousness of God,"
   or "the essence of God," the life of God, or God Himself.

   According to this view the objective work of Christ, what He did and
   suffered is of no avail for us; it is not that which makes us
   righteous, or by which we are redeemed. Redemption and reconciliation
   are a purely subjective process; something which takes place in the
   sinner's own soul, and not something which was done for him. It matters
   little whether there was a historical Christ or not; or, at least,
   whether the facts recorded of Him be true or untrue; whether the
   Gospels are historical or mythical.

   According to another view, the work of Christ was in no sense a
   satisfaction to divine justice; neither his obedience nor his suffering
   was designed to be set over to his people with its merit, as the ground
   of their justification. The Word became flesh. He assumed our fallen
   humanity into personal union with Himself. This necessitated conflict
   and suffering as the only way in which the new life could triumph over
   the law of sin and death which belonged to our fallen humanity. This
   was the atonement of Christ, the triumph of health over disease. This
   was the victory of Christ over sin and hell. Thus He becomes the author
   of salvation to men. Humanity in Christ suffered and died, and rose
   again. That humanity is our nature. It is that which constitutes us
   what we are. By union with the Church, which is the body of Christ
   animated by his theanthropic nature or life, we become one with Him.
   What is communicated to us is not his merit, nor his Spirit, but his
   essence, his substance, his life. There is no dualism between the soul
   and body. They are one life. The soul externalizes itself in the body,
   they are one. So there is no dualism in Christ; not a divine and human
   substance; not a divine and human life; but one life which is simply
   and purely human and yet divine; for God and man are one; and humanity
   reaches its completion only when thus identified with the divine. This
   divine-human life passes over from Christ to the Church; and this takes
   place in the way of history, growth, and development. Partaking thus of
   the life of Christ, we partake of its righteousness, its holiness, and
   its glory. Thus redemption is purely subjective. It is wrought in us,
   although the source is without us. As we partake of Adam's sin and
   condemnation, because we partake of his nature; so we partake of
   Christ's righteousness and holiness because we partake of his
   divine-human life, or of humanity as healed and exalted in Him. [209]

   Ebrard of Erlangen.

   There is an important class of modern theological writers, of whom Dr.
   J. H. A. Ebrard of Erlangen may be taken as a representative, who
   consider themselves faithful to the doctrines of the Reformation, while
   developing them into new forms. As Ebrard represents this class of
   writers among the Reformed, so Delitzsch does the same for the Lutheran
   theologians. These writers are abundantly orthodox in their exposition
   of the nature of Christ's work. This is especially true of Delitzsch in
   his admirable treatise on "The Vicarious Satisfaction of Christ." [210]
   As these writers identify regeneration and justification, their views
   may be found briefly stated in the chapter on regeneration.

   Christ, it is admitted, made expiation for sin and satisfied the
   justice of God as our substitute by his vicarious obedience and
   sufferings. This righteousness, however, becomes ours not by being
   received by faith and imputed to us by the just judgment of God, but by
   regeneration, whereby we become partakers of the life, substance, or
   essence, however it may be designated, of Christ. On this subject
   Ebrard says: "Regeneration is the substantial objective ground both of
   the transient act of justification, and of the progressive work of
   sanctification; whereas conversion (repentance and faith) is the
   subjective condition of both. And justification as the act of the
   Father, is a forensic judicial act; as the act of Christ, it is
   identical with regeneration, i.e., with the real implantation of Christ
   in us and of us in Christ." Both propositions, therefore, he says, are
   equally true, namely, "Christ justifies us; and faith justifies us." In
   explaining this, he says: "Dikaios before God is one who does not merit
   punishment; who is free from guilt in the sight of God's eternal law,
   either because he is absolutely sinless, or holy, never having
   contracted guilt, as in the case of Christ; or because his guilt has
   been expiated, and his lack of the righteousness demanded by the law is
   covered. Dikaoun means either to acknowledge as dikaios one who is
   dikaios or to make dikaios one who is not dikaios." The latter is its
   sense when used in reference to sinners. In their case, "The act of
   dikaiosis consists, (1.) In the gift of the expiation (Sühne) made by
   Christ without the sinner's coöperation; and (2.) In the gift of the
   absolute righteousness of Christ, in such sense that God does not
   regard the sinner as he is by nature, and by self-development, but as
   he is as implanted in Christ." There is, therefore, a clear distinction
   to be made between the appropriation of righteousness, and the
   procuring of righteousness. "Christ has procured and merited (erworben
   hat) righteousness by his historical life and sufferings; it is applied
   by Christ's being born in us." "The Scriptures," he says, "do not speak
   of Christ's righteousness being imputed to us. They teach that it comes
   upon us (Rom. v. 18), and becomes our own. It is our own, however,
   because the person of Christ becomes ours in the strictest possible
   (allerrealsten, the most literal) sense of the terms." What Ebrard
   contends for is (die substantielle Lebenseinheit mit der Person
   Christi), the substantial oneness of life with Christ; [211] or as he
   often elsewhere expresses it, "the mysterious, mystical communication
   of the substance of Christ to the central substance of man." [212] Dr.
   Alexander Schweizer of Zürich, [213] although differing much in other
   points from Ebrard, agrees with him in this. The essential element in
   the work of Christ, he says, "is the founding and upholding a community
   animated or pervaded by his theanthropic life (gottmenschlichen
   Lebenspotenz). Dr. Nevin [214] says, "Our nature reaches after a true
   and real union with the nature of God, as the necessary complement and
   consummation of its own life. The idea which it embodies can never be
   fully actualized, under any other form. The incarnation is the proper
   completion of humanity. Christ is the true ideal man." "The incarnation
   was no mere theophany; no transient wonder; no illusion exhibited to
   the senses. . . . . The Word became flesh; not a single man only, as
   one among many; but flesh,' or humanity in its universal conception.
   How else could He be the principle of a general life, the origin of a
   new order of existence for the human world as such? How else could the
   value of his mediatorial work be made over to us in a real way, by a
   true imputation, and not a legal fiction only?" [215] "Christianity is
   a life, not only as revealed at first in Christ, but as continued also
   in the Church. It flows over from Christ to his people, always in this
   form. They do not simply bear his name and acknowledge his doctrine.
   They are so united to Him as to have part in the substance of his life
   itself." [216] He had before said, [217] that "by the hypostatical
   union of the two natures in the person of Jesus Christ, our humanity as
   fallen in Adam was exalted again to a new and imperishable divine
   life." "The object of the incarnation was to couple the human nature in
   real union with the Logos, as a permanent source of life." Again, [218]
   "the new life of which Christ is the source and organic principle, is
   in all respects a true human life; . . . . . not a new humanity, wholly
   dissevered from that of Adam; but the humanity of Adam itself, only
   raised to a higher character, and filled with new meaning and power, by
   its union with the divine nature. . . . . Christ's life, as now
   described, rests not in his separate person, but passes over to his
   people; thus constituting the Church, which is his body, the fulness of
   Him that filleth all in all." "Christ communicates his own life
   substantially to the soul on which He acts, causing it to grow into his
   very nature. This is the mystical union; the basis of our whole
   salvation; the only medium by which it is possible for us to have an
   interest in the grace of Christ under any other view." [219] With his
   substance, his life, his divine-human nature thus communicated to the
   soul come his merit, his holiness, his power, his glory. These are
   predicates of the nature which becomes ours, constituting our personal
   life and character. Even the resurrection is to be effected, not by the
   power of Christ operating "ab extra," as when He raised Lazarus from
   the dead, but by "a new divine element, introduced into our nature by
   the incarnation." [220]

   Objections to these Theories.

   In opposition to these views it may be said very briefly in the way of
   recapitulation of what has been more fully said in the chapters above
   referred to, --

   1. That this is a philosophy. The scheme has its entire basis in a
   philosophical theory as to the nature of man and his relation to God.
   This is undeniable, and is hardly denied. Dr. Nevin states three
   "scientific principles," ignorance of which led the Reformers to a
   misapprehension and imperfect representation of Christianity, and the
   recognition of which and of their application to theology, enables the
   modern theologian to set forth the nature and plan of salvation in a
   much more satisfactory light. Those principles are, (1.) The true
   import of organic law. The Reformers did not make a clear distinction,
   he says, "between the idea of the organic law which constitutes the
   proper identity of a human body, and the material volume it is found to
   embrace as exhibited to the senses." There may be, therefore, a real
   communication of Christ and even of his body to his people without a
   communication of his flesh. (2.) The absolute unity involved in
   personality. In the case of Christ, body, soul, and divinity are united
   in "a single indivisible life," so that where the one is, all are. To
   communicate Christ to the soul is therefore to communicate that
   indivisible life, including in it as an organizing, organic principle,
   body, soul, and divinity. (3.) The distinction between individual and
   generic life. "In every sphere of life," it is said, "the individual
   and the general are found closely united in the same subject." The
   acorn, in one view, is only a single existence; but it includes the
   force of a life capable of reaching far beyond itself. The life of a
   forest of oaks is only the expansion of the life of the original acorn,
   "and the whole general existence thus produced is bound together,
   inwardly and organically, by as true and close a unity as that which
   holds in any of the single existences embraced in it, separately
   considered." Thus also Adam, in one view, was a man; in another, he was
   the man. A whole world of separate personalities lay involved in his
   life, as a generic principle or root. "Adam lives in his posterity as
   truly as he has ever lived in his own person." In like manner, although
   in a higher form, the life of Christ is to be viewed under the same
   twofold aspect In one view the Saviour was a man; but in another, He
   was the man, "the Son of man, in whose person stood revealed the true
   idea of humanity, under its ultimate and most comprehensive form.
   Without any loss or change of character in the first view, his life is
   carried over in this last view continually into the persons of his
   people. He lives in Himself, and yet lives in their really and truly at
   the same time." As we participate in Adam's whole nature, soul and
   body, so the people of Christ participate in his whole nature, body,
   soul, and divinity. These are one indivisible life; and that one
   theanthropic life is communicated to believers and constitutes them
   Christians. In this is included all their participation in the
   righteousness, merit, and glory of their Redeemer. [221]

   Behind and under these three scientific principles there is another
   without which the three mentioned amount to nothing; namely, the unity
   of God and man. Man in his highest form; the ideal or perfect man; He
   in whom the idea of humanity is fully realized, is God. What does it
   amount to, if we admit that "organic law" constitutes identity, as in
   the case of man; or that personality includes the idea of "one
   indivisible life;" that in man there is not one life of the body and
   another of the soul, that these are only different manifestations of
   one and the same life; that the soul can no more be without the body
   than the body without the soul; and that in Christ there is not one
   life of the divinity and another of his humanity? Suppose we deny what
   the Church in all ages has affirmed, that there are two energeiai in
   Christ, what does this amount to? Or what does it avail to admit the
   realistic doctrine of a generic life; if that life (one and
   indivisible) be merely human, Adamic? How can it redeem us? It is only
   on the assumption that the human and the divine are one, that this
   unity, fully realized in Christ, constitutes the "one indivisible life"
   which passes over to us; that it has any redeeming power; and that it
   exalts man from his degradation, and brings him back to conscious as
   well as real unity with God.

   This theory as presented by Schleiermacher, its author in modern times,
   was undeniably pantheistic; as held by many of his disciples, it is, in
   their apprehension, theistic. In either form the leading idea of the
   identity of God and man is retained. [222] Christ is the ideal man. In
   Him the idea of humanity is fully realized. and therefore He is God.
   The manifestation of God in the form of man, belongs to the divine
   nature. The incarnation is entirely independent of the fall of man; or,
   admitting that the failure of the race to reach its true ideal in the
   first instance was the occasion of a new, special, and supernatural
   intervention, yet the whole end of that intervention was to realize the
   original idea of humanity as God made flesh.

   The watchword of this whole system is, in the language of Dr. Ullmann,
   "The life of Christ is Christianity;" i.e., the one indivisible life of
   Christ; the life of God in the form of humanity. And that life as
   communicated to men brings them to this real, substantial life union
   with God. "What," asks Dr. Ullmann, "is that in the personality of
   Christ by which He is constituted a perfect Saviour in the way of
   atonement and redemption? We reply generally, his own substantial
   nature, at once human and divine; his life filled with all the
   attributes of God, and representing at the same time the highest
   conception of nature and man; complete and self-sufficient in its own
   fulness, and yet by this fulness itself the free principle of a new
   corresponding life-process, in the way of self-communication, for the
   human world. This life itself, however, has again its central heart, to
   which especially we must look for the peculiar being of Christ. Here
   the whole theology of the present time, in all its different
   tendencies, may be said to have but one voice. That which constitutes
   the special being of Christ, makes Him to be what He is and gives Him
   thus his highest significance for the world, is the absolute unity of
   the divine and human in his nature. Deity and manhood in Him come fully
   together and are made one. This is the last ground of Christianity.
   Here above all we are to look for its distinctive character." He goes
   on to show that on this point all are agreed. God and man are one. The
   difference is between the pantheistic and the Christian view which
   acknowledges a personal God and a positive revelation. "For the whole
   apprehension of Christianity, we may say, not only that much, but that
   all depends on the question, which of these views shall be adopted;
   whether this central fact shall be regarded as a general unity of the
   divine and human' realizing itself in the consciousness of the race as
   such, or be conceived of as a concrete union of God and man,' that
   actualizes itself from a definite point and only under certain moral
   conditions." [223] That is, whether God is incarnate in the race or in
   the Church. According to the latter view, the life of Christ, his human
   life, "filled with all the attributes of God," passes over to his
   people, by a process of natural development. As we are fallen men by
   partaking of the nature or generic life of Adam, we are God-men, and
   therefore redeemed by partaking of the divine human nature or generic
   life of Christ.

   That the oneness of God and man is the ultimate principle on which this
   heteron euangelion rests, is obvious not only from the general
   character of the philosophy from which it is derived, but also from the
   fact that everything is made to depend upon the life of Christ becoming
   the life of his people, not by his controlling their life by his Spirit
   dwelling in them, but by a substantial union and identification of
   their life with his, of them with Him. We can measurably understand
   what is meant by life, by organic life, by a life principle or force
   which develops itself, and communicates and transmits itself in a given
   form. We know what is meant when it is said that the life of the acorn
   is developed into an oak, and communicated to other acorns, and thus to
   other oaks in endless succession and boundless multiplication. But here
   the essential idea is the unity and sameness of the life transmitted.
   You cannot combine the "organic law," or life, of the apple with that
   of the acorn, so that the life transmitted should be "an
   acorn-apple-life." Much less can you combine the organic life principle
   of an animal with that of the acorn, so as to produce an
   "acorn-bovine," or, "an acorn-equine life." Least of all can you
   combine the intellectual life of man with that of the oak, so as to
   have a "human-oak-life." Therefore if the life of God and the life of
   man be so combined as to constitute one life and that a divine-human
   life, then God and man must be one; i.e., one substance, one life
   differently manifested. Those who press the modern doctrine of the
   correlation of forces to the extreme of making thought and gravity
   identical, may accept these conclusions. With them the universe and all
   it contains, all its physical, mental, æsthetic, moral, and religious
   phenomena are to be referred to one and the same force variously
   modified. The same force modified by the brain produces all the
   phenomena of mind; as modified by animal tissues, all the phenomena of
   animal life; and as modified by vegetable organisms all the phenomena
   of vegetable life, -- a theory which has been annihilated as by a bolt
   from heaven by the single question. Where is the brain which elaborated
   the mind, which framed the universe?

   It may indeed be said, and is said by modern theologians, that God
   became man, and therefore man may become God. God and man, they say,
   were so united as to become one nature or life in the person of Christ.
   But this is contrary to Scripture and to the faith of the Church
   universal. There is not a historical Church on earth, and never has
   been, whose creed does not teach that in the person of Christ two
   distinct natures or substances are united, that He was born, not merely
   "per," but "ex matre sua Maria," of her substance; that He is as man
   consubstantial with men, as God consubstantial with the Father; or as
   the Apostle expresses it, kata sarka, He is the son of David, kata
   pneuma the Son of God. Humanity and divinity in Him are no more
   identified or reduced to one life, than soul and body in man are
   identified or reduced to one life.

   This whole modern theory of the Gospel rests, therefore, ultimately on
   the idea of the identity of God and man; that man is a "modus
   existendi" of God.

   The grand objection to this scheme is that it is a philosophy. It is a
   product of the human mind. It is the wisdom of the world. It is the
   recent philosophy of the speculative school of Germany, clothed in
   Biblical forms and phrases. The reason why the Reformers did not
   present the plan of salvation in this form, is declared to be that they
   were ignorant of modern philosophy. It is because Hegel thought that
   the Gospel admitted of being cast into the mould of his philosophy that
   he pronounced Christianity to be the absolute religion. All, therefore,
   that the Bible says of the "wisdom of the wise," "of the wisdom of
   men," of "the wisdom of the world," of "philosophy as a vain deceit,"
   applies, and was intended to apply to this scheme and to all of like
   nature. "To the poor the gospel is preached." The Gospel is designed
   for babes and sucklings. He that runs may read and understand it. This
   system not one man in ten thousand can understand.

   These Theories Unscriptural.

   2. The second great objection to this scheme is that it is
   unscriptural. The Bible tells us that Christ saves us as a priest. This
   a child can understand. He knows that a priest takes the place of those
   for whom he acts; that he approaches God in their behalf; that he makes
   expiation for sin; that he does what satisfies the demands of God's
   justice against the sinner, so that He can be just and yet justify the
   ungodly. He knows that a priest saves, not by what he does in us, not
   by imparting his life to us, but by what he does for us; by an
   objective, and not by a subjective work. What there is of an inward
   work, and that is much and absolutely necessary, is not the work of a
   priest, under which aspect the work of Christ is so prominently
   presented in the Scriptures. Again, Christ saves us as a sacrifice; but
   a sacrifice is a substitute; it bears the sins of the offender; dies in
   his stead, and by its vicarious death delivers the offerer from the
   penalty which he had incurred. A sacrifice is not a symbol of an inward
   conflict between good and evil; its proximate design is not to effect a
   subjective change in the sinner; it does not produce or communicate a
   new principle of life, much less its own generic life to the offerer by
   which his real redemption is effected.

   In like manner the Bible teaches that Christ gave Himself as a ransom
   for many. But a ransom is a price paid. Those delivered by it are
   bought. They are delivered by purchase. A ransom meets and satisfies
   the claims of a third party. This is its essential idea, and cannot be
   omitted without rejecting the very truth, which the Scriptures, in the
   use of the term, design to teach. This again is an objective work. It
   is something which the person redeemed neither does, nor inwardly
   experiences; but which is done for him and without him and not in him.

   Moreover, the whole idea of redemption, the primary truth taught in
   setting forth Christ as a Redeemer, is that He delivers his people not
   by power, not by instruction, not by moral influence, not by any
   subjective change wrought in them, and not by any new form of life
   imparted to them, but by purchase. This is the signification and the
   meaning of the word. The words apolutrosis, lutroun, agorazein,
   exagorazein, are never used in Scripture in reference to the work of
   Christ in any other sense than that of deliverance by purchase or
   payment of a ransom; and to substitute any other mode of deliverance,
   is to put man's thoughts in the place of God's truth; it is to
   substitute the human for the divine; the worthless for the priceless.

   Moreover, Christ is constantly represented as a rock, a refuge, a
   hiding place. The duty required of sinners is trust; relying on Him and
   his work, as something out of themselves on which to place their hope
   toward God.

   These Theories lead Men to trust to themselves.

   3. This introduces the third great objection to this scheme. It makes
   redemption subjective. It is what we are; what we become; it is the
   Christ within us; the new heart, the new nature, the new life, the
   divine-human life of Christ, or whatever else it may be called, which
   is at once the ground of our justification and the source of
   sanctification. This is utterly inconsistent with the Bible, and with
   the experience of the people of God in all ages and under all
   dispensations. In no instance are believers represented as trusting to
   what is within them, but to what is without them. The Protestant
   doctrine, as we have seen, makes full provision for an inward work of
   deliverance from the power of sin, as well as for redemption from the
   curse of the law; for sanctification as well as for justification. But
   it does not confound the two, neither does it refer either or both to
   the new principle of life, the new seed or leaven implanted or inserted
   which works as "an organic law," and by a regular process of
   development, as natural as the operation of any other law. The whole
   work of the Spirit is ignored in this new theory of redemption. What in
   the Bible is referred to the Spirit of God is, by the theologians of
   this class, referred to the "divine-human" nature of Christ. The
   latter, and not the former, is the proximate and efficient source of
   holiness of heart and life. "Christ," says Dr. Nevin, "does dwell in
   us, by his Spirit; but only as his Spirit constitutes the very form and
   power of his own presence as the incarnate and everlasting Word." [224]
   That is, the Spirit is the power of the incarnate Word, i.e., of the
   divine-human life of Christ. "The life," he adds, "thus wrought in our
   souls by his agency, is not a production out of nothing, but the very
   life of Jesus Himself organically continued in this way over into our
   persons." "It is with the mediatorial life of Christ that the Christian
   salvation, in the form now contemplated, is concerned. In this is
   comprehended the entire new creation revealed by the Gospel; the
   righteousness of Christ, and all the benefits He has procured for his
   people. But the mediatorial life, by the communication of which only
   all this grace is made to pass over to men, is one and undivided;" and
   this life, as he goes on to show, includes his body, soul, and
   divinity. To the same effect, [225] it is said, "That the whole
   spiritual life of the Christian, including the resurrection of his
   body, is thus organically connected with the mediatorial life of the
   Lord Jesus, might seem to be too plainly taught in the New Testament to
   admit of any question; and yet we find many slow to allow the mystery,
   notwithstanding. A very common view appears to be, that the whole
   salvation of the Gospel is accomplished in a more or less outward and
   mechanical way, by supernatural might and power, rather than by the
   Spirit of the Lord as a revelation of a new historical life in the
   person of the believer Himself. So we have an outward imputation of
   righteousness to begin with; a process of sanctification carried
   forward by the help of proper spiritual machinery brought to bear on
   the soul, including perhaps, as its basis, the notion of an abrupt
   creation de novo,' by the fiat of the Holy Ghost; and finally, to crown
   all, a sudden unprepared refabrication of the body, to be superadded to
   the life of the spirit already complete in its state of glory." The
   doctrines of justification by the imputation of the righteousness of
   Christ; of the regeneration and sanctification of the soul by the
   supernatural power of the Spirit, and the resurrection of the body by
   the power of God at the last day, are rejected and despised; and the
   doctrine substituted for them is, that the divine-human life of Christ,
   as a new organic law, develops itself in the Church, just as the life
   of the acorn develops itself in the oak and in the forest, by a
   natural, historical process, so that the members of the Church, in
   virtue of their participation of this life, are justified and
   sanctified, and their bodies (since the life of Christ is a human life
   actualizing itself outwardly in a body as well as inwardly in a soul),
   ultimately raised from the dead, are fashioned after the glorious body
   of Christ. The resurrection of the body is as much a natural process as
   the development of a seed into a flower, or of a grub into a butterfly.
   This is Dr. Nevin's own illustration: "The birth of the butterfly, as
   it mounts in the air on wings of light, is comparatively sudden, too;
   but this is the revelation only of a life which had been gradually
   formed for this efflorescence before, under cover of the vile,
   unsightly larve." "The new creation," he says, "is indeed supernatural;
   but as such it is strictly conformable to the general order and
   constitution of life. It is a new creation in Christ Jesus, not by Him
   in the way of mere outward power. The subjects of it are saved, only by
   being brought within the sphere of his life, as a regular, historical,
   divine-human process, in the Church. The new nature implanted in them
   at their regeneration, is not a higher order of existence framed for
   them at the moment out of nothing by the fiat of God, but truly and
   strictly a continuation of Christ's life over in their persons." [226]

   This is the modern view of Christianity introduced by Schleiermacher,
   modified more or less by his disciples, and which has passed over into
   England and into this country. Humanity as revealed in Adam as a
   generic life was too feeble. Its development failed and would have ever
   failed to reach the ideal. Therefore God interposed and interrupted the
   process of natural development by the production of a new ideal man
   containing in himself a generic life, a seed, a principle, an organic
   law, which develops itself in the Church by a historical process, just
   as the life of Adam developed itself in his posterity. We, therefore,
   are justified, not by what Christ did, but by his life in us, which is
   as truly and properly our life, as the life we derived from Adam is our
   own life. We must stand before God to be justified or condemned,
   accepted or rejected, on the ground of what we are. We have nothing to
   offer but our own subjective, inherent character such as it is. The man
   is to be pitied who dares to do this. It is surely better to agree with
   Paul, who renounced his own righteousness, his own goodness, everything
   pertaining to himself, everything subjective, and trusted only and
   confidently to the righteousness of Christ received by faith.

CHAPTER XVIII.

  SANCTIFICATION
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Its Nature.

   Sanctification in the Westminster Catechism is said to be "the work of
   God's free grace, whereby we are renewed in the whole man after the
   image of God, and are enabled more and more to die unto sin and live
   unto righteousness."

   Agreeably to this definition, justification differs from
   sanctification, (1.) In that the former is a transient act, the latter
   a progressive work. (2.) Justification is a forensic act, God acting as
   judge, declaring justice satisfied so far as the believing sinner is
   concerned, whereas sanctification is an effect due to the divine
   efficiency. (3.) Justification changes, or declares to be changed, the
   relation of the sinner to the justice of God; sanctification involves a
   change of character. (4.) The former, therefore, is objective, the
   latter subjective. (5.) The former is founded on what Christ has done
   for us; the latter is the effect of what He does in us. (6.)
   Justification is complete and the same in all, while sanctification is
   progressive, and is more complete in some than in others.

   Sanctification is declared to be a work of God's free grace. Two things
   are included in this. First, that the power or influence by which it is
   carried on is supernatural. Secondly, that granting this influence to
   any sinner, to one sinner rather than another, and to one more than to
   another, is a matter of favour. No one has personally, or in himself,
   on the ground of anything he has done, the right to claim this divine
   influence as a just recompense, or as a matter of justice.

   It is a Supernatural Work.

   In representing, in accordance with Scripture, sanctification as a
   supernatural work, or as a work of grace, the Church intends to deny
   the Pelagian or Rationalistic doctrine which confounds it with mere
   moral reformation. It not unfrequently happens that men who have been
   immoral in their lives, change their whole course of living. They
   become outwardly correct in their deportment, temperate, pure, honest,
   and benevolent. This is a great and praiseworthy change. It is in a
   high degree beneficial to the subject of it, and to all with whom he is
   connected. It may be produced by different causes, by the force of
   conscience and by a regard for the authority of God and a dread of his
   disapprobation, or by a regard to the good opinion of men, or by the
   mere force of an enlightened regard to one's own interest. But whatever
   may be the proximate cause of such reformation, it falls very far short
   of sanctification. The two things differ in nature as much as a clean
   heart from clean clothes. Such external reformation may leave a man's
   inward character in the sight of God unchanged. He may remain destitute
   of love to God, of faith in Christ, and of all holy exercises or
   affections.

   Nor is sanctification to be confounded with the effects of moral
   culture or discipline. It is very possible, as experience proves, by
   careful moral training, by keeping the young from all contaminating
   influences, and by bringing them under the forming influences of right
   principles and good associates, to preserve them from much of the evil
   of the world, and to render them like the young man in the Gospel whom
   Jesus loved. Such training is not to be undervalued. It is enjoined in
   the Word of God. It cannot, however, change the nature. It cannot
   impart life. A faultless statue fashioned out of pure marble in all its
   beauty, is far below a living man.

   The word supernatural, as before said, is used in two senses. First,
   for that which is above nature, and by nature is meant everything out
   of God. An effect, therefore, is said to be supernatural, in the
   production of which nature exercises no efficiency. But secondly, the
   word is often used to mark the distinction between the providential
   efficiency of God operating according to fixed laws, and the voluntary
   agency of the Holy Spirit. The Bible makes a wide distinction between
   the providence of God and the operations of his grace. The difference
   between the two is, in some respects, analogous to that between the
   efficiency of a law, or of a uniformly acting force, and the agency of
   a person. The one is ordered, the other is exercised from time to time,
   the Spirit distributing his gifts to every one severally as He wills.
   In the providential agency of God, the effects produced never transcend
   the power of second causes as upheld and guided by Him; whereas the
   effects produced by the Spirit do transcend the power of second causes.
   The effect is due neither to the power of the truth, nor to that of the
   rational subject in whom the effect is produced. It is due to the power
   of God over and above the power of the second causes concerned. The
   effects of grace, or fruits of the Spirit, are above the sphere of the
   natural they belong to the supernatural. The mere power of truth,
   argument, motive, persuasion, or eloquence cannot produce repentance,
   faith, or holiness of heart and life. Nor can these effects be produced
   by the power of the will, or by all the resources of man, however
   protracted or skilful in their application. They are the gifts of God,
   the fruits of the Spirit. Paul may plant and Apollos water, but it is
   God who gives the increase.

   In this latter sense of the word supernatural, the cooperation of
   second causes is not excluded. When Christ opened the eyes of the blind
   no second cause interposed between his volition and the effect. But men
   work out their own salvation, while it is God who worketh in them to
   will and to do, according to his own good pleasure. In the work of
   regeneration, the soul is passive. It cannot cooperate in the
   communication of spiritual life. But in conversion, repentance, faith,
   and growth in grace, all its powers are called into exercise. As,
   however, the effects produced transcend the efficiency of our fallen
   nature, and are due to the agency of the Spirit, sanctification does
   not cease to be supernatural, or a work of grace, because the soul is
   active and cooperating in the process.

   Proof of its Supernatural Character.

   That sanctification is a supernatural work in the sense above stated is
   proved, --

   1. From the fact that it is constantly referred to God as its author.
   It is referred to God absolutely, or to the Father, as in 1
   Thessalonians v. 23, "The very God of peace sanctify you wholly."
   Hebrews xiii. 20, 21, "The God of peace that brought again from the
   dead our Lord Jesus . . . . make you perfect in every good work to do
   his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight." It
   is also referred to the Son, as in Titus ii. 14, He "gave himself for
   us, that he might . . . . purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous
   of good works." Ephesians v. 25, He "loved the church and gave himself
   for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water
   by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not
   having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy
   and without blemish." Predominantly sanctification is referred to the
   Holy Spirit, as his peculiar work in the economy of redemption. Hence
   He is called the Spirit of all grace; the Spirit of joy, of peace, of
   love, of faith, and of adoption. All Christian graces are set forth as
   fruits of the Spirit. We are said to be born of the Spirit, and by Him
   to he enlightened, taught, led, and cleansed. We are said to be in the
   Spirit, to live, to walk, and to rejoice in the Spirit. The Spirit
   dwells in the people of God, and is the abiding source of all the
   actings of that spiritual life which He implants in the soul. The Bible
   teaches that the Son and Spirit are in the Holy Trinity subordinate to
   the Father, as to their mode of subsistence and operation, although the
   same in substance, and equal in power and glory. Hence it is that the
   same work is often attributed to the Father, to the Son, and to the
   Spirit; and as the Father and Son operate through the Spirit, the
   effects due to the agency of God are referred specially to the Holy
   Ghost.

   This reference of sanctification to God proves it to be a supernatural
   work, because the insufficiency of second causes to produce the effect
   is declared to be the ground of this reference. It is because men
   cannot cleanse or heal themselves, that they are declared to be
   cleansed and healed by God. It is because rites, ceremonies,
   sacraments, truth, and moral suasion, cannot bring the soul back to
   God, that it is said to be transformed, by the renewing of the mind,
   through the power of the Spirit, into the image of God. We are,
   therefore, declared to be God's workmanship, created unto good works.
   And it is not we that live, but Christ that liveth in us.

   All Holy Exercises referred to the Spirit as their Author.

   2. This reference of sanctification to God as its author, the more
   decisively proves the supernatural character of the work, because the
   reference is not merely general, as when the wind and rain, and the
   production of vegetable and animal life, are referred to his universal
   providential agency. The reference is special. The effect is one which
   the Scriptures recognize as not within the sphere of second causes, and
   therefore ascribe to God. They recognize the free agency of man; they
   acknowledge and treat him as a moral and rational being; they admit the
   adaptation of of truth to convince the understanding, and of the
   motives presented to determine the will and to control the affections,
   and nevertheless they teach that these secondary causes and influences
   be utterly ineffectual to the conversion and sanctification of the
   soul, without the demonstration of the Spirit. The sacred writers,
   therefore, constantly pray for this divine influence, "extrinsecus
   accidens," to attend the means of grace and to render them effectual,
   as well for sanctification as for regeneration and conversion. Every
   such prayer, every thanksgiving for grace imparted, every recognition
   of the Christian virtues as fruits of the Spirit, and gifts of God, are
   so many recognitions of the great truth that the restoration of man to
   the image of God is not a work of nature, either originated or carried
   on by the efficiency of second causes, but is truly and properly
   supernatural, as due to the immediate power of the Spirit producing
   effects for which second causes are inadequate.

   We are taught to pray for Repentance, Faith, and other Graces.

   3. We accordingly find the Apostle and the sacred writers generally,
   referring not only regeneration, the communication of spiritual life to
   those spiritually dead, but the continuance of that life in its
   activity and growth, not merely to the power of God, but to his
   almighty power. Paul prays in Ephesians i. 19, that his readers might
   know "what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who
   believe according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought
   in Christ when he raised him from the dead." The same almighty power
   which was exhibited in the resurrection of Christ, is exercised in the
   spiritual resurrection of the believer. And as the power which raised
   Christ from the dead was exercised in his ascension and glorification;
   so also the same power, according to the Apostle, which is exerted in
   the spiritual resurrection of the believer, is exercised in carrying on
   his sanctification, which is inward and real glorification.
   Accordingly, in the same Epistle (iii. 7), he ascribes all the grace
   whereby he was fitted for the apostleship, "to the effectual working of
   his power." And further on (ver. 20), to encourage the people of God to
   pray for spiritual blessings, he reminds them of his omnipotence
   whereby He was "able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask
   or think, according to the power that worketh in us." It is almighty
   power, therefore, and not the impotence of secondary influences, which
   works in the believer and carries on the work of his salvation.

   They who are in Christ, therefore, are new creatures. They are created
   anew in Christ Jesus. This does not refer exclusively to their
   regeneration, but to the process by which the sinner is transformed
   into the image of Christ.

   Argument from the Believer's Union with Christ.

   4. All that the Scriptures teach concerning the union between the
   believer and Christ, and of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, proves
   the supernatural character of our sanctification. Men do not make
   themselves holy; their holiness, and their growth in grace, are not due
   to their own fidelity, or firmness of purpose, or watchfulness and
   diligence, although all these are required, but to the divine influence
   by which they are rendered thus faithful, watchful, and diligent, and
   which produces in them the fruits of righteousness. Without me, saith
   our Lord, ye can do nothing. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,
   except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me. The
   hand is not more dependent on the head for the continuance of its
   vitality, than is the believer on Christ for the continuance of
   spiritual life in the soul.

   Argument from related Doctrines.

   5. This, however, is one of those doctrines which pervade the whole
   Scriptures. It follows of necessity from what the Bible teaches of the
   natural state of man since the fall; it is assumed, asserted, and
   implied in all that is revealed of the plan of salvation. By their
   apostasy, men lost the image of God; they are born in a state of
   alienation and condemnation. They are by nature destitute of spiritual
   life. From this state it is as impossible that they should deliver
   themselves, as that those in the grave should restore life to their
   wasted bodies, and when restored, continue and invigorate it by their
   own power. Our whole salvation is of Christ. Those who are in the grave
   hear his voice. They are raised by his power. And when they live it is
   He who lives in them. This is the doctrine which our Lord Himself so
   clearly and so frequently teaches, and upon which his Apostles so
   strenuously insist. St. Paul in the sixth and seventh chapters of his
   Epistle to the Romans, where he treats of this subject "in extenso,"
   has for his main object to prove that as we are not justified or our
   own righteousness, so we are not sanctified by our own power, or by the
   mere objective power of the truth. The law, the revelation of the will
   of God, including everything which He has made known to man either as a
   rule of obedience or as exhibiting his own attributes and purposes, was
   equally inadequate to secure justification and sanctification. As it
   demanded perfect obedience and pronounced accursed those who continue
   not in all things written in the book of the law to do them, it can
   only condemn. It can never pronounce the sinner just. And as it was a
   mere outward presentation of the truth, it could no more change the
   heart than light could give sight to the blind. He winds up his
   discussions of the subject with the exclamation, "O wretched man that I
   am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God,
   through Jesus Christ our Lord." His deliverance was to be effected by
   God through Jesus Christ. We learn from the eighth chapter that he was
   fully confident of this deliverance, and we learn also the ground on
   which that confidence rested. It was not that he had in regeneration
   received strength to sanctify himself, or that by the force of his own
   will, or by the diligent use of natural or appointed means, the end was
   to be accomplished without further aid from God. On the contrary, his
   confidence was founded, (1.) On the fact that he had been delivered
   from the law, from its curse, and from its inexorable demand of perfect
   obedience. (2.) On the fact that he had received the Spirit as the
   source of a new, divine, and imperishable life. (3.) This life was not
   a mere state of mind, but the life of God, or the Spirit of God
   dwelling in the heart; which indwelling secured not only the
   continuance of "spiritual mindedness," but even the resurrection from
   the dead. "For if," says he, "the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
   from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead
   shall also quicken (zoopoiesei make alive with the life of Christ) your
   mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." (4.) Being led by
   the Spirit of God as the controlling principle of their inward and
   outward life, believers are the sons of God. The Spirit of God which is
   in them being the Spirit of the Son, is in them the Spirit of sonship,
   i.e., it produces in them the feelings of sons toward God, and assures
   them of their title to all the privileges of his children. (5.) The
   sanctification and ultimate salvation of believers are secured by the
   immutable decree of God. For those "whom he did foreknow he also did
   predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son; . . . . moreover,
   whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them
   he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified." This
   last includes sanctification; the inward glory of the soul; the divine
   image as retraced by the Spirit of God, which to and in the believer is
   the Spirit of glory. (1 Pet. iv. 14.) The indwelling of the Spirit
   renders the believer glorious. (6.) The infinite and immutable love
   which induced God to give his own Son for our salvation, renders it
   certain that all other things shall be given necessary to keep them in
   the love and fellowship of God. Salvation, therefore, from beginning to
   end is of grace; not only as being gratuitous to the exclusion of all
   merit on the part of the saved, but also as being carried on by the
   continued operation of grace, or the supernatural power of the Spirit.
   Christ is our all. He is of God made unto us wisdom, and righteousness,
   sanctification and redemption.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. Wherein it consists.

   Admitting sanctification to be a supernatural work, the question still
   remains, What does it consist in? What is the nature of the effect
   produced? The truth which lies at the foundation of all the Scriptural
   representations of this subject is, that regeneration, the quickening,
   of which believers are the subject, while it involves the implanting,
   or communication of a new principle or form of life, does not effect
   the immediate and entire deliverance of the soul from all sin. A man
   raised from the dead may be and long continue to be, in a very feeble,
   diseased, and suffering state. So the soul by nature dead in sin, may
   be quickened together with Christ, and not be rendered thereby perfect.
   The principle of life may be very feeble, it may have much in the soul
   uncongenial with its nature, and the conflict between the old and the
   new life may be protracted and painful. Such not only may be, but such
   in fact is the case in all the ordinary experience of the people of
   God. Here we find one of the characteristic and far-reaching
   differences between the Romish and Protestant systems of doctrine and
   religion. According to the Romish system, nothing of the nature of sin
   remains in the soul after regeneration as effected in baptism. From
   this the theology of the Church of Rome deduces its doctrine of the
   merit of good works; of perfection; of works of supererogation; and,
   indirectly, those of absolution and indulgences. But according to the
   Scriptures, the universal experience of Christians, and the undeniable
   evidence of history, regeneration does not remove all sin. The Bible is
   filled with the record of the inward conflicts of the most eminent of
   the servants of God, with their falls, their backslidings, their
   repentings, and their lamentations over their continued shortcomings.
   And not only this, but the nature of the conflict between good and evil
   in the heart of the renewed is fully described, the contending
   principles are distinguished and designated, and the necessity,
   difficulties, and perils of the struggle, well as the method of
   properly sustaining it, are set forth repeatedly and in detail. In the
   seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans we have an account of this
   conflict elaborately described by the Apostle as drawn from his own
   experience. And the same thing occurs in Galatians v. 16, 17. This I
   say then, "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the
   flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
   the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye
   cannot do the things that ye would." Again, in Ephesians vi. 10-18, in
   view of the conflict which the believer has to sustain with the evils
   of his own heart and with the powers of darkness, the Apostle exhorts
   his brethren to be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his
   might. . . . . "Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that
   ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to
   stand."

   With the teachings of the Scriptures the experience of Christians in
   all ages and in all parts of the Church agrees. Their writings are
   filled with the account of their struggles with the remains of sin in
   their own hearts; with confessions; with prayers for divine aid; and
   with longings after the final victory over all evil, which is to be
   experienced only in heaven. The great lights of the Latin Church, the
   Augustines and Bernards and Fénélons, were humble, penitent, struggling
   believers, even to the last, and with Paul did not regard themselves as
   having already attained, or as being already perfect. And what the
   Bible and Christian experience prove to be true, history puts beyond
   dispute. Either there is no such thing as regeneration in the world, or
   regeneration does not remove all sin from those who are its subjects.

   Putting off the Old, and putting on the New Man.

   Such being the foundation of the Scriptural representations concerning
   sanctification, its nature is thereby determined. As all men since the
   fall are in a state of sin, not only sinners because guilty of specific
   acts of transgression, but also as depraved, their nature perverted and
   corrupted, regeneration is the infusion of a new principle of life in
   this corrupt nature. It is leaven introduced to diffuse its influence
   gradually through the whole mass. Sanctification, therefore, consists
   in two things: first, the removing more and more the principles of evil
   still infecting our nature, and destroying their power; and secondly,
   the growth of the principle of spiritual life until it controls the
   thoughts, feelings, and acts, and brings the soul into conformity to
   the image of Christ.

   Paul details his own Experience in Romans vii. 7-25.

   The classical passages of the New Testament on the nature of this work
   are the following, -- Romans vii. 7-25. This is not the place to enter
   upon the discussion whether the Apostle in this passage is detailing
   his own experience or not. This is the interpretation given to it by
   Augustinians in all ages. It is enough to say here that the "onus
   probandi" rests on those who take the opposite view of the passage. It
   must require very strong proof that the Apostle is not speaking of
   himself and giving his own experience as a Christian, when, --

   1. His object in the whole discussion throughout the sixth and seventh
   chapters, is to prove that the law, as it cannot justify, neither can
   it sanctify; as it cannot deliver from the guilt, so neither can it
   free us from the power of sin. This is not the fault of the law, for it
   is spiritual, holy, just, and good. It commends itself to the reason
   and the conscience as being just what it ought to be; requiring neither
   more nor less than what it is right should be demanded, and threatening
   no penalty which want of conformity to its requirements does not justly
   merit. What is the effect of the objective presentation of the ideal
   standard of moral perfection to which we are bound to be conformed on
   the penalty of death? The Apostle tells us that the effects are, (a.) A
   great increase of knowledge. He had not known lust, had not the law
   said, Thou shalt not covet. (b.) A sense of moral pollution, and
   consequently of shame and self-loathing. (c.) A sense of guilt, or of
   just exposure to the penalty of the law of which our whole lives are a
   continued transgression. (d.) A sense of utter helplessness. The
   standard, although holy, just, and good, is too high. We know we never
   can of ourselves conform to it; neither can we make satisfaction for
   past transgression. (e.) The result of the whole is despair. The law
   kills. It destroys not only all self-complacency, but all hope of ever
   being able to effect our own salvation. (f.) And thus it lead. the
   sinner to look out of himself for salvation; i.e., for deliverance from
   the power, as well as the guilt of sin. The law is a schoolmaster to
   lead us to Christ. Why could not the Apostle say all this of himself?
   There is nothing here inconsistent with the character or experience of
   a true believer. It is as true of the Christian that he is not
   sanctified by moral suasion, by the objective presentation of truth, as
   it is of the unrenewed sinner, that he is not regenerated by any such
   outward influences. It is, therefore, perfectly pertinent to the
   Apostle's object that he should detail his own experience that
   sanctification could not be effected by the law.

   2. But in the second place, he uses the first person singular
   throughout. He says, "I had not known sin," "I died," "The commandment
   which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death," "I consent unto
   the law that it is good," "I delight in the law of God after the inward
   man, but I see another law in my members," etc., etc. We are bound to
   understand the Apostle to speak of himself in the use of such language,
   unless there be something in the context, or m the nature of what is
   said, to render the reference to him impossible. It has been shown,
   however, that the context favours, if it does not absolutely demand the
   reference of what is said to the Apostle himself. And that there is
   nothing in the experience here detailed inconsistent with the
   experience of the true children of God, is evident from the fact that
   the same humility, the same sense of guilt, the same consciousness of
   indwelling sin, the same conviction of helplessness, here expressed,
   are found in all the penitential portions of Scripture. Job, David,
   Isaiah, and Nehemiah, make the same confessions and lamentations that
   the Apostle here makes. The same is true of believers since the coming
   of Christ. There is no one of them, not even the holiest, who is not
   constrained to speak of himself as Paul here speaks, unless indeed he
   chooses to give the language of the Apostle a meaning which it was
   never intended to express.

   3. While the passage contains nothing inconsistent with the experience
   of true believers, it is inconsistent with the experience of unrenewed
   men. They are not the subjects of the inward conflict here depicted.
   There is in them indeed often a struggle protracted and painful,
   between reason and conscience on the one side, and evil passion on the
   other. But there is not in the unrenewed that utter renunciation of
   self, that looking for help to God in Christ alone, and that delight in
   the law of God, of which the Apostle here speaks.

   What Romans vii. 7-25 teaches.

   Assuming, then, that we have in this chapter an account of the
   experience of a true and even of an advanced Christian, we learn that
   in every Christian there is a mixture of good and evil; that the
   original corruption of nature is not entirely removed by regeneration;
   that although the believer is made a new creature, is translated from
   the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son, he is but
   partially sanctified; that his selfishness pride, discontent,
   worldliness, still cleave to, and torment him, that they effectually
   prevent his "doing what he would," they prevent his living without sin,
   they prevent his intercourse with God being as intimate and
   uninterrupted as he could and does desire. He finds not only that he is
   often, even daily, overcome so as to sin in thought, word, and deed,
   but also that his faith, love, zeal, and devotion are never such as to
   satisfy his own conscience; much less can they satisfy God. He
   therefore is daily called upon to confess, repent, and pray for
   forgiveness. The Apostle designates these conflicting principles which
   he found within himself, the one, indwelling sin; "sin that dwelleth in
   me;" or the "law in my members;" "the law of sin;" the other, "the
   mind," "the law of my mind," "the inward man." His internal self, the
   Ego, was sometimes controlled by the one, and sometimes by the other.

   We learn, further, that the control of the evil principle is resisted,
   that subjection to it is regarded as a hateful bondage, that the good
   principle is in the main victorious, and that through Christ it will
   ultimately be completely triumphant. Sanctification therefore,
   according to this representation, consists in the gradual triumph of
   the new nature implanted in regeneration over the evil that still
   remains after the heart is renewed. In other words, as elsewhere
   expressed, it is a dying unto sin and living unto righteousness. (1
   Pet. ii. 24.)

   Galatians v. 16-26.

   Another passage of like import is Galatians v. 16-26, "Walk in the
   Spirit, and ye shall not full the lust of the flesh. For the flesh
   lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these
   are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that
   ye would," etc., etc. The Scriptures teach that the Spirit of God
   dwells in his people, not only collectively as the Church, but
   individually in every believer, so that of every Christian it may be
   said, he is a temple of the Holy Ghost. God is said to dwell wherever
   He permanently manifests his presence, whether as of old in the temple,
   or in the hearts of his people, in the Church, or in heaven. And as the
   Spirit dwells in believers, He there manifests his life-giving,
   controlling power, and is in them the principle, or source, or
   controlling influence which determines their inward and outward life.
   By the flesh, in the doctrinal portions of Scripture, is never, unless
   the word be limited by the context, meant merely our sensuous nature,
   but our fallen nature, i.e., our nature as it is in itself, apart from
   the Spirit of God. As our Lord says (John iii. 6), "That which is born
   of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
   These then are the principles which "are contrary the one to the
   other." No man can act independently of both. He must obey one or the
   other. He may sometimes obey the one, and sometimes the other; but one
   or the other must prevail. The Apostle says of believers that they have
   crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts. They have renounced
   the authority of the evil principle; they do not willingly, or of set
   purpose, or habitually yield to it. They struggle against it, and not
   only endeavour, but actually do crucify it, although it may die a long
   and painful death.

   Ephesians iv. 22-24.

   In Ephesians iv. 22-24, we are told: "Put off concerning the former
   conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful
   lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and" put ye "on the
   new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true
   holiness." By the old man is to be understood the former self with all
   the evils belonging to its natural state. This was to be laid aside as
   a worn and soiled garment, and a new, pure self, the new man, was to
   take its place. This change, although expressed in a figure borrowed
   from a change of raiment, was a profound inward change produced by a
   creating process, by which the soul is new fashioned after the image of
   God in righteousness and holiness. It is a renewing as to the Spirit,
   i.e., the interior life of the mind; or as Meyer and Ellicott, the best
   of modern commentators, both interpret the phrase, "By the Spirit" (the
   Holy Spirit) dwelling in the mind. This is a transformation in which
   believers are exhorted to cooperate; for which they are to labour, and
   which is therefore a protracted work. Sanctification, therefore,
   according to this representation, consists in the removal of the evils
   which belong to us in our natural condition, and in being made more and
   more conformed to the image of God through the gracious influence of
   the Spirit of God dwelling in us.

   It is not, however, merely in such passages as those above cited that
   the nature of sanctification is set forth. The Bible is full of
   exhortations and commands addressed to the people of God, to those
   recognized and assumed to be regenerate, requiring them, on the one
   hand, to resist their evil passions and propensities, to lay aside all
   malice, and wrath, and pride, and jealousy; and on the other, to
   cultivate all the graces of the Spirit, faith, love, hope,
   long-suffering, meekness, lowliness of mind, and brotherly kindness. At
   the same time they are reminded that it is God who worketh in them both
   to will and to do, and that therefore they are constantly to seek his
   aid and to depend upon his assistance.

   It follows from this view of the subject that sanctification is not
   only, as before proved, a supernatural work, but also that it does not
   consist exclusively in a series of a new kind of acts. It is the making
   the tree good, in order that the fruit may be good. It involves an
   essential change of character. As regeneration is not an act of the
   subject of the work, but in the language of the Bible a new birth, a
   new creation, a quickening or communicating a new life, and in the
   language of the old Latin Church, the infusion of new habits of grace;
   so sanctification in its essential nature is not holy acts, but such a
   change in the state of the soul, that sinful acts become more
   infrequent, and holy acts more and more habitual and controlling. This
   view alone is consistent with the Scriptural representations, and with
   the account given in the Bible of the way in which this radical change
   of character is carried on and consummated.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. The Method of Sanctification.

   It has already been shown that although sanctification does not exclude
   all cooperation on the part of its subjects, but, on the contrary,
   calls for their unremitting and strenuous exertion, it is nevertheless
   the work of God. It is not carried on as a mere process of moral
   culture by moral means; it is as truly supernatural in its method as in
   its nature. What the Bible teaches in answer to the question, How a
   soul by nature spiritually dead, being quickened by the mighty power of
   God, is gradually transformed into the image of Christ, is
   substantially as follows, --

   The Soul is led to exercise Faith.

   1. It is led to exercise faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, to receive Him
   as its Saviour, committing itself to Him to be by his merit and grace
   delivered from the guilt and power of sin. This is the first step, and
   secures all the rest, not because of its inherent virtue or efficacy,
   but because, according to the covenant of grace, or plan of salvation,
   which God has revealed and which He has pledged Himself to carry out,
   He becomes bound by his promise to accomplish the full salvation from
   sin of every one who believes.

   The Effect of Union with Christ.

   2. The soul by this act of faith becomes united to Christ. We are in
   Him by faith. The consequences of this union are, (a.) Participation in
   his merits. His perfect righteousness, agreeably to the stipulations of
   the covenant of redemption, is imputed to the believer. He is thereby
   justified. He is introduced into a state of favour or grace, and
   rejoices in hope of the glory of God. (Rom. v. 1-3.) This is, as the
   Bible teaches, the essential preliminary condition of sanctification.
   While under the law we are under the curse. While under the curse we
   are the enemies of God and bring forth fruit unto death. It is only
   when delivered from the law by the body or death of Christ, and united
   to Him, that we bring forth fruit unto God. (Rom. vi. 8; vii. 4-6.)
   Sin, therefore, says the Apostle, shall not reign over us, because we
   are not under the law. (Rom. vi. 14.) Deliverance from the law is the
   necessary condition of deliverance from sin. All the relations of the
   believer are thus changed. He is translated from the kingdom of
   darkness and introduced into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.
   Instead of an outcast, a slave under condemnation, he becomes a child
   of God, assured of his love, of his tenderness, and of his care. He may
   come to Him with confidence. He is brought under all the influences
   which in their full effect constitute heaven. He therefore becomes a
   new creature. He has passed from death to life; from darkness to light,
   from hell (the kingdom of Satan) to heaven. He sits with Christ in
   heavenly places. (Eph. ii. 6.) (b.) Another consequence of the union
   with Christ effected by faith, is the indwelling of the Spirit. Christ
   has redeemed us from the curse of the law by being made a curse for us,
   in order that we might receive the promise of the Holy Ghost. (Gal.
   iii. 13, 14.) It was not consistent with the perfections or purposes of
   God that the Spirit should be given to dwell with his saving influences
   in the apostate children of men, until Christ had made a full
   satisfaction for the sins of the world. But as with God there are no
   distinctions of time, Christ was slain from the foundation of the
   world, and his death availed as fully for the salvation of those who
   lived before, as for that of those who have lived since his coming in
   the flesh. (Rom. iii. 25, 26; Heb. ix. 15.) The Spirit was given to the
   people of God from the beginning. But as our Lord says (John x. 10)
   that He came into the world not only that men might have life, but that
   they might have it more abundantly, the effusion, or copious
   communication of the Spirit is always represented as the great
   characteristic of the Messiah's advent. (Joel ii 28, 29; Acts ii.
   16-21; John vii. 38, 39.) Our Lord, therefore, in his last discourse to
   his disciples, said it was expedient for them that He went away, for
   "if I go not away, the Comforter (the Parakletos, the helper) will not
   come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you." (John xvi.
   7.) He was to supply the place of Christ as to his visible presence,
   carry on his work, gather in his people, transform them into the
   likeness of Christ, and communicate to them all the benefits of his
   redemption. Where the Spirit is, there Christ is; so that, the Spirit
   being with us, Christ is with us; and if the Spirit dwells in us,
   Christ dwells in us. (Rom. viii. 9-11.) In partaking, therefore, of the
   Holy Ghost, believers are partakers of the life of Christ. The Spirit
   was given to Him without measure, and from him flows down to all his
   members. This participation of the believer in the life of Christ, so
   that every believer may say with the Apostle, "I live; yet not I, but
   Christ liveth in me" (Gal. ii. 20), is prominently presented in the
   Word of God. (Rom. vi. 5; vii. 4; John xiv. 19; Col. iii. 3, 4.) The
   two great standing illustrations of this truth are the vine and the
   human body. The former is presented at length in John xv. 1-8, the
   latter in 1 Corinthians xii. 11-27; Romans xii. 5; Ephesians i. 22, 23;
   iv. 15, 16; v. 30; Colossians i. 18; ii. 19; and frequently elsewhere.
   As the life of the vine is diffused through all the branches,
   sustaining and rendering them fruitful; and as the life of the head is
   diffused through all the members of the body making it one, and
   imparting life to all, so the life of Christ is diffused through all
   the members of his mystical body making them one body in Him; having a
   common life with their common head. This idea is urged specially in
   Ephesians iv. 15, 16, where it is said that it is from Christ that the
   whole body fitly joined together, through the spiritual influence
   granted to every part according to its measure, makes increase in love.
   It is true that this is spoken of the Church as a whole. But what is
   said of Christ's mystical body as a whole is true of all its members
   severally. He is the prophet, priest, and king of the Church; but He is
   also the prophet, priest, and king of every believer. Our relation to
   Him is individual and personal. The Church as a whole is the temple of
   God; but so is every believer. (1 Cor. iii. 16; vi. 19.) The Church is
   the bride of Christ, but every believer is the object of that tender,
   peculiar love expressed in the use of that metaphor. The last verse of
   Paul Gerhardt's hymn, "Ein Lämmlein geht und trägt die Schuld," every
   true Christian may adopt as the expression of his own hopes: --


   "Wann endlich ich soll treten ein

   In deines Reiches Freuden,

   So soll diess Blut mein Purpur seyn,

   Ich will mich darein kielden;

   Es soll seyn meines Hauptes Kron'

   In welcher ich will vor den Thron

   Des höchsten Vaters gehen,

   Und dir, dem er mich anvertraut,

   Als eine wohlgeschmückte Braut,

   An deiner Seiten stehen."

   The Inward Work of the Spirit.

   3. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit thus secured by union with Christ
   becomes the source of a new spiritual life, which constantly increases
   in power until everything uncongenial with it is expelled, and the soul
   is perfectly transformed into the image of Christ. It is the office of
   the Spirit to enlighten the mind; or, as Paul expresses it, "to
   enlighten the eyes of the understanding" (Eph. i. 18), that we may know
   the things freely given to us of God (1 Cor. ii. 12); i.e., the things
   which God has revealed; or, as they are called in v. 14, "The things of
   the Spirit of God." These things, which the natural man cannot know,
   the Spirit enables the believer "to discern," i.e., to apprehend in
   their truth and excellence; and thus to experience their power. The
   Spirit, we are taught, especially opens the eyes to see the glory of
   Christ, to see that He is God manifest in the flesh; to discern not
   only his divine perfections, but his love to us, and his suitableness
   in all respects as our Saviour, so that those who have not seen Him,
   yet believing on Him, rejoice in Him with joy unspeakable and full of
   glory. This apprehension of Christ is transforming; the soul is thereby
   changed into his image, from glory to glory by the Spirit of the Lord.
   It was this inward revelation of Christ by which Paul on his way to
   Damascus was instantly converted from a blasphemer into a worshipper
   and self-sacrificing servant of the Lord Jesus.

   It is not, however, only one object which the opened eye of the
   believer is able to discern. The Spirit enables him to see the glory of
   God as revealed in his works and in his word; the holiness and
   spirituality of the law; the exceeding sinfulness of sin; his own
   guilt, pollution, and helplessness; the length and breadth, the height
   and depth of the economy of redemption; and the reality glory, and
   infinite importance of the things unseen and eternal. The soul is thus
   raised above the world. It lives in a higher sphere. It becomes more
   and more heavenly in its character and desires. All the great doctrines
   of the Bible concerning God, Christ, and things spiritual and eternal,
   are so revealed by this inward teaching of the Spirit, as to be not
   only rightly discerned, but to exert, in a measure, their proper
   influence on the heart and life. Thus the prayer of Christ (John xvii.
   17), "Sanctify them through thy truth," is answered in the experience
   of his people.

   God calls the Graces of his People into Exercise.

   4. The work of sanctification is carried on by God's giving constant
   occasion for the exercise of all the graces of the Spirit. Submission,
   confidence, self-denial, patience, and meekness, as well as faith,
   hope, and love, are called forth, or put to the test, more or less
   effectually every day the believer passes on earth. And by this
   constant exercise he grows in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord
   and Saviour Jesus Christ. It is, however, principally by calling his
   people to labour and snffer for the advancement of the Redeemer's
   kingdom, and for the good of their fellow-men, that this salutary
   discipline is carried on. The best Christians are in general those who
   not merely from restless activity of natural disposition, but from love
   to Christ and zeal for his glory, labour most and suffer most in his
   service.

   The Church and Sacraments as means of Grace.

   5. One great end of the establishment of the Church on earth, as the
   communion of saints, is the edification of the people of God. The
   intellectual and social life of man is not developed in isolation and
   solitude. It is only in contact and collision with his fellow-men that
   his powers are called into exercise and his social virtues are
   cultivated. Thus also it is by the Church-life of believers, by their
   communion in the worship and service of God, and by their mutual good
   offices and fellowship, that the spiritual life of the soul is
   developed. Therefore the Apostle says, "Let us consider one another, to
   provoke unto love and to good works: not forsaking the assembling of
   ourselves together. as the manner of some is; but exhorting one
   another; and so much the more as ye see the day approaching." (Heb. x.
   24, 25.)

   6. The Spirit renders the ordinances of God, the word, sacraments, and
   prayer, effectual means of promoting the sanctification of his people,
   and of securing their ultimate salvation. These, however, must be more
   fully considered in the sequel.

   The Kingly Office of Christ.

   7. In this connection, we are not to overlook or undervalue the
   constant exercise of the kingly office of Christ. He not only reigns
   over his people, but He subdues them to Himself, rules and defends
   them, and restrains and conquers all his and their enemies. These
   enemies are both inward and outward, both seen and unseen; they are the
   world, the flesh, and the devil. The strength of the believer in
   contending with these enemies, is not his own. He, is strong only in
   the Lord, and in the power of his might. (Eph. vi. 10.) The weapons,
   both offensive and defensive, are supplied by Him, and the disposition
   and the skill to use them are his gifts to be sought by praying without
   ceasing. He is an ever present helper. Whenever the Christian feels his
   weakness either in resisting temptation or in the discharge of duty, he
   looks to Christ, and seeks aid from Him. And all who seek find. When we
   fail, it is either from self-confidence, or from neglecting to call
   upon our ever present and almighty King, who is always ready to protect
   and deliver those who put their trust in Him. But there are dangers
   which we do not apprehend, enemies whom we do not see, and to which we
   would become an easy prey, were it not for the watchful care of Him who
   came into the world to destroy the works of the devil, and to bruise
   Satan under our feet. The Christian runs his race "looking unto Jesus;"
   the life he lives, he lives by faith in the Son of God; it is by the
   constant worship of Christ; by the constant exercise of love toward
   Him; by constant endeavours to do his will; and by constantly looking
   to Him for the supply of grace and for protection and aid, that he
   overcomes sin and finally attains the prize of the high-calling of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. The Fruits of Sanctification, or Good Works.

   Their Nature.

   The fruits of sanctification are good works. Our Lord says "A good tree
   bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring
   forth good fruit, For every tree is known by his own fruit: for of
   thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they
   grapes." (Luke vi. 43, 44.) By good works, in this connection, are
   meant not only the inward exercises of the religious life, but also
   outward acts, such as can be seen and appreciated by others.

   There are three senses in which works may be called good, --

   1. When as to the matter of them they are what the law prescribes. In
   this sense even the heathen perform good works; as the Apostle says,
   Romans ii. 14, "The Gentiles . . . do by nature the things contained in
   the law." That is, they perform acts of justice and mercy. No man on
   earth is so wicked as never, in this sense of the term, to be the
   author of some good works. This is what the theologians call civil
   goodness, whose sphere is the social relations of men.

   2. In the second place, by good works are meant works which both in the
   matter of them, and in the design and motives of the agent, are what
   the law requires. In other words, a work is good, when there is nothing
   either in the agent or in the act which the law condemns. In this sense
   not even the works of the holiest of God's people are good. No man is
   ever, since the fall, in this life, in such an inward state that he can
   stand before God and be accepted on the ground of what he is or of what
   he does. All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags. (Is. lxiv. 6.)
   Paul found to the last a law of sin in his members. He groaned under a
   body of death. In one of his latest epistles he says he had not
   attained, or was not already perfect, and all Christians are required
   to pray daily for the forgiveness of sin. What the Scriptures teach of
   the imperfection of the best works of the believer, is confirmed by the
   irrepressible testimony of consciousness. It matters not what the lips
   may say, every man's conscience telis him that he is always a sinner,
   that he never is free from moral defilement in the sight of an
   infinitely holy God. On this subject the Form of Concord [227] says,
   "Lex Dei credentibus bona opera ad eum modum præscribit, ut simul,
   tanquam in speculo, nobis commonstret, ea omnia in nobis in hac vita
   adhuc imperfecta et impura esse;" and [228] "Credentes in hac vita non
   perfecte, completive vel consummative (ut veteres locuti sunt)
   renovantur. Et quamvis ipsorum peccata Christi obedientia absolutissima
   contecta sint, ut credentibus non ad damnationem imputentur, et per
   Spiritum Sanctum veteris Adami mortificatio et renovatio in spiritu
   mentis eorum inchoata sit: tamen vetus Adam in ipsa natura, omnibusque
   illius interioribus et exterioribus viribus adhuc semper inhæret."
   Calvin [229] says, "Seligat ex tota sua vita sanctus Dei servus, quod
   in ejus cursu maxime eximium se putabit edidisse, bene revolvat
   singulas partes: deprehendet procul dubio alicubi quod carnis
   putredinem sapiat, quando numquam ea est nostra alacritas ad bene
   agendum quæ esse debet, sed in cursu retardando multa debilitas.
   Quanquam non obscuras esse maculas videmus, quibus respersa sint opera
   sanctorum, fac tamen minutissimos esse nævos duntaxat: sed an oculos
   Dei nihil offendent, coram quibus ne stellæ quidem puræ sunt? Habemus,
   nec unum a sanctis exire opus, quod, si in se censeatur, non mereatur
   justam opprobrii mercedem."

   Romish Doctrine on Good Works.

   Against the doctrine that the best works of the believer are imperfect,
   the Romanists are especially denunciatory. And with good reason. It
   subverts their whole system, which is founded on the assumed merit of
   good works. If the best works of the saints merit "justam opprobrii
   mercedem" (i.e., condemnation), they cannot merit reward. Their
   argument on this subject is, that if the Protestant doctrine be true
   which declares the best works of the believer to be imperfect; then the
   fulfilment of the law is impossible; but if this be so, then the law is
   not binding; for God does not command impossibilities. To this it may
   be answered, first, that the objection is inconsistent with the
   doctrine of Romanists themselves. They teach that man in his natural
   state since the fall is unable to do anything good in the sight of God,
   until he receives the grace of God communicated in baptism. According
   to the principle on which the objection is founded, the law does not
   bind the unbaptized. And secondly, the objection assumes the
   fundamental principle of Pelagianism, namely that ability limits
   obligation; a principle which, in the sphere of morals, is contrary to
   Scripture, consciousness, and the common judgment of mankind. We cannot
   be required to do what is impossible because of the limitation of our
   nature as creatures, as to create a world, or raise the dead; but to
   love God perfectly does not exceed the power of man as he came from the
   hands of his maker. It is not absolutely, but only relatively
   impossible, that is, in relation of the thing commanded, to us not as
   men, but as sinners. Although it is essential to the Romish doctrine of
   merit, of indulgences, of works of supererogation, and of purgatory,
   that the renewed should be able perfectly to fulfil the demands of the
   law, nevertheless, Romanists themselves are compelled to admit the
   contrary. Thus Bellarmin says, [230] "Defectus charitatis, quod
   videlicet non faciamus opera nostra tanto fervore dilectionis, quanto
   faciemus in patria, defectus quidem est, sed culpa et peccatum non
   est. . . . . Unde etiam charitas nostra, quamvis comparata ad
   charitatem beatorum sit imperfecta, tamen absolute perfecta dici
   potest." That is, although our love is in fact imperfect, it may be
   called perfect. But calling it perfect, does not alter its nature. To
   the same effect another of the leading theologians of the Roman Church,
   Andradius, says, "Peccata venalia per se tam esse minuta et levia, ut
   non adversentur perfectioni caritatis, nec impedire possint perfectam
   et absolutam legis obedientiam: utpote quæ non sint ira Dei et
   condemnatione, sed venia digna, etiamsi Deus cum illis in judicium
   intret." [231] That is, sins are not sins, because men choose to regard
   them as trivial.

   Works of Supererogation.

   But if no work of man since the fall in this life is perfectly good,
   then it not only follows that the doctrine of merit must be given up,
   but still more obviously, all works of supererogation are impossible.
   Romanists teach that the renewed may not only completely satisfy all
   the demands of the law of God, which requires that we should love Him
   with all the heart, and all the mind, and all the strength, and our
   neighbour as ourselves; but that they can do more than the law demands,
   and thus acquire more merit than they need for their own salvation,
   which may be made available for those who lack.

   It is impossible that any man can hold such a doctrine, unless he first
   degrades the law of God by restricting its demands to very narrow
   limits. The Romanists represent our relation to God as analogous to a
   citizen's relation to the state. Civil laws are limited to a narrow
   sphere. They concern only our social and political obligations. It is
   easy for a man to be a good citizen; to fulfil perfectly all that the
   law of the land requires. Such a man, through love to his country, may
   do far more than the law can demand. He may not only pay tribute to
   whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, and honour to whom honour;
   but he may also devote his time, his talents, his whole fortune to the
   service of his country. Thus also, according to Romanists, men may not
   only do all that the law of God requires of men as men, but they may
   also through love, far exceed its demands. This Möhler represents as a
   great superiority of Romish ethics over the Protestant system. The
   latter, according to him, limits man's obligations to his legal
   liabilities, to what in justice may be exacted from him on pain of
   punishment. Whereas the former rises to the higher sphere of love, and
   represents the believer cordially and freely rendering unto God what in
   strict justice could not be demanded of him. "It is the nature of love,
   which stands far, even immeasurably higher than the demands of the law,
   never to be satisfied with its manifestation, and to become more and
   more sensitive, so that believers, who are animated with this love,
   often appear to men who stand on a lower level as fanatics or
   lunatics." [232] But what if the law itself is love? What if the law
   demands all that love can render? What if the love which the law
   requires of every rational creature calls for the devotion of the whole
   soul, with all its powers to God as a living sacrifice? It is only by
   making sin to be no sin; by teaching men that they are perfect when
   even their own hearts condemn them; it is only by lowering the demands
   of the law which, being founded on the nature of God, of necessity
   requires perfect conformity to the divine image, that any man in this
   life can pretend to be perfect, or be so insane as to imagine that he
   can go beyond the demands of the law and perform works of
   supererogation.

   Precepts and Counsels.

   The distinction which Romanists make between precepts and counsels,
   rests upon the same low view of the divine law. By precepts are meant
   the specific commands of the law which bind all men, the observance of
   which secures a reward, and non-observance a penalty. Whereas counsels
   are not commands; they do not bind the conscience of any man, but are
   recommendations of things peculiarly acceptable to God, compliance with
   which merits a much higher reward than the mere observance of precepts.
   There are many such counsels in the Bible, the most important of which
   are said to be celibacy, monastic obedience, and poverty. [233] No man
   is bound to remain unmarried, but if he voluntarily determines to do so
   for the glory of God, that is a great virtue. No one is bound to
   renounce the acquisition of property, but if he voluntarily embraces a
   life of absolute poverty, it is a great merit. Our Lord, however,
   demands everything. He saith, "He that loveth father or mother more
   than me, is not worthy of me, and he that loveth son or daughter more
   than me, is not worthy of me." "He that findeth his life, shall lose
   it: and he that loseth his life for my sake, shall find it." (Matt. x.
   31, 39.) "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,
   and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own
   life also, he cannot be my disciple." (Luke xiv. 26.) The law of Christ
   demands entire devotion to Him. If his service requires that a man
   should remain unmarried, he is bound to live a life of celibacy; if it
   requires that he should give up all his property and take up his cross,
   and follow Christ, he is bound to do so; if it requires him to lay down
   his life for Christ's sake, he is bound to lay it down. Greater love
   hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.
   Nothing can go beyond this. There can be no sacrifice and no service
   which a man can make or render, which duty, or the law of Christ, does
   not demand when such sacrifice or service becomes necessary as the
   proof or fruit of love to Christ. There is no room, therefore, for this
   distinction between counsels and precepts, between what the law demands
   and what love is willing to render. And therefore the doctrine of works
   of supererogation is thoroughly anti-Christian.

   They Sense in which the Fruits of the Spirit in Believers are called
   Good.

   3. Although no work even of the true people of God, while they continue
   in this world, is absolutely perfect, nevertheless those inward
   exercises and outward acts which are the fruits of the Spirit are
   properly designated good, and are so called in Scripture. Acts ix. 36,
   it was said of Dorcas that she "was full of good works." Ephesians ii.
   10, believers are said to be "created in Christ Jesus unto good works."
   2 Timothy iii. 17, teaches that the man of God should be "thoroughly
   furnished unto all good works." Titus ii. 14, Christ gave Himself for
   us that He might "purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of
   good works." There is no contradiction in pronouncing the same work
   good and bad, because these terms are relative, and the relations
   intended may be different. Feeding the poor, viewed in relation to the
   nature of the act is a good work. Viewed in relation to the motive
   which prompts it, it may be good or bad. If done to be seen of men, it
   is offensive in the sight of God. If done from natural benevolence, it
   is an act of ordinary morality. If done to a disciple in the name of a
   disciple, it is an act of Christian virtue. The works of the children
   of God, therefore, although stained by sin, are truly and properly
   good, because, (1.) They are, as to their nature or the thing done,
   commanded by God. (2.) Because, as to the motive, they are the fruits,
   not merely of right moral feeling, but of religious feeling, i.e., of
   love to God; and (3.) Because they are performed with the purpose of
   complying with his will, of honouring Christ and of promoting the
   interests of his kingdom.

   It follows from the fundamental principle of Protestantism, that the
   Scriptures are the only rule of faith and practice, that no work can be
   regarded as good or obligatory on the conscience which the Scriptures
   do not enjoin. Of course it is not meant that the Bible commands in
   detail everything which the people of God are bound to do, but it
   prescribes the principles by which their conduct is to be regulated,
   and specifies the kind of acts which those principles require or
   forbid. It is enough that the Scriptures require children to obey their
   parents, citizens the magistrate, and believers to hear the Church,
   without enjoining every act which these injunctions render obligatory.
   In giving these general commands, the Bible gives all necessary
   limitations, so that neither parents, magistrates, nor Church can claim
   any authority not granted to them by God, nor impose anything on the
   conscience which He does not command. As some churches have enjoined a
   multitude of doctrines as articles of faith, which are not taught in
   Scripture, so they have enjoined a multitude of acts, which the Bible
   neither directly, nor by just or necessary inference requires. They
   have thus imposed upon those who recognize their authority as
   infallible in teaching, a yoke of bondage which no one is able to bear.
   After the example of the ancient Pharisees, they teach for doctrines
   the commandments of men, and claim divine authority for human
   institutions. From this bondage it was one great design of the
   Reformation to free the people of God. This deliverance was effected by
   proclaiming the principle that nothing is sin but what the Bible
   forbids and nothing is morally obligatory but what the Bible enjoins.

   Such, however, is the disposition, on the one hand, to usurp authority,
   and, on the other, to yield to it, that it is only by the constant
   assertion and vindication of this principle, that the liberty wherewith
   Christ has made us free can be preserved.

   § 5. Necessity of Good Works.

   On this subject there has never been any real difference of opinion
   among Protestants, although there was in the early Lutheran Church some
   misunderstanding. First. It was universally admitted that good works
   are not necessary to our justification; that they are consequences and
   indirectly the fruits of justification, and, therefore, cannot be its
   ground. Secondly, it was also agreed that faith, by which the sinner is
   justified, is not as a work, the reason why God pronounces the sinner
   just. It is the act by which the sinner receives and rests upon the
   righteousness of Christ, the imputation of which renders him righteous
   in the sight of God. Thirdly, faith does not justify because it
   includes, or is the root or principle of good works; not as "fides
   obsequiosa." Fourthly, it was agreed that it is only a living faith,
   i.e., a faith which works by love and purifies the heart, that unites
   the soul to Christ and secures our reconciliation with God. Fifthly, it
   was universally admitted that an immoral life is inconsistent with a
   state of grace; that those who wilfully continue in the practice of sin
   shall not inherit the kingdom of God. The Protestants while rejecting
   the Romish doctrine of subjectve justification, strenuously insisted
   that no man is delivered from the guilt of sin who is not delivered
   from its reiguing power; that sanctification is inseparable from
   justification, and that the one is just as essential as the other.

   The controversy on this subject was due mainly to a misunderstanding,
   but in a measure also to a real difference of opinion as to the office
   of the law under the Gospel. Melancthon taught that repentance was the
   effect of the law and anterior to faith, and used forms of expression
   which were thought to imply that good works, or sanctification,
   although not the ground of justification, were nevertheless a "causa
   sine qua non" of our acceptance with God. To this Luther objected, as
   true sanctification is the consequence, and in no sense the condition
   of the sinner's justification. We are not justified because we are
   holy; but being justified, we are rendered holy. Agricola (born in
   Eisleben, 1492, died 1566), a pupil of Luther, and greatly influential
   as a preacher, took extreme ground against Melancthon. He not only held
   that repentance was not due to the operation of the law, and was the
   fruit of faith, but also that the law should not be taught under the
   Gospel, and that good works are not necessary to salvation. The
   believer is entirely free from the law, is not under the law but under
   grace; and being accepted for what Christ did, it is of little
   consequence what he does. Luther denounced this perversion of the
   Gospel, which overlooked entirely the distinction between the law as a
   covenant of works demanding perfect obedience as the condition of
   justification, and the law as the revelation of the immutable will of
   God as to what rational creatures should be and do in character and
   conduct. He insisted that faith was the receiving of Christ, not only
   for the pardon of sin, but also as a saviour from its power; that its
   object was not merely the death, but also the obedience of Christ.
   [234]

   The controversy was renewed not long after in another form, in
   consequence of the position taken by George Major, also a pupil of
   Luther and Melancthon, and for some years professor of theology and
   preacher at Wittenberg. He was accused of objecting to the proposition
   "we are saved by faith alone" and of teaching that good works were also
   necessary to salvation. This was understood as tantamount to saying
   that good works are necessary to justification. Major, indeed, denied
   the justice of this charge. He said he did not teach that good works
   were necessary as being meritorious, but simply as the necessary fruits
   of faith and part of our obedience to Christ; nevertheless, he
   maintained that no one could be saved without good works. How then can
   infants be saved? And how can this unconditional necessity of good
   works be consistent with Paul's doctrine that we are justified by faith
   without works? Whom God justifies He glorifies. Justification secures
   salvation; and, therefore, if faith alone, or faith without works,
   secures justification, it secures salvation. It is very evident that
   this was a dispute about words. Major admitted that the sinner was in a
   state of salvation the moment he believed, but held that if his faith
   did not produce good works it was not a saving faith. In his sermon "On
   the Conversion of Paul," he said: "As thou art now justified by faith
   alone, and hast become a child of God, and since Christ and the Holy
   Ghost through that faith dwell in thy heart, so are good works
   necessary, not to obtain salvation (which thou already hast as a matter
   of grace, without works, through faith alone on the Lord Jesus Christ),
   but to hold fast your salvation, that it be not lost, and also because
   if thou dost not produce good works, it is an evidence that thy faith
   is false and dead, a mere pretence or opinion." Amsdorf, the chief
   representative of the extremists in this controversy, laid down his
   doctrine in the following propositions: (1.) Etsi hæc oratio: bona
   opera sunt necessaria ad salutem in doctrina legis abstractive et de
   idea tolerari potest, tamen multæ sunt graves causæ, propter quas
   vitanda, et fugienda est non minus, quam hæc oratio: Christus est
   creatura. (2.) In foro justificationis hæc propositio nullo modo
   ferenda est. (3.) In foro novæ obedientiæ post reconciliationem
   nequaquam bona opera ad salutem, sed propter alias causas necessaria
   sunt. (4.) Sola fides justificat in principio, medio, et fine. (5.)
   Bona opera non sunt necessaria ad retinendam salutem. (6.) Synonyma
   sunt et æquipollentia, seu termini convertibiles, justificatio et
   salvatio, nec ulla ratione distrahi aut possunt aut debent. (7.)
   Explodatur ergo ex ecclesia cothurnus papisticus propter scandala
   multiplicia, dissensiones innumerabiles et alias causas, de quibus
   Apostoli Act. xv. loquuntur."

   The "Form of Concord," in which this and other controversies in the
   Lutheran Church were finally adjusted, took the true ground on this
   subject, midway between the two extreme views. It rejects the
   unqualified proposition that good works are necessary to salvation, as
   men may be saved who have no opportunity to testify to their faith by
   their works. On the other hand, it utterly condemns the unwarrantable
   declaration that good works are hurtful to salvation; which it
   pronounces to be pernicious and full of scandal. It teaches that "Fides
   vera nunquam sola est, quin caritatem et spem semper secum habeat."
   [235]

   The same doctrine was clearly taught in the Lutheran Symbols from the
   beginning, so that the charge made by Romanists, that Protestants
   divorced morality from religion, was without foundation, either in
   their doctrine or practice. In the "Apology for the Augsburg
   Confession" it is said: "Quia fides affert Spiritum Sanctum, et parit
   novam vitam in cordibus, necesse est, quod pariat spirituales motus in
   cordibus. Et qui sint illi motus, ostendit propheta, cum ait: Dabo
   legem meam in corda eorum.' Postquam igitur fide justificati et renati
   sumus, incipimus Deum timere, diligere, petere, et expectare ab eo
   auxilium. . . . . Incipimus et diligere proximos, quia corda habent
   spirituales et sanctos motus. Hæc non possunt fieri, nisi postquam fide
   justificati sumus et renati accipimus Spiritum Sanctum. . . . .
   Profitemur igitur, quod necesse est, inchoari in nobis et subinde magis
   magisque fieri legem. Et complectimur simul utrumque videlicet
   spirituales motus et externa bona opera. Falso igitur calumniantur nos
   adversarii, quod nostri non doceant bona opera, cum ea non solum
   requirant, sed etiam ostendant, quomodo fieri possint." [236]

   Antinomianism.

   Antinomianism has never had any hold in the churches of the
   Reformation. There is no logical connection between the neglect of
   moral duties, and the system which teaches that Christ is a Saviour as
   well from the power as from the penalty of sin; that faith is the act
   by which the soul receives and rests on Him for sanctification as well
   as for justification; and that such is the nature of the union with
   Christ by faith and indwelling of the Spirit, that no one is, or can be
   partaker of the benefit of his death, who is not also partaker of the
   power of his life; which holds to the divine authority of the Scripture
   which declares that without holiness no man shall see the Lord (Heb.
   xii. 14); and which, in the language of the great advocate of salvation
   by grace, warns all who call themselves Christians: "Be not deceived:
   neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor
   abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor
   drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of
   God." (1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.) It is not the system which regards sin as so
   great an evil that it requires the blood of the Son of God for its
   expiation, and the law as so immutable that it requires the perfect
   righteousness of Christ for the sinner's justification, which leads to
   loose views of moral obligation; these are reached by the system which
   teaches that the demands of the law have been lowered, that they can be
   more than met by the imperfect obedience of fallen men, and that sin
   can be pardoned by priestly intervention. This is what logic and
   history alike teach.

   § 6. Relation of Good Works to Reward.

   Romish Doctrine.

   On this subject the Romanists make a distinction between works done
   before, and those done after regeneration. Works as to the matter of
   them good, when performed from mere natural conscience, have no other
   merit than that of congruity. They are necessarily imperfect, and
   constitute no claim on the justice of God. But works performed under
   the control of gracious principles infused in baptism, are perfect;
   they have therefore real merit, i.e., the merit of condignity. They
   give a claim for reward, not merely on the ground of the divine
   promise, but also on the divine justice. To him that worketh is the
   reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. (Rom. iv. 4.) On this
   subject the Council of Trent, [237] says: "Si quis dixerit, hominis
   justificati bona opera ita esse dona Dei, ut non sint etiam bona ipsius
   justificati merita; aut ipsum justificatum bonis operibus, quæ ab eo
   per Dei gratiam, et Jesu Christi meritum cujus vivum membrum est,
   fiunt, non vere mereri augmentum gratiæ, vitam æternam, et ipsius vitæ
   æternæ, si tamen in gratia decesserit, consecutionem, atque etiam
   gloriæ augmentum; anathema sit." Bellarmin [238] says: "Habet communis
   catholicorum omnium sententia, opera bona justorum vere, ac proprie
   esse merita, et merita non cujuscunque premii, sed ipsius vitæ æternæ."

   The conditions of such meritorious works, according to Bellarmin, are:
   (1.) That they be good in their nature. (2.) Done in obedience to God.
   (3.) By a man in this life. (4.) That they be voluntary. (5.) That the
   agent be in a state of justification and favour with God. (6.) That
   they be prompted by love. (7.) That some divine promise be attached to
   them.

   Refutation of this Romish Doctrine.

   1. This whole doctrine of merit is founded on the assumption that
   justification, their term for regeneration, removes everything of the
   nature of sin from the soul; that works performed by the renewed being
   free from sin are perfect; that a renewed man can not only fulfil all
   the demands of the law, but also do more than the law requires. As
   these assumptions are contrary to Scripture, and to the experience of
   all Christians, the doctrine founded on them must be false.

   2. The doctrine is inconsistent, not only with the express declarations
   of the word of God, but also with the whole nature and design of the
   Gospel. The immediate or proximate design of the plan of salvation, as
   the Scriptures abundantly teach, is the manifestation of the grace of
   God, and therefore it must be gratuitous in all its parts and
   provisions, to the entire exclusion of all merit. Unless salvation be
   of grace it is not a revelation of grace, and if of grace it is not of
   works.

   3. The doctrine is so repugnant to the inward teachings of the Spirit,
   as well as to the teachings of his word, that it cannot be practically
   believed even by those who profess it. The children of God, in spite of
   their theories and their creeds, do not trust for their salvation,
   either in whole or in part, to what they are or to what they do; but
   simply and exclusively to what Christ is and has done for them. In
   proof of this, appeal may be made to the written or recorded experience
   of all the great lights of the Latin Church. If every Christian is
   intimately convinced that he is unholy in the sight of God; that all
   his best acts are polluted; and that in no one thing and at no time
   does he come up to the standard of perfection; it is impossible that he
   can believe that he merits eternal life on the ground of his own works.

   4. As the doctrine of merit is opposed to the nature and design of the
   Gospel, and to the express declarations of Scripture that we are not
   justified or saved by works, but gratuitously for Christ's sake, so it
   is derogatory to the honour of Christ as our Saviour. He gave Himself
   as a ransom; he offered Himself as a sacrifice; it is by his obedience
   we are constituted righteous; it is, therefore, only on the assumption
   that his ransom, sacrifice, and obedience are inadequate that the merit
   of our works can be needed or admitted. The Romanists attempt to evade
   the force of this objection by saying that we owe to Christ the grace
   or spiritual life by which we perform good works. Had He not died for
   our sins, God would not in baptism wash away our guilt and pollution
   and impart those "habits of grace" by which we are enabled to merit
   eternal life. This does not help the matter; for salvation remains a
   debt as a matter of justice on the ground of our good works. It is this
   which is so contrary to Scripture, to the intimate conviction of every
   Christian, and to the glory of Christ, to whom the whole honour of our
   salvation is due.

   Doctrine of the older Protestant Divines.

   The older theologians, in order the more effectually to refute the
   doctrine of merit, assumed that a work, to be meritorious, must be (1.)
   "Indebitum," i.e., not due. Something which we are not bound to do.
   (2.) Our own. (3.) Absolutely perfect. (4.) Equal, or bearing a due
   proportion to the recompense. (5.) And, therefore, that the recompense
   should be due on the gound of justice, and not merely of promise or
   agreement. On these conditions, all merit on the part of creatures is
   impossible. It is, however, clearly recognized in Scripture that a
   labourer is worthy of his hire. To him that worketh, says the Apostle,
   the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt. It is something due
   in justice. This principle also is universally recognized among men.
   Even on the theory of slavery, where the labourer himself his time, and
   strength, and all he has, are assumed to belong to his master, the
   servant has a claim to a proper recompense, which it would be unjust to
   withhold from him. And in every department of life it is recognized as
   a simple matter of justice, that the man who performs a stipulated
   work, earns his wages. The payment is not a matter of favour; it is not
   due simply because promised; but because it has been earned. It is a
   debt. So in the case of Adam, had he remained perfect, there would have
   been no ground in justice why he should die, or forfeit the favour of
   God; which favour is life.

   The passage in Luke xvii. 10, is relied upon as proving that a creature
   can in no case perform a meritorious act, i.e., an act which lays a
   claim in justice for a reward. Our Lord there says, "When ye shall have
   done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
   servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.'" This does not
   teach that the labourer is not worthy of his hire. The passage is part
   of a parable in which our Lord says, that a master does not thank his
   servant for merely doing his duty. It does not call for gratitude. But
   it does not follow that it would be just to withhold the servant's
   wages, or to refuse to allow him to eat and drink. God is just, and
   being just, He rewards every man according to his works, so long as men
   are under the law. If not under the law, they are dealt with, not on
   the principles of law, but of grace.

   But although Protestants deny the merit of good works, and teach that
   salvation is entirely gratuitous, that the remission of sins, adoption
   into the family of God, and the gift of the Holy Spirit are granted to
   the believer, as well as admission into heaven, solely on the ground of
   the merits of the Lord Jesus Christ; they nevertheless teach that God
   does reward his people for their works. Having graciously promised for
   Christ s sake to overlook the imperfection of their best services, they
   have the assurance founded on that promise that he who gives to a
   disciple even a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, shall in
   no wise lose his reward. The Scriptures also teach that the happiness
   or blessedness of believers in a future life, will be greater or less
   in proportion to their devotion to the service of Christ in this life.
   Those who love little, do little; and those who do little enjoy less.
   What a man sows that shall he also reap. As the rewards of heaven are
   given on the ground of the merits of Christ, and as He has a right to
   do what He will with his own, there would be no injustice were the
   thief saved on the cross as highly exalted as the Apostle Paul. But the
   general drift of Scripture is in favour of the doctrine that a man
   shall reap what he sows; that God will reward every one according to,
   although not on account of his works.

   § 7. Perfectionism.

   Protestant Doctrine.

   The doctrine of Lutherans and Reformed, the two great branches of the
   Protestant Church, is, that sanctification is never perfected in this
   life; that sin is not in any case entirely subdued; so that the most
   advanced believer has need as long as he continues in the flesh, daily
   to pray for the forgiveness of sins.

   The question is not as to the duty of believers. All admit that we are
   bound to be perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect. Nor is it a
   question as to the command of God; for the first, original, and
   universally obligatory commandment is that we should love God with all
   our heart and our neighbour as ourselves. Nor does the question concern
   the provisions of the Gospel. It is admitted that the Gospel provides
   all that is needed for the complete sanctification and salvation of
   believers. What can we need more than we have in Christ, his Spirit,
   his word and his ordinances? Nor does it concern the promises of God;
   for all rejoice in the hope, founded on the divine promise, that we
   shall be ultimately delivered from all sin. God has in Christ made
   provision for the complete salvation of his people: that is, for their
   entire deliverance from the penalty of the law, from the power of sin,
   from all sorrow, pain, and death; and not only for mere negative
   deliverance, but for their being transformed into the image of Christ,
   filled with his Spirit, and glorified by the beauty of the Lord. It is,
   however, too plain that, unless sanctification be an exception, no one
   of these promises besides that which concerns justification, is
   perfectly fulfilled in this life. Justification does not admit of
   degrees. A man either is under condemnation, or he is not. And,
   therefore, from the nature of the case, justification is instantaneous
   and complete, as soon as the sinner believes. But the question is,
   whether, when God promises to make his people perfectly holy, perfectly
   happy, and perfectly glorious, He thereby promises to make them perfect
   in holiness in this life? If the promises of happiness and glory are
   not perfectly fulfilled in this life, why should the promise of
   sanctification be thus fulfilled? It is, however, a mere question of
   fact. All admit that God can render his people perfect before death as
   well as after it. The only question is, Has He promised, with regard to
   sanctification alone, that it shall be perfected on this side of the
   grave? and, Do we see cases in which the promise has been actually
   fulfilled? The answer given to these questions by the Church universal
   is in the negative. So long as the believer is in this world, he will
   need to pray for pardon.

   The grounds of this doctrine are, --

   1. The spirituality of the divine law and the immutability of its
   demands. It condemns as sinful any want of conformity to the standard
   of absolute perfection as exhibited in the Bible. Anything less than
   loving God constantly with all the heart, all the soul, all the mind,
   and all the strength, and our neighbour as ourselves, is sin.

   2. The express declaration of Scripture that all men are sinners. This
   does not mean simply that all men have sinned, that all are guilty, but
   that all have sin cleaving to them. "If," declares the Apostle, "we say
   that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
   (1 John i. 8.) As the wise man had said before him, "There is not a
   just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not." (Eccles. vii.
   20.) And in 1 Kings viii. 46, it is said, "There is no man that sinneth
   not." And the Apostle James, iii. 2, says: "In many things we offend
   all." It is a manifest perversion of the simple grammatical meaning of
   the words to make hamartian ouk echomen to refer to the past. The verb
   is in the present tense. The truth is not in us, says the Apostle, if
   we say we have no sin, i.e., that we are not now polluted by sin. In
   the context he sets forth Christ as the "Word of Life," as having life
   in Himself, and as being the source of life to us. Having fellowship
   with Him, we have fellowship with God. But God is light, i.e., is pure,
   holy, and blessed; if, therefore, we walk in darkness, i.e., in
   ignorance and sin, we can have no fellowship with Him. But if we walk
   in the light, as He is in the light, the blood of Jesus Christ
   cleanseth us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, and do not need
   now and at all times the cleansing power of Christ's blood, we deceive
   ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

   Argument from the General Representations of Scripture.

   The declarations of Scripture, which are so abundant, that there is
   none righteous, no not one; that all have sinned and come short of the
   glory of God; that no flesh living is just in the sight of God; and
   that every one must lay his hand upon his mouth, and his mouth in the
   dust in the sight of the infinitely holy God, who accuses his angels of
   folly, refer to all men without exception; to Jews and Gentiles; to the
   renewed and unrenewed; to babes in Christ and to mature Christians. All
   feel, and all are bound to acknowledge that they are sinners whenever
   they present themselves before God; all know that they need constantly
   the intervention of Christ, and the application of his blood, to secure
   fellowship with the Holy One. As portrayed in Scripture, the inward
   life of the people of God to the end of their course in this world, is
   a repetition of conversion. It is a continued turning unto God; a
   constant renewal of confession, repentance, and faith; a dying unto
   sin, and living unto righteousness. This is true of all the saints,
   patriarchs, prophets, and apostles of whose inward experience the Bible
   gives us any account.

   Passages which describe the Conflict between the Flesh and the Spirit.

   3. More definitely is this truth taught in those passages which
   describe the conflict in the believer between the flesh and the Spirit.
   To this reference has already been made. That the seventh chapter of
   Paul's Epistle to the Romans is an account of his own inward life at
   the time of writing that Epistle, has already, as it is believed, been
   sufficiently proved; and such has been the belief of the great body of
   evangelical Christians in all ages of the Church. If this be the
   correct interpretation of that passage, then it proves that Paul, at
   least, was not free from sin; that he had to contend with a law in his
   members, warring against the law of his mind; that he groaned
   constantly under the burden of indwelling sin. At a still later period
   of his life, when he was just ready to be offered up, he says to the
   Philippians, iii. 12-14, "Not as though I had already attained, either
   were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that
   for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not
   myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those
   things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are
   before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of
   God in Christ Jesus." This is an unmistakable declaration on the part
   of the Apostle that even at this late period of his life he was not yet
   perfect; he had not attained the end of perfect conformity to Christ,
   but was pressing forward, as one in a race, with all earnestness that
   he might reach the end of his calling. To answer this, as has been done
   by some distinguished advocates of perfectionism, by saying that Paul's
   not being perfect, is no proof that other men may not be is not very
   satisfactory.

   The parallel passage in Galatians, v. 16-26, is addressed to Christians
   generally. It recognizes the fact that they are imperfectly sanctified;
   that in them the renewed principle, the Spirit as the source of
   spiritual life, is in couffict with the flesh, the remains of their
   corrupt nature. It exhorts them to mortify the flesh (not the body, but
   their corrupt nature), and to strive constantly to walk under the
   controlling influence of the Spirit. The characteristic difference
   between the unrenewed and the renewed is not that the former are
   entirely sinful, and the latter perfectly holy; but that the former are
   wholly under the control of their fallen nature, while the latter have
   the Spirit of God dwelling in them, which leads them to crucify the
   flesh, and to strive after complete conformity to the image of God.
   There was nothing in the character of the Galatian Christians to render
   this exhortation applicable to them alone. What the Scriptures teach
   concerning faith, repentance, and justification, is intended for all
   Christians; and so what is taught of sanctification suits the case of
   all believers. Indeed, if a man thinks himself perfect, and apprehends
   that he has already attained what his fellow believers are only
   striving for, a great part of the Bible must for him lose its value.
   What use can he make of the Psalms, the vehicle through which the
   people of God for millenniums have poured out their hearts? How can
   such a man sympathize with Ezra, Nehemiah, or any of the prophets? How
   strange to him must be the language of Isaiah, "Woe is me! for I am
   undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of
   a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of
   hosts."

   Argument from the Lord's Prayer.

   4. Not only do the holy men of God throughout the Scriptures in coming
   into his presence, come with the confession of sin and imperfection,
   praying for mercy, not only for what they were but also for what they
   are, but our Lord has taught all his disciples whenever they address
   their Father in heaven to say, "Forgive as our trespasses." This
   injunction has ever been a stumbling block in the way of the advocates
   of perfection from Pelagius to the present day. It was urged by
   Augustine in his argument against the doctrine of his great opponent
   that men could be entirely free from sin in the present life. The
   answer given to the argument from this source has been substantially
   the same as that given by Pelagius. It is presented in its best form by
   the Rev. Richard Watson. [239] That writer says, "(1.) That it would be
   absurd to suppose that any person is placed under the necessity of
   trespassing, in order that a general prayer designed for men in a mixed
   condition might retain its aptness to every particular ease. (2.) That
   trespassing of every kind and degree is not supposed by this prayer to
   be continued, in order that it might be used always in the same import,
   or otherwise it might be pleaded against the renunciation of any
   trespass or transgression whatever. (3.) That this petition is still
   relevant to the case of the entirely sanctified and the evangelically
   perfect, since neither the perfection of the first man nor that of
   angels is in question; that is, a perfection measured by the perfect
   law, which in its obligation, contemplates all creatures as having
   sustained no injury by moral lapse, and admits, therefore, of no excuse
   from infirmities and mistakes of judgment; nor of any degree of
   obedience below that which beings created naturally perfect, were
   capable of rendering. There may, however, be an entire sanctification
   of a being rendered naturally weak and imperfect, and so liable to
   mistake and infirmity, as well as to defect as to the degree of that
   absolute obedience and service which the law of God, never bent to
   human weakness, demands from all. These defects, and mistakes, and
   infirmities, may be quite consistent with the entire sanctification of
   the soul and the moral maturity of a being still naturally infirm and
   imperfect."

   The first and second of these answers do not touch the point. No one
   pretends that men are placed under the necessity of sinning, "in order
   that" they may be able to repeat the Lord's prayer. This would indeed
   be absurd. The argument is this. If a man prays to be forgiven, he
   confesses that he is a sinner, and if a sinner, he is not free from sin
   or perfect. And therefore, the use of the Lord's prayer by all
   Christians, is an acknowledgment that no Christian in this life is
   perfect. The third answer which is the one principally relied upon and
   constantly repeated, involves a contradiction. It assumes that what is
   not sin requires to be forgiven. Mr. Watson says the petition, "Forgive
   us our trespasses," may be properly used by those who are free from
   sin. This is saying that sin is not sin. The argument by which this
   position is sustained also involves a contradiction. Our "infirmities"
   are sins if judged by "the perfect law"; but not if judged by "the
   evangelical law." As we are not to be judged by the former, but by the
   latter, want of conformity tc the law is not sin. The only inability
   under which men, since the fall, labour, arises from their sinfulness,
   and therefore is no excuse for want of conformity to that law which it
   is said, and said rightly, is "never bent to human weakness."

   Argument from the Experience of Christians.

   5. Appeal may be made on this subject to the testimony of the Church
   universal. There are no forms of worship, no formulas for private
   devotion, in any age or part of the Church, which do not contain
   confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness. The whole Christian
   Church with all its members prostrates itself before God, saying, "Have
   mercy upon us miserable sinners." If here and there one and another
   among this prostrate multitude refuse to bow and join in this
   confession, they are to be wondered at and pitied. They are, however,
   not to he found. Consciousness is too strong for theory, and therefore,

   6. We may appeal to the conscience of every believer. He knows that he
   is a sinner. He never is in a state which satisfies his own conviction
   as to what he ought to be. He may call his deficiencies infirmities,
   weaknesses, and errors, and may refuse to call them sins. But this does
   not alter the case. Whatever they are called, it is admitted that they
   need God's pardoning mercy.

   § 8. Theories of Perfectionism.

   Pelagian Theory.

   The two radical principles of Pelagianism are, first, that the nature
   of man is uninjured by the fall, so that men are free from sin until by
   voluntary transgression they incur guilt. Secondly, that our natural
   powers, since, as well as before the fall, are fully competent to
   render complete obedience to the law.

   From these principles Pelagius inferred, (1.) That a man (even among
   the heathen) might live from birth to death free from all sin, although
   he did not assert that any man ever had so lived. (2.) That when
   converted, men might, and numbers of men did, live without sin;
   perfectly obeying the law. (3) That this obedience was rendered in the
   exercise of their ability, assisted by the grace of God.

   By grace, Pelagius says that we are to understand, (1.) The goodness of
   God in so constituting our nature that we can completely obey the law
   in virtue of our free agency. (2.) The revelation, precepts, and
   example of Christ. (3.) The pardon of sins committed before conversion.
   (4.) The moral influences of the truth and of the circumstances in
   which we are placed. The effect of grace thus understood, is simply to
   render obedience more easy.

   In the Council of Carthage, A.D. 418, the Pelagians were condemned,
   among other things, for teaching, (1.) That the effect of grace was
   merely to render obedience more easy. (2.) That the declaration of the
   Apostle John, "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and
   the truth is not in us," is, as to some, a mere expression of humility.
   (3.) That the petition in the Lord's prayer, "Forgive us our
   trespasses," is not suited to the saints. They use it only as
   expressing the desire and necessity of others.

   According to the Pelagian theory, therefore, (1.) The sin from which
   the believer may be perfectly free is the voluntary transgression of
   known law. Nothing else is of the nature of sin. (2.) The law to which
   perfect conformity in this life is possible, and in many cases actual,
   is the moral law in all its strictness. (3.) This obedience may be
   rendered without any supernatural influence of the Holy Spirit.

   Romish Theory.

   Romanists teach, (1.) That by the infusion of grace in justification as
   effected by or in baptism, everything of the nature of sin is removed
   from the soul. (2.) That good works performed in a state of grace are
   free from the taint of sin, and are perfect. "Si quis in quolibet bono
   opere justum saltem venaliter peccare dixerit . . . . anathema sit."
   [240] (3.) That the law may be and often is, perfectly obeyed by the
   children of God in this life. (4.) That men may not only do all that
   the law requires, but may even go beyond its demands. (5.)
   Nevertheless, as there is in higher law than that by which men are to
   be judged, no man is entirely free from venial sins, i.e., sins which
   do not bring the soul under condemnation, and therefore all men in this
   life have need to say, "Forgive us our trespasses."

   From this statement it appears,

   1. That by sin from which advanced believers are said to be free, is
   meant only what merits condemnation, and in itself deserves the
   forfeiture of grace or divine favour. It is admitted that
   "concupiscence," or the remains of original sin, is not removed by
   baptism, but it is not of the nature of sin, in the sense just stated.
   Neither are venial sins, i.e., sins which do not forfeit grace,
   properly sins, if judged by the law under which believers are now
   placed. So far, therefore, as the negative part of perfection, or
   freedom from sin is concerned, the Romanists do not mean freedom from
   moral faults, but simply freedom from what incurs the sentence of the
   law. It is perfection as judged by a lower standard of judgment.

   2. The law to which we are now subject, and the demands of which
   Romanists say are satisfied by the obedience of the saints, is not the
   moral law in its original strictness, but the sum of that which is due
   from man in his present circumstances; in other words, the demands of
   the law are accommodated to the condition of men in this life. This is
   evident, because they say that the saints obey the law so far as it is
   now binding, and because they admit that saints commit venial sins,
   which can only mean sins which, under a stricter rule of judgment,
   would merit condemnation.

   3. As stated above, they distinguish between the law and love. The
   former is that which all men, and especially Christians, are bound to
   observe, but love is a higher principle which prompts to doing more
   than the law or justice demands. Consequently, the positive part of
   perfection, or conformity to the law, does not imply the highest degree
   of moral excellence of which our nature is susceptible, but only such
   as answers to the lower demands of the law to which we are now subject.
   In a passage already quoted, Bellarmin says, "Defectus charitatis, quod
   videlicet non faciamus opera nostra tanto fervore dilectionis, quanto
   faciemus in patria, defectus quidem est, sed culpa, et peccatum non
   est. Unde etiam charitas nostra, quamvis comparata ad charitatem
   beatorum sit imperfecta, tamen absolute perfecta dici potest." [241] In
   like manner Moehler says, [242] "In modern times the attempt has been
   made to sustain the old orthodox doctrine by assuming that the moral
   law makes ideal demands, which, as every other ideal, must remain
   unattainable. If this be true, then the man who falls short of this
   ideal is as little responsible, and as little deserving of punishment,
   as an epic poet who should fall short of the Iliad of Homer."

   The Romish theory is consistent. In baptism all sin is washed away. By
   the infusion of grace full ability is given to do all that is required
   of us. Nothing can be required beyond what we are able to perform, and,
   therefore, the demands of the law are suited to our present state. By
   obedience to this modified law, we merit increased supplies of grace
   and eternal life.

   The perfection, therefore, which Romanists insist upon is merely
   relative; not an entire freedom from sin, but only from such sins as
   merit condemnation; not holiness which is absolutely perfect, but
   perfect only relatively to the law under which we are now placed. It is
   clear that there is a radical difference between Romanists and
   Protestants as to the nature of sin and the limits of moral obligation.
   If they were to adopt our definition of sin, they would not pretend to
   any perfection in the present life.

   The Arminian Theory.

   The perfection which the Arminians teach is attainable, and which, in
   many cases, they say is actually attained in this life, is declared to
   be complete conformity to the law; including freedom from sin, and the
   proper exercise of all right affections and the discharge of all
   duties.

   Episcopius defines it to be, keeping the commandments of God with a
   perfect fulfilment; or loving God as much as we ought to love Hun,
   according to the requirements of the Gospel; or according to the
   covenant of grace. "By a perfection of degrees is meant that highest
   perfection which consists in the highest exertion of human strength
   assisted by grace." "This perfection includes two things, (1.) A
   perfection proportioned to the powers of each individual; (2.) A desire
   of making continual progress, and of increasing one s strength more and
   more."

   Limborch defines it as "keeping the precepts of the Gospel after such
   manner, and in such degree of perfection as God requires of us under
   the denunciation of eternal damnation." This obedience is "perfect as
   being correspondent to the stipulations contained in the divine
   covenant." "It is not a sinless or absolutely perfect obedience, but
   such as consists in a sincere love and habit of piety, which excludes
   all habit of sin, with all enormous and deliberate actions." [243] This
   perfection has three degrees (1.) That of beginners. (2.) That of
   proficients. (3.) That of the truly perfect, who have subdued the habit
   of sin, and take delight in the practice of virtue.

   Wesley [244] says; "Perfection is the loving God with all the heart,
   mind, soul, and strength. This implies that no wrong temper, none
   contrary to love, remains in the soul; and that all the thoughts,
   words, and actions, are governed by love." Dr. Peck [245] says that it
   is "a state of holiness which fully meets the requirements of the
   Gospel."

   Although these definitions differ in some respects, they agree in the
   general idea that perfection consists in entire conformity to the law
   to which we are now subject, and by which we are to be judged.

   The Law to which Believers are subject.

   What, according to the Arminian theory, is that law? The answer to that
   question is given in a negative, and in a positive form. Negatively, it
   is said by Dr. Peck not to be the Adamic law, or the law originally
   given to Adam. Fletcher [246] says: "With respect to the Christless law
   of paradisiacal obedience, we utterly disclaim sinless perfection." "We
   shall not be judged by that law; but by a law adapted to our present
   state and circumstances, called the law of Christ." "Our Heavenly
   Father never expects of us, in our debilitated state, the obedience of
   immortal Adam in paradise." The positive statements are, "It is the law
   of Christ." "The Gospel." "The standard of character set up in the
   Gospel must be such as is practicable by man, fallen as he is. Coming
   up to this standard is what we call Christian perfection." [247]

   From this it appears that the law according to which men are pronounced
   perfect, is not the original moral law, but the mitigated law suited to
   the debilitated state of man since the fall. The sin from which the
   believer may be entirely free, is not all moral imperfection which in
   itself deserves punishment, but only such delinquencies as are
   inconsistent with the mitigated law of the Gospel.

   On this point the language of Limborch above quoted, is explicit. It is
   not "an absolutely sinless perfection" that is asserted. And Fletcher
   says, We utterly disclaim "sinless perfection" according to the
   paradisiacal law. Wesley says, By sin is meant (1.) Voluntary
   transgression of known law. In this sense all who are born of God are
   free from sin. (2.)It means all unholy tempers, self-will, pride,
   anger, sinful thoughts. From these the perfect are free. (3.) But
   mistakes and infirmities are not sins. "These are," indeed, "deviations
   from the perfect law, and consequently need atonement. Yet they are not
   properly sins." "A person filled with the love of God is still liable
   to these involuntary transgressions. Such transgressions you may call
   sins, if you please, I do not." [248] The question, however, is not
   what Wesley or any other man chooses to call sin; but what does the law
   of God condemn. Nothing which the law does not condemn can need
   expiation. If these transgressions, therefore, need atonement, they are
   sins in the sight of God. Our refusing to recognize them as such does
   not alter their nature, or remove their guilt.

   According to the Arminian system, especially as held by the Wesleyans,
   this perfection is not due to the native ability, or free will of man,
   but to the grace of God, or supernatural influence of the Spirit.
   Perfection is a matter of grace, (1.) Because it is solely on account
   of the work of Christ that God lowers the demands of the law, and
   accepts as perfect the obedience which the milder law of the Gospel
   demands. (2.) Because the ability to render this obedience is due to
   the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit. (3.) Because believers
   constantly need the intercession of Christ as our High Priest, to
   secure them from condemnation for involuntary transgressions, which,
   judged by the law, would incur its penalty.

   Oberlin Theory.

   This theory is so called because its prominent advocates are the
   officers of the Oberlin University in Ohio. President Mahan [249] says,
   perfection in holiness implies a full and perfect discharge of our
   entire duty; of all existing obligations in respect of God and all
   other beings. It is loving God with all the heart, soul, mind, and
   strength. It implies the entire absence of selfishness and the
   perpetual presence and all pervading influence of pure and perfect
   love.

   Professor Finney says: "By entire sanctification, I understand the
   consecration of the whole being to God. In other words, it is the state
   of devotedness to God and his service required by the moral law. The
   law is perfect. It requires just what is right, all that is right, and
   nothing more. Nothing more nor less can possibly be perfection or
   entire sanctification than obedience to the law. Obedience to the law
   of God in an infant, a man, an angel, and in God himself, is perfection
   in each of them. And nothing can possibly be perfection in any being
   short of this; nor can there possibly be anything above it." [250]

   The law which now binds men and to which they are bound to be perfectly
   conformed, is the original moral law given to Adam. But that law
   demands nothing more and nothing less than what every man in his inward
   state and outward circumstances is able to render. The law meets man at
   every step of his ascending or descending progress. The more grace,
   knowledge, or strength he has, the more does the law demand. On the
   other hand, the less of knowledge, culture, moral susceptibility, or
   strength he possesses, the less does the law require of him.

   President Mahan says, Perfection does not imply that we love God as the
   saints do in heaven, but merely that we love Him as far as practicable
   with our present powers.

   Professor Finney says, The law does not require that we should love God
   as we might do, had we always improved our time, or had we never
   sinned. It does not suppose that our powers are in a perfect state. The
   service required is regulated by our ability.

   The principle of this perfect obedience is our own natural ability. A
   free moral agent must be able to be and to do all that the law can
   justly demand. Moral ability, natural ability, gracious ability, are
   distinctions which Professor Finney pronounces perfectly nonsensical.
   "It is," he says, "a first truth of reason that moral obligation
   implies the possession of every kind of ability which is required to
   render the required act possible." [251]

   The Oberlin theory of perfection is founded on the following
   principles: --

   1. Holiness consists in disinterested benevolence, i.e., a perfect
   willingness that God should do whatever the highest good of the
   universe demands. A man either has, or has not, this willingness. If he
   has, he has all that is required of him. He is perfect. If he has not
   this willingness he is in rebellion against God. Therefore it is said,
   "Perfection, as implied in the action of our voluntary powers in full
   harmony with our present convictions of duty is an irreversible
   condition of eternal life." [252]

   2. There is no sin but in the voluntary transgression of known law.

   3. There is no moral character in anything but generic volitions, or
   those purposes which terminate on an ultimate end. There is no moral
   character in feeling, and much less in states of mind not determined by
   the will. When a man's purpose is to promote the happiness of the
   universe he is perfectly holy; when it is anything else, he is
   perfectly sinful.

   4. Every man, in virtue of being a free agent, has plenary ability to
   fulfil all his obligations. This principle, though mentioned last, is
   the root of the whole system.

   The Relation between these Theories of Perfection.

   The Pelagian and the Oberlin theories agree as to their views of the
   nature of sin; the ability of man; and the extent of the obligation of
   the law.

   They differ as to their views of the nature of virtue or holiness. The
   Pelagian system does not assume that disinterested benevolence, or the
   purpose to promote the highest good of the universe, is the sum of all
   virtue; i.e., it does not put the universe in the place of God, as that
   to which our allegiance is due. They differ also in that, while the
   Oberlin divines maintain the plenary ability of man, they give more
   importance to the work of the Holy Spirit; and in that, it is generally
   admitted that although men have the ability to do their whole duty, yet
   that they will not exert it aright unless influenced by the grace of
   God.

   The Romish and Arminian theories agree, (1.) In that both teach that
   the law to which we are bound to be conformed is not "ideal
   excellence;" not the Adamic law; not the moral law in its original
   strictness; but a milder law suited to our condition since the fall.
   (2.) That by freedom from sin is not meant freedom from what the law in
   its strictness condemns, and what in its nature needs expiation and
   pardon, but from everything which the milder law, "the law of Christ,"
   condemns. (3.) They agree in denying to men since the fall ability
   perfectly to keep the commandments of God, but attribute the ability
   and disposition to obey to the grace of God; or the supernatural
   influence of the Holy Spirit.

   They differ as to the mode in which this grace is communicated, in that
   the Romanists say that it is only through the sacraments, whereas
   Arminians say that sufficient grace is given to all men, which, if duly
   improved, secures such larger measures of grace as will enable the
   believer to become perfect. They differ also as to the nature of good
   works in so far as Romanists include under that category many things
   not commanded in the Scriptures; and as they teach the possibility of
   performing works of supererogation, which the Arminians deny. The
   Romanists also teach that good works merit eternal life, which
   evangelical Arminians do not.

   These theories, however, all agree in teaching that the law of God has
   been lowered in so far that its demands are satisfied by a less degree
   of obedience than was required of Adam, or of man in his normal state;
   and therefore in calling that perfection which in fact is not
   perfection, either in the sight of God or of an enlightened conscience.
   It is a contradiction to say that a man is perfect whose acts and
   shortcomings need expiation and the pardoning mercy of God.

   It may be safely assumed that no man living has ever seen a fellow-man
   whom, even in the imperfect light in which a man reveals himself to his
   fellows, he deems perfect. And no sound minded man can regard himself
   as perfect, unless he lowers the standard of judgment to suit his case.
   And here lies one of the special dangers of the whole system. If the
   law of God can be relaxed in its demands to suit the state of its
   subjects, then there is no limit to be assigned to its condescension.
   Thus perfectionism has sometimes, although not among the Methodists,
   lapsed into antinomianism.

CHAPTER XIX.

  THE LAW
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Preliminary Principles.

   The Personality of God involved in the Idea of Law; and, therefore, all
   Morality is founded on Religion.

   The principal meanings of the word law are, (1.) An established order
   in the sequence of events. A law, in this sense, is a mere fact. That
   the planets are distant from the sun according to a determined
   proportion; that the leaves of a plant are arranged in a regular spiral
   around the stem; and that one idea by association suggests another, are
   simple facts. Yet they are properly called laws, in the sense of
   established orders of sequence or relation. So also what are called the
   laws of light, of sound, and of chemical affinity, are, for the most
   part, mere facts. (2.) A uniformly acting force which determines the
   regular sequence of events. In this sense the physical forces which we
   see in operation around us, are called the laws of nature. Gravitation,
   light, heat, electricity, and magnetism, are such forces. The fact that
   they act uniformly gives them the character of laws. Thus the Apostle
   speaks also of a law of sin in his members which wars against the law
   of the mind. (3.) Law is that which binds the conscience. It imposes
   the obligation of conformity to its demands upon all rational
   creatures. This is true of the moral law in its widest sense. It is
   also true of human laws within the sphere of their legitimate
   operation.

   In all these senses of the word, law implies a law-giver; that is, an
   intelligence acting voluntarily for the attainment of an end. The
   irregular, or unregulated action of physical forces produces chaos;
   their ordered action produces the cosmos. But ordered action is action
   preëstablished, sustained, and directed for the accomplishment of a
   purpose.

   This is still more obviously true with regard to moral laws. The
   slightest analysis of our feelings is sufficient to show that moral
   obligation is the obligation to conform our character and conduct to
   the will of an infinitely perfect Being, who has the authority to make
   his will imperative, and who has the power and the right to punish
   disobedience. The sense of guilt especially resolves itself into a
   consciousness of being amenable to a moral governor. The moral law,
   therefore, is in its nature the revelation of the will of God so far as
   that will concerns the conduct of his creatures. It has no other
   authority and no other sanction than that which it derives from Him.

   The same is true with regard to the laws of men. They have no power or
   authority unless they have a moral foundation. And if they have a moral
   basis, so that they bind the conscience, that basis must be the divine
   will. The authority of civil rulers, the rights of property, of
   marriage, and all other civil rights, do not rest on abstractions, nor
   on general principles of expediency. They might be disregarded without
   guilt, were they not sustained by the authority of God. All moral
   obligation, therefore, resolves itself into the obligation of
   conformity to the will of God. And all human rights are founded on the
   ordinance of God. So that theism is the basis of jurisprudence as well
   as of morality. This doctrine is taught by Stahl, perhaps the greatest
   living authority on the philosophy of law. "Every philosophical
   science," he says, "must begin with the first principle of all things,
   that is, with the Absolute. It must, therefore, decide between Theism
   and Pantheism, between the doctrine that the first cause or principle
   is the personal, extramundane, self-revealing God, and the doctrine
   that the first principle is an impersonal power immanent in the world."
   [253] It is not pantheism, but fetichism to make all things God. The
   real question is, Whether the Absolute has personality and
   self-consciousness or not? Stahl had previously said to the same
   effect, that every philosophy, and every religion, and especially the
   Christian, must proceed on a theory of the universe (a Weltanschauung).
   It is the Christian doctrine of God and of this relation to the world,
   that he makes the foundation of legal and political science (of Rechts-
   und Staatslehre). [254] He therefore calls his system "theological" in
   so far as it makes the nature and will of God the foundation of all
   duties and the source of all rights.

   He recognizes, however, the distinction between morality and religion.
   "Morality," he says, "is the perfection (Vollendung) of man in himself
   (so far as the will is concerned); or the revelation of the divine
   being in man. Man is the image of God, and therefore in his nature is
   like God, perfect or complete in himself; and conformity to the divine
   image is for him the goal and command. (Matt. v. 45). Religion, on the
   other hand, is the bond between man and God, or what binds men to God,
   so that we should know and will only in Hun, refer everything to Him,
   entire consecration, the personal union with God. Thus, love of our
   neighbour, courage, spirituality (the opposite of sensuality), may be
   simply moral virtues; whereas faith and the love of God are purely
   religious. The courage of Napoleon's guard was a moral virtue (a state
   of the will); the courage of Luther was religious (a power derived from
   his relation to God)." [255]

   Religion and morality, although thus different, are not independent.
   They are but different phases of our relation to God. Stahl, therefore,
   controverts the doctrine of Grotius, that there would be a jus naturale
   if there were no God; which is really equivalent to saying that there
   would be an obligation to goodness if there were no such thing as
   goodness. Moral excellence is of the very essence of God. He is
   concrete goodness; infinite reason, excellence, knowledge, and power in
   a personal form; so that there can be no obligation to virtue which
   does not involve obligation to God. Wolf carried out the doctrine of
   Grotius to the length of saying that an Atheist, if consistent, would
   act just as the Christian acts. This principle of Grotius, says Stahl,
   contained the germ of separation from religion, which unfolded itself
   with Kant into an ignoring, and, with those who followed him, into the
   denial of God. [256]

   "The primary idea of goodness, is the essential, not the creative, will
   of God. The divine will in its essence is infinite love, mercy,
   patience, truth, faithfulness, rectitude, spirituality, and all that is
   included in holiness, which constitutes the inmost nature of sod. The
   holiness of God, therefore, neither precedes his will sanctitas
   antecedens voluntatem' of the Schoolmen), nor follows it, but is his
   will itself. The good is not a law for the divine will (so that God
   wills it because it is good); neither is it a creation of his will (so
   that it becomes good because He wills it); but it is the nature (das
   Urwollen) of God from everlasting to everlasting." [257] Again it is
   said, "Hence it follows that moral goodness is concrete,
   specific, . . . . absolute, original, as little determined by logical
   laws as by a relation to external ends. . . . This is not the doctrine
   of modern ethics. According to the eudaimonistic view adopted by the
   English philosophers, by Thomasius, and others, the good is good
   because it tends to produce happiness. According to the rationalists,
   the good is conformity with the laws of thought
   (Denkrichtigkeit). . . . . This was the real doctrine of Wolf, who made
   morality to consist in order (Regelmässigkeit); still more decidedly
   was it the doctrine of Kant, with whom the moral law is a consequence
   of the laws of thought. He says, expressly, that the idea of moral good
   must be derived from preceding law, that is, the law of reason." [258]

   These two principles, then, are to be taken for granted; first, that
   moral good is good in its own nature, and not because of its
   tendencies, or because of its conformity to the laws of reason and,
   second, that all law has its foundation in the nature and will of God.
   These principles are very comprehensive. They are of special importance
   in the exposition of the law in its aspect as the revealed will of God
   designed to regulate human character and conduct.

   Protestant Principles limiting Obedience to Human Laws.

   There is another principle regarded as fundamental by all Protestants,
   and that is, that the Bible contains the whole rule of duty for men in
   their present state of existence. Nothing can legitimately bind the
   conscience that is not commanded or forbidden by the Word of God. This
   principle is the safeguard of that liberty wherewith Christ has made
   his people free. If it be renounced, we are at the mercy of the
   external Church, of the State, or of public opinion. This is simply the
   principle that it is right to obey God rather than man. Our obligation
   to render obedience to human enactments in any form, rests upon our
   obligation to obey God; and, therefore, whenever human laws are in
   conflict with the law of God we are bound to disobey them. When heathen
   emperors commanded Christians to worship idols, tne martyrs refused.
   When popes and councils commanded Protestants to worship the Virgin
   Mary, and to acknowledge the supremacy of the bishop of Rome, the
   Protestant martyrs refused. When the Presbyterians of Scotland were
   required by their rulers in Church and State to submit themselves to
   the authority of prelatical bishops, they refused. When the Puritans of
   England were called upon to recognize the doctrine of "passive
   obedience," they again refused. And it is to the stand thus taken by
   those martyrs and confessors that the world is indebted for all of the
   religious and civil liberty it now enjoys.

   Whether any enactment of the Church or State conflicts with the truth
   or law of God, is a question which every man must decide for himself.
   On him individually rests the responsibility, and therefore to him, as
   an individual, belongs the right of judgment.

   Although these principles, when stated in in thesi, are universally
   recognized among Protestants, they are nevertheless very frequently
   disregarded. This is true not only of the past when the Church and
   State both openly claimed the right to make laws to bind the
   conscience. It is true at the present time. Men still insist on the
   right of making that sin which God does not forbid; and that obligatory
   which God has not commanded. They proscribe rules of conduct and terms
   of church fellowship, which have no sanction in the Word of God. It is
   just as much a duty for the people of God to resist such usurpations,
   as it was for the early Christians to resist the authority of the Roman
   Emperors in matters of religion, or for the early Protestants to refuse
   to recognize the right of the Pope to determine for them what they were
   to believe, and what they were to do. The essence of infidelity
   consists in a man's putting his own convictions on matters of truth and
   duty above the Bible. This may be done by fanatics in the cause of
   benevolence, as well as by fanatics in any other cause. It is
   infidelity in either case. And as such it should be denounced and
   resisted unless we are willing to renounce our allegiance to God, and
   make ourselves the servants of men.

   Christian Liberty in Matters of Indifference.

   It is perfectly consistent with the principle above stated, that a
   thing may be right or wrong according to circumstances, and, therefore,
   it may often be wrong for a man to do what the Bible does not condemn.
   Paul himself circumcised Timothy; yet he told the Galatians that if
   they allowed themselves to be circumcised, Christ would profit them
   nothing. Eating meat offered in sacrifice to idols was a matter of
   indifference. Yet the Apostle said, "If meat make my brother to offend,
   I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to
   offend."

   There are two important principles involved in these Scriptural facts.
   The first is, that a thing indifferent in itself may become even
   fatally wrong if done with a wrong intention. Circumcision was nothing,
   and uncircumcision was nothing. It mattered little whether a man was
   circumcised or not. But if any one submitted to circumcision as an act
   of legal obedience, and as the necessary condition of his justification
   before God, he thereby rejected the Gospel, or, as the Apostle
   expressed it, he fell from grace. He renounced the gratuitous method of
   justification, and Christ became of no effect to him. In like manner,
   eating meat which had been offered in sacrifice to an idol, was a
   matter of indifference. "Meat," says Paul, "commendeth us not to God:
   for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are
   we the worse." Yet if a man ate such meat as an act of reverence to the
   idol, or under circumstances which implied that it was an act of
   worship, he was guilty of idolatry. And, therefore, the Apostle taught
   that participation in feasts held within the precincts of an idol's
   temple, was idolatry.

   The other principle is that, no matter what our intention may be, we
   sin against Christ when we make such use of our liberty, in matters of
   indifference, as causes others to offend. In the first of these cases
   the sin was not in being circumcised, but in making circumcision a
   condition of our justification. In the second case, the idolatry
   consisted not in eating meat offered in sacrifice to idols, but in
   eating it as an act of worship to the idol. And in the third case, the
   sin was not in asserting our liberty in matters of indifference, but in
   causing others to offend.

   The rules which the Scriptures clearly lay down on this subject are:
   (1.) That no man or body of men has the right to pronounce that to be
   sinful which God does not forbid. There was no sin in being
   circumcised, or in eating meat, or in keeping the sacred days of the
   Hebrews. (2.) That it is a violation of the law of love, and therefore
   a sin against Christ, to make such use of our liberty as to cause
   others to sin. "Take heed," says the Apostle, "lest by any means this
   liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak." "When
   ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin
   against Christ." (1 Cor. viii. 9, 12.) "It is good (i.e., morally
   obligatory) neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing
   whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak." "All
   things indeed are pure, but it is evil for that man who eateth with
   offence. (Rom. xiv. 21, 20.) (3). Nothing in itself indifferent can be
   made the ground of permanent and universal obligation. Because it was
   wrong in Galatia to submit to circumcision, it does not follow that it
   was wrong in Paul to circumcise Timothy. Because it was wrong in
   Corinth to eat meat, it does not follow that it is wrong always and
   everywhere. An obligation arising out of circumstances must vary with
   circumstances. (4.) When it is obligatory to abstain from the use of
   things indifferent, is a matter of private judgment. No man has the
   right to decide that question for other men. No bishop, priest, or
   church court has the right to decide it. Otherwise it would not be a
   matter of liberty. Paul constantly recognized the right (exousia) of
   Christians to judge in such cases for themselves. He does this not by
   implication only, but he also expressly asserts it, and condemns those
   who would call it in question. "Let not him that eateth despise him
   that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that
   eateth: for God hath received him. Who art thou that judgest another
   man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth." "One man
   esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let
   every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." (Rom. xiv. 3, 4, 5.) It
   is a common saying that every man has a pope in his own bosom. That is,
   the disposition to lord it over God's heritage is almost universal. Men
   wish to have their opinions on moral questions made into laws to bind
   the consciences of their brethren. This is just as much a usurpation of
   a divine prerogative when done by a private Christian or by a church
   court, as when done by the Bishop of Rome. We are as much bound to
   resist it in the one case as in the other. (5.) It is involved in what
   has been said that the use which a man makes of his Christian liberty
   can never be legitimately made the ground of church censure, or a term
   of Christian communion.

   Scriptural Usage of the Word Law.

   The Scriptures uniformly understand by law a manifestation of the will
   of God. All the operations of nature are ordered by laws of his
   appointment. And his will is represented as the ultimate foundation of
   moral obligation. In Hebrew it is called tvrh, instruction, because it
   is, as the Apostle says, "the form of knowledge and of the truth." It
   is the standard of right and wrong. In Greek it is called nomos,
   custom, and then, as custom or usage regulates the conduct of men,
   whatever has that authority does in fact control action, is called
   nomos. In the New Testament it is constantly used in this wide sense.
   It is sometimes applied to a rule of conduct however revealed;
   sometimes to the Scriptures as the supernaturally revealed will of God,
   as the rule of faith and practice; sometimes to the Pentateuch or Law
   of Moses; and sometimes specifically to the moral law. It is here to be
   taken to mean that revelation of the will of God which is designed to
   bind the conscience and to regulate the conduct of men.

   How the Law is revealed.

   This law is revealed in the constitution of our nature, and more fully
   and clearly in the written Word of God. That there is a binding
   revelation of the law, independently of any supernatural external
   revelation, is expressly taught in the Bible. Paul says of the heathen
   that they are a law unto themselves. They have the law written on their
   hearts. This is proved, he tells us, because they do, phusei, by
   nature, i.e., in virtue of the constitution of their nature, the things
   of the law. The same moral acts which the written law prescribes, the
   conduct of the heathen shows that they know to be obligatory. Hence
   their conscience approves or disapproves, as they obey or disobey this
   inwardly revealed law. What is thus taught in Scripture is confirmed by
   consciousness and experience. Every man is conscious of a knowledge of
   right and wrong, and of a sense of obligation, which are independent of
   all external revelation. He may be unable to determine whence that
   knowledge comes. He knows, however, that it has been in him coeval with
   the dawn of reason, and has enlarged and strengthened just as his
   reason unfolded. His consciousness tells him that the rule is within,
   and would be there though no positive or external revelation of duty
   existed. In other words, we do not refer the sense of moral obligation
   to an externally revealed law, as its source, but to the constitution
   of our nature. This is not the experience of any class of men
   exclusively, but the common experience of the race. Wherever there are
   men, there is the sense of moral obligation, and a knowledge of right
   and wrong.

   It is frequently objected to this doctrine that men differ widely in
   their moral judgments. What men of one age or country regard as
   virtues, men of other ages or countries denounce as crimes. But this
   very diversity proves the existence of the moral sense. Men could not
   differ in judgments about beauty, if the æsthetic element did not
   belong to their nature. Neither could they differ on questions of
   morality unless the sense of right and wrong were innate and universal.
   The diversity in question is not greater than in regard to rational
   truths. That men differ in their judgments as to what is true, is no
   proof that reason is not a natural and essential element of their
   constitution. As there are certain truths of the reason which are
   intuitive and perceived by all men, so there are moral truths so simple
   that they are universally recognized. As beyond these narrow limits
   there is diversity of knowledge, so there must be diversity of
   judgment. But this is not inconsistent with the Scriptural doctrine
   that even the most degraded heathen are a law unto themselves, and show
   the work of the law written on their hearts. As the revelation which
   God has made of his eternal power and Godhead in his works is true and
   trustworthy, and sufficient to render ignorance or denial of his
   existence inexcusable, while it does not supersede the necessity of a
   clearer revelation in his word; so there is an imperfect revelation of
   the law made in the very constitution of our nature, by which those who
   have no other revelation are to be judged, but which does not render
   unnecessary the clearer teachings of the Scriptures.

   Different Kinds of Laws.

   In looking into the Bible as containing a revelation of the will of
   God, the first thing which arrests attention is the great diversity of
   precepts therein contained. This difference concerns the nature of the
   precepts, and the ground on which they rest, or the reason why they are
   obligatory.

   1. There are laws which are founded on the nature of God. To this class
   belong the command to love God supremely, to be just, merciful, and
   kind. Love must everywhere and always be obligatory. Pride, envy, and
   malice must everywhere and always be evil. Such laws bind all rational
   creatures, angels as well as men. The criterion of these laws is that
   they are absolutely immutable and indispensable. Any change in them
   would imply, not merely a change in the relations of men, but in the
   very nature of God.

   2. A second class of laws includes those which are founded on the
   permanent relations of men in their present state of existence. Such
   are the moral, as opposed to mere statute laws, concerning property,
   marriage, and the duties of parents and children, or superiors and
   inferiors. Such laws concern men only in their present state of being.
   They are, however, permanent so long as the relations which they
   contemplate continue. Some of these laws bind men as men; others
   husbands as husbands, wives as wives, and parents and children as such,
   and consequently they bind all men who sustain these several relations.
   They are founded on the nature of things, as it is called; that is,
   upon the institution which God has seen fit to ordain. This
   constitution might have been different, and then these laws would have
   had no place. The right of property need not have existed. God might
   have made all things as common as sun-light or air. Men might have been
   as angels, neither marrying nor giving in marriage. Under such a
   constitution there would be no room for a multitude of laws which are
   now of universal and necessary obligation.

   3. A third class of laws have their foundation in certain temporary
   relations of men, or conditions of society, and are enforced by the
   authority of God. To this class belong many of the judicial or civil
   laws of the ancient theocracy; laws regulating the distribution of
   property, the duties of husbands and wives, the punishment of crimes,
   etc. These laws were the application of general principles of justice
   and right to the peculiar circumstances of the Hebrew people. Such
   enactments bind only those who are in the circumstances contemplated,
   and cease to be obligatory when those circumstances change. It is
   always and everywhere right that crime should be punished, but the kind
   or degree of punishment may vary with the varying condition of society.
   It is always right that the poor should be supported, but one mode of
   discharging that duty may be proper in one age and country, and another
   preferable in other times and places. All those laws, therefore, in the
   Old Testament, which had their foundation in the peculiar circumstances
   of the Hebrews, ceased to be binding when the old dispensation passed
   away.

   It is often difficult to determine to which of the last two classes
   certain laws of the Old Testament belong; and therefore, to decide
   whether they are still obligatory or not. Deplorable evils have flowed
   from mistakes as to this point. The theories of the union of Church and
   State, of the right of the magistrate to interfere authoritatively in
   matters of religion, and of the duty of persecution, so far as
   Scriptural authority is concerned, rest on the transfer of laws founded
   on the temporary relations of the Hebrews to the altered relations of
   Christians. Because the Hebrew kings were the guardians of both tables
   of the Law, and were required to suppress idolatry and all false
   religion, it was inferred that such is still the duty of the Christian
   magistrate. Because Samuel hewed Agag to pieces, it was inferred to be
   right to deal in like manner with heretics. No one can read the history
   of the Church without being impressed with the dreadful evils which
   have flowed from this mistake. On the other hand, there are some of the
   judicial laws of the Old Testament which were really founded on the
   permanent relations of men, and therefore, were intended to be of
   perpetual obligation, which many have repudiated as peculiar to the old
   dispensation. Such are some of the laws relating to marriage, and to
   the infliction of capital punishment for the crime of murder. lf it be
   asked, How are we to determine whether any judicial law of the Old
   Testament is still in force? the answer is first, When the continued
   authority of such law is recognized in the New Testament. That for
   Christians is decisive. And secondly, If the reason or ground for a
   given law is permanent, the law itself is permanent.

   4. The fourth class of laws are those called positive, which derive all
   their authority from the explicit command of God. Such are external
   rites and ceremonies, as circumcision, sacrifices, and the distinction
   between clean and unclean meats, and between months, days, and years.
   The criterion of such laws is that they would not be binding unless
   positively enacted; and that they bind those only to whom they are
   given, and only so long as they continue in force by the appointment of
   God. Such laws may have answered important ends, and valid reasons
   doubtless existed why they were imposed; still they are specifically
   different from those commands which are in their own nature morally
   obligatory. The obligation to obey such laws does not arise from their
   fitness for the end for which they have been given, but solely from the
   divine command.

   How far may the Laws contained in the Bible be dispensed with?

   This is a question much discussed between Protestants and Romanists.
   Protestants contended that the Church had not the power claimed by
   Romanists, to relieve men from the obligation of an oath, and to render
   marriages lawful which without the sanction of the Church would be
   invalid. The Church has neither the authority to set aside any law of
   God, nor to decide the circumstances under which a divine law ceases to
   be obligatory, so that it continues in force until the Church declares
   the parties free frum its obligation. On this subject it is plain, (1.)
   That none but God can free men from the obligation of any divine law,
   which He has imposed upon them. (2.) That with regard to the positive
   laws of the Old Testament, and such judicial enactments as were
   designed exclusively for the Hebrews living under the theocracy, they
   were all abolished by the introduction of the new dispensation. We are
   no longer under obligation to circumcise our children, to keep the
   Passover, or feast of tabernacles or to go up three times in the year
   to Jerusalem, or to exact an eye for an eye, or a tooth for a tooth.
   (3.) With regard to those laws which are founded on the permanent
   relations of men, such as the laws of property, of marriage, and of
   obedience to parents, they can be set aside by the authority of God. It
   was not wrong for the Hebrews to spoil the Egyptians or to dispossess
   the Canaanites, because He whose is the earth and the fulness thereof,
   authorized those acts. He had a right to take the property of one
   people and give it to another. The extermination of the idolatrous
   inhabitants of the promised land at the command of Joshua, was as much
   an act of God as though it had been effected by pestilence or famine.
   It was a judicial execution by the Supreme Ruler. In like manner,
   although marriage as instituted by God was and is an indissoluble
   covenant between one man and one woman, yet He saw fit to allow, under
   the Mosaic Law, within certain limitations, both polygamy and divorce.
   While that permission continued, those things were lawful; when it was
   withdrawn, they ceased to be allowable.

   When one Divine Law is superseded by another.

   The above classification of the divine laws, which is the one usually
   adopted, shows that they differ in their relative dignity and
   importance. Hence when they come into conflict the lower must yield to
   the higher. This we are taught when God says, "I will have mercy, and
   not sacrifice." And our Lord also says, "The Sabbath was made for man,
   and not man for the Sabbath," and, therefore, the Sabbath might be
   violated when the duties of mercy rendered it necessary. Throughout the
   Scriptures we find positive laws subordinated to those of moral
   obligation. Christ approved of the lawyer who said that to love God
   with all the heart, and our neighbour as ourselves, "is more than all
   whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices."

   Perfection of the Law.

   The perfection of the moral law as revealed in the Scriptures, includes
   the points already considered, -- (1.) That everything that the Bible
   pronounces to be wrong, is wrong; that everything which it declares to
   be right, is right. (2.) That nothing is sinful which the Bible does
   not condemn; and nothing is obligatory on the conscience which it does
   not enjoin. (3.) That the Scriptures are a complete rule of duty, not
   only in the sense just stated, but also in the sense that there is and
   can be no higher standard of moral excellence. Romanists, on the
   contrary, teach that a man can do more than the law requires. There are
   certain things which are commanded, and therefore absolutely
   obligatory; and others which are recommended, but not enjoined, such as
   voluntary poverty, celibacy, and monastic obedience. These are held to
   be virtues of a higher grade than obedience to explicit commands. This
   doctrine is founded on the erroneous views of the Church of Rome on the
   nature of sin, and the grounds of moral obligation. If nothing is
   sinful but voluntary, i.e., deliberate transgression of known law; and
   if the law is satisfied by voluntary action in this sense of the terms,
   then it is conceivable that a man may in this life render perfect
   obedience to the law, and even go beyond its demands. This is also
   connected with the distinction which Romanists make between mortal and
   venial sins. The former are those which forfeit baptismal grace, and
   reduce the soul to its original state of spiritual death and
   condemnation. The latter are sins which have not this deadly effect,
   but can be fully atoned for by confession and penance. But if the law
   of God be spiritual, extending to the thoughts and feelings whether
   impulsive or cherished; and if it demands all kinds and degrees of
   moral excellence, or complete congeniality with God, and conformity to
   his image, then there is no room for these distinctions, and no higher
   rule of moral conduct. The law of the Lord, therefore, is perfect in
   every sense of the word.

   The Decalogue.

   The question whether the decalogue is a perfect rule of duty is, in one
   sense, to be answered in the affirmative. (1.) Because it enjoins love
   to God and man, which, our Saviour teaches, includes every other duty.
   (2.) Because our Lord held it up as a perfect code, when he said to the
   young man in the Gospel, "This do and thou shalt live." (3.) Every
   specific command elsewhere recorded may be referred to some one of its
   several commands. So that perfect obedience to the decalogue in its
   spirit, would be perfect obedience to the law. Nevertheless, there are
   many things obligatory on us, which without a further revelation of the
   will of God than is contained in the decalogue, we never should have
   known to be obligatory. The great duty of men under the Gospel, is
   faith in Christ. This our Lord teaches when He says, "This is the work
   of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath went." This comprehends or
   produces all that is required of us either as to faith or practice.
   Hence he that believeth shall be saved.

   Rules of Interpretation.

   Theologians are accustomed to lay down numerous rules for the proper
   interpretation of the divine law, such as that negative precepts are to
   be understood as including positive, and positive, negative; that, in
   forbidding an act, everything which naturally leads to it is
   comprehended; that, in condemning one offence, all others of a like
   kind are forbidden, and the like. All such rules resolve themselves
   into one. The decalogue is not to be interpreted as the laws of men,
   which take cognizance only of external acts, but as the law of God,
   which extends to the thoughts and intents of the heart. In all cases it
   will be found that the several commandments contain some comprehensive
   principle of duty, under which a multitude of subordinate specific
   duties are included.

   § 2. Division of the Contents of the Decalogue.

   As the law given on Sinai and written on two tables of stone, is
   repeatedly called in the Scriptures "The Ten Words," or, as it is in
   the English version of Exodus xxxiv. 28, "The Ten Commandments," there
   is no doubt that the contents of that law are to be divided into ten
   distinct precepts. (See Deut. iv. 13, and x. 4.) This summary of moral
   duties is also called in Scripture "The Covenant," as containing the
   fundamental principles of the solemn contract between God and his
   chosen people. Still more frequently it is called "The Testimony," as
   the attestation of the will of God concerning human character and
   conduct.

   The decalogue appears in two forms which differ slightly from each
   other. The original form is found in Exodus the twentieth chapter; the
   other in Deuteronomy v. 6-21. The principal differences between them
   are, first, that the command respecting the Sabbath is in Exodus
   enforced by a reference to God's resting on the seventh day, after the
   work of creation; whereas in Deuteronomy it is enforced by a reference
   to God's delivering his people out of Egypt. Secondly, in the command
   respecting coveting, in Exodus, it is said, "Thou shalt not covet thy
   neighbour' s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife," etc. In
   both clauses the word is chmd. In Deuteronomy it is, "Neither shalt
   thou desire (chmd) thy neighbour's wife; neither shalt thou covet ('vh)
   thy neighbour's house," etc. This latter difference has been magnified
   into a matter of importance.

   The Scriptures themselves determine the number of the commandments, but
   not in all cases what they are. They are not numbered off as first,
   second, third, etc. The consequence is that different modes of division
   have been adopted. The Jews from an early period adopted the
   arrangement which is still recognized by them. They regard the words in
   Exodus xx. 2, as constituting the first commandment, "I am the Lord thy
   God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house
   of bondage." The command is that the people should recognize Jehovah as
   their God; and the special ground of this recognition is made to be,
   that He delivered them from the tyranny of the Egyptians. These words,
   however, are not in the form of a command. They constitute the preface
   or introduction to the solemn injunctions which follow. In making the
   preface one of the commandments it became necessary to preserve the
   number ten, by uniting the first and second, as they are commonly
   arranged. The command, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me," and
   "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image," being regarded as
   substantially the same; the latter being merely an amplification of the
   former. An idol was a false god; worshipping idols was therefore having
   other gods than Jehovah.

   Augustine, and after him the Latin and Lutheran churches, agreed with
   the Jews in uniting the first and second commandments; but differed
   from them in dividing the tenth. There is, however, a difference as to
   the mode of division. Augustine followed the text as given in
   Deuteronomy, and made the words, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's
   wife;" the ninth, and the words, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's
   house," etc., the tenth commandment. This division was necessitated by
   the union of the first and second, and justified by Augustine on the
   ground that the "cupido impuræ voluptatis" is a distinct offence from
   the "cupido impuri lucri." The Romish Church, however, adheres to the
   text as given in Exodus, and makes the clause, "Thou shalt not covet
   thy neighbour's house," the ninth, and what follows, "Thou shalt not
   covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his man servant, nor his maid servant,"
   etc., the tenth commandment.

   The third method of arrangement is that adopted by Josephus, Philo, and
   Origen, and accepted by the Greek Church, and also by the Latin until
   the time of Augustine. At the Reformation it was adopted by the
   Reformed, and has the sanction of almost all modern theologians.
   According to this arrangement, the first commandment forbids the
   worship of false gods; the second, the use of idols in divine worship.
   The command, "Thou shalt not covet," is taken as one commandment.

   It is universally admitted that there are two tables of the decalogue;
   the one containing the precepts concerning our duties to God, and the
   other those which concern our duties to our fellowmen. Philo referred
   five commands to each table, as he regarded reverence to parents,
   enjoined in the fifth, as a religious rather than a moral duty. Those
   who unite the first and second, and divide the tenth, refer three
   commandments to the first table and seven to the second. According to
   the third arrangement mentioned above, there are four in the first, and
   six in the second. The only objection urged against this is founded on
   the symbolism of numbers. Three and seven among the Jews are sacred end
   significant; four and six are not.

   Arguments for the Arrangement adopted by the Reformed.

   There are two questions to be determined. First, should the
   commandments concerning idolatry be united or separated? In favour of
   considering them two distinct commandments, it may be urged, (1.) That
   all the way through the decalogue, a new command is introduced by a
   positive injunction or prohibition "Thou shalt not take the name of the
   Lord thy God in vain;" "Thou shalt not steal;" "Thou shalt not kill,"
   etc. This is the way in which new commands are introduced. The fact,
   therefore, that the command, "Thou shalt have no other gods," is
   distinguished by the repetition of the injunction, "Thou shalt not make
   unto thee any graven image," is an indication that they were intended
   as different commands. The tenth commandment is indeed an exception to
   this rule, but the principle holds good in every other case. (2.) The
   things forbidden are in their nature distinct. Worshipping false gods
   is one thing; using images in divine worship is another. They therefore
   called for separate prohibitions. (3.) These offences are not only
   different in their own nature, but they differed also in the
   apprehension of the Jews. The Jews regarded worshipping false gods, and
   using images in the worship of the true God, as very different things.
   They were severely punished for both offences. Both external and
   internal considerations, therefore, are in favour of retaining the
   division which has been so long and so extensively adopted in the
   Church.

   The second question concerns the division of the tenth commandment. It
   is admitted that there are ten commandments. If, therefore, the two
   commands, "Thou shalt have no other gods," and "Thou shalt not make any
   graven image," are distinct, there is no room for the question whether
   the command against coveting should he divided. There is, moreover, no
   pretext for such division, unless we follow the order given in
   Deuteronomy, which puts the words, "Neither shalt thou desire thy
   neighbour's wife," before the words, "Neither shalt thou covet thy
   neighbour's house, his field," etc., etc. As coveting a man's wife is a
   different offence, or at least a different form of a general offence,
   from coveting his house or land, if the order given in Deuteronomy be
   considered authoritative, there might be some reason for the
   separation. But if the order given in Exodus be adhered to, no such
   reason exists. The thing forbidden is cupidity, whatever be its object.
   That the order given in Exodus is authoritative may be argued, (1.)
   Because the law as there given was not only the first chronologically,
   but also was solemnly announced from Mount Sinai. (2.) The recension
   given in Deuteronomy differs from the other in many unimportant
   particulars. If the order in which the objects of cupidity are
   mentioned be a matter of indifference, then the diversity is a matter
   of no consequence. But if it be made a matter of importance,
   controlling the order and interpretation of the commandments, then it
   is hard to account for it. There is, therefore, every reason for
   regarding it as one of those diversities which were not intended to be
   significant. (3.) The distinction is nowhere else recognized in
   Scripture. On the contrary, the command, "Thou shalt not covet," is
   elsewhere given as one command. Paul, in Romans vii. 7, says: "I had
   not known sin but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law
   had said, Thou shalt not covet." And in Romans xiii. 9, in enumerating
   the laws forbidding sins against our neighbour, Paul gives as one
   command, "Thou shalt not covet." (4.) Our Lord refers the sin of
   "coveting a man's wife" to the seventh commandment. If included under
   that, it would be incongruous and out of harmony with the context, to
   make it a distinct commandment by itself.

   § 3. Preface to the Ten Commandments.

   "I am Jehovah thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of
   Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods
   before me." Theism and Monotheism, the foundation of all religion, are
   taught in these words. The first clause is the preface or introduction
   to the decalogue. It presents the ground of obligation and the special
   motive by which obedience is enforced. It is because the commandments
   which follow are the words of God that they bind the conscience of all
   those to whom they are addressed. It is because they are the words of
   the covenant God and Redeemer of his people that we are specially bound
   to render them obedience.

   History seems to prove that the question whether the Infinite is a
   person cannot be satisfactorily answered by the unassisted reason of
   man. The historical fact is, that the great majority of those who have
   sought the solution of that question on philosophical principles have
   answered it in the negative. It is impossible, therefore, duly to
   estimate the importance of the truth involved in the use of the pronoun
   "I" in these words. It is a person who is here presented. Of that
   person it is affirmed, first, that He is Jehovah; and secondly, that He
   is the covenant God of his people.

   In the first place, in calling himself Jehovah, God reveals that He is
   the person known to his people by that name, and that He is in his
   nature all that that name imports. The etymology and signification of
   the name Jehovah seem to be given by God Himself in Exodus iii. 13, 14,
   where it is written, "Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the
   children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers
   hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what
   shall I say unto them, and God said unto Moses, I am that I am: and he
   said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am hath sent
   me unto you."

   Jehovah, therefore, is the I am; a person always existing and always
   the same. Self-existence, eternity, and immutability are included in
   the signification of the word. This being the case, the name Jehovah is
   presented as the ground of confidence to the people of God; as in
   Deuteronomy xxxii. 40, and Isaiah xl. 28, "Hast thou not known? hast
   thou not heard, that the everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the
   ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no
   searching of his understanding." These natural attributes, however,
   would be no ground of confidence if not associated with moral
   excellence. He who as Jehovah is declared to be infinite, eternal, and
   immutable in his being, no less infinite, eternal, and immutable in his
   knowledge, wisdom, holiness, goodness, and truth. Such is the Person
   whose commands are recorded in the decalogue.

   In the second place, it is not only the nature of the Being who speaks,
   but the relation in which He stands to his people that is here
   revealed. "I am Jehovah thy God." The word God has a definite meaning
   from which we are not at liberty to depart. We may not substitute for
   the idea which the word in Scripture and in ordinary language is
   intended to express, any arbitrary philosophical notion of our own. God
   is the Being, who, because He is all that the word Jehovah implies, is
   the proper object of worship, that is, of all the religious affections,
   and of their appropriate expression. He is, therefore, the only
   appropriate object of supreme love, adoration, gratitude, confidence,
   and submission. Him we are bound to trust and to obey.

   Jehovah is not only God, but He says to his people collectively and
   individually, "I am thy God." That is, not only the God whom his people
   are to acknowledge and worship, but who has entered into covenant with
   them; promising to be their God, to be all that God can be to his
   creatures and children, on condition that they consent to be his
   people. The special covenant which God formed with Abraham, and which
   was solemnly renewed at Mount Sinai, was that He would give to the
   children of Abraham the land of Palestine as their possession and bless
   them in that inheritance on condition that they kept the laws delivered
   to them by his servant Moses. And the covenant which He has made with
   the spiritual children of Abraham, is that He will be their God for
   time and eternity on condition that they acknowledge, receive, and
   trust his only begotten Son, the promised seed of Abraham, in whom all
   the nations of the earth are to be blessed. And as in this passage the
   redemption of the Hebrews from their bondage in Egypt is referred to as
   the pledge of God's fidelity to his promise to Abraham, and the special
   ground of the obligation of the Hebrews to acknowledge Jehovah as their
   God; so the mission of the Eternal Son for the redemption of the world
   is at once the pledge of God's fidelity to the promise made to our
   first parents after their fall, and the special ground of our
   allegiance to our covenant God and Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 4. The First Commandment.

   The first commandment is, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me." I,
   that is, the person whose name, and nature, and whose relation to his
   people are given in the preceding words, sad I only, shall be
   recognized by you as God.

   This command, therefore, includes, first, the injunction to recognize
   Jehovah as the true God. As this recognition must be intelligent and
   sincere, it includes, --

   1. Knowledge. We must know who, or what Jehovah is. This implies a
   knowledge of his attributes, of his relation to the world as its
   creator, preserver, and governor, and especially his relation to his
   rational creatures and to his own chosen people. This of course
   involves a knowledge of our relation to Him as dependent and
   responsible creatures and as the objects of his redeeming love.

   2. Faith. We must believe that God is, and that He is what He declares
   Himself to be; and that we are his creatures and his children.

   3. Confession. It is not enough that we secretly in our hearts
   recognize Jehovah as the true God; we must openly and under all
   circumstances and despite of all opposition, whether from magistrates
   or from philosophers, avow our faith in Him as the only living and true
   God. This confession must be made, not only by the avowal of the lips
   as when we repeat the Creed, but by all appropriate acts of worship in
   public and private, by praise, prayer, and thanksgiving.

   4. As the law is spiritual, not only as bearing the impress of the
   Spirit, and, therefore, holy, just, and good, but also as taking
   cognizance of the inward as well as of the outward life, of the
   thoughts and feelings as well as of external acts, this recognition of
   Jehovah as our God includes the exercise towards Him of all the
   religious affections; of love, fear, reverence, gratitude, submission,
   and devotion. And as this is not an occasional duty to be performed at
   certain times and places, but one of perpetual obligation, a habitual
   state of mind is the thing required. The recognition of Jehovah as our
   God involves a constant sense of his presence, of his majesty, of his
   goodness, and of his providence, and of our dependence, responsibility,
   and obligation. We are to have God always before our eyes; to walk and
   live with Him, having a constant reference to his will in the conduct
   of our inward and outward life; recognizing continually his hand in
   everything that befalls us, submitting to all his chastisements and
   grateful for all his mercies.

   The second or negative aspect of the command is the condemnation of the
   failure to recognize Jehovah as the true God; failing to believe in his
   existence and attributes, in his government and authority; failing to
   confess him before men; and failing to render him the inward reverence
   and the outward homage which are his due, that is, the first
   commandment forbids Atheism whether theoretical or practical. It
   moreover forbids the recognition of any other than Jehovah as God. This
   includes the prohibition of ascribing to any other being divine
   attributes rendering to any creature the homage or obedience due to God
   alone; or exercising towards any other person or object those feelings
   of love, confidence, and submission which belong of right only to God.

   It is, therefore, a violation of this commandment either to fail in the
   full and sincere recognition of God as God, or to give to any creature
   the place in our confidence and love due to God alone.

   This the Chief of all the Commandments.

   The duty enjoined in this commandment is the highest duty of man. It is
   proved to be so in the estimation of God by the express declaration of
   Christ. When asked, "Which is the great commandment in the law," He
   answered, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
   with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great
   commandment." (Matt. xxii. 37, 38.) It is so also in the sight of
   reason. That infinite excellence should be reverenced; that He who is
   the author of our being and giver of all our mercies; on whom we are
   absolutely dependent; to whom we are responsible; who is the rightful
   possessor of our souls and bodies; and whose will is the highest rule
   of duty, should be duly recognized by his creatures, from the nature of
   the case must be the highest duty of all rational beings. It is,
   moreover, the first and greatest of the commandments if measured by the
   influence which obedience to its injunction has upon the soul itself.
   It places the creature in its proper relation to its Creator on which
   its own excellence and well-being depend. It purifies, ennobles, and
   exalts the soul. It calls into exercise all the higher and nobler
   attributes of our nature; and assimilates man to the angels who
   surround the throne of God in heaven. The preeminence of this
   commandment is further evident from the fact that religion, or the duty
   we owe to God, is the foundation of morality. Without the former, the
   latter cannot exist. This is plain, (1.) From the nature of the case.
   Morality is the conformity of an agent's character and conduct to the
   moral law. But the moral law is the revealed will of God. If there be
   no God, there is no moral law; and if a man does not acknowledge or
   recognize God, there is no higher law than his own reason to which he
   can feel any obligation to be conformed. (2.) It is a principle of our
   nature that if a man disregard a higher obligation, he will not be
   controlled by a lower. This principle was recognized by our Lord when
   He said, "He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also
   in much; and he that is unjust in the least, is unjust also in much."
   (Luke xvi. 10.) This involves the converse: He that is unfaithful in
   much, is unfaithful in that which is least. (3.) It is the testimony of
   experience that where religion has lost its hold on the minds of the
   people, there the moral law is trampled under foot. The criminal and
   dangerous class in every community consists of those who have no fear
   of God before their eyes. (4.) It is the secret conviction of every man
   that his duty to God is his highest duty, as is evinced by the fact
   that the charge of atheism is one from which the human soul
   instinctively recoils. It is felt to be a charge of the utter
   degradation, or of the deadness of all that is highest and noblest in
   the nature of man. (5.) The most decisive and solemn evidence of this
   truth, however, is to be found in the revealed purpose of God to
   forsake those who forsake Him; to give up to the unconstrained control
   of their evil passions, those who cast off their allegiance to Him. The
   Apostle says of the heathen world that it was "Because that when they
   knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, . . . .
   God gave them up unto vile affections." (Rom. i. 21, 26.) And again in
   ver. 28, "As they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God
   gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
   convenient; being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,
   wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate,
   deceit, malignity; whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful,
   proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
   without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection,
   implacable, unmerciful." Such are the natural, the actual, the
   inevitable, and the judicially ordained effects of men's refusing to
   retain God in their knowledge.

   Notwithstanding all this we see multitudes of men of whom it may be
   said that God is not in all their thoughts. They never think of Him.
   They do not recognize his providence. They do not refer to his will as
   a rule of conduct. They do not feel their responsibility to Him for
   what they think or do. They do not worship Him, nor thank Him for their
   mercies. They are without God in the world. Yet they think well of
   themselves. They are not aware of the dreadful guilt involved in thus
   forgetting God, in habitually failing to discharge the first and
   highest duty that rests on rational creatures. Self-respect or regard
   to public opinion often renders such men decorous in their lives. But
   they are really dead while they live; and they have no security against
   the powers of darkness. It is painful also to see that scientific men
   and philosophers so often endeavour to invalidate the arguments for the
   existence of God, and advance opinions inconsistent with Theism;
   arguing, as they in many cases do, to prove either that there is no
   evidence of the existence of any power in the universe other than of
   physical force, or that no knowledge, consciousness, or voluntary
   action can be predicated of an infinite Being. This is done in apparent
   unconsciousness that they are undermining the foundations of all
   religion and morality; or that they are exhibiting a state of mind
   which the Scriptures pronounce worthy of reprobation.

   § 5. The Invocation of Saints and Angels.

   Saints and angels, and especially the Virgin Mary, are confessedly
   objects of worship in the Romish Church. The word "worship," however,
   means properly to respect or honour. It is used to express both the
   inward sentiment and its outward manifestation. This old sense of the
   word is still retained in courts of law in which the judge is addressed
   as "Your Worship," or as "worshipful." The Hebrew word hshchvh and the
   Greek proskuneo often translated in the English version by the word
   "worship," mean simply to bow down, or prostrate one's self. They are
   used whether the person to whom the homage is rendered be an equal, an
   earthly superior, or God Himself. It is not, therefore, from the use of
   any of these words that the nature of the homage rendered can be
   determined. Romanists are accustomed to distinguish between the cultus
   civilis due to earthly superiors, douleia due to saints and angels;
   huperdouleia due to the Virgin Mary; and latreia due to God alone.
   These distinctions, however, are of little use. They afford no
   criterion by which to distinguish between douleia and huperdouleia and
   between huperdouleia and latreia. The important principle is this: Any
   homage, internal or external, which involves the ascription of divine
   attributes to its object, if that object be a creature, is idolatrous.
   Whether the homage paid by Romanists to saints and angels be idolatrous
   is a question of fact rather than of theory; that is, it is to be
   determined by the homage actually rendered, and not by that which is
   prescribed. It is easy to say that the saints are not to be honoured as
   God is honoured; that He is to be regarded as the original source and
   giver of all good, and they as mere intercessors, and as channels of
   divine communications; but this does not alter the case if the homage
   rendered them assumes that they possess the attributes of God; and if
   they are to the people the objects of religious affection and
   confidence.

   What the Church of Rome teaches on this subject may be learned from the
   following passages, from the decisions of the Council of Trent, from
   the Roman Catechism, and from the writings of the leading theologians
   of that Church: [259] "Mandat sancta synodus omnibus episcopis . . . .
   ut . . . . fideles diligenter instruant, docentes eos, sanctos, una cum
   Christo regnantes, orationes suas pro hominibus Deo offerre; bonum,
   atque utile esse suppliciter eos invocare; et ob beneficia impetranda a
   Deo per filium ejus Jesus Christum, Dominum nostrum, qui solus noster
   redemptor et salvator est, ad eorum orationes, opem auxiliumque
   confugere: illos vero, qui negant sanctos, æterna felicitate in coelo
   fruentes, invocandos esse; aut qui asserunt, vel illos pro hominibus
   non orare; vel eorum, ut pro nobis etiam singulis orent, invocationem
   esse idolatriam; vel pugnare cum verbo Dei; adversarique honori unius
   mediatoris Dei et hominum Jesu Christi; vel stultum esse in coelo
   regnantibus voce, vel mente supplicare; impie sentire." "Et quamvis in
   honorem et memoriam sanctorum nonnullas interdum missas ecclesia
   celebrare consueverit; non tamen illis sacrificium offerri docet, sed
   Deo soli, qui illos coronavit; unde nec sacerdos dicere solet, offero
   tibi sacrificium Petre, vel Paule; sed Deo de illorum victoriis gratias
   agens, eorum patrocinia implorat, ut ipsi pro nobis intercedere
   dignentur in coelis, quorum memoriam facimus in terris." [260]

   The Roman Catechism [261] teaches the same doctrine.

   "Invocandi sunt [angeli eorum]; quod et perpetuo Deum intuentur et
   patrocinium salutis nostræ, sibi delatum, libentissime suscipiunt."
   This invocation, it says, does not conflict with the law "de uno Deo
   colendo."

   Thomas Aquinas says: "Quanquam solus Deus sit orandus, ut vel gratiam
   vel gloriam nobis donet; sanctos nihilominus viros orare expedit, ut
   illorum precibus et meritis, nostræ orationes sortiantur effectum."
   [262]

   On this subject Bellarmin lays down the following propositions, (1.)
   "Non licet a sanctis petere, ut nobis tanquam auctores divinorum
   beneficiorum, gloriam, vel gratiam aliaque ad beatitudinem media
   concedunt." This, however, he virtually nullifies, when he adds, "Est
   tamen notandum, cum dicimus, non debere peti à sanctis, nisi ut orent
   pro nobis, nos non agere de verbis, sed de sensu verborum; nam quantum
   ad verba, licet dicere, S. Petre miserere mihi, salva me, aperi mihi
   aditum coeli: item, da mihi sanitatem corporis, da patientiam, da mihi
   fortitudinem." (2.) "Sancti non sunt immediati intercessores nostri
   apud Deum, sed quidquid a Deo nobis impetrant, per Christum impetrant."
   (3.) "Sancti orant pro nobis saltem in genere, secundum Scripturas."
   (4) "Sancti qui regnant cum Christo, pro nobis orant, non solum in
   genere, sed etiam in particulari.quot; [263] As to the question, How
   the saints in heaven can know what men on earth desire of them, he says
   four answers are given. First, some say that the angels, who are
   constantly ascending to heaven and thence descending to us, communicate
   to the saints the prayers of the people. Secondly, others say,
   "Sanctorum animas, sicut etiam angelos, mira quadam celeritate naturæ,
   quodammodo esse ubique; et per se audire preces supplicantium."
   Thirdly, others again say, "Sanctos videre in Deo omnia a principio suæ
   beatitudinis, quæ ad ipsos aliquo modo pertinent, et proinde etiam
   orationes nostras ad se directas." Fourthly, others say that God
   reveals to them the prayers of the people. As on earth God revealed the
   future to the prophets and gives to men at times the power to read the
   thoughts of others, so He can reveal to the saints in heaven the wants
   and prayers of those who call upon them. This last solution of the
   difficulty Bellarmin himself prefers. [264]

   The objections which Protestants are accustomed to urge against this
   invocation of saints are, --

   1. That it is, to say the least, superstitious. It requires faith
   without evidence. It assumes not only that the dead are in a conscious
   state of existence in another world; and that departed believers belong
   to the same living mystical body of Christ, or which their brethren
   still on earth are members, both of which Protestants, on the authority
   of God's word, cheerfully admit, but it assumes, without any evidence
   from Scripture or experience, that the spirits of the dead are
   accessible to those who are still in the flesh; that they are near us,
   capable of hearing our prayers, knowing our thoughts, and answering our
   requests. The Church or the soul is launched on an ocean of fantasies
   and follies, without a compass, if either suffers itself to believe
   without evidence then there is nothing in astrology, alchemy, or
   demonology which may not be received as true, to perplex, to pervert,
   or to torment.

   2. The whole thing is a deceit and illusion. If in fact departed saints
   are not authorized and not enabled to hear and answer the prayers of
   suppliants on earth, then the people are in the condition of those who
   trust in gods who cannot save, who have eyes that see not, and ears
   that cannot hear. That the saints have no such office as the theory and
   practice of invocation supposs is plain, because the fact if true
   cannot be known except by divine revelation. But no such revelation
   exists. It is a purely superstitious belief, without the support of
   either Scripture or reason. The conjectural methods suggested by
   Bellarmin of explaining how the saints may be cognizant of the wants
   and wishes of men, is a confession that nothing is known or can be
   known on the subject; and, therefore, that the invocation of the saints
   has no Scriptural or rational foundation. If this be so, then how
   dreadfully are the people deluded! How fearful the consequences of
   turning their eyes and hearts from the one divine mediator between God
   and man, who ever lives to make intercession for us, and whom the
   Father heareth always, and causing them to direct their prayers to ears
   which never hear, and to place their hopes in arms which never save. It
   is turning from the fountain of living waters, to cisterns which can
   hold no water.

   3. The invocation of saints as practised in the Church of Rome is
   idolatrous. Even if it be conceded that the theory as expounded by
   theologians is free from this charge, it remains true that the practice
   involves all the elements of idolatry. Blessings are sought from the
   saints which God only can bestow; and attributes are assumed to belong
   to them which belong to God alone. Every kind of blessing, temporal and
   spiritual, is sought at their hands, and sought directly from them as
   the givers. This Bellarmin admits so far as the words employed are
   concerned. He says it is right to say: "Holy Peter, save me; open to me
   the gates of heaven; give me repentance, courage," etc. God alone can
   grant these blessings; the people are told to seek them at the hands of
   creatures. This is idolatry. Practically it is taken for granted that
   the saints are everywhere present, that they can hear prayers addressed
   to them from all parts of the earth at the same time; that they know
   our thoughts and unexpressed desires. This is to assume that they
   possess divine attributes. In fact. therefore, the saints are the gods
   whom the people worship, whom they trust, and who are the objects of
   the religious affections.

   The polytheism of the Church of Rome is in many respects analogous to
   that of heathen Rome. In both cases we find gods many and lords many.
   In both cases either imaginary beings are the objects of worship, or
   imaginary powers and attributes are ascribed to them. In both cases,
   also, the homage rendered, the blessings sought, the prerogatives
   attributed to the objects of worship and the affections exercised
   toward them, involve the assumption that they are truly divine. In both
   cases the hearts of the people, their confidence and hopes, are turned
   from the Creator to the creature. There is indeed, however, this great
   difference between the two cases. The objects of heathen worship were
   unholy; the objects of worship in the Church of Rome are regarded as
   ideals of holiness. This, in one view, makes an immense difference. But
   the idolatry is in either case the same. For idolatry consists in
   paying creatures the homage due to God.

   Mariolatry.

   The mother of our Lord is regarded by all Christians as "blessed," as
   "the most highly favoured of women." No member of the fallen family of
   man has had such an honour as she received in being the mother of the
   Saviour of the world. The reverence due to her as one thus highly
   favoured of God, and as one whose heart was pierced through with many
   sorrows, led the way to her being regarded as the ideal of all female
   grace and excellence, and gradually to her being made the object of
   divine honours, as the Church lost more and more of its spirituality.

   The deification of the Virgin Mary in the Church of Rome was a slow
   process. The first step was the assertion of her perpetual virginity.
   This was early taken and generally conceded. The second step was the
   assertion that the birth, as well as the conception of our Lord, was
   supernatural. The third was the solemn, authoritative decision by the
   ecumenical council of Ephesus, A.D. 431, that the Virgin Mary was the
   "Mother of God. On this decision it may be remarked, (a.) That it was
   rendered rather as a vindication of the divinity of Christ, than as an
   exaltation of the glory of the Blessed Virgin. It had its origin in the
   Nestorian controversy. Nestorius was accused of teaching that the Logos
   only inhabited the man Jesus, whence it was inferred that he held that
   the person born of the Virgin was simply human. It was to emphasize the
   assertion that the "person" thus born was truly divine that the
   orthodox insisted that the Virgin should be called the Mother of God.
   (b.) There is a sense in which the designation is proper and according
   to the analogy of Scripture. The Virgin was the Mother of Christ.
   Christ is God manifest in the flesh: therefore she was the Mother of
   God. The infant Saviour was a divine person. Christians do not hesitate
   to say that God purchased his Church with his own blood. According to
   the usage of Scripture, the person of Christ may be designated from one
   nature, when the predicate belongs to the other. He may be called the
   Son of man when we speak of his filling immensity; and He may be called
   God when we speak of his being born. (c.) Nevertheless, although the
   designation be in itself justifiable, in the state of feeling which
   then pervaded the Church, the decision of the Council tended to
   increase the superstitious reverence for the Virgin. It was considered
   by the common people as tantamount to a declaration of divinity. The
   members of the Council were escorted from their place of meeting by a
   multitude bearing torches, preceded by women bearing censers filled
   with burning incense. In combating the assumed Nestorian doctrine of
   two persons in Christ, there was a strong tendency to the opposite, to
   the doctrine of Eutyches, who held that there was in our Lord but one
   nature. According to this view the Virgin might be regarded as the
   Mother of God in the same sense that any ordinary mother is the parent
   of her child. However it may be accounted for, the fact is that the
   decision of the Council of Ephesus marks a distinct epoch in the
   progress of the deification of the Virgin.

   The fourth step soon followed in the dedication to her honour of
   numerous churches, shrines, and festivals; and in the introduction of
   solemn offices designed for public and private worship in which she was
   solemnly invoked. No limit was placed to the titles of honour by which
   she was addressed or to the prerogatives and powers which were
   attributed to her. She was declared to be deificata. She was called the
   Queen of heaven, Queen of queens. said to be exalted above all
   principalities and powers; to be seated at the right hand of Christ, to
   share with Him in the universal and absolute power committed to his
   hands. All the blessings of salvation were sought at her hands, as well
   as protection from all enemies, and deliverance from all evils.
   Prayers, hymns, and doxologies were allowed and prescribed to be
   addressed to her. The whole Psalter has been transformed into a book of
   praise and confession to the Mother of Christ. What in the Bible is
   said to God and of God, is in this book addressed to the Virgin. In the
   First Psalm, for example, it is said, "Blessed is the man who walketh
   not in the counsel of the ungodly," etc. In the Psalter of the Virgin
   it reads, "Blessed is the man who loveth thy name, O Virgin Mary; thy
   grace shall comfort his soul. As a tree irrigated by fountains of
   water, he shall bring forth the richest fruits of righteousness." In
   the second Psalm the prayer is directed to the Virgin: "Protect us with
   thy right hand, O Mother of God," etc. Ps. ix., "I will confess to
   Thee, O Lady (Domina); I will declare among the people thy praise and
   glory. To thee belong glory, thanksgiving, and the voice of praise."
   Ps. xv., "Preserve me, O Lady, for I have hoped in thee." Ps. xvii., "I
   will love thee O Queen of heaven and earth, and will glorify thy name
   among the Gentiles." Ps. xviii., "The heavens declare thy glory, O
   Virgin Mary; the fragrance of thy ointments is dispersed among all
   nations." Ps. xli., "As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so
   panteth my soul for thy love, O Holy Virgin." And so on to the end. The
   Virgin is throughout addressed as the Psalmist addressed God; and the
   blessings which he sought from God, the Romanist is taught to seek from
   her. [265]

   In like manner the most holy offices of the Church are parodied. The Te
   Deum, For example, is turned into an address to the Virgin. "We praise
   thee, Mother of God; we acknowledge thee to be a virgin. All the earth
   doth worship thee, the spouse of the eternal Father. All the angels and
   archangels, all thrones and powers, do faithfully serve thee. To thee
   all angels cry aloud, with a never-ceasing voice, Holy, Holy, Holy,
   Mary, Mother of God. . . . . The whole court of heaven doth honour thee
   as queen. The holy Church throughout all the world doth invoke and
   praise thee, the mother of divine majesty. . . . . Thou sittest with
   thy Son on the right hand of the Father. . . . . In thee, sweet Mary,
   is our hope; defend us for evermore. Praise be cometh thee; empire
   becometh thee; virtue and glory be unto thee for ever and ever." [266]

   It is hardly necessary to refer to the Litanies of the Virgin Mary in
   further proof of the idolatrous worship of which she is the object.
   Those litanies are prepared in the form usually adopted in the worship
   of the Holy Trinity; containing invocations, deprecations,
   intercessions, and supplications. They contain such prayers as the
   following: "Peccatores, te rogamus audi nos; Ut sanctam Ecclesiam
   piissima conservare digneris, Ut justis gloriam, peccatoribus gratiam
   impetrare digneris, Ut navigantibus portum, infirmantibus sanitatem,
   tribulatis consolationem, captivis liberationem, impetrare digneris, Ut
   famulos et famulas tuas tibi devote servientes, consolare digneris, Ut
   cunctum populum Christianum filii tui pretioso sanguine redemptum,
   conservare digneris, Ut cunctis fidelibus defunctis, eternam requiem
   impetrare digneris, Ut nos exaudire digneris, Mater Dei, Filia Dei,
   Sponsa Dei, Mater carissima, Domina nostra, miserere, et dona nobis
   perpetuam pacem." More than this cannot be sought at the hands of God
   or Christ. The Virgin Mary is to her worshippers what Christ is to us.
   She is the object of all religious affections; the ground of
   confidence; and the source whence all the blessings of salvation are
   expected and sought.

   There was, however, always an undercurrent of opposition to this
   deification of the mother of our Lord. This became more apparent in the
   controversy on the question of her immaculate conception. This idea was
   never broached in the early Church. The first form in which the
   doctrine appeared was, that from the fact that God says of Jeremiah,
   "Before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee" (Jer. i.
   5), it was maintained that the same might be said of the Virgin Mary.
   Jeremiah indeed was sanctified before birth, in the sense that he was
   consecrated or set apart in the purpose of God to the prophetic office;
   whereas Mary, it was held, was thus sanctified in the sense of being
   made holy. All the great lights of the Latin Church, Augustine, Anselm,
   Bernard of Clairvaux, and Thomas Aquinas, held that if the Virgin Mary
   were not a partaker of the sin and apostasy of man, she could not be a
   partaker of redemption. As Thomas Aquinas, and after him the
   Dominicans, took the one side in this controversy, Duns Scotus and the
   Franciscans took the other. The public feeling was in favour of the
   Franciscan doctrine of the immaculate conception. Even John Gerson,
   chancellor of the University of Paris, distinguished not only for his
   learning but also for his zeal in reforming abuses, in 1401 came out
   publicly in support of that view. He was, however, candid enough to
   admit that it had not hitherto been the doctrine of the Church. But he
   held that God communicated the truth gradually to the Church, hence
   Moses knew more than Abraham, the prophets more than Moses, the
   Apostles more than the prophets; in like manner, the Church has
   received from the Spirit of God many truths not known to the Apostles.
   This of course implies the rejection of the doctrine of tradition. That
   doctrine is, that a plenary revelation of all Christian doctrine was
   made by Christ to the Apostles and by them communicated to the Church,
   partly in their writings and partly by oral instructions. To prove that
   any doctrine is of divine authority, it must be proved that it was
   taught by the Apostles, and to prove that they taught it, it must be
   proved that it has been always and everywhere held by the Church. But
   according to Gerson the Church of today may hold what the Apostles
   never held, and even the very reverse of what was held by them and by
   the Church for ages to be true. He teaches that the Church before his
   time taught that the Virgin Mary, in common with all other members of
   the human race, was born with die infection of original sin; but that
   the Church of his day, under the inspiration of the Spirit, believed in
   her immaculate conception. This resolves tradition into, or rather
   substitutes for it, the sensus communis ecclesiæ of any given time. It
   has already been shown [267] that Moehler in his "Symbolik" teaches
   substantially the same doctrine.

   This question was undecided at the time of the meeting of the Council
   of Trent, and gave the fathers there assembled a great deal of trouble.
   The Dominicans and Franciscans, of nearly equal influence in the
   Council, each urged that their peculiar views should be sanctioned. The
   legates in their perplexity referred to Rome for instructions, and were
   directed for fear of schism to prevent any further controversy on the
   subject, and so to frame the decision as to satisfy both parties. This
   could only be done by leaving the question undecided. This was
   substantially the course which the Council adopted. After affirming
   that all man kind sinned in Adam and derive from him a corrupt nature,
   it adds: "Declarat tamen hæc ipsa Sancta Synodus, non esse suæ
   intentionis comprehendere in hoc decreto, ubi de peccato originali
   agitur, beatam, et immaculatam Viriginem Mariam, Dei genetricem; sed
   observandas esse constitutiones felicis recordationis Xysti papæ IV.,
   sub poenis in eis constitutionibus contentis, quas innovat." [268] This
   last clause refers to the Bull of Sixtus IV., issued in 1483,
   threatening both parties in this controversy with the pains of
   excommunication if either pronounced the other guilty of heresy or
   mortal sin.

   The controversy went on, therefore, after the Council of Trent very
   much as it had done before, until the present Pope, himself a devoted
   worshipper of the Virgin, announced his purpose to have the immaculate
   conception of the Mother of our Lord declared. This purpose he carried
   into effect, and on the eighth of December, 1854, he went in great pomp
   to St. Peter's in Rome, and pronounced the decree that the "Virgin
   Mary, from the first moment of conception by the special grace of
   almighty God in view of the merits of Christ, was preserved from all
   stain of original sin." She was thus placed, as to complete
   sinlessness, on an equality with her adorable Son, Jesus Christ, whose
   place she occupies in the confidence and love of so large a part of the
   Roman Catholic world.

   § 6. The Second Commandment.

   The two fundamental principles of the religion of the Bible are first,
   that there is one only the living and true God, the maker of heaven and
   earth, who has revealed Himself under the name Jehovah; secondly, that
   this God is a Spirit, and, therefore, incapable of being conceived of
   or represented under a visible form. The first commandment, therefore,
   forbids the worship of any other being than Jehovah; and the second,
   the worship of any visible object whatever. This includes the
   prohibition, not only of inward homage, but of all external acts which
   are the natural or conventional expression of such inward reverence.

   That the second commandment does not forbid pictorial or sculptured
   representations of ideal or visible objects, is plain because the whole
   command has reference to religious worship, and because Moses, at the
   command of God himself, made many such images and representations. The
   curtains of the tabernacle and especially the veil separating between
   the Holy and Most Holy places, were adorned with embroidered figures
   representing cherubim; cherubim overshadowed the Ark of the Covenant
   with their wings; the Golden Candlestick was in the form of a tree
   "with branches, knops, and flowers;" the hem of the high priest's robe
   was adorned with alternate bells and pomegranates. When Solomon built
   the temple, "he carved all the walls of the house round about with
   carved figures of cherubim, and palm-trees, and open flowers, within
   and without." (1 Kings vi. 29.) The "molten sea" stood upon twelve
   oxen. Of this house thus adorned God said, "I have hallowed this house,
   which thou hast built, to put my name there forever; and mine eyes and
   mine heart shall be there perpetually." (1 Kings ix. 3.) There can
   therefore be no doubt that the second commandment was intended only to
   forbid the making or using the likeness of anything in heaven or earth
   as objects of worship. [269]

   The Worship of Images forbidden.

   It is equally clear that the second commandment does forbid the use of
   images in divine worship. In other words, idolatry consists not only in
   the worship of false gods, but also in the worship of the true God by
   images. This is clear, --

   1. From the literal meaning of the words. The precise thing forbidden
   is, bowing down to them, or serving them, i.e., rendering them any kind
   of external homage. This, however, is exactly what is done by all those
   who employ images as the objects, or aids of religious worship.

   2. This is still further plain because the Hebrews were solemnly
   enjoined not to make any visible representation of the unseen God, or
   to adopt anything external as the symbol of the invisible and make such
   symbol the object of worship; i.e., they were not to bow down before
   these images or symbols or serve them. The Hebrew word tsvr, rendered
   "to serve," includes all kinds of external homage, burning incense,
   making oblations, and kissing in token of subjection. The Hebrews were
   surrounded by idolaters. The nations, having forgotten God, or refusing
   to acknowledge Him, had given themselves up to false gods. It was
   nature's invisible force, of which they saw constant, and often fearful
   manifestations around them, that was the great object of their
   reverence and fear. But nature, force, the invisible, could no more
   satisfy them, than the invisible Jehovah. They symbolized not the
   unknown, but the real, first in one way and then in another. Light and
   darkness were the two most obvious symbols of good and evil; light,
   therefore, the sun, moon, and stars, the host of heaven, were among the
   earlier objects of reverence. But anything external and visible, living
   or dead, might be made to the people, by association or arbitrary
   appointment, the representative of the great unknown power by which all
   things were controlled. Most naturally, men distinguished by force of
   character and by their exploits would be regarded as manifestations of
   the unknown. Thus nature-worship and hero-worship, the two great forms
   of heathenism, are seen to be radically the same. It was in view of
   this state of the Gentile world, all nations being given to the worship
   of the visible as the symbol of the invisible, that Moses delivered the
   solemn address to the chosen people recorded in the fourth chapter of
   Deuteronomy. "Only take heed to thyself," said the prophet, "and keep
   thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have
   seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but
   teach them thy sons, and thy sons sons." What is it that he thus
   earnestly called on them to remember? It was that in all the wonderful
   display of the divine presence and majesty upon Sinai, they had seen
   "no similitude," but only heard a voice, "Take ye therefore good heed
   unto yourselves; (for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that
   the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire,) lest ye
   corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any
   figure, the likeness of male or female, the likeness of any beast that
   is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the
   air, the likeness of anything that creepeth on the ground, the likeness
   of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth: and lest thou lift
   up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon,
   and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to
   worship them [literally, "to prostrate thyself before them"], and serve
   them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the
   whole heaven. . . . . Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the
   covenant of the Lord your God, which he made with you, and make you a
   graven image, the likeness of anything which the Lord thy God hath
   forbidden thee. For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a
   jealous God." The thing thus repeatedly and solemnly forbidden as a
   violation of the covenant between God and the people, was the bowing
   down to, or using anything visible, whether a natural object as the sun
   or moon, or a work of art and man s device, as an object or mode of
   divine worship. And in this sense the command has been understood by
   the people to whom it was given, from the time of Moses until now. The
   worship of the true God by images, in the eyes of the Hebrews, has ever
   been considered as much an act of idolatry as the worship of false
   gods.

   3. A third argument on this subject is, that the worship of Jehovah by
   the use of images is denounced and punished as an act of apostasy from
   God. When the Hebrews in the wilderness said to Aaron, "Make us gods
   which shall go before us," neither they nor Aaron intended to renounce
   Jehovah as their God; but they desired a visible symbol of God, as the
   heathen had of their gods. This is plain, because Aaron, when he
   fashioned the golden calf and built an altar before it, made
   proclamation, and said, "To-morrow is a feast to Jehovah." "Their sin
   then lay, not in their adopting another god, but in their pretending to
   worship a visible symbol of Him whom no symbol could represent." [270]

   In like manner, when the ten tribes separated from Judah and were
   erected into a separate kingdom under Jeroboam, the worship of God by
   idols was regarded as an apostasy from the true God. It is evident from
   the whole narrative that Jeroboam did not intend to introduce the
   worship of any other god than Jehovah. It was the place and mode of
   worship which he sought to change. He feared that if the people
   continued to go up to Jerusalem and worship in the temple there
   established, they would soon return to their allegiance to the house of
   David. To prevent this, he made two golden calves, as Aaron had done,
   symbols of the God who had brought his people out of Egypt, and placed
   one in Dan and the other in Bethel, and commanded the people to resort
   to those places for worship. Thus also Jehu, who boasted of his "zeal
   for Jehovah," and exterminated the priests and worshippers of Baal,
   retained the service of the golden calves, because, as Winer expresses
   it, "that had become the established form of the Jehovah-worship in
   Israel." "Er [Jehu] behielt den Kälberdienst in Dan und Bethel, als in
   Israel einheimisch gewordenen Jehovahdienst." [271] In Leviticus xxvi.
   1, it is said: "Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither
   rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of
   stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the Lord your God."
   And Moses commanded that when the people had gained possession of the
   promised land, six of the tribes should be gathered on Mount Gerizim to
   bless, and six upon Mount Ebal to curse: "And the Levites shall speak
   and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice, cursed be the man
   that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the Lord,
   the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret
   place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen." (Deut. xxvii.
   15.)

   The specific thing thus frequently and solemnly forbidden is the bowing
   down to images, or rendering them any religious service. In this sense
   these commands were understood by the ancient people of God to whom
   they were originally given, and by the whole Christian Church until the
   sudden influx of nominally converted heathen into the Church after the
   time of Constantine, who brought with them heathenish ideas and
   insisted on heathen modes of worship.

   The simple obvious facts with regard to the religion of the gentile
   world are, (1.) That the gods of the nations were imaginary beings;
   that is, they either had no existence except in the imaginations of
   their worshippers, or they did not possess the attributes which were
   ascribed to them. Therefore they are called in Scripture vanity, lies,
   nonentities. (2.) Of these imaginary beings symbols were selected or
   images formed, to which all the homage supposed to be due to the gods
   themselves was paid. This was not done on the assumption that the
   symbols or images were really gods. The Greeks did not think that
   Jupiter was a block of marble. Neither did the heathen mentioned in the
   Bible believe that the sun was Baal. Nevertheless some connection was
   supposed to exist between the image and the divinity which it was
   intended to represent. With some this connection was simply that
   between the sign and the thing signified; with others it was more
   mystical, or what in these days we should call sacramental. In either
   case it was such that the homage due to the divinity was paid to his
   image; and any indignity offered to the latter was resented as offered
   to the former.

   As, therefore, the heathen gods were no gods, and as the homage due to
   God was paid to the idols, the sacred writers denounced the heathen as
   the worshippers of stocks and stones, and condemned them for the folly
   of making gods out of wood or metal "graven by art and man's device."
   They made little or no difference between the worshipping of images and
   the worshipping false gods. The two things were, in their view,
   identical. Hence in the Bible the worship of images is denounced as
   idolatry, without regard to the divinity, whether true or false, to
   whom the image was dedicated.

   The Reasons annexed to this Commandment.

   The relation between the soul and God is far more intimate than that
   between the soul and any creature. Our life, spiritual and eternal,
   depends on our relation to our Maker. Hence our highest duty is to Him.
   The greatest sin a man can commit is to refuse to render to God the
   admiration and obedience which are his due, or to transfer to the
   creature the allegiance and service which belong to him. Hence no sin
   is so frequently or so severely denounced in the Scriptures.

   The most intimate relation which can subsist among men is that of
   marriage. No injury which can be rendered by one man against another is
   greater than the violation of that relation; and no sin which a wife
   can commit is more heinous and degrading than infidelity to her
   marriage vows.

   This being the case, it is natural that the relation between God and
   his people should be, as it is, in the Bible so often illustrated by a
   reference to the marriage relation. A people who refuse to recognize,
   or an individual man who refuses to recognize Jehovah as his God, who
   transfers the allegiance and obedience due to God alone to any other
   object, is compared to an unfaithful wife. And as jealousy is the
   strongest of human passions, the relation of God to those who thus
   forsake Him is illustrated by a reference to the feelings of an injured
   and forsaken husband. It is in this way that the Scriptures teach that
   the severest displeasure of God, and the most dreadful manifestations
   of his wrath, are the certain consequences of the sin of idolatry; that
   is, of the sin of having any other God than Jehovah, or of giving to
   images, to stocks and stones, the external homage due to Him who is a
   spirit, and who must be worshipped in spirit and in truth.

   The Lord, therefore, in this commandment, declares Himself to be "a
   jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children
   unto the third and fourth generation; and showing mercy unto thousands
   (unto the thousandth generation) of them that love me, and keep my
   commandments." The evil consequences of apostasy from God are not
   confined to the original apostates. They are continued from generation
   to generation. They seem indeed, and, humanly speaking, in fact are
   remediless. The degradation and untold miseries of the whole heathen
   world are the natural and inevitable consequence of their forefathers
   having turned the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served
   the creature more than the Creator. These natural consequences,
   however, are designed, ordained, and judicial. They are not mere
   calamities. They are judgments, and therefore are not to be
   counteracted or evaded. Consequently those who teach atheism, or who
   undermine religion, or who corrupt and degrade the worship of God by
   associating with it the worship of creatures; or who teach that we may
   make graven images and bow down to them and serve them, are bringing
   down upon themselves and upon coming generations the most direful
   calamities that can degrade and afflict the children of men. Such must
   be the issue unless they not only can counteract the operation of
   natural causes, but also can thwart the purpose of Jehovah.

   It is a great cause for thankfulness, and adapted to fill the hearts of
   God's faithful people with joy and confidence, to know that He will
   bless their children to the thousandth generation.

   The Doctrine and Usage of the Romish Church as to Images.

   Salvation, our Lord said, is of the Jews. The founders of the Christian
   Church were Jews. The religion of the Old Testament in which they had
   been educated forbade the use of images in divine worship. All the
   heathen were worshippers of idols. Idol-worship, therefore, was an
   abomination to the Jews. With the Old Testament authority against the
   use of images and with this strong national prejudice against their
   use, it is absolutely incredible that they should be admitted in the
   more spiritual worship of the Christian Church. It was not until three
   centuries after the introduction of Christianity, that the influence of
   the heathen element introduced into the Church was strong enough to
   overcome the natural opposition to their use in the service of the
   sanctuary. Three parties soon developed themselves in connection with
   this subject. The first adhered to the teachings of the Old Testament
   and the usage of the Apostolic Churches, and repudiated the religious
   use of images in any form. The second allowed the use of images and
   pictures for the purpose of instruction, but not for worship. The
   common people could not read, and therefore it was argued that visible
   representations of Scriptural persons and incidents were allowable for
   their benefit. The third contended for their use not only as a means of
   instruction, but also for worship.

   As early as A.D. 305, the Council of Elvira in Spain condemned the use
   of pictures in the Church. [272] In the thirty-sixth Canon the Council
   says, [273] "Placuit picturas in ecclesia esse non debere; ne quod
   colitur et adoratur in parietibus depingatur." Augustine complained of
   the superstitious use of images; Eusebins of Cæsarea, and Epiphanius of
   Salamis, protested against their being made objects of worship; and
   Gregory the Great allowed their use only as means of instruction. [274]

   In A.D. 726 the Emperor Leo III. issued an ordinance forbidding the use
   of images in churches as heathenish and heretical. To support his
   action a council was called, which met in Constantinople A.D. 754, and
   which gave ecclesiastical sanction to this condemnation. In A.D. 787,
   however, the Empress Irene, under Roman influence, called a council,
   which Romanists of the Italian school consider ecumenical, at Nice, by
   which image-worship was fully sanctioned. This Council first met in
   Constantinople, but there the opposition to the use of images was so
   strong that it was disbanded and called to meet the following year at
   Nice. Here the face of things had changed; enemies had been converted;
   opponents became advocates; even Gregory of Neo-Cæsarea, who had been a
   zealous supporter of the policy of Leo III. and of his son Constantine
   Copronymus, was brought to say, "Si omnes consentiunt, ego non
   dissentio." Few could withstand the promises and threats of those in
   power, and the cogency of the argument for image worship drawn from the
   numerous miracles adduced in favour of their worship. This Council,
   therefore, declared the previous Council, called by Leo III.,
   heretical, and ordained the worship of pictures in the churches; not
   indeed with latreia, or the reverence due to God, but with aspasmos kai
   timetike proskunesis (with salutations and reverent prostrations). The
   Council announced the principle on which image-worship, whether among
   the heathen or Christians, has generally been defended, i.e., that the
   worship paid the image terminates on the object which it represents. He
   tes eikonos time epi to prototupon diabainei kai ho proskunon ten
   eikona proskunei en aute tou engraphomenou ten hupostasin.

   The decisions of this Council, although sanctioned by the Pope, gave
   offence to the Western Churches. The Emperor Charlemagne not only
   caused a book to be written (entitled "Libri Carolini") to refute the
   doctrines inculcated, but also summoned a council to meet at Frankfort
   on the Main A.D. 794, at which delegates from Britain, France, Germany,
   Italy, and even two legates from the Bishop of Rome, were present;
   where the decrees of the so-called General Council of Nice were
   "rejected," "despised," and "condemned." All worshipping of pictures
   and images was forbidden, but their presence in the churches for
   instruction and ornament was allowed.

   The friends of image-worship, however, rapidly gained the ascendancy,
   so that Thomas Aquinas, one of the best as well as the greatest of the
   Romish theologians in the thirteenth century, held the extreme doctrine
   on this subject. He taught that images were to be used in the churches
   for three purposes, first, for the instruction of the masses who could
   not read; secondly, that the mystery of the incarnation and the
   examples of the saints may be the better remembered; and thirdly, that
   pious feelings may be excited, as men are more easily moved by what
   they see than by what they hear. He taught that to the image in itself
   and for itself no reverence is due, but that if it represents Christ,
   the reverence due to Christ is due to the image. "Sic ergo dicendum
   est, quod imagini Christi in quantum est res quædam (puta lignum vel
   pictum) nulla reverentia exhibetur; quia reverentia nonnisi rationali
   naturæ debetur. Relinquitur ergo quod exhibeatur ei reverentia solum,
   in quantum est imago: et sic sequitur, quod eadem reverentia exhibeatur
   imagini Christi et ipsi Christo. Cum ergo Christus adoretur adoratione
   latriæ, consequens est, quod ejus imago sit adoratione latriæ
   adoranda." [275]

   Tridentine Doctrine.

   The Council of Trent acted with reference to the worship of images with
   its usual caution. It decreed that to the images of Christ and the
   saints "due reverence" should be paid, without defining what that
   reverence is. The council decided: "Imagines porro Christi, Deiparæ
   Virginis, et aliorum sanctorum, in templis præsertim habendas, et
   retinendas; eisque debitum honorem, et venerationem impertiendam; non
   quod credatur inesse aliqua in eis divinitas, vel virtus, propter quam
   sint colendæ; vel quod ab eis sit aliquid petendum; vel quod fiducia in
   imaginibus sit figenda; veluti olim fiebat a gentibus, quæ in idolis
   spem suam collocabant; sed quoniam honos, qui eis exhibetur refertur ad
   prototypa, quæ illæ representant: ita ut per imagines, quas osculamur,
   et coram quibus caput aperimus, et procumbimus, Christum adoremus; et
   sanctos, quorum illæ similitudinem gerunt, veneremur."

   In the same session it was decreed concerning relics: "Sanctorum quoque
   martyrum, et aliorum cum Christo viventium sancta corpora, quæ viva
   membra fuerunt Christi, et templum Spiritus Sancti, ab ipso ad æternam
   vitam suscitanda, et glorificanda, a fideibus veneranda esse; per quæ
   multa beneficia a Deo hominibus præstantar: ita ut affirmantes,
   sanctorum reliquiis venerationem, atque honorem non deberi; vel eas,
   aliaque sacra monumenta a fidelibus inutiliter honorari; atque eorum
   opis impetrandæ causa sanctorum memorias frustra frequentari; omnino
   damnandos esse; prout jampridem eos damnavit, et nunc etiam damnat
   ecclesia." [276]

   On relic-worship the Roman Catechism, says, "Cui fidem non faciant et
   honoris, qui sanctis debetur, et patrocinii, quod nostri suscipiunt,
   mirabiles effectæ res ad eorum sepulcra, et oculis, et manibus
   membrisque omnibus captis, in pristinum statum restitutis, mortuis ad
   vitam revocatis, ex corporibus hominum ejectis demoniis? quæ non
   audisse, ut multi, non legisse, ut plurimi gravissimi viri, sed
   vidisse, testes locupletissimi sancti Ambrosius et Augustinus litteris
   prodiderunt. Quid multa? si vestes, sudaria, si umbra sanctorum,
   priusquam e vita migrarent, depulit morbos, viresque restituit, quis
   tandem negare audeat, Deum per sacros cineres, ossa, ceterasque
   sanctorum reliquias eadem mirabiliter efficere? Declaravit id cadaver
   illud, quod forte illatum in sepulcrum Elisei, ejus tacto corpore,
   subito revixit." [277]

   Bellarmin.

   The whole of the Liber Secundus of Bellarmin's Disputation "De Ecclesia
   Triumphante" in the second volume of his works, is devoted to the
   discussion of the question of the worship of the relics and images of
   the saints. As to the worship of images he says there are three
   opinions among Romanists themselves: "Prima, quod imago non sit ullo
   modo in se colenda, sed solum coram imagine colendum exemplar."
   "Secunda opinio est, quod idem honor debeatur imagini ut exemplari, et
   proinde Christi imago sit adoranda cultu latriæ, Beatæ Mariæ cultu
   hyperduliæ, sanctorum aliorum, cultu duliæ." "Tertia opinio versatur in
   medio, estque eorum, qui dicunt, ipsas imagines in se, et proprie
   honorari debere, sed honore minori, quam ipsum exemplar, et proinde
   nullam imaginem adorandam esse cultu latriæ." [278] His own opinion is
   given in the following propositions: "Prima sententia, sive propositio.
   Imagines Christi, et sanctorum venerandæ sunt, non solum per accidens,
   vel improprie, sed etiam per se proprie, ita ut ipsæ terminent
   venerationem ut in se considerantur, et non solum ut vicem gerunt
   exemplaris." "Secunda propositio. Quantum ad modum loquendi præsertim
   in concione ad populum, non est dicendum imagines ullas adorari debere
   latria, sed e contrario non debere sic adorari." "Tertia propositio. Si
   de re ipsa agatur, admitti potest, imagines posse coli improprie, vel
   per accidens, eodem genere cultus, quo exemplar ipsum colitur." "Quarta
   propositio. Imago per se, et proprie non est adoranda eodem cultu, quo
   ipsum exemplar, et proinde nulla imago est adoranda cultu latriæ per
   se, et proprie." "Quinta conclusio, Cultus, qui per se, proprie debetur
   imaginibus, est cultus quidam imperfectus, qui analogice et reductive
   pertinet ad speciem ejus cultus, qui debetur exemplari." [279]

   Relics.

   Bellarmin in his defence of the "cultus reliquiarum" begins with an
   attempted refutation of Calvin's five arguments against such worship.
   He then presents his own in favour of it. [280] They are such as these:
   First, from Scriptural examples: (a.) Moses carried the bones "sancti
   Josephi" with him when he left Egypt; (b.) God honoured the remains of
   Moses by burying them with his own hands; (c.) A dead man was restored
   to life by contact with the bones of Elisha (2 Kings xiii. 21); (d.)
   Isaiah predicted that the sepulchre of the Messiah should be glorious.
   The Vulgate renders Isaiah xi. 10, "Et erit sepulcrum ejus gloriosum;"
   which Bellarmin understands as foretelling "ut sepulcrum Domini, ab
   omnibus honoraretur." And adds, "Ex quo refellitur Lutheri blasphemia,
   qui in libro de abolenda Missa dicit, Deo non majorem curam esse de
   sepulcro Domini, quam de bobus." (e.) The woman mentioned in the Gospel
   was healed by touching Christ's garment; the sick, according to Acts v.
   15, were placed in the streets "that at least the shadow of Peter
   passing by might overshadow some of them"; again, in Acts xix. 11, 12,
   it is said: "God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: so that
   from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and
   the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of
   them." If, says Bellarmin, Christ were now on earth, and we should kiss
   his garment, the Protestants would call us idolaters.

   His second argument is from the decisions of councils; the third from
   the testimony of the fathers; the fourth and fifth from the miracles
   wrought by and in the relics of the saints, of which he cites numerous
   examples; the sixth from the miraculous discovery of the remains of the
   saints, "Si enim Deo cultus reliquiarum non placeret, cur ipse servis
   suis corpora sanctorum, quæ latebant, ostenderet?" the seventh, from
   the translation of relics from one place to another. He also argues
   from the custom of depositing the remains of the saints under altars,
   and burning incense and lamps before their tombs. [281]

   Remarks.

   1. From all this it appears that the Romanists worship images in the
   same way that the heathen of old did, and pagans of our own day still
   do. They "bow down to them and serve them." They pay them all the
   external homage which they render to the persons they are intended to
   represent.

   2. The explanations and defence of such worship are the same in both
   cases. The heathen recognized the fact that the images made of gold,
   silver, wood, or marble were lifeless and insensible in themselves;
   they admitted that they could not see, or hear, or save. They
   attributed no inherent virtue or supernatural power to them. They
   claimed that the homage paid to them terminated on the gods which they
   represented; that they only worshipped before the images, or at most
   through them. So far as the Greeks and Romans are concerned, they were
   less reverential to the mere image, and claimed far less of the
   supernatural in connection with their use.

   3. Both among the heathen and the Romanists, for the uneducated people
   the images themselves were the objects of worship. It would be hard to
   find in any heathen author such justification of image-worship as the
   Romish theologians put forth. What heathen ever said that the same
   homage was due to the image of Jupiter as to Jupiter himself? This
   Thomas Aquinas says of the images of Christ and of the saints. Or what
   heathen ever has said, as Bellarmin says, that although the homage to
   be paid to the image is not strictly and properly the same as that due
   to its prototype, it is nevertheless improperly and analogically the
   same; the same in kind although not in degree? What can the common
   people know of the difference between proprie and improprie? They are
   told to worship the image, and they worship it just as the heathen
   worshipped the images of their gods. As the Bible pronounces and
   denounces as idolatry not only the worship of false gods, but also the
   worship of images, the bowing down to them and serving them,' it is
   clear that the Roman Church is as wholly given to idolatry as was
   Athens when visited by Paul.

   4. The moral and religious effects of image worship are altogether
   evil. It is enough to prove that it is evil in its consequences that
   God has forbidden it, and threatened to visit the worshippers of idols
   with his severe judgments. It degrades the worship of God. It turns off
   the minds of the people from the proper object of reverence and
   confidence, and leads the uneducated masses to put their trust in gods
   who cannot save.

   5. As to the worship of relics, it is enough to say, (a.) That it has
   no support from Scripture. The outline of Bellarmin's arguments given
   above, is sufficient to show that the Bible furnishes no apology for
   this superstitious custom. (b.) What pass for relics, in the great
   majority of cases, are spurious. There is no end to the deceptions
   practised on the people in this regard. There are, it is said, enough
   fragments of the cross exhibited in different sanctuaries, to build a
   large ship; and there are innumerable nails which are reverenced as the
   instruments of our Lord's torture. Bones not only of ordinary men, but
   even of brutes, are set before the people as relics of the saints.
   [282] In one of the cathedrals of Spain there is a magnificent ostrich
   feather preserved in a gorgeous casket, which the priests affirm fell
   from the wing of the angel Gabriel. Romanists themselves are obliged to
   resort to the doctrine of "economics or pious fraud, to justify these
   palpable impositions on the credulity of the people. Of such
   impositions the most flagrant example is the blood of St. Januarius,
   which is annually liquefied in Naples. (c.) Ascribing miraculous powers
   to these pretended relics as Romanists do, is to the last degree
   superstitious and degrading. It is true that a little more than a
   century ago belief in necromancy and witchcraft was almost universal
   even among Protestants. But there is the greatest possible difference
   between superstitious beliefs prevailing for a time among the people,
   and those beliefs being adopted by the Church and enacted into articles
   of faith to bind the conscience of the people in all time. The Church
   of Rome is chained down by the decisions of her popes and councils
   pronouncing the grossest superstitions to be matters of divine
   revelation sanctioned and approved by God. She has rendered it
   impossible for men entitled to be called rational to believe what she
   teaches. The great lesson taught by the history of image-worship and
   the reverencing of relics, is the importance of adhering to the word of
   God as the only rule of our faith and practice; receiving nothing as
   true in religion but what the Bible teaches, and admitting nothing into
   divine worship which the Scriptures do not either sanction or enjoin.

   Protestant Doctrine on the Subject.

   As the worship of images is expressly forbidden in the Scriptures,
   Protestants, as well Lutheran as Reformed, condemned their being made
   the objects of any religious homage. As, however, their use for the
   purposes of instruction or ornament is not thus expressly forbidden,
   Luther contended that such use was allowable and even desirable. He,
   therefore, favoured their being retained in the Churches. The Reformed,
   however, on account of the great abuse which had attended their
   introduction, insisted that they should be excluded from all places of
   worship.

   The Lutheran standards do not dilate on this subject. In the Apology
   for the Augsburg Confession it is said: "Primum quia cum alii
   mediatores præter Christum quæruntur, collocatur fiducia in alios,
   obruitur tota notitia Christi, idque res ostendit. Videtur initio
   mentio sanctorum, qualis est in veteribus orationibus, tolerabili
   consilio recepta esse. Postea secuta est invocatio, invocationem
   prodigiosi et plus quam ethnici abusus secuti sunt. Ab invocatione ad
   imagines ventum est, hæ quoque colebantur, et putabatur eis inesse
   quædam vis, sicut Magi vim inesse fingunt imaginibus signorum
   coelestium certo tempore sculptis." [283]

   Luther was tolerant of the use of images in the churches. On this
   subject he says: "If the worship of images be avoided, we may use them
   as we do the words of Scripture, which bring things before the mind and
   cause us to remember them." [284] "Who is so stone blind," he asks, "as
   not to see that if sacred events may be described in words without sin
   and to the profit of the hearers, they may with the same propriety, for
   the benefit of the uneducated, be portrayed or sculptured, not only at
   home and in our houses, but in the churches." [285] In another place he
   says that when one reads of the passion of Christ, whether he will or
   not an image of a man suspended on a cross is formed in his mind just
   as certainly as his face is reflected when he looks into the water.
   There is no sin in having such an image in the mind why then should it
   be sinful to have it before the eyes? [286]

   The Reformed went further than this. They condemned not only the
   worship of images, but also their introduction into places of worship,
   because they were unnecessary, and because they were so liable to
   abuse. The Second Helvetic Confession says, "Rejicimus non modo gentium
   idola, sed et Christianorum simulachra. Tametsi enim Christus humanam
   assumpserit naturam, non ideo tamen assumpsit, ut typum præferret
   statuariis atque pictoribus. . . . . Et quando beati spiritus et divi
   coelites, dum hic viverent, omnem cultum sui averterunt, et statuas
   oppugnarunt, cui verisimile videatur divis coelestibus et angelis suas
   placere imagines, ad quas genua flectunt homines, detegunt capita,
   allisque prosequuntur honoribus?" In another paragraph of the same
   chapter it is said: "Idcirco approbamus Lactantii veteris, scriptoris
   sententiam, dicentis, Non est dubium, quin religio nulla est, ubicunque
   simulachrum est." [287]

   The Heidelberg Catechism, says, [288] "Is it forbidden to make any
   images or statues? God cannot and ought not in any way to be depicted,
   and although it is lawful to make representations of creatures, yet God
   forbids that they should be worshipped, or He through them. But may not
   images be tolerated in the churches for the instruction of the
   uneducated? By no means; for it does not become us to be wiser than
   God, who has willed that his Church be instructed, not by dumb images,
   but by the preaching of his word."

   No one who has ever seen any of the masterpieces of Christian art,
   whether of the pencil or of the chisel, and felt how hard it is to
   resist the impulse to "bow down to them and serve them," can doubt the
   wisdom of their exclusion from places of public worship.

   § 7. The Third Commandment.

   "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord
   will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain."

   The literal meaning of this command is doubtful. It may mean, "Thou
   shalt not utter the name of God in a vain or irreverent manner;" or,
   "Thou shalt not utter the name of God to a lie," i.e., "Thou shalt not
   swear falsely." The Septuagint renders the passage thus; Ou lepse to
   onoma kuriou tou theou sou epi matio. The Vulgate has, "Non assumes
   nomen Domini Dei tui in vanum." Luther, as usual, freely ad sensum: "Du
   sollist den Namen des Herrn, deines Gottes, nicht missbrauchen." Our
   translators have adopted the same rendering.

   The ancient Syriac Version, the Targum of Onkelos, Philo, and many
   modern commentators and exegetes understand the command as directed
   against false swearing: "Thou shalt not utter the name of God to a
   lie." So the elder Michaelis in his annotated Hebrew Bible, explains
   "ad vanum confirmandum: non frustra, nedum, falso." Gesenius in his
   Hebrew Lexicon renders the passage, [289] "Du sollst den Namen Jehova's
   nicht zur Lüge aussprechen; nicht falsch schwören." Rosenmüller [290]
   renders it: "Nolli enunciare nomen Jova Dei tui ad falsum sc.
   comprobandum." Knobel [291] reads: "Nicht sollst du erheben den Namen
   Jehova's zur Nichtigkeit;" and adds, "The prohibition is directed
   specially against false swearing."

   This interpretation is consistent with the meaning of the words, as
   asv', here rendered "vanity," or with the preposition, "in vain,"
   elsewhere means "falsehood." (See Ps. xii. 3 (2); xli. 7 (6); Isaiah
   lix. 4; Hos. x. 4.) To lift up, or pronounce the name of God for a lie,
   naturally means, to call upon God to confirm a falsehood. The
   preposition l also has its natural force. Compare Leviticus xix. 12,
   "Ye shall not swear by my name [lstr to a lie'] falsely." The general
   import of the command remains the same, whichever interpretation be
   adopted. The command not to misuse the name of God, includes false
   swearing, which is the greatest indignity which can be offered to God.
   And as the command, "Thou shalt do no murder," includes all indulgence
   of malicious feelings; so the command, "Thou shalt not forswear thy
   self," includes all lesser forms of irreverence in the use of the name
   of God.

   It is urged, as an objection to the second interpretation given above,
   that perjury is an offence against our neighbour, and therefore belongs
   to the second table of the Law; and that it is in fact included in the
   ninth commandment, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
   neighbour." Bearing false testimony and false swearing are, however,
   different offences. The first and second commandment forbid the worship
   of any other being than Jehovah, and worshipping Him in any way not
   appointed in his word; and the third, supposing it to forbid false
   swearing, is here in place, as false swearing is a practical denial of
   the being or perfections of God.

   Import of the Command.

   The word "name" is used in reference to God in a very comprehensive
   sense. It often means a personal or individual designation; as when God
   says, "This is my name," i.e., Jehovah. Frequently the "name of God" is
   equivalent to God himself. To call on the name of the Lord, and to call
   on God, are synonymous forms of expression. As names are intended to
   distinguish one person or thing from another, anything distinguishing
   or characteristic may be included under the term. The name of God,
   therefore, includes everything by which He makes Himself known. This
   commandment, therefore, forbids all irreverence towards God; not only
   the highest act of irreverence in calling on Him to bear witness to a
   falsehood, but also all irreverent use of his name; all careless,
   unnecessary reference to him, or his attributes; all indecorous conduct
   in his worship; and in short, every indication of the want of that
   fear, reverence, and awe due to a Being infinite in all his
   perfections, on whom we are absolutely dependent, and to whom we are
   accountable for our character and conduct.

   The third commandment, therefore, specially forbids not only perjury,
   but also all profane, or unnecessary oaths, all careless appeals to
   God, and all irreverent use of his name. All literature, whether
   profane or Christian, shows how strong is the tendency in human nature
   to introduce the name of God even on the most trivial occasions. Not
   only are those formulas, such as Adieu, Good-bye or God be with you,
   and God forbid, which may have had a pious origin, constantly used
   without any recognition of their true import, but even persons
   professing to fear God often allow themselves to use his name as a mere
   expression of surprise. God is everywhere present. He hears all we say.
   He is worthy of the highest reverence; and He will not hold him
   guiltless who on any occasion uses his name irreverently.

   Oaths.

   The command not to call upon God to confirm a lie, cannot be considered
   as forbidding us to call upon Him to confirm the truth. And such is the
   general nature of an oath. Oaths are of two kinds, assertatory, when we
   affirm a thing to be true; and promissory, when we bring ourselves
   under an obligation to do, or to forbear doing certain acts. To this
   class belong official oaths and oaths of allegiance. In both cases
   there is an appeal to God as a witness. An oath, therefore, is in its
   nature an act of worship. It implies, (1.) An acknowledgment of the
   existence of God. (2.) Of his attributes of omnipresence, omniscience,
   justice, and power. (3.) Of his moral government over the world; and
   (4.) Of our accountability to Him as our Sovereign and Judge. Hence "to
   swear by the name of Jehovah," and to acknowledge Him as God, are the
   same thing. The former involves the latter.

   Such being the case, it is evident that a man who denies the truths
   above mentioned cannot take an oath. For him the words he utters have
   no meaning. If he does not believe that there is a God; or suppose that
   he admits that there is some being or force which may be called God, if
   he does not believe that that Being knows what the juror says, or that
   He will punish the false swearer, the whole service is a mockery. It is
   a great injustice, tending to loosen all the bonds of society, to allow
   atheists to give testimony in courts of justice. [292]

   The imprecation usually introduced in the formula of an oath, is not
   essential to its nature. It is indeed involved in the appeal to God to
   bear witness to the truth of what we say, but its direct assertion is
   not necessary. Indeed, it is not found in any of the oaths recorded in
   the Bible. Some strenuously object to its introduction, as involving a
   renunciation of all hope of the mercy and grace of God, and as an
   equivalent to an imprecation on one s self of everlasting perdition.

   The Lawfulness of Oaths.

   The lawfulness of oaths may be inferred, --

   1. From their nature. Being acts of worship involving the
   acknowledgment of the being and attributes of God, and of our
   responsibility to Him, they are in their nature good. They are not
   superstitious, founded on wrong ideas of God or of his relation to the
   world; nor are they irreverent; nor are they useless. They have a real
   power over the consciences of men; and that power is the greater
   according as the faith of the juror and of society in the truths of
   religion, is the more intelligent and the stronger.

   2. In the Scriptures, oaths, on proper occasions, are not only
   permitted, but commanded. "Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and shalt
   swear by his name. (Deut. vi. 13.) "He who blesseth himself in the
   earth, shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in
   the earth, shall swear by the God of truth." (Is. lxv. 16.) "It shall
   come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to
   swear by my name, Jehovah liveth; (as they taught my people to swear by
   Baal;) then shall they be built in the midst of my people." (Jer. xii.
   16; iv. 2.) God Himself is represented as swearing. (Psalms cx. 4;
   Hebrews vii. 21.) "When God made promise to Abraham, because he could
   swear by no greater, he sware by himself." (Heb. vi. 13.) Our blessed
   Lord also, when put upon his oath by the high priest, did not hesitate
   to answer. (Matt. xxvi. 63.) The words are, Exorkizo se kata tou Theou
   tou zontos, which are correctly rendered by our version, "I adjure thee
   (call on thee to swear) by the living God." Meyer in his comment on
   this passage says: "An affirmative answer to this formula was an oath
   in the full meaning of the word." And our Lord's reply, "Thou sayest,"
   is the usual Rabbinical form of direct affirmation. [293] The Hebrew
   word hsby is rendered in the Septuagint by horkizo and exorkizo, and in
   the Vulgate by adjuro. See Genesis 1. 5, "My father made me swear,
   horkise me." Num. v. 19, "The priest shall charge her by an oath,
   horkiei auten." It appears from this passage as well as from others in
   the Old Testament, that oaths were on certain occasions enjoined by God
   himself. (Ex. xxii. 10.) They cannot, therefore, be unlawful.

   Seeing, then, that an oath is an act of worship; that it is enjoined on
   suitable occasions; that our Lord himself submitted to be put upon his
   oath; and that the Apostles did not hesitate to call God to witness to
   the truth of what they said; we cannot admit that Christ intended to
   pronounce all oaths unlawful, when he said, as recorded in Matthew v.
   34, "Swear not at all." This would be to suppose that Scripture can
   contradict Scripture, and that Christ's conduct did not conform to his
   precepts. Nevertheless, his words are very explicit. They mean in Greek
   just what our version makes them mean. Our Lord did say, "Swear not at
   all." But in the sixth commandment it is said, "Thou shalt not kill."
   That, however, does not mean that we may not kill animals for food; for
   that is permitted and commanded. It does not forbid homicide in
   self-defence, for that also is permitted. Neither does it forbid
   capital punishment; for that is not only permitted but even commanded.
   The meaning of this command has never been doubted or disputed, because
   it is sufficiently explained by the context and occasion, and by the
   light shed upon it by other parts of Scripture. As, therefore, the
   command, "Thou shalt not kill," forbids only unlawful killing; so also
   the command, "Swear not at all," forbids only unlawful swearing.

   This conclusion is confirmed by the context. A great part of our Lord's
   Sermon on the Mount is devoted to the correction of perversions of the
   law, introduced by the Scribes and Pharisees. They made the sixth
   commandment to forbid only murder; our Lord said that it forbade all
   malicious passions. They limited the seventh commandment to the outward
   act; He extended it to the inward desire. They made the precept to love
   our neighbour consistent with hating our enemies; Christ says, "Love
   your enemies, bless them that curse you." In like manner, the Scribes
   taught that the law allowed all kinds of swearing, and swearing on all
   occasions, provided a man did not forswear himself; but our Lord said,
   I say unto you, in your communications swear not at all; this is plain
   from ver. 37, "Let your communications (logos, word, talk) be Yea, yea;
   Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these, cometh of evil." It is
   unnecessary, colloquial, irreverent swearing our Lord condemns. This
   has nothing to do with those solemn acts of worship, permitted and
   commanded in the word of God. The Jews of that age were especially
   addicted to colloquial swearing, holding that the law forbade only fake
   swearing, or swearing by the name of false gods; [294] hence our Lord
   had the more occasion to rebuke this sin, and show the evil of any such
   adjurations.

   When are Oaths lawful.

   1. As an oath involves an act of worship, it is plain that it should
   not be taken on any trivial occasion, or in an irreverent manner.

   2. An oath is lawful when prescribed and administered by duly
   authorized officers of the State, or of the Church; they are the
   "ministers of God," acting in his name and by his authority. There are
   many who do not regard it as proper that an oath should ever be taken,
   except when thus imposed by those in authority. The Church of England
   in the thirty-ninth article, says: "As we confess that vain and rash
   swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James
   his Apostle; so we judge that Christian religion doth not prohibit, but
   that a man may swear when the magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith
   and charity, so it be done according to the prophet's teaching, in
   justice, judgment, and truth." The same ground has been taken by many
   moral philosophers and theologians.

   There does not, however, seem to be any sufficient reason for this
   restriction, either in the nature or design of an oath, or in the
   teachings of Scripture. The oath being an appeal to God to bear witness
   to the truth of our declarations, or the sincerity of our promises,
   there is no reason why this appeal should not be made whenever any
   important end is to be accomplished by it. There should be a necessity
   for it; that is, no man should swear lightly or profanely, but only
   when all the conditions which justify this appeal to God are present.
   According to the old law those conditions are, "judicium in jurante,
   justitia in objecto, veracitas in mente." That is, the juror must be
   competent. He must have a just judgment of the nature and obligation of
   an oath, so as to understand what he is about to do. Therefore an
   idiot, a child, or an unbeliever cannot properly be put upon his oath.
   By "justitia in objecto," is meant that the object concerning which the
   oath is taken, should be a proper object. If it be a promissory oath,
   the thing we engage to do must be possible and lawful; if an
   assertatory oath, the object must have due importance; it must be
   within the knowledge of the juror; and there must be an adequate reason
   why this appeal to God should be made. The "veracitas in mente,"
   includes the sincere purpose of doing what we promise, or of telling
   the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, to the best of our
   knowledge in the case in which we testify. This excludes all intention
   to deceive, all mental reservation, and all designed ambiguity of
   language. All these conditions may be present in private, as well as in
   judicial or official oaths.

   Then again, as the design of an oath is to produce conviction of the
   truth, to satisfy others of our sincerity and fidelity, and to make an
   end of controversy, it is evident that circumstances may arise in
   private life, or in the intercourse of a man with his fellow-men, when
   an oath may be of the greatest importance. If we risk a great deal on
   the fidelity or veracity of a man, we have a right to bind him by the
   solemnity of an oath; or if it is of great importance that others
   should confide in our veracity or fidelity, it may be right to give
   them the assurance which an oath is suited and intended to afford.

   As to the Scriptural examples, by far the greater number of the oaths
   recorded in the Bible, and that with the implied approbation of God,
   are of a non-judicial character. Abraham swore to Abimelech. (Gen. xxi.
   23.) Abraham made his servant swear to him. (Gen. xxiv. 3.) Isaac and
   Abimelech interchanged oaths. (Gen. xxvi. 31.) Jacob caused Joseph to
   swear not to bury him in Egypt. (xlvii. 31.) Joseph exacted a similar
   oath from his brethren. So we read of David's swearing to Saul, and to
   Jonathan, of Jonathan's to David, and of David's to Shimei. Such
   private oaths seem at times to have been prescribed in the Mosaic law.
   In Exodus xxii. 19, it is said, if a man deliver any animal to his
   neighbour for safe-keeping, and it die on his hands, "then shall an
   oath of the Lord be between them both, that he hath not put his hand
   unto his neighbour's goods." In the New Testament we find the Apostle
   frequently appealing to God to witness to truth of what he said (Rom.
   i. 9; Phil. i. 8; 1 Thess. ii. 10); doing this also in the most formal
   manner, as in 2 Corinthians i. 23, "I call God for a record upon my
   soul."

   Augustine's rule on this subject is good: "Quantum ad me pertinet,
   juro, sed quantum mihi videtur, magna necessitate compulsus." [295] The
   multiplicity of oaths is a great evil. The rapid irreverent
   administration of them is profane.

   The Form of an Oath.

   Under the Old Testament, in voluntary oaths the usual fona was, "The
   Lord do so to me, and more also." (Ruth i. 17; 2 Sam. iii. 9, 35; l
   Kings ii. 23; 2 Kings vi. 31.) Or simply,"As the Lord liveth." (Ruth
   iii. 13; Judges viii. 19; 2 Sam. ii. 27, Jer. xxxviii. 16); or as it is
   in Jeremiah xlii. 5. "The Lord be a true and faithful witness." In
   judicial proceedings the oath consisted in a simple assent to the
   adjuration, which assent was expressed in Hebrew by 'tv, and in Greek
   by su eipas. The form is a matter of indifference; any form of words
   which implies an appeal to God as a witness is an oath. In swearing,
   the right hand was usually elevated towards heaven. Genesis xiv. 22,
   "Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the
   Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth." Hence "to
   lift up the hand" was to swear. (See Deut. xxxii. 40; Ex. vi. 8 (in the
   Hebrew); Ezek. xx. 5.) Lifting up the hand was evidently intended to
   intimate that the juror appealed to the God of heaven. Among Christians
   it is usual to put the hand upon the Bible, to indicate that the oath
   is taken in the name of the God of the Bible, and that the judgment
   invoked in case of perjury is that which the Bible denounces against
   false swearing. Kissing the Bible, another usual part of the ceremonial
   of an oath, is an expression of faith in the Bible as the word of God.
   There is nothing unseemly or superstitious in this. On the contrary,
   instead of appealing to the God of nature, it is most appropriate that
   the Christian should appeal to the God of the Bible, who, through Jesus
   Christ, is our reconciled God and Father.

   Rules which determine the Interpretation and Obligation of an Oath.

   An oath must be interpreted according to the plain natural meaning of
   the words, or the sense in which they are understood by the party to
   whom the oath is given or by whom it is imposed. This is a plain
   dictate of honesty. If the juror understands the oath in a sense
   different from that attached to it by the party to whom it is given,
   the whole service is a deceit and mockery. The commander of whom Paley
   speaks, who swore to the garrison of a besieged town that if they
   surrendered, a drop of their blood should not be shed, and buried them
   all alive, was guilty, not only of perjury, but also of dastardly and
   cruel mockery. The animus imponentis, as is universally admitted, must
   therefore determine the interpretation of an oath. It was the fact that
   the results inculcated the lawfulness of mental reservation, which more
   than anything else made them an abomination in the eyes of all
   Christendom. It was this which furnished the sharpest thong to the
   scourge with which Pascal drove them out of Europe.

   This is a matter about which men who mean to be honest are not always
   sufficiently careful. Their conscience is satisfied if what they say
   will bear an interpretation consistent with the truth, although the
   obvious sense is not true. [296]

   No oath is obligatory which binds a man to do what is unlawful or
   impossible. The sin lies in taking such an oath, not in breaking it.
   The reason of this rule is, that no man can bring himself under an
   obligation to commit a sin. Herod was not bound to keep his oath to the
   daughter of Herodias when she demanded the head of John the Baptist.
   Neither were the forty men, who had bound themselves with "an oath of
   execration" to kill Paul. But an oath voluntarily taken to do what is
   lawful and within the power of the juror binds the conscience, (a.)
   Even when fulfilling it involves injury to the temporal interests of
   the juror. The Bible pronounces the man blessed who "sweareth to his
   own hurt and changeth not." (Ps. xv. 4.) (b.) When the oath is obtained
   by deceit or violence. In the latter case the juror makes a choice of
   evils. He swears to make a sacrifice to save himself from what he
   dreads more than the loss of what he promises to relinquish. This may
   often be a hard case. But such is the solemnity of an oath, and such
   the importance of its inviolable sanctity being preserved, that it is
   better to suffer injustice than that an oath should be broken. The case
   where an oath is obtained by deceit is more difficult, for when such
   deceit is practised the juror did not intend to assume the obligation
   which the oath imposes. He might, therefore, plausibly argue that if he
   did not intend to assume an obligation, it was not assumed. But, on the
   other hand, the principle involved in the commercial maxim, caveat
   emptor, applies to oaths. A man is bound to guard against deception;
   and if deceived he must take the consequences. Besides, those to whom
   the oath is given trust to it, and act upon it, and, in a certain sense
   at least, acquire rights under it. The Scriptures, however, in this as
   in all other cases, are our safest guide. When the Israelites conquered
   Canaan, the Gibeonites who dwelt in the land, sent delegates to Joshua
   pretending that they were from a distant country, and "Joshua made
   peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the
   princes of the congregation sware unto them." When the deception was
   discovered, the people clamoured for their extermination. "But all the
   princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the
   Lord God of Israel: now, therefore, we may not touch them." (Joshua ix.
   15, 19.) This oath, as appears from 2 Samuel xxi. 1, was sanctioned by
   God and the people were punished for violating it.

   Romish Doctrine.

   The principle on which the authorities of the Roman Church assume the
   right to free men from the obligation of their oaths, is that no man
   can bind himself to do what is sinful. It is the prerogative of the
   Church to decide what is sinful. If therefore the Churoh decide that an
   oath to obey a sovereign disobedient to the Pope, to preserve inviolate
   a safe conduct, or to keep faith with heretics or infidels is sinful,
   the obligation of every such oath ceases as soon as the judgment of the
   Church is rendered.

   In answer to the question, "Cui competit potestas dispensandi super
   juramento?" the Romish theologians answer: "Principaliter competit
   summo Pontifici; non tamen nisi ex rationabili causa, quia dispensat in
   jure alieno: competit etiam jure ordinario Episcopis, non Parochis.
   Requirit autem hæc dispensatio potestatem jurisdictionis majoris."
   [297] The casuists, on this as on all other practical subjects, go into
   the most minute details and subtle distinctions. Dens, for example, in
   the section above quoted, gives no less than ten conditions under which
   the obligation of an oath ceases. To the question: "Quibus modis potest
   cessare obligatio juramenti promissorii?" he answers: "1. Irritatione.
   2. Dispensatione et relaxatione. 3. Commutatione. 4. Materiæ mutatione
   vel subtracione. 5. Cessante fine totali complete. 6. Ratione
   conditionis non adimpletæ. 7. Cessante principali obligatione cessat
   juramentum pure accessorium. 8. Non acceptatione, et condonatione, seu
   remissione. 9. Si juramentum incipiat vergere in deteriorem exitum, vel
   in præjudicium boni communis, vel etiam alicujus particularis, v. g.
   quis juravit occultare furtum alterius, sed inde alter liberius
   prolabitur ad alia furta: item cessat juramentum, quando directe est
   majoris boni impeditivum. 10. Denique cessat obligatio juramenti, licet
   improprie, per adimpletionem sive totalem solutionem rei juratæ: et e
   contra dicitur cessare ab initio, quia juramentum fuit nullum, sive
   quia nullam ab initio obligationem produxit." Number nine opens a very
   wide door: the last clause especially seems to teach that a promissory
   oath ceases to bind whenever it is expedient to break it. [298]

   The whole Romish system is the masterpiece of the "wisdom of the
   world." As many promissory oaths are not obligatory, it would seem to
   be wise, instead of leaving the question of their continued obligation
   to be decided by the individual juror, who is so liable to be unduly
   biased, to refer the matter to some competent authority. This would
   tend to prevent false judgments, to satisfy the conscience of the juror
   and the public mind. And as the question is a matter of morals and
   religion, it would seem to be proper that the decision should be
   referred to the organs of the Church. Rome makes all these seemingly
   wise arrangements. But as God has exalted no human authority over the
   individual conscience, as no man can delegate his responsibility to
   another, but every man must answer to God for himself, it is clear that
   no such arrangement can be consistent with the divine will. Again, if
   it were true that the Church were divinely guided so as to be
   infallible in its judgment, this tremendous power over the consciences
   of men might be safely intrusted to it; but as in fact the
   representatives of the Church are men of like passions as other men,
   and no more infallible than their fellows, Romanism is nothing more
   than a device to put the prerogatives and power of God into the hands
   of sinful men. History teaches how this usurped power has been used.

   Vows.

   Vows are essentially different from oaths, in that they do not involve
   any appeal to God as a witness, or any imprecation of his displeasure.
   A vow is simply a promise made to God. The conditions of a lawful vow
   are, first, as to the object, or matter of the vow, (1.) That it be
   something in itself lawful. (2.) That it be acceptable to God. (3.)
   That it be within our own power. (4.) That it be for our spiritual
   edification. Secondly, as to the person making the vow, (1.) That he be
   competent; that is, that he have sufficient intelligence, and that he
   be sui juris. A child is not competent to make a vow; neither is one
   under authority so that he has not liberty of action as to the matter
   vowed. (2.) That he act with due deliberation and solemnity; for a vow
   is an act of worship. (3.) That it be made voluntarily, and observed
   cheerfully.

   All these principles are recognized in the Bible. "When thou shalt vow
   a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the
   Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in
   thee. But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.
   That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform: even a
   freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the Lord thy God,
   which thou hast promised with thy mouth." (Deut. xxiii. 21-23.) In
   Numbers xxx. 3-5, it is enacted that if a woman in her father's house
   make a vow, and her father disallow it, it shall not stand, "and the
   Lord shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her." The same
   rule is applied to wives and to children, on the obvious principle,
   that where the rights of others are concerned, we are not at liberty to
   disregard them.

   All the conditions requisite to the lawfulness of a vow, may be
   included under the old formula, "judicium in vovente, justitia in
   objecto, veritas in mente." There are two conditions insisted upon by
   Romanists to which Protestants do not consent. The one is that a vow
   must be "de meliore bono," i.e., for a greater good. If a man vows to
   devote himself to the priesthood, to make a pilgrimage, to found a
   church, or to become a monk, the thing vowed is not only good in
   itself, but it is better than its opposite. The other condition is,
   that the thing vowed must be in itself not obligatory, so that the
   sphere of duty is enlarged by the vow. These conditions are included in
   those laid down by Dens. [299] He says: "Quinque ex causis provenire,
   quod aliquid non sit apta materia voti; 1º. quia est impossibile; 2º.
   quia est necessarium; 3º. quia est illicitum; 4º. quia est indifferens
   vel inutile; 5º. quia non est bonum melius." The two conditions just
   specified no doubt concur in many vows acceptable to God, but they are
   not essential. A man may vow to do what he is bound to do, as is the
   case with every man who consecrates himself to God in baptism. Nor is
   it necessary that the thing vowed should be in its own nature a greater
   good. A man may bind himself to a work out of gratitude to God, which
   in its own nature is indifferent. This was the case with many of the
   particulars included in the vows of the Nazarite. There was no special
   virtue in abstaining from wine, vinegar, grapes moist or dry, or in
   letting "the locks of the hair of his head grow." (Num. vi. 3-5.) The
   Romish doctrine on this subject is connected with the distinction which
   Papists make between precepts and counsels. The former bind the
   conscience, the others do not. There is special merit, according to
   their theory, in doing more than is commanded. No man is commanded to
   devote himself to a life of obedience, celibacy, and poverty, but if he
   does, so much the better; he has the greater merit.

   As usual, the Romanists connect so many subordinate rules with the
   general principles laid down that they are explained away, or rendered
   of little use. Thus the rule that the matter of a vow must be "bonum
   melius," is explained to mean better in itself considered, and not
   better in relation to the person making the vow. Thus it may be very
   injurious to a man's spiritual interests to be bound by monastic vows;
   nevertheless, as the monastic life is in itself a "bonum melius," the
   vows once taken are obligatory. Then as to the condition of
   possibility; if possible as to the substance, but impossible as to the
   accidents, the vow is binding. Thus if a man vows to make a pilgrimage
   to Jerusalem on his knees, although going on his knees be impossible,
   he is bound to go in some way.

   Lawfulness of Vows.

   On this subject there is little or no diversity of opinion. That they
   are lawful appears, --

   1. From their nature. A vow is simply a promise made to God. It may be
   an expression of gratitude for some signal favour already given, or a
   pledge to manifest such gratitude for some blessing desired should God
   see fit to grant it. Thus Jacob vowed that if God would bring him back
   in peace to his father's house, he would consecrate to Him the tenth of
   all that he possessed. The Bible, and especially the Psalms, abound
   with examples of such vows of thank-offerings to God. Even Calvin,
   notwithstanding his deep sense of the evils entailed on the Church by
   the abuse of vows by the Romanists, says, "Ejusmodi vota hodie quoque
   nobis in usu esse possunt, quoties nos Dominus vel a clade aliqua, vel
   a morbo difficili, vel ab alio quovis discrimine eripuit. Neque enim a
   pii hominis officio tunc abhorret, votivam oblationem, velut sollenne
   recognitionis symbolum, Deo consecrare: ne ingratus erga ejus
   benignitatem videatur." [300] He also recognized the propriety of vows
   of abstinence from indulgences which we have found to be injurious; and
   also of vows the end of which is to render us more mindful of duties
   which we may be inclined to neglect. In all such vows there is a devout
   recognition of God, and of our obligations to Him. They, therefore, as
   well as oaths, are acts of worship. They are regarded as such in the
   Symbols of the Reformed Churches. Thus, for example, the "Declaratio
   Thoruniensis" [301] includes, under acts of worship, "jusjurandum
   legitimum, quo Deum cordium inspectorem, ut veritatis testem, et
   falsitatis vindicem appellamus. Denique votum sacrum, quo vel nos
   ipsos, vel res aut actiones nostras Deo, velut sacrificium quoddam
   spirituale, consecramus et devovemus."

   2. The fact that the Scriptures contain so many examples of vows, and
   so many injunctions to their faithful observance, is a sufficient proof
   that in their place, and on proper occasions, they are acceptable in
   the sight of God.

   3. This is further evident from the fact that the baptismal covenant is
   of the nature of a vow. In that ordinance we solemnly promise to take
   God the Father to be our Father, Jesus Christ his Son to be our
   Saviour, the Holy Ghost to be our Sanctifier, and his word to be the
   rule of our faith and practice. The same is true of the sacrament of
   the Lord's Supper; in that ordinance we consecrate ourselves to Christ
   as the purchase of his blood, and vow to be faithful to Him to the end.
   The same thing is true also of the marriage covenant, because the
   promises therein made are not merely between the parties, but by both
   parties to the contract, to God.

   But while the lawfulness of vows is to be admitted, they should not be
   unduly multiplied, or made on slight occasions, or allowed to interfere
   with our Christian liberty. Not only have the violation of these rules
   been productive of the greatest evils in the Church of Rome, but
   Protestant Christians also have often reduced themselves to a miserable
   state of bondage by the multiplication of vows. When such cases occur,
   it is healthful and right for the Christian to assert his liberty. As a
   believer cannot rightfully be brought into bondage to men, so neither
   can he rightfully make a slave of himself. He should remember that God
   prefers mercy to sacrifice; that no service is acceptable to Him which
   is injurious to us; that He does not require us to observe promises
   which we ought never to have made and that vows about trifles are
   irreverent, and should neither be made nor regarded, but should be
   repented of as sins. Even Thomas Aquinas says, "Vota quæ sunt de rebus
   vanis et inutilibus, sunt magis deridenda, quam servanda." [302]

   Monastic Vows.

   At the time of the Reformation the doors of all the monasteries in
   lands in which Protestants had the power, were thrown open, and their
   inmates declared free in the sight of God and man, from the vows by
   which they had hitherto been bound. Protestants did not maintain that
   there was anything intrinsically wrong in a man, or a company of men
   renouncing the ordinary avocations of life, and devoting himself or
   themselves to a religious life. Nor did they object to such men living
   together and conforming to a prescribed rule of discipline; nor did
   they deny that such institutions under proper regulations, might be,
   and in fact had been of great and manifold utility. They had been
   places of security for those who had no taste for the conflicts by
   which all Christendom was so long agitated. In many cases they were
   places of education and seats of learning. Their objections to them
   were, --

   1. That they had been perverted from their original design, and had
   become the sources of evil and not of good, in every part of the
   Church. Instead of its being free to every one to enter and to leave
   these institutions at discretion, those once initiated were bound for
   life by the vows which they had made, and instead of the obligations
   assumed being rational and Scriptural, they were unreasonable and
   unscriptural. Instead of the inmates of these institutions supporting
   themselves by their own labour, they were allowed to live in idleness,
   supported by alms or by the revenues of the convents, which had in many
   cases become enormous. This objection was directed to the very
   principle on which the monastic institutions of the Romish Church were
   founded. On this point Calvin says, "Proinde meminerint lectores,
   fuisse me de monachismo potius quam de monachis loquutum, et ea vitia
   notasse, non quæ in paucorum vita hærent, sed quæ ab ipso vivendi
   instituto separari nequeunt." [303]

   2. To this, however, was added the argument from experience. Monastic
   institutions had become the sources of untold evils to the Church.
   Being in a great measure independent of the ordinary ecclesiastical
   authorities, they were the cause of conflict and agitation. Each order
   was an "imperium in imperio," and one order was arrayed against
   another, as one feudal baron against his fellows. Besides, the
   corruption of manners within the convents as portrayed by Romanists
   themselves, rendered them such a scandal and offence as to justify
   their summary suppression. Much is implied in the answer of Erasmus to
   Frederick the Wise, "Lutherus peccavit in duobus, nempe quod tetigit
   coronam pontificis et ventres monachorum." [304]

   3. Practical evils might be reformed, but Protestants objected that the
   whole system of monkery was founded on the false principle of the merit
   of good works. It was only on the assumption that men could work out a
   righteousness of their own, that they submitted to the self-denial and
   restraints of the monastic life. If, however, as Protestants believe,
   there is no merit in the sight of God in anything fallen men can do,
   and the righteousness of Christ is the sole ground of our acceptance
   with God, the whole ground on which these institutions were defended is
   undermined. To enter a monastery, on the theory of the Romish Church,
   was to renounce the doctrine of salvation by grace. Besides, it was
   also taught that celibacy, obedience, and voluntary poverty, being
   uncommanded, the monastic vow to observe these rules of life, involved
   special merit. This was a twofold error. First, it is an error to
   suppose that there can be any work of supererogation. The law of God
   demanding absolute perfection of heart and life, there can be no such
   thing as going beyond its requirements. And, secondly, it is an error
   to assume that there is any virtue at all in celibacy, monastic
   obedience, or voluntary poverty. These are not "meliora bona" in the
   Romish sense of the words. In this view, also, monastic vows are
   antichristian.

   4. A fourth reason urged by Protestants for pronouncing monastic vows
   invalid, was that they were unlawful, not only for the reason just
   assigued, but also because they were contrary to the law of Christ. No
   man has the right to swear away his liberty; to reduce himself to a
   state of absolute subjection to a fellow-mortal. To his own master he
   must stand or fail. The vow of obedience made by every monk or nun was
   a violation of the apostolic injunction, "Be not ye the servants of
   men." The same remark is applicable to the vow of celibacy. No one has
   a right to take that vow; because celibacy is right or wrong according
   to circumstances. It may be a sin, and therefore no such vow can bind
   the conscience.

   5. Monastic life, instead of being subservient to holiness of heart,
   was in the vast majority of cases injurious to the monks themselves.
   The fearful language of Jerome is full of instruction: "O quoties ego
   ipso in eremo constitutus in illa vasta solitudine, quæ exusta solis
   ardoribus, horridum monachis præstat habitaculum, putavi me Romanis
   interesse deliciis. . . . . Ille igitur ego, qui ob Gehennæ metum tali
   me carcere ipse damnaveram, scorpiorum tantum socius et ferarum, sæpe
   choris intereram puellarum. Pallebant ora jejuniis, et mens desideriis
   æstuabat in frigido corpore, et ante hominem sua jam in carne
   præmortuum, sola libidinum incendia bulliebant." [305] In the day when
   that which is hidden shall be made manifest, there will probably be no
   such fearful revelation of self-torture as that made by unveiling the
   secret life of the inmates of monastic institutions. They are in
   necessary conflict with the laws of nature and with the law of God.

   The Protestants adopted the rule announced by Calvin: [306] "Omnia non
   legitima nec rite concepta, ut apud Deum nihili sunt, sic nobis irrita
   esse debere." For, he immediately adds, as in human contracts only that
   continues binding, which he to whom the promise is made wishes us to
   observe, so it is to be supposed that we are not bound to do what God
   does not wish us to do, simply because we have promised Him to do it.
   On these grounds the Reformers with one accord pronounced all monastic
   vows to be null and void. Thus the Gospel became a proclamation of
   liberty to the captive, and the opening of the prison to those who were
   bound.

   § 8. The Fourth Commandment.

   Its Design.

   The design of the fourth commandment was, (1.) To commemorate the work
   of creation. The people were commanded to remember the Sabbath-day and
   to keep it holy, because in six days God had made the heavens and the
   earth. (2.) To preserve alive the knowledge of the only living and true
   God. If heaven and earth, that is, the universe, were created, they
   must have had a creator; and that creator must be extramundane,
   existing before, out of, and independently of the world. He must be
   almighty, and infinite in knowledge, wisdom, and goodness; for all
   these attributes are necessary to account for the wonders of the
   heavens and the earth. So long, therefore, as men believe in creation,
   they must believe in God. This accounts for the fact that so much
   stress is laid upon the right observance of the Sabbath. Far more
   importance is attributed to that observance than to any merely
   ceremonial institution. (3.) This command was designed to arrest the
   current of the outward life of the people and to turn their thoughts to
   the unseen and spiritual. Men are so prone to be engrossed by the
   things of this world that it was, and is, of the highest importance
   that there should be one day of frequent recurrence on which they were
   forbidden to think of the things of the world, and forced to think of
   the things unseen and eternal. (4.) It was intended to afford time for
   the instruction of the people, and for the public and special worship
   of God. (5.) By the prohibition of all servile labour, whether of man
   or beast, it was designed to secure recuperative rest for those on whom
   the primeval curse had fallen: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
   bread." (6.) As a day of rest and as set apart for intercourse with
   God, it was designed to be a type of that rest which remains for the
   people of God, as we learn from Psalms xcv. 11, as expounded by the
   Apostle in Hebrews iv. 1-10. (7.) As the observance of the Sabbath had
   died out among the nations, it was solemnly reenacted under the Mosaic
   dispensation to be a sign of the covenant between God and the children
   of Israel. They were to be distinguished as the Sabbath-keeping people
   among all the nations of the earth, and as such were to be the
   recipients of God's special blessings. Exodus xxxi. 13, "Verily my
   Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout
   your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth
   sanctify you." And in verses 16, 17, "Wherefore the children of Israel
   shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their
   generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the
   children of Israel forever." And in Ezekiel xx. 12, it is said,
   "Moreover, also, I gave them my Sabbaths, to be a sign between me and
   them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."

   The Sabbath was instituted from the Beginning, and is of Perpetual
   Obligation.

   1. This may be inferred from the nature and design of the institution.
   It is a generally recognized principle, that those commands of the Old
   Testament which were addressed to the Jews as Jews and were founded on
   their peculiar circumstances and relations, passed away when the Mosaic
   economy was abolished; but those founded on the immutable nature of
   God, or upon the permanent relations of men, are of permanent
   obligation. There are many such commands which bind men as men; fathers
   as fathers; children as children; and neighbours as neighbours. It is
   perfectly apparent that the fourth commandment belongs to this latter
   class. It is important for all men to know that God created the world,
   and therefore is an extramundane personal being, infinite in all his
   perfections. All men need to be arrested in their worldly career, and
   called upon to pause and to turn their thoughts Godward. It is of
   incalculable importance that men should have time and opportunity for
   religious instruction and worship. It is necessary for all men and
   servile animals to have time to rest and recuperate their strength. The
   daily nocturnal rest is not sufficient for that purpose, as
   physiologists assure us, and as experience has demonstrated. Such is
   obviously the judgment of God.

   It appears, therefore, from the nature of this commandment as moral,
   and not positive or ceremonial, that it is original and universal in
   its obligation. No man assumes that the commands, "Thou shalt not
   kill," and "Thou shalt not steal," were first announced by Moses, and
   ceased to be obligatory when the old economy passed away. A moral law
   is one that binds from its own nature. It expresses an obligation
   arising either out of our relations to God or out of our permanent
   relations to our fellow-men. It binds whether formally enacted or not.
   There are no doubt positive elements in the fourth commandment as it
   stands in the Bible. It is positive that a seventh, and not a sixth or
   eighth part of our time should be consecrated to the public service of
   God. It is positive that the seventh rather than any other day of the
   week should be thus set apart. But it is moral that there should be a
   day of rest and cessation from worldly avocations. It is of moral
   obligation that God and his great works should be statedly remembered.
   It is a moral duty that the people should assemble for religious
   instruction and for the united worship of God. All this was obligatory
   before the time of Moses, and would have been binding had he never
   existed. All that the fourth commandment did was to put this natural
   and universal obligation into a definite form.

   2. The original and universal obligation of the law of the Sabbath may
   be inferred from its having found a place in the decalogue. As all the
   other commandments in that fundamental revelation of the duties of men
   to God and to their neighbour, are moral and permanent in their
   obligation, it would be incongruous and unnatural if the fourth should
   be a solitary exception. This argument is surely not met by the answer
   given to it by the advocates of the opposite doctrine. The argument
   they say is valid only on the assumption "that the Mosaic law, because
   of its divine origin, is of universal and permanent authority." [307]
   May it not be as well said, If the command, "Thou shalt not steal," be
   still in force, the whole code of the Mosaic law must be binding? The
   fourth commandment is read in all Christian churches, whenever the
   decalogue is read, and the people are taught to say, "Lord, have mercy
   upon us, and incline our hearts to keep this law."

   3. Another argument is derived from the penalty attached to the
   violation of this commandment. "Ye shall keep the Sabbath, therefore,
   for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put
   to death." (Ex. xxxi. 14.) The violation of no merely ceremonial or
   positive law was visited with this penalty. Even the neglect of
   circumcision, although it involved the rejection of both the Abrahamic
   and the Mosaic covenant, and necessarily worked the forfeiture of all
   the benefits of the theocracy, was not made a capital offence. The law
   of the Sabbath by being thus distinguished was raised far above the
   level of mere positive enactments. A character was given to it, not
   only of primary importance, but also of special sanctity.

   4. We accordingly find that in the prophets as well as in the
   Pentateuch, and the historical books of the Old Testament, the Sabbath
   is not only spoken of as "a delight," but also its faithful observance
   is predicted as one of the characteristics of the Messianic period.
   Thus Isaiah says, "If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from
   doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a Delight, the
   Holy of the Lord, Honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own
   ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words:
   then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to
   ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage
   of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." (Is.
   lviii. 13, 14.) Gesenius is very much puzzled at this. The prophets
   predicted that under the Messiah the true religion was to be extended
   to the ends of the earth. But the public worship of God was by the
   Jewish law tied to Jerusalem. That law was neither designed nor adapted
   for a universal religion. To those, therefore, who believe that the
   Sabbath was a temporary Mosaic institution to pass away when the old
   economy was abolished, it is altogether incongruous that a prophet
   should represent the faithful observance of the Sabbath as one of the
   chief blessings and glories of the Messiah's reign.

   These considerations, apart from historical evidence or the direct
   assertion of the Scriptures, are enough to create a strong, if not an
   invincible presumption, that the Sabbath was instituted from the
   beginning, and was designed to be of universal and permanent
   obligation. Whatever law had a temporary ground or reason for its
   enactment, was temporary in its obligation. Where the reason of the law
   is permanent the law itself is permanent.

   The greater number of Christian theologians who deny all this still
   admit the Sabbath to be a most wise and beneficent institution. Nay,
   many of them go so far as to represent its violation, as a day of
   religious rest, as a sin. This, however, is a concession that the
   reason for the command is permanent, and that if God has not required
   its observance, the Church or State is bound to do so.

   Direct Evidence of the ante-Mosaic institution of the Sabbath.

   Presumptive evidence may be strong enough to coerce assent. The
   advocates of the early institution of the Sabbath, however, are not
   limited to that kind of evidence. There is direct proof of the fact for
   which they contend, --

   1. In Genesis ii. 3, it is said, "God blessed the seventh day, and
   sanctified it; because that in it he had rested from all his work which
   God created and made." It is indeed easy to say that this is a
   prolepsis; that the passage assigns the reason why in the times of
   Moses, God selected the seventh, rather than any other day of the week
   to be the Sabbath. This is indeed possible, but it is not probable. It
   is an unnatural interpretation which no one would adopt except to suit
   a purpose. The narrative purports to be an account of what God did at
   the time of the creation. When the earth was prepared for his
   reception, God created man on the sixth day, and rested from the work
   of creation on the seventh, and set apart that day as a holy day to be
   a perpetual memorial of the great work which He had accomplished. [308]
   This is the natural sense of the passage, from which only the strongest
   reasons would authorize us to depart. All collateral reasons, however,
   are on its side.

   In support of this interpretation the authority of the most impartial,
   as well as the most competent interpreters might be quoted. Grotius did
   not believe in the perpetuity of the Sabbath, yet he admits that in
   Genesis ii. 3, it is said that the seventh day was set apart as holy
   from the creation. He assumes, on the authority, as he says, of many
   learned Hebrews, that there were two precepts concerning the Sabbath.
   The one given at the beginning enjoined that every seventh day should
   be remembered as a memorial of the creation. And in this sense, he
   says, the Sabbath was doubtless observed by the patriarchs, Enoch,
   Noah, Abraham, etc. The second precept was given from Mount Sinai when
   the Sabbath was made a memorial of the deliverance of the Israelites
   from Egyptian bondage. This latter law enjoined rest from labour on the
   Sabbath. The Scriptural argument which he urges in support of this
   theory, is, that in all the accounts of the journeyings of the
   patriarchs, we never read of their resting on the seventh day; whereas
   after the law given from Mount Sinai, this reference to the resting of
   the people on the Sabbath is of constant occurrence. [309]

   Delitzsch says "Hengstenberg understands Genesis ii. 3, as though it
   were written from the stand-point of the Mosaic law, as if it were
   said, God for this reason in after times blessed the seventh day; which
   scarcely needs a refutation. God himself, the Creator, celebrated a
   Sabbath immediately after the six days work, and because his
   sabbatismos could become the sabbatismos of his creatures, He made for
   that purpose the seventh day, by his blessing, to be a perennial
   fountain of refreshment, and clothed that day by hallowing it with
   special glory for all time to come." [310]

   Baumgarten in his comment on this verse says the separation of this day
   from all others was made so that "the return of this blessed and holy
   day should be to him a memorial, and participation of the divine rest."
   [311] And Knobel, one of the most pronounced of the rationalistic
   commentators, says, "That the author of Genesis makes the distinction
   of the seventh day coeval with the creation, although the carrying out
   of the purpose thus intimated was deferred to the time of Moses.
   Nothing is known of any ante-Mosaic celebration of the Sabbath." [312]

   2. Apart from the fact that the reason for the Sabbath existed from the
   beginning, there is direct historical evidence that the hebdomadal
   division of time prevailed before the deluge. Noah in Genesis viii. 10,
   12, is said twice to have rested seven days. And again in the time of
   Jacob, as appears from Genesis xxix. 27, 28, the division of time into
   weeks was recognized as an established usage. As seven is not an equal
   part either of a solar year or of a lunar month, the only satisfactory
   account of this fact, is to be found in the institution of the Sabbath.
   This fact moreover proves not only the original institution, but also
   the continued observance of the seventh day. There must have been
   something to distinguish that day as the close of one period or the
   commencement of another. It is altogether unnatural to account for this
   hebdomadal division by a reference to the worship of the seven planets.
   There is no evidence that the planets were objects of worship at that
   early period of the world, or for a long time afterwards, especially
   among the Shemitic races. Besides, this explanation is inconsistent
   with the account of the creation. The divine authority of the book of
   Genesis is here taken for granted. What it asserts, Christians are
   bound to believe. It is undeniably taught in this book that God created
   the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh. It
   matters not how the word "days" may be explained, we have in the
   history of the creation this hebdomadal division of time. No earlier
   cause for the prevalence of that division can be given, and no other is
   needed, or can reasonably be assumed.

   This division of time into weeks, was not confined to the Hebrew race.
   It was almost universal. This fact proves that it must have had its
   origin in the very earliest period in the history of the world. [313]

   3. That the law of the Sabbath was not first given on Mount Sinai, may
   also be inferred from the fact that it was referred to as a known and
   familiar institution, before that law was promulgated. Thus in the
   sixteenth chapter of Exodus the people were directed to gather on the
   sixth day of the week manna sufficient for the seventh, as on that day
   none would be provided. And more particularly in the twenty-third
   verse, it is said, "To-morrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the
   Lord: bake that which ye will bake to-day, and seethe that ye will
   seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you, to be kept until
   morning." And in the twenty-sixth verse we read, "Six days ye shall
   gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, in it there
   shall be none." There was therefore a Sabbath before the Mosaic law was
   given. Again, the language used in the fourth commandment, "Remember
   the Sabbath day to keep it holy," naturally implies that the Sabbath
   was not a new institution. It was a law given in the beginning, that
   had doubtless in a good measure, especially during their bondage in
   Egypt, become obsolete, which the people were henceforth to remember
   and faithfully observe.

   The objection to the pre-Mosaic institution of the Sabbath founded on
   the silence of Genesis on the subject in the history of the patriarchs,
   is of little weight. It is to be remembered that the book of Genesis,
   comprised in some sixty octavo pages, gives us the history of nearly
   two thousand years. All details not bearing immediately on the design
   of the author were of necessity left out. If nothing was done but what
   is there recorded, the antediluvians and patriarchs lived almost
   entirely without religious observances.

   The Sabbath does not stand alone. It is well known that Moses adopted
   and incorporated with his extended code many of the ancient usages of
   the chosen people. This was the case with sacrifices and circumcision,
   as well as with all the principles of the decalogue. That a particular
   law, therefore, is found in the Mosaic economy is not sufficient
   evidence that it had its origin with the Hebrew Lawgiver, or that it
   ceased to be binding when the old dispensation was abrogated. If the
   reason for the law remains, the law itself remains; and if given to
   mankind before the birth of Moses, it binds mankind. On this point even
   Dr. Paley says: "If the divine command was actually delivered at the
   creation, it was addressed, no doubt, to the whole human species alike,
   and continues, unless repealed by some subsequent revelation, binding
   upon all who come to the knowledge of it." [314] That the law of the
   Sabbath was thus given is, as has been shown, the common opinion even
   of those who deny its perpetual obligation, and therefore its
   permanence cannot reasonably be questioned by those who admit the
   principle that what was given to mankind was meant for mankind.

   4. It is a strong argument in favour of this conclusion, that the law
   of the Sabbath was taken up and incorporated in the new dispensation by
   the Apostles, the infallible founders of the Christian Church. All the
   Mosaic laws founded on the permanent relations of men either to God or
   to their fellows, are in like manner adopted in the Christian Code.
   They are adopted, however, only as to their essential elements. Every
   law, ceremonial are typical, or designed only for the Jews, is
   discarded. Men are still bound to worship God, but this is not now to
   be done especially at Jerusalem, or by sacrifices, or through the
   ministration of priests. Marriage is as sacred now as it ever was, but
   all the special laws regulating its duties, and the penalty for its
   violation, are abrogated. Homicide is as great a crime now as under the
   Mosaic economy, but the old laws about the avenger of blood and cities
   of refuge are no longer in force. The rights of property remain
   unimpaired under the gospel dispensation, but the Jewish laws regarding
   its distribution and protection, are no longer binding. The same is
   true with regard to the Sabbath. We are as much bound to keep one day
   in seven boly unto the Lord, as were the patriarchs or Israelites. This
   law binds all men as men, because given to all mankind, and because it
   is founded upon the nature common to all men, and the relation which
   all men bear to God. The two essential elements of the command are that
   the Sabbath should be a day of rest, that is, of cessation from worldly
   avocations and amusements; and that it should be devoted to the worship
   of God and the services of religion. All else is circumstantial and
   variable. It is not necessary that it should be observed with special
   reference to the deliverance of the Israelites out of Egypt; nor are
   the details as to the things to be done or avoided, or as to the
   penalty for transgression obligatory on us. We are not bound to offer
   the sacrifices required of the Jews, nor are we bound to abstain from
   lighting a fire on that day. In like manner the day of the week is not
   essential. The change from the seventh to the first was circumstantial.
   If made for sufficient reason and by competent authority, the change is
   obligatory. The reason for the change is patent. If the deliverance of
   the Hebrew from the bondage in Egypt should be commemorated, how much
   more the redemption of the world by the Son of God. If the creation of
   the material universe should be kept in perpetual remembrance, how much
   more the new creation secured by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
   the dead. If men wish the knowledge of that event to die out, let them
   neglect to keep holy the first day of the week; if they desire that
   event to be everywhere known and remembered, let them consecrate that
   day to the worship of the risen Saviour. This is God's method for
   keeping the resurrection of Christ, on which our salvation depends, in
   perpetual remembrance.

   This change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the
   week was made not only for a sufficient reason, but also by competent
   authority. It is a simple historical fact that the Christians of the
   apostolic age ceased to observe the seventh, and did observe the first
   day of the week as the day for religious worship. Thus from the
   creation, in unbroken succession, the people of God have, in obedience
   to the original command, devoted one clay in seven to the worship of
   the only living and true God. It is hard to conceive of a stronger
   argument than this for the perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as a
   divine institution. It is not worth while to stop to answer the
   objection, that the record of this uninterrupted observance of the
   Sabbath is incomplete. History does not record everything. We find the
   fountain of this river of mercy in paradise; we trace its course from
   age to age; we see its broad and beneficent flow before our eyes. If
   here and there, in its course through millenniums, it be lost from view
   in a morass or cavern, its reappearance proves its identity and the
   divinity of its origin. The Sabbath is to the nations what the Nile is
   to Egypt, and you might as well call the one a human device as the
   other. Nothing but divine authority and divine power can account for
   the continued observance of this sacred institution from the beginning
   until now.

   5. It is fair to argue the divine origin of the Sabbath from its
   supreme importance. As to the fact of its importance all Christians are
   agreed. They may differ as to the ground on which the obligation to
   observe it rests, and as to the strictness with which the day should be
   observed, but that men are bound to observe it, and that its due
   observance is of essential importance, there is no difference of
   opinion among the churches of Christendom. But if so essential to the
   interests of religion, is it conceivable that God has not enjoined it?
   He has given the world the Church, the Bible, the ministry, the
   sacraments; these are not human devices. And can it be supposed that
   the Sabbath, without which all these divine institutions would be
   measurably inefficient, should be left to the will or wisdom of men?
   This is not to be supposed. That these divinely appointed means for the
   illumination and sanctification of men, are in a great measure without
   effect, where the Sabbath is neglected or profaned, is a matter of
   experience. It is undeniable that the mass of the people are indebted
   to the services of the sanctuary on the Lord's Day, for their religious
   knowledge. Any community or class of men who ignore the Sabbath and
   absent themselves from the sanctuary, as a general thing, become
   heathen. They have little more true religious knowledge than pagans.
   But without such knowledge morality is impossible. Religion is not only
   the lifeblood of morality, so that without the former the latter cannot
   be; but God has revealed his purpose that it shall not be. If men
   refuse to retain Him in their knowledge, He declares that He will give
   them up to a reprobate mind. (Rom. i. 28.) Men do not know what they
   are doing, when by their teaching or example they encourage the neglect
   or profanation of the Lord's Day. We have in the French Communists an
   illustration and a warning of what a community without a Sabbath, i.e.,
   without religion, must ultimately and inevitably become. Irreligious
   men of course sneer at religion and deny its importance, but the Bible
   and experience are against them.

   Objections.

   The general objections against the doctrine that the law of the sabbath
   is of universal and perpetual obligation, have already been
   incidentally considered. Those derived from the New Testament are
   principally the following: --

   1. An objection is drawn from the absence of any express command. No
   such command was needed. The New Testament has no decalogue. That code
   having been once announced, and never repealed, remains in force. Its
   injunctions are not so much categorically repeated, as assumed as still
   obligatory. We find no such words as, "Thou shalt have no other gods
   before me," or "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image." Paul
   says, "I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not
   covet." (Rom. vii. 7.) The law which said "Thou shalt not covet," is in
   the decalogue. Paul does not reënact the command, he simply takes for
   granted that the decalogue is now as ever the law of God.

   2. It is urged not only that there is no positive command on the
   subject, but also that there is a total silence in the New Testament
   respecting any obligation to keep holy one day in seven. Our Lord in
   his Sermon on the Mount, it is said, while correcting the false
   interpretations of the Mosaic law given by the Pharisees, and
   expounding its precepts in their true sense, says nothing of the fourth
   commandment. The same is true of the council in Jerusalem. That council
   says nothing about the necessity of the heathen converts observing a
   Sabbath. But all this may be said of other precepts the obligation of
   which no man questions. Neither our Lord nor the council say anything
   about the worshipping of graven images. Besides, our Lord elsewhere
   does do, with regard to the fourth commandment, precisely what He did
   in the Sermon on the Mount with regard to other precepts of the
   decalogue. He reproved the Pharisees for their false interpretation of
   that commandment, without the slightest intimation that the law itself
   was not to remain in force.

   3. Appeal is made to such passages as Colossians ii. 16, "Let no man
   therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day,
   or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath days;" and Romans xiv. 5, "One
   man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth every day alike.
   Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind." Every one knows,
   however, that the apostolic churches were greatly troubled by
   Judaizers, who insisted that the Mosaic law continued in force, and
   that Christians were bound to conform to its prescriptions with regard
   to the distinction between clean and unclean meats, and its numerous
   feast days, on which all labour was to be intermitted. These were the
   false teachers and this was the false doctrine against which so much of
   St. Paul's epistles was directed. It is in obvious reference to these
   men and their doctrines that such passages as those cited above were
   written. They have no reference to the weekly Sabbath, which had been
   observed from the creation, and which the Apostles themselves
   introduced and perpetuated in the Christian Church.

   4. It is also frequently said that a weekly Sabbath is out of keeping
   with the spirit of the Gospel, which requires the consecration of the
   whole life and of all our time to God. With the Christian, it is said,
   every day is holy, and one day is not more holy than another. It is not
   true, however, that the New Testament requires greater consecration to
   God than the Old. The Gospel has many advantages over the Mosaic
   dispensation, but that is not one of them. It was of old, even from the
   beginning, required of all men that they should love God with all the
   heart, with all the mind, and with all the strength; and their
   neighbour as themselves. More than this the Gospel demands of no man If
   it consists with the spirituality of the Church that believers should
   not neglect the assembling themselves together; and that they should
   have a stated ministry, sacramental rites, and the power of
   excommunication, and all this by Divine appointment; then it is hard to
   see why the consecration of one day in seven to the service of God,
   should be inconsistent with its spiritual character. So long as we are
   in the body, religion cannot be exclusively a matter of the heart. It
   must have its institutions and ordinances; and any attempt to dispense
   with these would be as unreasonable and as futile as for the soul, in
   this our present state of existence, to attempt to do without the body.

   5. Another ground is often taken on this subject. The importance of the
   Sabbath is not denied. The obligation to keep it holy is admitted. It
   is declared to be sinful to engage in worldly avocations or amusements
   on that day; but it is denied that this obligation to consecrate the
   day to God rests upon any divine command. It is denied that the
   original sanctification of the seventh day at the creation binds all
   men to keep one day in seven holy to the Lord. It is maintained that
   the fourth commandment, both as to its essence and as to its accidents
   is abrogated; and, therefore, that there is no express command of God
   now in force requiring us to keep holy the Sabbath. The obligation is
   either self-imposed, or it is imposed by the Church. The Church
   requires its members to observe the Lord's Day, as it requires them to
   observe Christmas or Good Friday; and Christians, it is said, are bound
   to obey the Church, as citizens are bound to obey the state. But
   Protestants deny that the Church power to make laws to bind the
   conscience. That is the prerogative of God. If the Church may do it in
   one case it may another; and we should be made the servants of men. It
   is by this simple principle, that men are bound to obey the Church,
   that Rome has effectually despoiled all who acknowledge her authority
   of the liberty wherewith Christ has made his people free.

   Most of the modern evangelical theologians in Germany say that the
   obligation to observe the Sabbath is self-imposed. That is, that every
   man, and especially every Christian, is bound to do all he can to
   promote the interests of religion and the good of society. The
   consecration of the Lord's Day to the worship of God is eminently
   conducive to these ends; therefore men are bound to keep it holy. But
   an obligation self-imposed is limited to self. One man thinks it best
   to devote Sunday to religion; another that it should be kept as a day
   of relaxation and amusement. One man's liberty cannot be judged by
   another man's conscience. Expediency can never be the ground of a
   universal and permanent obligation. The history of the Church proves
   that no such views of duty are adequate to coerce the conscience and
   govern the lives of men. The Sabbath is not in fact consecrated to
   religion, where its divine authority is denied. The churches may be
   more or less frequented, but the day is principally devoted to
   amusement. A German theologian [315] says that the doctrine that the
   religious observance of the Sabbath rests on an express divine command,
   "prevails throughout the whole English-speaking part of Christendom,"
   and that in the Evangelical Church in Germany, some either from a too
   legal view of Christianity, or from servile subjection to the letter of
   the Bible, or impressed by the solemn stillness of an English Sunday as
   contrasted with its profanation elsewhere, have ever been inclined to
   the same views. Although this writer, the representative of a large
   class, asserts his Christian liberty to observe one day above another,
   or all days alike, he admits that the religious observance of the
   Lord's Day is not a matter of indifference; on the contrary, he says
   that "its profanation (Verleztung) is a sin." To make a thing sinful,
   however, he says it is not necessary that it should be against an
   express divine command. A Christian's conscience, "guided by the word,
   and enlightened by the Spirit of God," is his rule of conduct.
   Conscience thus guided and enlightened, may enjoin or forbid much for
   which no explicit directions can he found in the Scriptures. No man
   denies all this; but a man's conscience is a guide for himself, and not
   for other people. If we hold fast the fundamental principle of our
   Protestant faith and freedom, "that the Scriptures are the only
   infallible rule of faith and practice," we must be able to plead
   express divine authority for the religious observance of the Lord's
   Day, or allow every man so to keep it or not as he sees fit. To his own
   master he stands or falls; to Him alone is he accountable for the use
   which he makes of his Christian liberty. But as no man is at liberty to
   steal or not to steal as he sees fit, so all "English speaking"
   Christians with one voice say, he is not at liberty to sanctify or
   profane the Sabbath, as he sees fit. He is bound by the primal and
   immutable law given at the creation, to keep one day in seven holy to
   the Lord.

   If it be true that it is peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon race to hold this
   view of the obligation of the Christian Sabbath, then they have special
   reason for profound gratitude to God. God of old said to the
   Israelites, "Hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me
   and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God." That is, it
   shall be for a sign that you are my people. So long as you keep the
   Sabbath holy I will bless you; when you neglect and profane it, your
   blessings shall depart from you. (Jer. xvii. 20-27.) If it be then the
   distinction of Anglo-Saxon Christians, that they are a sabbath-keeping
   people, it is one to be highly prized and sedulously guarded; and in
   this country especially, we should be watchful lest the influx of
   immigrants of other nationalities deprive us of this great distinction
   and its blessings.

   It is a popular objection against the religious observance of the
   Lord's Day, that the labouring classes need it as a day of recreation.
   On this it is obvious to remark, (1.) That there are many grievous
   evils in our modern civilization, but these are not to be healed by
   trampling on the laws of God. If men crowd labourers into narrow
   premises, and overwork them in heated factories six days in the week,
   they cannot atone for that sin by making the Lord's Day a day for
   amusement. (2.) So far from Sunday, as generally spent by the labouring
   class, being a day of refreshment, it is just the reverse. Monday is
   commonly with them the worst day in the week for labour; it is needed
   as a day for recovery from the effects of a misspent Sunday (3.) If the
   labouring classes are provided with healthful places of abode and are
   not overworked, then the best restorative is entire rest from ordinary
   occupations, and directing their thoughts and feelings into new
   channels, by the purifying and elevating offices of religion. This is
   the divinely appointed method of preserving the bodies and souls of men
   in a healthful state, a method which no human device is likely to
   improve.

   How is the Sabbath to be Sanctified?

   It may be said in general terms to be the opinion of the whole Jewish
   and Christian Church, that the sanctification required by God, consists
   not merely in cessation from worldly avocations, but also in the
   consecration of the day to the offices of religion. That this is the
   correct view is proved, (1.) Not only by the general consent of the
   people of God under both dispensations, but also by the constant use of
   the words to "hallow," to "make" or, "keep holy," and to "sanctify."
   The uniform use of such expressions, shows that the day was set apart
   from a common to a sacred use. (2.) From the command to increase the
   number of sacrifices in the temple service, which proves that the day
   was to be religiously observed. (3.) From the design of the
   institution, which from the beginning was religious; the commemoration
   of the work of creation, and after the advent, of the resurrection of
   Christ. (4.) In Leviticus xxiii., a list is given of those lays on
   which there was to be "a holy convocation" of the people; i.e., on
   which the people were to be called together for public worship, and the
   Sabbath is the first given. (5.) The command is constantly repeated
   that the people should be faithfully instructed out of the law, which
   was to be read to them on all suitable occasions. To give opportunity
   for such instruction was evidently one of the principal objects of
   these "holy convocations." (Deut. vi. 6, 7, 17-19; Josh. i. 8.) This
   instruction of the people was made the special duty of the Levites
   (Deut. xxxiii. 10); and of the priests. (Lev. x. 11, comp. Mal. ii. 7.)
   The reading of the law was doubtless a regular part of the service on
   all the days on which the people were solemnly called together for
   religious worship. Thus in Deuteronomy xxxi. 11, 12, we read, "When all
   Israel is come to appear before the Lord thy God in the place which he
   shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their
   hearing. Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and
   thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that
   they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the
   words of this law." Such was the design of the convocation of the
   people. We know from the New Testament that the Scriptures were read
   every Sabbath in the synagogues; and the synagogues were among the
   earliest institutions of the chosen people. 2 Kings iv. 23, at least
   proves that at that period it was customary for the people to resort on
   the Sabbath to holy men for instruction. In Psalm lxxiv. 8, it is said
   of the heathen, "They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the
   land." The word here rendered "synagogues," means "assemblies," but
   burning up "assemblies" can only mean places of assembly; as burning up
   churches, in our mode of expression, can only mean the edifices where
   churches or congregations are accustomed to assemble. What other places
   of assembling the Psalmist could refer to, if synagogues did not then
   exist, it is hard to understand. But admitting that synagogues were not
   common among the Jews until after the exile, which is a very improbable
   supposition, the fact that reading the Scriptures on the Sabbath was an
   established part of the synagogue service, goes far to prove that it
   was a sabbatical service long before the exile. (6.) The place of the
   fourth command in the decalogue; the stress laid upon it in the Old
   Testament; the way in which it is spoken of in the prophets; and the
   Psalms appointed to be used on that day, as for example the
   ninety-second, all show that the day was set apart for religious duties
   from the beginning. (7.) This may also be argued from the whole
   character of the old dispensation. All its institutions were religious;
   they were all intended to keep alive the knowledge of the true God, and
   to prepare the way for the coming of Christ. It would be entirely out
   of keeping with the spirit of the Mosaic economy to assume that its
   most important and solemn holy day was purely secular in its design.
   [316]

   It is admitted that the precepts of the decalogue bind the Church in
   all ages; while the specific details contained in the books of Moses,
   designed to point out the way in which the duty they enjoined was then
   to be performed, are no longer in force. The fifth commandment still
   binds children to obey their parents, but the Jewish law giving fathers
   the power of life and death over their children, is no longer in force.
   The seventh commandment forbids adultery, but the ordeal enjoined for
   the trial of a woman suspected of that crime, is a thing of the past.
   The same principle applies to the interpretation of the fourth
   commandment. The command itself is still in force; the Mosaic laws
   respecting the mode of its observance have passed away with the economy
   to which they belonged. It is unjust therefore to represent the
   advocates of the continued obligation of the fourth commandment, as
   Judaizers. They are no more Judaizers than those who hold that the
   other precepts of the decalogue are still in force.

   There are two rules by which we are to be guided in determining how the
   Sabbath is to be observed, or in deciding what is, and what is not
   lawful on that holy day. The first is, the design of the commandment.
   What is consistent with that design is lawful; what is inconsistent
   with it, is unlawful. The second rule is to be found in the precepts
   and example of our Lord and of his Apostles. The design of the command
   is to be learned from the words in which it is conveyed and from other
   parts of the word of God. From these sources it is plain that the
   design of the institution, as already remarked, was in the main
   twofold. First, to secure rest from all worldly cares and avocations;
   to arrest for a time the current of the worldly life of men, not only
   lest their minds and bodies should be overworked, but also that
   opportunity should be afforded for other and higher interests to occupy
   their thoughts. And secondly, that God should be properly worshipped,
   his word duly studied and taught, and the soul brought under the
   influence of the things unseen and eternal. Any man who makes the
   design of the Sabbath as thus revealed in Scripture his rule of conduct
   on that day, can hardly fail in its due observance. The day is to be
   kept holy unto the Lord. In Scriptural usage to hallow or make holy is
   to set apart to the service of God. Thus the tabernacle, the temple,
   and all its utensils were made holy. In this sense the Sabbath is holy.
   It is to be devoted to the duties of religion, and what is inconsistent
   with such devotion, is contrary to the design of the institution.

   It is however to be remembered that the specific object of the
   Christian Sabbath is the commemoration of the resurrection of Jesus
   Christ from the dead. All the exercises of the day, therefore, should
   have a special reference to Him and to his redeeming work. It is the
   day in which He is to be worshipped, thanked, and praised; in which men
   are to be called upon to accept his offers of grace, and to rejoice in
   the hope of his salvation. It is therefore a day of joy. It is utterly
   incongruous to make it a day of gloom or fasting. In the early Church
   men were forbidden to pray on their knees on that day. They were to
   stand erect, exulting in the accomplishment of the work of God's
   redeeming love.

   The second rule for our guidance is to be found in the precepts and
   example of our Lord. In the first place, He lays down the principle,
   "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath." It is to
   be remarked that Christ says, "the Sabbath was made for man," not for
   the Jews, not for the people of any one age or nation, but for man; for
   man as man, and therefore for all men. Moral duties, however, often
   conflict, and then the lower must yield to the higher. The life, the
   health, and the well-being of a man are higher ends in a given case,
   than the punctilious observance of any external service. This is the
   rule laid down by the prophet (Hosea vi. 6): "I desired mercy, and not
   sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offering." This
   passage our Lord quotes twice in application to the law of the Sabbath,
   and thus establishes the general principle for our guidance, that it is
   right to do on the Sabbath whatever mercy or a due regard to the
   comfort or welfare of ourselves or others requires to be done. Christ,
   therefore, says expressly, "It is lawful to do well (kalos poiein, that
   is, as the context shows to confer benefits) on the Sabbath days."
   (Matt. xii. 12. See also Mark iii. 4.)

   Again, we are told by the same authority, that "the priests in the
   temple profane the Sabbath and are blameless." (Matt. xii. 5.) The
   services of the temple were complicated and laborious, and yet were
   lawful on the Sabbath. On another occasion He said to his accusers, "
   If a man on the Sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses
   should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man
   every whit whole on the Sabbath day? Judge not according to the
   appearance, but judge righteous judgment." (John vii. 23, 24.) From
   this we learn that whatever is necessary for the due celebration of
   religious worship, or for attendance thereon, is lawful on the Sabbath.

   Again in Luke xiv. 1-14, we read, "And it came to pass, as he went into
   the house of one of the chief Pharisees, to eat bread on the Sabbath
   day, that they watched him. And, behold, there was a certain man before
   him, which had the dropsy. And Jesus answering, spake unto the lawyers
   and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? And
   they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him
   go. . . . . And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when
   he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them," etc.,
   etc. This was evidently a large entertainment to which guests were
   "bidden." Christ, therefore, thought right, in the prosecution of his
   work, to attend on such entertainments on the Sabbath.

   The frequency with which our Lord was accused of Sabbath-breaking by
   the Pharisees, proves that his mode of observing that lay was very
   different from theirs, and the way in which He vindicated himself
   proves that He regarded the Sabbath as a divine institution of
   perpetual obligation. It had been easy for Him to say that the law of
   the Sabbath was no longer in force; that He, as Lord of the Sabbath,
   erased it from the decalogue. It may indeed be said that as the whole
   of the Mosaic law was in force until the resurrection of Christ, or
   until the day of Pentecost, the observance of the Sabbath was as a
   matter of course then obligatory, and therefore that Christ so regarded
   it. In answer to this, however, it is obvious to remark, that Christ
   did not hesitate to abrogate those of the laws of Moses which were in
   conflict with the spirit of the Gospel. This He did with the laws
   relating to polygamy and divorce. Under the old dispensation it was
   lawful for a man to have more than one wife; and also to put away a
   wife by giving her a bill of divorcement. Both of these things Christ
   declared should not be allowed under the Gospel. The fact that He dealt
   with the Sabbath just as He did with the fifth, sixth, and seventh
   precepts of the decalogue, which the Pharisees had misinterpreted,
   shows that He regarded the fourth commandment as belonging to the same
   category as the others. His example affords us a safe guide as to the
   way in which the day is to be observed.

   The Sunday Laws.

   It is very common, especially for foreign-born citizens, to object to
   all laws made by the civil governments in this country to prevent the
   public violation of the Lord's Day. It is urged that as there is in the
   United States an entire separation of the Church and State, it is
   contrary to the genius of our institutions, that the observance of any
   religious institution should be enforced by civil laws. It is further
   objected that as all citizens have equal rights irrespective of their
   religious opinions, it is an infringement of those rights if one class
   of the people are required to conform their conduct to the religious
   opinions of another class. Why should Jews, Mohammedans, or infidels be
   required to respect the Christian Sabbath? Why should any man, who has
   no faith in the Sabbath as a divine institution, be prevented from
   doing on that day whatever is lawful on other days? If the State may
   require the people to respect Sunday as a day of rest, why may it not
   require the people to obey any or all other precepts of the Bible?

   State of the Question.

   It is conceded, (1.) That in every free country every man has equal
   rights with his fellow-citizens, and stands on the same ground in the
   eye of the law. (2.) That in the United States no form of religion can
   be established; that no religious test for the exercise of the elective
   franchise or for holding of office can be imposed; and that no
   preference can be given to the members of one religious denomination
   above those of another. (3.) That no man can be forced to contribute to
   the support of any church, or of any religious institution. (4.) That
   every man is at liberty to regulate his conduct and life according to
   his convictions or conscience, provided he does not violate the law of
   the land.

   On the other hand it is no less true, --

   1. That a nation is not a mere conglomeration of individuals. It is an
   organized body. It has of necessity its national life, its national
   organs, national principles of action, national character, and national
   responsibility.

   2. In every free country the government must, in its organization and
   mode of action, be an expression of the mind and will of the people.

   3. As men are rational creatures, the government cannot banish all
   sense and reason from their action, because there may be idiots among
   the people.

   4. As men are moral beings, it is impossible that the government should
   act as though there were no distinction between right and wrong. It
   cannot legalize theft and murder. No matter how much it might enrich
   itself by rapine or by the extermination of other nations, it would
   deserve and receive universal condemnation and execration, should it
   thus set at nought the bonds of moral obligation. This necessity of
   obedience to the moral law on the part of civil governments, does not
   arise from the fact that they are instituted for the protection of the
   lives, rights, and property of the people. Why have our own and other
   Christian nations pronounced the slave-trade piracy and punishable with
   death? Not because it interferes with the rights or liberty of their
   citizens but because it is wicked. Cruelty to animals is visited with
   civil penalties, not on the principle of profit and loss, but because
   it is a violation of the moral law. As it is impossible for the
   individual man to disregard all moral obligations, it is no less
   impossible on the part of civil governments.

   5. Men moreover are religious beings. They can no more ignore that
   element of their nature than their reason or their conscience. It is no
   matter what they may say, or may pretend to think, the law which binds
   them to allegiance to God, is just as inexorable as the law of
   gravitation. They can no more emancipate themselves from the one than
   they can from the other. Morality concerns their duty to their
   fellow-men; religion concerns their duty to God. The latter binds the
   conscience as much as the former. It attends the man everywhere. It
   must influence his conduct as an individual, as the head of a family,
   as a man of business, as a legislator, and as an executive officer. It
   is absurd to say that civil governments have nothing to do with
   religion. That is not true even of a fire company, or of a manufactory,
   or of a banking-house. The religion embraced by the individuals
   composing these associations must influence their corporate action, as
   well as their individual conduct. If a man may not blaspheme, a
   publishing firm may not print and disseminate a blasphemous book. A
   civil government cannot ignore religion any more than physiology. It
   was not constituted to teach either the one or the other, but it must,
   by a like necessity, conform its action to the laws of both. Indeed it
   would be far safer for a government to pass an act violating the laws
   of health, than one violating the religious convictions of its
   citizens. The one would be unwise, the other would be tyrannical. Men
   put up with folly, with more patience than they do with injustice. It
   is vain for the potsherds of the earth to contend with their Maker.
   They must submit to the laws of their nature not only as sentient, but
   also as moral and religious beings. And it is time that blatant
   atheists, whether communists, scientists, or philosophers, should know
   that they are as much and as justly the objects of pity and contempt,
   as of indignation to all right-minded men. By right-minded men, is
   meant men who think, feel, and act according to the laws of their
   nature. Those laws are ordained, administered, and enforced by God, and
   there is no escape from their obligation, or from the penalties
   attached to their violation.

   6. The people of this country being rational, moral, and religious
   beings, the government must be administered on the principles of
   reason, morality, and religion. By a like necessity of right, the
   people being Christians and Protestants, the government must be
   administered according to the principles of Protestant Christianity. By
   this is not meant that the government should teach Christianity, or
   make the profession of it a condition of citizenship, or a test for
   office. Nor does it mean that the government is called upon to punish
   every violation of Christian principle or precept. It is not called
   upon to punish every violation of the moral law. But as it cannot
   violate the moral law in its own action, or require the people to
   violate it, so neither can it ignore Christianity in its official
   action. It cannot require the people or any of its own officers to do
   what Christianity forbids, nor forbid their doing anything which
   Christianity enjoins. It has no more right to forbid that the Bible
   should be taught in the public schools, than it has to enjoin that the
   Koran should be taught in them. If Christianity requires that one day
   in seven should be a day of rest from all worldly avocations, the
   government of a Christian people cannot require any class of the
   community or its own officers to labour on that day, except in cases of
   necessity or mercy. Should it, on the ground that it had nothing to do
   with religion, disregard that day, and direct that the custom-houses,
   the courts of law, and the legislative halls should be open on the
   Lord's Day, and public business be transacted as on other days, it
   would be an act of tyranny, which would justify rebellion. It would be
   tantamount to enacting that no Christian should hold any office under
   the government, or have any share in making or administering the laws
   of the country. The nation would be in complete subjection to a handful
   of imported atheists and infidels.

   Proof that this is a Christian and Protestant Nation.

   The proposition that the United States of America are a Christian and
   Protestant nation, is not so much the assertion of a principle as the
   statement of a fact. That fact is not simply that the great majority of
   the people are Christians and Protestants, but that the organic life,
   the institutions, laws, and official action of the government, whether
   that action be legislative, judicial, or executive, is, and of right
   should be, and in fact must be, in accordance with the principles of
   Protestant Christianity.

   1. This is a Christian and Protestant nation in the sense stated in
   virtue of a universal and necessary law. If you plant an acorn, you get
   an oak. If you plant a cedar, you get a cedar. If a country be settled
   by Pagans or Mohammedans, it develops into a Pagan or Mohammedan
   community. By the same law, if a country be taken possession of and
   settled by Protestant Christians, the nation which they come to
   constitute must be Protestant and Christian. This country was settled
   by Protestants. For the first hundred years of our history they
   constituted almost the only element of our population. As a matter of
   course they were governed by their religion as individuals, in their
   families, and in all their associations for business, and for
   municipal, state, and national government. This was just as much a
   matter of necessity as that they should act morally in all these
   different relations.

   2. It is a historical fact that Protestant Christianity is the law of
   the land, and has been from the beginning. As the great majority of the
   early settlers of the country were from Great Britain, they declared
   that the common law of England should be the law here. But Christianity
   is the basis of the common law of England, and is therefore of the law
   of this country; and so our courts have repeatedly decided. It is so
   not merely because of such decisions. Courts cannot reverse facts.
   Protestant Christianity has been, is, and must be the law of the land,
   Whatever Protestant Christianity forbids, the law of the land (within
   its sphere, i.e., within the sphere in which civil authority may
   appropriately act) forbids. Christianity forbids polygamy and arbitrary
   divorce, Se does the civil law. Romanism forbids divorce even on the
   ground of adultery; Protestantism admits it on that ground. The laws of
   all the states conform in this matter to the Protestant rule.
   Christianity forbids all unnecessary labour, or the transaction of
   worldly business, on the Lord's Day; that day accordingly is a dies
   non, throughout the land. No contract is binding, made on that day. No
   debt can be collected on the Christian Sabbath. If a man hires himself
   for any service by the month or year, he cannot be required to labour
   on that day. All public offices are closed, and all official business
   is suspended. From Maine to Georgia, from ocean to ocean, one day in
   the week, by the law of God and by the law of the land, the people
   rest.

   This controlling Influence of Christianity, is Reasonable and Right.

   lt is in accordance with analogy. If a man goes to China, he expects to
   find the government administered according to the religion of the
   country. If he goes to Turkey, he expects to find the Koran supreme and
   regulating all public action. If he goes to a Protestant country, he
   has no right to complain, should he find the Bible in the ascendancy
   and exerting its benign influence not only on the people, but also on
   the government.

   The principle that the religion of a people rightfully controls the
   action of the government, has of course its limitation. If the religion
   itself be evil and require what is morally wrong, then as men cannot
   have the right to act wickedly, it is plain that it would be wrong for
   the government to conform to its requirements. If a religion should
   enjoin infanticide, or the murder of the aged or infirm, neither the
   people nor the government should conform their conduct to its laws. But
   where the religion of a people requires nothing unjust or cruel or in
   any way immoral, then those who come to live where it prevails are
   bound to submit quietly to its controlling the laws and institutions of
   the country.

   The principle contended for is recognized in all other departments of
   life. If a number of Christian men associate themselves as a
   manufacturing or banking company, it would be competent for them to
   admit unbelievers in Christianity into their association, and to allow
   them their full share in its management and control. But it would be
   utterly unreasonable for such unbelievers to set up a cry of religious
   persecution, or of infringement of their rights and liberty, because
   all the business of the company was suspended upon the Lord's Day.
   These new members knew the character and principles of those with whom
   they sought to be associated. They knew that Christians would assert
   their right to act as Christians. To require them to renounce their
   religion would be simply preposterous.

   When Protestant Christians came to this country they possessed and
   subdued the land. They worshipped God, and his Son Jesus Christ as the
   Saviour of the world, and acknowledged the Scriptures to be the rule of
   their faith and practice. They introduced their religion into their
   families, their schools, and their colleges. They abstained from all
   ordinary business on the Lord's Day, and devoted it to religion. They
   built churches, erected school-houses, and taught their children to
   read the Bible and to receive and obey it as the word of God. They
   formed themselves as Christians into municipal and state organizations.
   They acknowledged God in their legislative assemblies. They prescribed
   oaths to be taken in his name. They closed their courts, their places
   of business, their legislatures, and all places under the public
   control, on the Lord's Day. They declared Christianity to be part of
   the common law of the land. In the process of time thousands have come
   among us, who are neither Protestants nor Christians. Some are papists,
   some Jews, some infidels, and some atheists. All are welcomed; all are
   admitted to equal rights and privileges. All are allowed to acquire
   property, and to vote in every election, made eligible to all offices,
   and invested with equal influence in all public affairs. All are
   allowed to worship as they please, or not to worship at all, if they
   see fit. No man is molested for his religion or for his want of
   religion. No man is required to profess any form of faiths or to join
   any religious association. More than this cannot reasonably be
   demanded. More, however, is demanded. The infidel demands that the
   government should be conducted on the principle that Christianity is
   false. The atheist demands that it should be conducted on the
   assumption that there is no God, and the positivist on the principle
   that men are not free agents. The sufficient answer to all this is,
   that it cannot possibly be done.

   The Demands of Infidels are Unjust.

   The demands of those who require that religion, and especially
   Christianity, should be ignored in our national, state, and municipal
   laws, are not only unreasonable, but they are in the highest degree
   unjust and tyrannical. It is a condition of service in connection with
   any railroad which is operated on Sundays, that the employee be not a
   Christian. If Christianity is not to control the action of our
   municipal, state, and general governments, then if elections be ordered
   to be held on the Lord's Day, Christians cannot vote. If all the
   business of the country is to go on, on that as on other days, no
   Christian can hold office. We should thus have not a religious, but an
   anti-religious test-act. Such is the free-thinker's idea of liberty.
   [317] But still further, if Christianity is not to control the laws of
   the country, then as monogamy is a purely Christian institution, we can
   have no laws against polygamy, arbitrary divorce, or "free love." All
   this must be yielded to the anti-Christian party; and consistency will
   demand that we yield to the atheists, the oath and the decalogue; and
   all the rights of citizenship must be confined to blasphemers. Since
   the fall of Lucifer, no such tyrant has been made known to men as
   August Comte, the atheist. If, therefore, any man wishes to antedate
   perdition, he has nothing to do but to become a free-thinker and join
   in the shout, "Civil government has nothing to do with religion; and
   religion has nothing to do with civil government."

   Conclusion.

   We are bound, therefore, to insist upon the maintenance and faithfu1
   execution of the laws enacted for the protection of the Christian
   Sabbath. Christianity does not teach that men can be made religious by
   law; nor does it demand that men should be required by the civil
   authority to profess any particular form of religious doctrine, or to
   attend upon religious services; but it does enjoin that men should
   abstain from all unnecessary worldly avocations on the Lord's Day. This
   civil Sabbath, this cessation from worldly business, is what the civil
   government in Christian countries is called upon to enforce. (1.)
   Because it is the right of Christians to be allowed to rest on that
   day, which they cannot do, without forfeiting their citizenship, unless
   all public business be arrested on that day. (2.) Because such rest is
   the command of God; and this command binds the conscience as much as
   any other command in the decalogue. So far as the point in hand is
   concerned, it matters not whether such be the command of God or not; so
   long as the people believe it, it binds their conscience; and this
   conscientious belief the government is bound to respect, and must act
   accordingly. (3.) Because the civil Sabbath is necessary for the
   preservation of our free institutions, and of the good order of
   society. The indispensable condition of social order is either despotic
   power in the magistrate, or good morals among the people. Morality
   without religion is impossible; religion cannot exist without
   knowledge; knowledge cannot be disseminated among the people, unless
   there be a class of teachers, and time allotted for their instruction.
   Christ has made all his ministers, teachers; He has commanded them to
   teach all nations; He has appointed one day in seven to be set apart
   for such instruction. It is a historical fact that since the
   introduction of Christianity, nine tenths of the people have derived
   the greater part of their religious knowledge from the services of the
   sanctuary. If the Sabbath, therefore, be abolished, the fountain of
   life for the people will be sealed. [318]

   Hengstenberg, after referring to the authority of the Church and other
   grounds, for the observance of the Lord's Day, closes his discussion of
   the subject with these words: "Thank God these are only the outworks;
   the real fortress is the command that sounded out from Sinai, with the
   other divine commands therewith connected, as preparatory,
   confirmatory, or explanatory. The institution was far too important,
   and the temptations too powerful, that the solid ground of Scriptural
   command could be dispensed with. . . . It is as plain as day that the
   obligation of the Old Testament command instead of being lessened is
   increased. This follows of course from the fact that the redemption
   through Christ is infinitely more glorious than the deliverance of the
   Israelites out of Egypt, which in the preface to the Ten Commandments
   is referred to as a special motive to obedience. No ingratitude is
   blacker than refusing to obey Him who for our sakes gave up his only
   begotten Son." [319] He had said before that the Sabbath "rests on the
   unalterable necessities of our nature, inasmuch as men inevitably
   become godless if the cares and labours of their earthly life be not
   regularly interrupted" [320]

   [308] The force of this argument does not depend on the supposition
   that the days of creation were periods of twenty-four hours. Admitting
   that they were geologic periods, at the end of the sixth of which man
   appeared, and that then followed a period of permanent rest, that would
   be reason enough why every seventh day should be selected as a memorial
   of the creation, to teach Adam and his descendants that the earth did
   not owe its existence to a blind process of development, but to the
   fiat of Jehovah.

   [316] The doctrine that the Jewish sabbath was simply a day of
   relaxation from labour, was advanced among Protestants towards the
   close of the seventeenth century, by Selden, in his work De Legibus
   Hebræorum. This opinion was adopted by Vitringa in the first book of
   his Observationes Sacræ. It is also advocated by Bähr in his Symb. des
   Mos. Cultus. The contrary doctrine was adopted by all the Reformers,
   and by the great body of Christian theologians; and is ably sustained
   by Hengstenberg in his treatise Ueber den Tag des Herrn, pp. 29-41.
   This subject is discussed in the January number of the Princeton
   Review, for 1831, pp. 86-134.

   [317] A free-thinker is a man whose understanding is emancipated from
   his conscience. It is therefore natural for him to wish to see civil
   government emancipated from religion.

   § 9. The Fifth Commandment.

   Its Design.

   The general principle of duty enjoined in this commandment, is that we
   should feel and act in a becoming manner towards our superiors. It
   matters not in what their superiority consists, whether in age, office,
   power, knowledge, or excellence. There are certain feelings, and a
   certain line of conduct due to those who are over us, for that very
   reason, determined and modified in each case by the degree and nature
   of that superiority. To superiors are due, to each according to the
   relation in which he stands to us, reverence, obedience, and gratitude.
   The ground of this obligation is to be found, (1.) In the will of God,
   who has enjoined this duty upon all rational creatures. (2.) In the
   nature of the relation itself. Superiority supposes, in some form or
   degree, on the part of the inferior, dependence and indebtedness, and
   therefore calls for reverence, gratitude, and obedience; and, (3.) In
   expediency, as the moral order of the divine government and of human
   society depend upon this due submission to authority.

   In the case of God, as his superiority is infinite the submission of
   his creatures must be absolute. To Him we owe adoration or the
   profoundest reverence, the most fervent gratitude, and implicit
   obedience. The fifth commandment, however, concerns our duty to our
   fellow-creatures. First in order and in importance is the duty of
   children to their parents, hence the general duty is embodied in the
   specific command, "Honour thy father and thy mother."

   The Filial Relation.

   When a child is born into the world it is entirely helpless and
   dependent. As it derives its existence from its parents, so it would
   immediately perish without their assiduous and constant care. The
   parents are not only its superiors in knowledge, in power, and in every
   other attribute of humanity; but they are also the proximate source of
   all good to the child. They protect, cherish, feed, clothe, educate,
   and endow it. All the good be-stowed, is bestowed disinterestedly. Self
   is constantly sacrificed. The love of parents to their children is
   mysterious and immutable, as well as self-sacrificing. It is a form of
   love which none but a parent can know. A mother's love is a mystery and
   a wonder. It is the most perfect analogue of the love of God.

   As the relation in which parents stand to their children has this close
   analogy to the relation in which God stands to his rational creatures,
   and especially to his own people, so the duties resulting from that
   relation are analogous. They are expressed by the same word. Filial
   piety is as correct an expression as it is common. Parents stand to
   their dependent children, so to speak, in the place of God. They are
   the natural objects of the child's love, reverence, gratitude,
   confidence, and devotion. These are the sentiments which naturally flow
   out of the relation; and which in all ordinary cases do flow from it;
   so that Calvin is justified in saying that children destitute of these
   feelings, "monstra sunt non homines." This endearing and intimate
   relation between parents and children (which cannot exist where
   monogamy is not the law), binding all in the closest union which can
   exist among men, makes the family the corner-stone of the well-being of
   society on earth, and the type of the blessedness of heaven. The Church
   is the family of God. He is the Father, its members are brethren.

   While the relative duties of parents and children must be everywhere
   and always essentially the same, yet they are more or less modified by
   varying conditions of society. There are laws on this subject in the
   Bible, which being intended for the state of things existing before the
   coming of Christ, are no longer binding upon us. It was unavoidable in
   the patriarchal state of society, and especially in its nomadic state,
   that the father of a family should be at once father, magistrate, and
   priest. And it was natural and right that many of the parental
   prerogatives necessary in such a state of society, should be retained
   in the temporary and transition state organized under the Mosaic
   institutions. We find accordingly that the laws of Moses invested
   parents with powers which can no longer properly belong to them; and
   sustained parental authority by penal enactments which are no longer
   necessary. Thus it was ordered, "He that curseth (or revileth,
   Septuagint ho kakologon, Vulgate qui maledixerit') his father or his
   mother shall surely be put to death." (Exod. xxi. 17) In the fifteenth
   verse of the same chapter it is said, "He that smiteth his father or
   his mother, shall be surely put to death." (Compare Deut. xxvii. 16;
   Prov. xx. 20; Matt. xv. 4.) It may be remarked here, in passing, that
   our Lord's comment on this commandment given in Matthew xv. 4-6, shows
   that the honouring of their parents required of children, does not mean
   simply the cherishing right feelings towards them, but as well the
   ministering to their support when necessary. Christ said to the
   Pharisees, "God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother;
   . . . . but ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It
   is a gift (consecrated to God), by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
   by me, and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free." That
   is, the Pharisees taught that a son might evade the obligation to
   honour, i.e., to support his father or mother, by saying that his
   property was consecrated to God.

   The Mosaic law also enacted that "If a man have a stubborn and
   rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the
   voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not
   hearken unto them; then shall his father and his mother lay hold on
   him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city and unto the gates
   of his place: and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our
   son is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a
   glutton, and a drunkard. And all the men of the city shall stone him
   with stones, that he die." (Deut. xxi. 18-21.)

   Fathers under the old economy had the right to choose wives for their
   sons and to give their daughters in marriage. (Gen. xxiv.; Ex. xxi. 9;
   Judges xiv. 2; Gen. xxix. 18; xxxiv. 12.) Children also were liable to
   be sold to satisfy the debts of their fathers. (Levit. xxv. 39-41; 2
   Kings iv. 1; Is. l. 1; Matt. xviii. 25.) These judicial enactments have
   passed away. They serve to prove, however, how intimate in the sight of
   God is the relation between parents and children. A father's
   benediction was coveted as the greatest blessing; and his curse
   deprecated as a fearful evil. (Gen. xxvii. 4, 12, 34-38; xlix. 2 ff.)

   In the New Testament the duty enjoined in the fifth commandment is
   frequently recognized and enforced. Our blessed Lord himself was
   subject to his parents. (Luke ii. 51.) The Apostle commands children to
   obey their parents in the Lord (Eph. vi. 1), and to obey them in all
   things, for this is well pleasing unto the Lord. (Col. iii. 20.) This
   obedience is to be not only religious, but specifically Christian, as
   the word Lord, in Ephesians vi. 1, refers to Christ. This is plain
   because in ch. v. 21, the Apostle says that these specific duties are
   to be performed "in the fear of Christ;" [321] because the Lord is
   always in the New Testament to be understood of Christ, unless the
   context forbids; and because especially throughout these chapters Lord
   and Christ are interchanged, so that it is evident that both words
   refer to the same person. Children are required to obey their parents
   in the Lord, i.e., as a religious duty, as part of the obedience due to
   the Lord. They are to obey them "in all things;" i.e., in all things
   falling within the sphere of parental authority. God has never
   committed unlimited power to the hands of men. The limitations of
   parental authority are determined partly by the nature of the relation,
   partly by the Scriptures, and partly by the state of society or the law
   of the land. The nature of the relation supposes that parents are to be
   obeyed as parents, out of gratitude and love; and that their will is to
   be consulted and respected even where their decisions are not final.
   They are not to be obeyed as magistrates, as though they were invested
   with the power to make or to administer civil laws; nor yet as prophets
   or priests. They are not lords of the conscience. They cannot control
   our faith or determine for us questions of duty so as to exonerate us
   from personal obligation. Being a service of love, it does not admit of
   strictly defined boundaries. Children are to conform to the wishes and
   to be controlled by the judgments of their parents, in all cases where
   such submission does not conflict with higher obligations.

   The Scriptural rule is simple and comprehensive. It does not go into
   unnecessary details. It prescribes the general rule of obedience. The
   exceptions to that rule must be such as justify themselves to a
   divinely enlightened conscience, i.e., a conscience enlightened by the
   Word and Spirit of God. The general principle given in the Bible in all
   such cases is, "It is right to obey God rather than man."

   The Promise.

   This commandment has a special promise attached to it. This promise has
   a theocratical form as it stands in the decalogue, "That thy days may
   be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee." The Apostle,
   in Ephesians vi. 3, by leaving out the last clause generalizes it, so
   that it applies to no one land or people, but to obedient children
   everywhere. The promise announces the general purpose of God and a
   general principle of his providential government. "The hand of the
   diligent maketh rich," that is the general rule, which is not
   invalidated if here and there a diligent man remains poor. It is well
   with obedient children; they prosper in the world. Such is the fact,
   and such is the divine promise. The family being the corner-stone of
   social order and prosperity, it follows that those families are blessed
   in which God's plan and purpose are most fully carried out and
   realized.

   Parental Duties.

   As children are bound to honour and obey their parents, so parents have
   duties no less important in reference to their children. These duties
   are summarily expressed by the Apostle in Ephesians vi. 4, first in a
   negative, and then in a positive form. "Ye fathers provoke not your
   children to wrath." This is what they are not to do. They are not to
   excite the bad passions of their children by anger, severity,
   injustice, partiality, or any undue exercise of authority. This is a
   great evil. It is sowing tares instead of wheat in a fruitful soil. The
   positive part of parental duty is expressed by the cemprehensive
   direction, "but bring them up in the nurture (paideia) and admonition
   (nouthesia) of the Lord." The former of these words is comprehensive,
   the latter specific. The one expresses the whole process of education
   or training; the other the special duty of warning and correction. The
   "nurture and admonition" is to be Christian; that is, not only such as
   Christ approves and enjoins, but which is truly his, i.e., that which
   He exercises by his word and Spirit through the parent as his organ.
   "Christ is represented as exercising this nurture and admonition, in so
   far as He by his Spirit influences and controls the parent." [322]
   According to the Apostle, this religious or Christian element is
   essential in the education of the young. Man has a religious as well as
   an intellectual nature. To neglect the former would be as unreasonable
   as to neglect the latter and make all education a matter of mere
   physical training. We must act in accordance with facts. It is a fact
   that men have a moral and religious nature. It is a fact that if their
   moral and religious feelings are enlightened and properly developed,
   they become upright, useful, and happy; on the other hand, if these
   elements of their nature are uncultivated or perverted, they become
   degraded, miserable, and wicked. It is a fact that this department of
   our nature as much needs right culture as the intellectual or the
   physical. It is a fact that this culture can be effected only by the
   truth instilled into the mind and impressed upon the conscience. It is
   a fact that this truth, as all Christians believe, is contained in the
   Holy Scriptures. It is a fact, according to the Scriptures, that the
   eternal Son of God is the only Saviour of men, and that it is by faith
   in Him and by obedience to Him, men are delivered from the dominion of
   sin; and therefore it is a fact that unless children are brought up in
   the nurture and admonition of the Lord, they, and the society which
   they constitute or control, will go to destruction. Consequently, when
   a state resolves that religious instruction shall be banished from the
   schools and other literary institutions, it virtually resolves on
   self-destruction. It may indeed be said that such a resolution does not
   imply that religious education is to be neglected. It simply declares
   that it is not a function of the state, that it is a duty which belongs
   to the family and to the Church. This is plausible, but it is
   fallacious.

   1. All the education received by a large portion of the people of any
   country, is received in its primary schools. If that be irreligious (in
   the negative sense, if in this case there be such a sense), their whole
   training is irreligious.

   2. It is to be remembered that the Christian people of a country are
   the Church of that country. The Christians of Antioch were the Church
   of Antioch, and the Christians of Rome were the Church of Rome. In like
   manner the Christians in the United are the Church in the United
   States. As therefore the schools belong to the people, as they are
   their organs for the education of their children; if the people be
   Christians, the schools of right must be Christian. Any law which
   declares that they shall not be so, is tyrannical. It may be said that
   the law does not forbid Christians having religious schools, it only
   says that such schools shall not be supported by the public money. But
   the people are the public; and if the people be Christians, Christians
   are the public. The meaning of such a law, therefore, really is, that
   Christians shall not use their own money for the support of their own
   schools.

   3. If Christian men therefore constitute a nation, a state, a county, a
   town, or a village, they have the right, with which no civil power can
   justly interfere, of having Christian schools. If any who are not
   Christians choose to frequent such schools, they should not be required
   to attend upon the religious instruction. They can derive all the
   benefit they seek, although they omit attendance on what is designed
   for the children of Christian parents.

   4. It is true that Church and State are not united in this country as
   they ever have been in Europe. It is conceded that this separation is
   wise. But it is not to be inferred from that concession that the state
   has nothing to do with religion; that it must act as though there were
   no Christ and no God. It has already been remarked that this is as
   impossible as it would be for the state to ignore the moral law. It may
   be admitted that Church and State are, in this country, as distinct as
   the Church and a banking company. But a banking company, if composed of
   Christians, must conduct its business according to Christian
   principles, so far as those principles apply to banking operations. So
   a nation, or a state, composed of Christians, must be governed by
   Christianity, so far as its spirit and precepts apply to matters of
   civil government. If therefore the state assumes that the education of
   the people is one of its functions, it is bound in a Christian country,
   -- a country in which ninety hundredths of the population consist of
   Christians, -- to conduct the schools on Christian principles,
   otherwise it tramples on the most sacred rights of the people. This the
   people never will submit to, until they lose all interest in their
   religion. No one doubts that the Bible does require that education
   should be religiously conducted. "These words which I command thee this
   day, shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto
   thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house,
   and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
   thou risest up." (Deut. vi. 6, 7. and xi. 19.) "He established a
   testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded
   our fathers, that they should make them known to their children; that
   the generation to come might know them, even the children which should
   be born, who should arise and declare them to their children; that they
   might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep
   his commandments." (Ps. lxxviii. 5, 6, 7.) "Train up a child in the way
   he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it." (Prov.
   xxii. 6.) Fathers bring up your children "in the nurture and admonition
   of the Lord." (Eph. vi. 4.) These are not ceremonial or obsolete laws.
   They bind the consciences of men just as much as the command, "Thou
   shalt not steal." If parents themselves conduct the education of their
   children, these are the principles upon which it must be conducted. If
   they commit that work to teachers, they are bound, by the law of God,
   to see that the teachers regard these divine prescriptions; if they
   commit the work to the state, they are under equally sacred obligation
   to see that the state does not violate them. This is an obligation
   which they cannot escape.

   5. When the Sunday laws were under discussion, on a previous page, it
   was urged that it would be unreasonable and unjust for a man who joined
   a business association of moral men, to insist that the affairs of the
   association should be conducted on immoral principles; if he joined a
   company of Christian manufacturers, it would be unjust for him to
   require that they should violate the laws of Christianity. So if a
   Christian should go to Turkey, it would be preposterous for him to
   insist that the Koran should be banished from the public schools. No
   less preposterous is it for any man to demand that Christians in this
   country should renounce their religion. Christianity requires that
   education in all its departments should be conducted religiously. If
   any set of men should found a school or a university from which all
   religious instruction should be banished, the law of the land would
   doubtless permit them to do so. But for the law to forbid that the
   religion of the people should be taught in schools sustained by the
   money of the people, ought not to be submitted to.

   6. The banishment of religious influence from our schools is
   impossible. If a man is not religious, he is irreligious; if he is not
   a believer, he is an unbeliever. This is as true of organizations and
   institutions, as it is of Individuals. Byron uttered a profound truth
   when he put into the mouth of Satan the words "He that does not bow to
   God, has bowed to me." If you banish light, you are in darkness. If you
   banish Christianity from the schools, you thereby render them infidel.
   If a child is brought up in ignorance of God, he becomes an atheist. If
   never taught the moral law, his moral nature is as undeveloped as that
   of a pagan. This controversy, therefore, is a controversy between
   Christianity and infidelity; between light and darkness; between Christ
   and Belial. [323]

   It is admitted that this subject is encumbered with practical
   difficulties where the people of a country differ widely in their
   religious convictions. In such cases it would be far better to refer
   the matter to the people of each school district, than by a general law
   to prohibit all religious instruction from the public schools. This
   would, in fact, be to make them infidel, in deference to a numerically
   insignificant minority of the people. It is constantly said that the
   state, if it provides for anything more than secular education, is
   travelling out of its sphere; that civil government is no more
   organized to teach religion than a fire company is. This latter
   assertion may be admitted so far as this, that the same rule applies to
   both cases. That is, all individual men, and all associations of men,
   are bound to act according to the principles of morality and religion,
   so far as those principles are applicable to the work which they have
   to do. Men cannot lawfully cheat in banking, nor can they rightfully
   conduct their business on the Lord's Day. In like manner if God
   requires that education should be conducted religiously, the state has
   no more right to banish religion from its schools, than it has to
   violate the moral law. The whole thing comes to this: Christians are
   bound by the express command of God as well as by a regard to the
   salvation of their children and to the best interests of society, to
   see to it that their children are brought up "in the nurture and
   admonition of the Lord;" this they are bound to do; through the state
   if they can; without it, if they must.

   Obedience due to Civil Magistrates.

   It the fifth commandment enjoins as a general principle, respect and
   obedience to our superiors, it includes our obligations to civil
   rulers, we are commanded to "Submit ourselves to every ordinance of man
   for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king as supreme; or unto
   governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil
   doers, and for the praise of them that do well. For so is the will of
   God." (1 Peter ii. 13-15.) The whole theory of civil government and the
   duty of citizens to their rulers, are comprehensively stated by the
   Apostle in Romans xiii. 1-5. It is there taught, (1.) That all
   authority is of God. (2.) That civil magistrates are ordained of God.
   (3.) That resistance to them, is resistance to Him; they are ministers
   exercising his authority among men. (4.) That obedience to them must be
   rendered as a matter of conscience, as a part of our obedience to God.

   From this it appears, -- First, that civil government is a divine
   ordinance. It is not merely an optional human institution; something
   which men are free to have or not to have, as they see fit. It is not
   founded on any social compact; it is something which God commands. The
   Bible, however, does not teach that there is any one form of civil
   government which is always and everywhere obligatory. The form of
   government is determined by the providence of God and the will of the
   people. It changes as the state of society changes. Much less is it
   implied in the proposition that government is a divine institution,
   that God designates the persons who are to exercise the various
   functions of the government; or the mode of their appointment; or the
   extent of their powers.

   Secondly, it is included in the Apostle's doctrine, that magistrates
   derive their authority from God; they are his ministers; they represent
   Him. In a certain sense they represent the people, as they may be
   chosen by them to be the depositaries of this divinely delegated
   authority; but the powers that be are ordained by God; it is his will
   that they should be, and that they should be clothed with authority.

   Thirdly, from this it follows that obedience to magistrates and to the
   laws of the land, is a religious duty. We are to submit to "every
   ordinance of man," for the Lord's sake, out of our regard to Him, as
   St. Peter expresses it; or for "conscience sake," as the same idea is
   expressed by St. Paul. We are bound to obey magistrates not merely
   because we have promised to do so; or because we have appointed them;
   or because they are wise or good; but because such is the will of God.
   In like manner the laws of the land are to be observed, not because we
   approve of them, but because God has enjoined such obedience. This is a
   matter of great importance; it is the only stable foundation of civil
   government and of social order. There is a great difference between
   obedience to men and obedience to God; between lying to men and lying
   to God; and between resistance to men and resistance to God. This
   principle runs through the Bible, which teaches that all authority is
   of God, and therefore all obedience to those in authority is part of
   our obedience to God. This applies not only to the case of citizens and
   rulers, but also to parents and children, husbands and wives, and even
   masters and slaves. In all these relations we are to act not as the
   servants of men, but as the servants of God. This gives to authority by
   whomsoever exercised a divine sanction; it gives it power over the
   conscience; and it elevates even menial service into an element of the
   glorious liberty of the sons of God. No man can have a servile spirit
   who serves God in rendering obedience to men. None but a law-abiding
   people can be free or prosperous; and no people can be permanently
   law-abiding who do not truly believe that "the powers that be are
   ordained of God. "Whosoever, therefore, resisteth the power (those in
   authority), resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall
   receive to themselves damnation (krima)." That is, God will punish
   them.

   Fourthly, another principle included in the Apostle's doctrine is, that
   obedience is due to every de facto government, whatever its origin or
   character. His directions were written under the reign of Nero, and
   enjoined obedience to him. The early Christians were not called to
   examine the credentials of their actual rulers, every time the
   prætorian guard chose to depose one emperor and install another. The
   people of England were not free from their obligation to William and
   Mary when once established on the throne, because they might think that
   James II. was entitled to the crown. We are to obey "the powers that
   be." They are in authority by the will of God, which is revealed by
   facts, as clearly as by words. It is by Him that "kings reign and
   princes decree justice." "He raiseth up one, and putteth down another."

   Fifthly, the Scriptures clearly teach that no human authority is
   intended to be unlimited. Such limitation may not be expressed, but it
   is always implied. The command "Thou shalt not kill," is unlimited in
   form, yet the Scriptures recognize that homicide may in some cases be
   not only justifiable but obligatory. The principles which limit the
   authority of civil government and of its agents are simple and obvious.
   The first is that governments and magistrates have authority only
   within their legitimate spheres. As civil government is instituted for
   the protection of life and property, for the preservation of order, for
   the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of those who do well,
   it has to do only with the conduct, or external acts of men. It cannot
   concern itself with their opinions, whether scientific, philosophical,
   or religious. An act of Parliament or of Congress, that Englishmen or
   Americans should be materialists or idealists, would be an absurdity
   and a nullity. The magistrate cannot enter our families and assume
   parental authority, or our churches and teach as a minister. A justice
   of the peace cannot assume the prerogatives of a governor of a state or
   of a president of the United States. Out of his legitimate sphere a
   magistrate ceases to be a magistrate. A second limitation is no less
   plain. No human authority can make it obligatory on a man to disobey
   God. If all power is from God, it cannot be legitimate when used
   against God. This is self-evident. The Apostles when forbidden to
   preach the Gospel, refused to obey. When Daniel refused to bow down to
   the image which Nebuchadnezzar had made; when the early Christians
   refused to worship idols; and when the Protestant martyrs refused to
   profess the errors of the Romish Church, they all commended themselves
   to God, and secured the reverence of all good men. On this point there
   can be no dispute. It is important that this principle should be not
   only recognized, but also publicly avowed. The sanctity of law, and the
   stability of human governments, depend on the sanction of God. Unless
   they repose on Him, they rest on nothing. They have his sanction only
   when they act according to his will; that is in accordance with the
   design of their appointment and in harmony with the moral law.

   Sixthly, another general principle is that the question, When the civil
   government may be, and ought to be disobeyed, is one which every man
   must decide for himself. It is a matter of private judgment. Every man
   must answer for himself to God, and therefore, every man must judge for
   himself, whether a given act is sinful or not. Daniel judged for
   himself. So did Shadrach, Meshech, and Abednego. So did the Apostles,
   and so did the martyrs.

   An unconstitutional law or commandment is a nullity; no man sins in
   disregarding it. He disobeys, however, at his peril. If his judgment is
   right, he is free. If it be wrong, in the view of the proper tribunal,
   he must suffer the penalty. There is an obvious distinction to be made
   between disobedience and resistance. A man is bound to disobey a law,
   or a command, which requires him to sin, but it does not follow that he
   is at liberty to resist its execution. The Apostles refused to obey the
   Jewish authorities; but they submitted to the penalty inflicted. So the
   Christian martyrs disobeyed the laws requiring them to worship idols,
   but they made no resistance to the execution of the law. The Quakers
   disobey the law requiring military service, but quietly submit to the
   penalty. This is obviously right. The right of resistance is in the
   community. It is the right of revolution, which God sanctions, and
   which good men in past ages have exercised to the salvation of civil
   and religious liberty. When a government fails to answer the purpose
   for which God ordained it, the people have a right to change it. A
   father, if he shamefully abuses his power, may rightfully be deprived
   of authority over his children. [324]

   Obedience to the Church.

   The Apostle commands Christians "Obey them that have the rule over you,
   and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls." "Remember them
   which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of
   God." (Heb. xiii. 17, 7.) Our Lord said to his disciples, that if an
   offending brother resisted other means to bring him to repentance, his
   offence must be told to the Church; and that if he neglected to hear
   the Church, he was to be regarded as a heathen man and a publican.
   (Matt. xviii. 17.)

   The principles which regulate our obedience to the Church, are very
   much the same as those which concern our relation to the State, --

   1. The visible Church is a divine institution. In one sense indeed it
   is a voluntary society, in so far as that no man can be coerced to join
   it. If he joins it at all, it must be of his own free will.
   Nevertheless it is the will of God that the visible Church as an
   organized body should exist; and every man who hears the Gospel, is
   bound to enroll himself among its members and to submit to its
   authority.

   2. All Church power is of God, and all legitimate Church officers are
   his ministers. They act in his name and by his authority. Resistance to
   them, therefore, is resistance to the ordinance of God.

   3. All the prerogatives of the Church and all the powers of its
   officers are laid down in the word of God.

   4. The prerogatives of the Church are, first, to teach. Its great
   commission is to teach all nations. It is to teach what God has
   revealed in his word as to what men are to believe and what they are to
   do. Beyond the limits of the revelation contained in the Scriptures the
   Church has no more authority to teach than any other association among
   men. Secondly, the Church has the right and duty to order and conduct
   public worship, to administer the sacraments, to select and ordain its
   own officers, and to do whatever else is necessary for its own
   perpetuity and extension. Thirdly, it is the prerogative of the Church
   to exercise discipline over its own members, and to receive or to
   reject them as the case may be.

   5. As to the external organization of the Church all Christians agree
   that there are certain rules laid down in the word of God which are of
   universal and perpetual obligation. All Christian Churches, however,
   have acted on the assumption, that beyond these prescribed rules, the
   Church has a certain discretion to modify its organization and its
   organs to suit varying emergencies.

   6. The visible Church being organized for a definite purpose, its power
   being derived from God, and its prerogatives being all laid down in the
   Scriptures, it follows not only that its powers are limited within the
   bounds thus prescribed, but also that the question, whether its
   decisions and injunctions are to be obeyed, is to be determined by
   every one concerned, on his own responsibility. If the decision is
   within the limits to which God has confined the action of the Church,
   and in accordance with the Scriptures, it is to be obeyed. If it
   transcends those limits, or is contrary to the word of God, it is to be
   disregarded. If therefore the Church through any of its organs should
   assume to decide questions of pure science, or of political economy, or
   of civil law, such decisions would amount to nothing. Or, if it should
   declare that to be true which the Scriptures pronounce to be false; or
   that to be false which the Scriptures declare to be true, such judgment
   would bind no man's conscience. And in like manner, should the Church
   declare any thing to be sinful which the word of God teaches to be
   right or indifferent; or that to be right and obligatory which that
   word pronounces to be evil, then again its teaching is void of all
   authority. All this is included in the principle that we must obey God
   rather than man; and that as to when obedience to man conflicts with
   our allegiance to God, every man from the nature of the case must judge
   for himself. No man can estimate the importance of these simple
   principles. It was by disregarding them that the Church came gradually
   to deny the right of private judgment; to subordinate the Scriptures to
   its decisions; and to put itself in the place of God. In this way it
   has imposed unscriptural doctrines upon the faith of men; made
   multitudes of things to be obligatory which God never enjoined; and
   declared the greatest sins, such at treason, persecution, and massacre
   to be Christian duties.

   While, therefore, the duty of obedience to our superiors, and
   submission to law, as enjoined in the fifth commandment, is the source
   of all order in the family, the Church, and the State; the limitation
   of this duty by our higher obligation to God, is the foundation of all
   civil and religious liberty.

   § 10. The Sixth Commandment.

   Its Design.

   This commandment, as expounded by our Lord (Matt. v. 21, 22), forbids
   malice in all its degrees and in all its manifestations. The Bible
   recognizes the distinction between anger and malice. The former is on
   due occasion allowable; the other is in its nature, and therefore
   always, evil. The one is a natural or constitutional emotion arising
   out of the experience or perception of wrong, and includes not only
   disapprobation but also indignation, and a desire in some way to
   redress or punish the wrong inflicted. The other includes hatred and
   the desire to inflict evil to gratify that evil passion. Our Lord is
   said to have been angry; but in Him there was no malice or resentment.
   He was the Lamb of God; when He was reviled, He reviled not again; when
   He suffered, He threatened not; He prayed for his enemies even on the
   cross.

   In the several commandments of the decalogue, the highest manifestation
   of any evil is selected for prohibition, with the intention of
   including all lesser forms of the same evil. In forbidding murder, all
   degrees and manifestations of malicious feeling are forbidden. The
   Bible assigns special value to the life of man, first, because he was
   created in the image of God. He is not only like God in the essential
   elements of his nature, but he s also God's representative on earth. An
   indignity or injury inflicted on him, is an act of irreverence toward
   God. And secondly, all men are brethren. They are of one blood;
   children of a common father. On these grounds we are bound to love and
   respect all men as men; and to do all we can not only to protect their
   lives but also to promote their well-being. Murder therefore, is the
   highest crime which a man can commit against a fellow-man.

   Capital Punishment.

   As the sixth commandment forbids malicious homicide, it is plain that
   the infliction of capital punishment is not included in the
   prohibition. Such punishment is not inflicted to gratify revenge, but
   to satisfy justice and for the preservation of society. As these are
   legitimate and most important ends, it follows that the capital
   punishment of murder is also legitimate. Such punishment, in the case
   of murder, is not only lawful, but also obligatory.

   1. Because it is expressly declared in the Bible, "Whoso sheddeth man's
   blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he
   man." (Gen. ix. 6.) That this is of perpetual obligation is clear,
   because it was given to Noah, the second head of the human race. It
   was, therefore, not intended for any particular age or nation. It is
   the announcement of a general principle of justice; a revelation of the
   will of God. Moreover the reason assigned for the law is a permanent
   reason. Man was created in the image of God; and, therefore, whoso
   sheds his blood, by man shall his blood be shed. This reason has as
   much force at one time or place as at any other. Rosenmüller's comment
   on this clause is, "Cum homo ad Dei imaginem sit factus, æquum est, ut,
   qui Dei imaginem violavit et destruxit, occidatur, cum Dei imagini
   injuriam faciens, ipsum Deum, illius auctorem, petierit." [325] This is
   a very solemn consideration, and one of wide application. It applies
   not only to murder and other injuries infficted on the persons of men,
   but also to anything which tends to degrade or to defile them. The
   Apostle applies it even to evil words, or the suggestion of corrupt
   thoughts. If it is an outrage to defile the statue or portrait of a
   great and good man, or of a father or mother, how much greater is the
   outrage when we defile the imperishable image of God impressed on the
   immortal soul of man. We find the injunction, that the murderer should
   surely be put to death, repeated over and over in the Mosaic law. (Ex.
   xxi. 12, 14; Lev. xxiv. 17; Num. xxxv. 21; Deut. xix. 11, 13.)

   There are clear recognitions in the New Testament of the continued
   obligation of the divine law that murder should be punished with death.
   In Romans xiii. 4, the Apostle says that the magistrate "beareth not
   the sword in vain." The sword was worn as the symbol of the power of
   capital punishment. Even by profane writers, says Meyer, "bearing the
   sword" by a magistrate was the emblem of the power over life and death.
   The same Apostle said (Acts xxv. 11): "If I be an offender, or have
   committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die;" which clearly
   implies that, in his judgment, there were offenses, for which the
   appropriate penalty is death.

   2. Besides these arguments from Scripture, there are others drawn from
   natural justice. It is a dictate of our moral nature that crime should
   be punished; that there should be a just proportion between the offence
   and the penalty; and that death, the highest penalty, was the proper
   punishment for the greatest of all crimes. That such is the instinctive
   judgment of men is proved by the difficulty often experienced in
   restraining the people from taking summary vengeance in cases of
   atrocious murder. So strong is this sentiment that a species of wild
   justice is sure to step in to supply the place of judicial remissness.
   Such justice, from being lawless and impulsive, is too often misguided
   and erroneous, and, in a settled state of society, is always criminal.
   It being the nature of men, that if the regular, lawful infliction of
   death as a judicial penalty be abolished, it will be inflicted by the
   avenger of blood, or by tumultuous assemblies of the people, society
   has to choose between securing to the homicide a fair trial by the
   constituted authorities, and giving him up to the blind spirit of
   revenge.

   3. Experience teaches that where human life is undervalued, it is
   insecure; that where the murderer escapes with impunity or is
   inadequately punished, homicides are fearfully multiplied. The
   practical question, therefore, is, Who is to die? the innocent man or
   the murderer?

   Homicide in Self-Defence.

   That homicide in self-defence is not forbidden by the sixth
   commandment, is plain, (1.) Because such homicide is not malicious,
   and, therefore, does not come within the scope of the prohibition. (2.)
   Because sell-preservation is an instinct of our nature, and therefore,
   a revelation of the will of God. (3.) Because it is a dictate of reason
   and of natural justice that if of two persons we must die, it should be
   the aggressor and not the aggrieved. (4.) Because the universal
   judgment of men, and the Word of God, pronounce the man innocent who
   kills another in defence of his own life or that of his neighbor.

   War.

   It is conceded that war is one of the most dreadful evils that can be
   inflicted on a people; that it involves the destruction of property and
   life; that it demoralizes both the victors and the vanquished; that it
   visits thousands of non-combatants with all the miseries of poverty,
   widowhood, and orphanage; and that it tends to arrest the progress of
   society in everything that is good and desirable. God overrules wars in
   many cases, as He does the tornado and the earthquake, to the
   accomplishment of his benevolent purposes, but this does not prove that
   war in itself is not a great evil. He makes the wrath of man to praise
   Him. It is conceded that wars undertaken to gratify the ambition,
   cupidity, or resentment of rulers or people, are unchristian and
   wicked. It is also conceded that the vast majority of the wars which
   have desolated the world have been unjustifiable in the sight of God
   and man. Nevertheless it does not follow from this that war in all
   cases is to be condemned.

   1. This is proved because the right of self-defence belongs to nations
   as well as to individuals. Nations are bound to protect the lives and
   property of their citizens. If these are assailed by force, force may
   be rightfully used in their protection. Nations also have the right to
   defend their own existence. If that be endangered by the conduct of
   other nations, they have the natural right of self-protection. A war
   may be defensive and yet in one sense aggressive. In other words,
   self-defence may dictate and render necessary the first assault. A man
   is not bound to wait until a murderer actually strikes his blow. It is
   enough that he sees undeniable manifestations of a hostile purpose. So
   a nation is not bound to wait until its territories are actually
   invaded and its citizens murdered, before it appeals to arms. It is
   enough that there is clear evidence on the part of another nation of an
   intention to commence hostilities. While it is easy to lay down the
   principle that war is justifiable only as a means of self-defence, the
   practical application of this principle is beset with difficulties. The
   least aggression on national property, or the slightest infringement of
   national rights, may be regarded as the first step toward national
   extinction, and therefore justify the most extreme measures of redress.
   A nation may think that a certain enlargement of territory is necessary
   to its security, and, therefore, that it has the right to go to war to
   secure it. So a man may say that a portion of his neighbour's farm is
   necessary to the full enjoyment of his own property, and therefore that
   he has the right to appropriate it to himself. It is to be remembered
   that nations are as much bound by the moral law as individual men; and
   therefore that what a man may not do in the protection of his own
   rights, and on the plea of self-defence, a nation may not do. A nation
   therefore is bound to exercise great forbearance, and to adopt every
   other available means of redressing wrongs, before it plunges itself
   and others into all the demoralizing miseries of war.

   2. The lawfulness of defensive war, however, does not rest exclusively
   on these general principles of justice; it is distinctly recognized in
   Scripture. In numerous cases, under the Old Testament, such wars were
   commanded. God endowed men with special qualifications as warriors. He
   answered when consulted through the Urim and Thummim, or by the
   prophets, as to the propriety of military enterprises (Judges xx. 27
   f., 1 Sam. xiv. 37, xxiii. 2, 4; 1 Kings xxii. 6 ff.); and He often
   interfered miraculously in behalf of his people when they were engaged
   in battle. Many of the Psalms of David, dictated by the Spirit, are
   either prayers for divine assistance in war or thanksgivings for
   victory. It is very plain, therefore, that the God whom the patriarchs
   and prophets worshipped did not condemn war, when the choice was
   between war and annihilation. It is a very clear case that if the
   Israelites had not been allowed to defend themselves against their
   heathen neighbours they would have soon been extirpated, and their
   religion would have perished with them.

   As the essential principles of morals do not change, what was permitted
   or commanded under one dispensation, cannot be unlawful under another,
   unless forbidden by a new revelation. The New Testament, however,
   contains no such revelation. It does not say, as in the case of
   divorce, that war was permitted to the Hebrews because of the hardness
   of their hearts, but that under the Gospel a new law was to prevail.
   This very silence of the New Testament leaves the Old Testament rule of
   duty on this subject still in force. Accordingly, although there is no
   express declaration on the subject, as none was needed, we find the
   lawfulness of war quietly assumed. When the soldiers inquired of John
   the Baptist what they should do to prepare for the kingdom of God, he
   did not tell them that they must forsake the profession of arms. The
   centurion, whose faith our Lord so highly commended (Matt. viii. 5-13),
   was not censured for being a soldier. So also the centurion, a devout
   man, whom God in a vision commanded to send for Peter, and on whom, and
   his associates, according to the record in the tenth chapter of Acts,
   the Holy Ghost came with miraculous gifts, was allowed to remain in the
   army of even a heathen emperor. If magistrates, as we learn from the
   thirteenth chapter of Romans, are armed with a right or power of life
   and death over their own citizens, they certainly have the right to
   declare war in self-defence.

   In the early ages of the Church there was a great disinclination to
   engage in military service, and the fathers at times justified this
   reluctance by calling the lawfulness of all wars into question. But the
   real sources of this opposition of Christians to entering the army,
   were that they thereby gave themselves up to the service of a power
   which persecuted their religion; and that idolatrous usages were
   inseparably connected with military duties. When the Roman empire
   became Christian, and the cross was substituted for the eagle on the
   standards of the army, this opposition died away, till at length we
   hear of fighting prelates, and of military orders of monks.

   No historical Christian Church has pronounced all war to be unlawful.
   The Augsburg Confession [326] expressly says that it is proper for
   Christians to act as magistrates, and among other things "jure bellare,
   militare," etc. And Presbyterians especially have shown that it is not
   against their consciences to contend to the death for their rights and
   liberties.

   Suicide.

   It is conceivable that men who do not believe in God or in a future
   state of existence, should think it allowable to take refuge in
   annihilation from the miseries of this life. But it is unaccountable,
   except on the assumption of temporary or permanent insanity, that any
   man should rush uncalled into the retributions of eternity. Suicide,
   therefore, is most frequent among those who have lost all faith in
   religion. [327] It is a very complicated crime; our life is not our
   own; we have no more right to destroy our life than we have to destroy
   the life of a fellow-man. Suicide is, therefore, self murder. It is the
   desertion of the post which God has assigned us; it is a deliberate
   refusal to submit to his will; it is a crime which admits of no
   repentance, and consequently involves the loss of the soul.

   Duelling.

   Duelling is another violation of the sixth commandment. Its advocates
   defend it on the same principle on which international war is defended.
   As independent nations have no common tribunal to which they can resort
   for the redress of injuries, they are justifiable, on the principle of
   self-defence, in appealing to arms for the protection of their rights.
   In like manner, it is said, there are offences for which the law of the
   land affords no redress, and therefore, the individual must be allowed
   to seek redress for himself. But (1.) There is no evil for which the
   law does not, or should not, afford redress. (2.) The redress sought in
   the duel is unjustifiable. No one has the right to kill a man for a
   slight or an insult. Taking a man's life for a hasty word, or even for
   a serious injury, is murder in the sight of God, who has ordained the
   penalty of death as the punishment for only the most atrocious crimes.
   (3.) The remedy is preposterous; for most frequently it is the
   aggrieved party who loses his life. (4.) Duelling is the cause of the
   greatest suffering to innocent parties, which no man has a right to
   inflict to gratify his pride or resentment. (5.) The survivor in a
   fatal duel entails on himself, unless his heart and conscience be
   seared, a life of misery.

   § 11. The Seventh Commandment.

   This commandment, as we learn from our Lord's exposition of it, given
   in his sermon on the mount, forbids all impurity in thought, speech,
   and behaviour. As the social organization of society is founded on the
   distinction of the sexes, and as the well-being of the state and the
   purity and prosperity of the Church rest on the sanctity of the family
   relation, it is of the last importance that the normal, or divinely
   constituted relation of the sexes be preserved in its integrity.

   Celibacy.

   Among the important questions to be considered under the head of this
   commandment, the first is, Whether the Bible teaches that there is any
   special virtue in a life of celibacy? This is really a question,
   whether there was an error in the creation of man.

   1. The very fact that God created man, male and female, declaring that
   it was not good for either to be alone, and constituted marriage in
   paradise, should be decisive on this subject. The doctrine which
   degrades marriage by making it a less holy state, has its foundation in
   Manicheeism or Gnosticism. It assumes that evil is essentially
   connected with matter; that sin has its seat and source in the body;
   that holiness is attainable only through asceticism and "neglecting of
   the body;" that because the "vita angelica" is a higher form of life
   than that of men here on earth, therefore marriage is a degradation.
   The doctrine of the Romish Church on this subject, therefore, is
   thoroughly anti-Christian. It rests on principles derived from the
   philosophy of the heathen. It presupposes that God is not the author of
   matter; and that He did not make man pure, when He invested him with a
   body.

   2. Throughout the Old Testament Scriptures marriage is represented as
   the normal state of man. The command to our first parents before the
   fall was, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth." Without
   marriage the purpose of God in regard to our world could not be carried
   out; it is, therefore, contradictory to the Scriptures to assume that
   marriage is less holy, or less acceptable to God than celibacy. To be
   unmarried, was regarded under the old dispensation as a calamity and a
   disgrace. (Judges xi. 37; Ps. lxxviii. 63; Is. iv. 1; xiii. 12.) The
   highest earthly destiny of a woman, according to the Old Testament
   Scriptures, which are the word of God, was not to be a nun, but to be
   the mistress of a family, and a mother of children. (Gen. xxx. 1; Ps.
   cxiii. 9; cxxvii. 3; cxxviii. 3, 4; Prov. xviii. 22; xxxi. 10, 28.)

   3. The same high estimate of marriage, characterizes the teachings of
   the New Testament. Marriage is declared to be "honourable in all."
   (Heb. xiii. 4.) Paul says, " Let every man have his own wife, and let
   every woman have her own husband." (1 Cor. vii. 2.) In 1 Timothy v. 14,
   he says: "I will, that the younger women marry." In 1 Timothy iv. 3,
   "forbidding to marry" is included among the doctrines of devils. As the
   truth comes from the Holy Spirit, so false doctrines, according to the
   Apostle's mode of thinking, come from Satan, and his agents, the
   demons; they are "the seducing spirits" spoken of in the same verse.
   [328] Our Lord more than once (Matt. xix. 5; Mark x. 7) quotes and
   enforces the original law given in Genesis ii. 24, that man shall
   "leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and
   they shall be one flesh." The same passage is quoted by the Apostle as
   containing a great and symbolical truth. (Eph. v. 31.) It is thus
   taught that the marriage relation is the most intimate and sacred that
   can exist on earth, to which all other human relations must be
   sacrificed. We accordingly find that from the beginning, with rare
   exceptions, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, confessors, and martyrs,
   have been married men. If marriage was not a degradation to them,
   surely it cannot be to monks and priests.

   The strongest proof of the sanctity of the marriage relation in the
   sight of God, is to be found in the fact that both in the Old and in
   the New Testaments, it is made the symbol of the relation between God
   and his people. "Thy Maker is thy husband," are the words of God, and
   contain a world of truth, of grace, and of love. The departure of the
   people from God, is illustrated by a reference to a wife forsaking her
   husband; while God's forbearance, tenderness, and love, area compared
   to those of a faithful husband to his wife. "As the bridegroom
   rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee." (Is.
   lxii. 5.) In the New Testament, this reference to the marriage
   relation, to illustrate the union between Christ and the Church, is
   frequent and instructive. The Church is called "the Bride, the Lamb's
   wife." (Rev. xxi. 9.) And the consummation of the work of salvation is
   set forth as the marriage, or the marriage-supper of the Lamb. (Rev.
   xix. 7 , 9.) In Ephesians v. 22-33, the union between husbands and
   wives, and the duties thence resulting, are set forth as so analogous
   to the union between Christ and his Church, that in some cases it is
   hard to determine to which union the language of the Apostle is to be
   applied. It is a matter of astonishment, in view of all these facts,
   that marriage has so extensively and persistently been regarded as
   something degrading, and celibacy or perpetual virginity as a special
   and peculiar virtue. No more striking evidence of the influence of a
   false philosophy in perverting the minds of even good men, is afforded
   in the whole history of the Church. Even the Reformers did not escape
   altogether from its influence. They often speak of marriage as the less
   of two evils; not as in itself a good; and not as the normal and
   appropriate state in which men and women should live, as designed by
   God in the very constitution of their nature, and as the best adapted
   to the exercise and development of all social and Christian virtues.
   Thus Calvin says: "Unde constat et aliam quamlibet, extra conjugium,
   societatem coram ipso [Deo] maledictam esse; et illam ipsam conjugalem
   in necessitatis remedium esse ordinatam, ne in effrenem libidinem
   proruamus. . . . . Jam quum per naturæ conditionem et accensa post
   lapsum libidine, mulieris consortio bis obnoxii simus, nisi quos
   singulari gratia Deus inde exemit; videant singuli quid sibi datum sit.
   Virginitas, fateor, virtus est non contemnenda: sed quoniam aliis
   negata est, allis nonnisi ad tempus concessa, qui ab incontinentia
   vexantur, et superiores in certamine esse nequeunt ad matrimonii
   subsidium se conferant, ut ita in suæ vocationis gradu castitatem
   colant." [329] That is, virginity is a virtue. Celibacy is a higher
   state than marriage. Those who cannot live in that state, should
   descend to the lower platform of married life. With such dregs of
   Manichean philosophy was the pure truth of the Bible contaminated, even
   as held by the most illustrious Reformers.

   4. The teaching of Scripture as to the sanctity of marriage is
   confirmed by the experience of the world. It is only in the marriage
   state that some of the purest, most disinterested, and most elevated
   principles of our nature are called into exercise. All that concerns
   filial piety, and parental and especially maternal affection, depends
   on marriage for its very existence. Yet on the purifying and
   restraining influence of these affections the well-being of human
   society is in a large measure dependent. It is in the bosom of the
   family that there is a constant call for acts of kindness, of
   sell-denial, of forbearance, and of love. The family, therefore, is the
   sphere the best adapted for the development of all the social virtues;
   and it may be safely said that there is far more of moral excellence
   and of true religion to be found in Christian households, than in the
   desolate homes of priests, or in the gloomy cells of monks and nuns. A
   man with his children or grandchildren on his knees, is an object of
   higher reverence than any emaciated anchorite in his cave.

   5. Our Lord teaches that a tree is known by its fruits. There has been
   no more prolific source of evil to the Church than the unscriptural
   notion of the special virtue of virginity and the enforced celibacy of
   the clergy and monastic vows, to which that action has given rise. This
   is the teaching of history. On this point the testimony of Romanists as
   well as of Protestants is decisive and overwhelming. It may be admitted
   that the Catholic clergy in this and in some other countries are as
   decorous in their lives, as the clergy of other denominations, without
   invalidating the testimony of history as to the evils of vows of
   celibacy.

   Protestants, while asserting the sanctity of marriage and denying the
   superior virtue of a life of celibacy, do not deny that there are times
   and circumstances in which celibacy is a virtue: i.e., that a man may
   perform a virtuous act in resolving never to marry. The Church often
   has work to do, for which single men are the only proper agents. The
   cares of a family, in other words, would unfit a man for the execution
   of the task assigned. This, however, does not suppose that celibacy is
   in itself a virtue. It may also happen that a rich man may be called
   upon to undertake a work which would necessitate his disencumbering
   himself of the care of his estate, and subjecting himself to a life of
   poverty. The same is true of the state. In fact military service, for
   the great majority of the rank and file of an army, is an estate of
   forced celibacy so long as the service continues. And even with regard
   to the officers, the liberty to marry is very much restricted in the
   standing armies of Europe. There are times when marriage is
   inexpedient. Our Lord in foretelling the destruction of Jerusalem said,
   "Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those
   days." It is the part of wisdom to escape such woes. When Christians
   had no security for life or home; when they were liable to be torn away
   from their families, or to have all means of providing for their wants
   taken out of their hands, it was better for them not to marry. It is in
   reference to such times and circumstances that the words of Christ, in
   the nineteenth chapter of Matthew, were uttered, and the advice of the
   Apostle, in the seventh chapter of First Corinthians was given. The
   Pharisees asked our Lord whether a man could put away his wife at
   pleasure. He referred them to the original institution of marriage, as
   showing that it was intended to be an indissoluble connection. His
   disciples said, In that case it is better that a man should not marry.
   Our Lord replied: Whether it is better for a man to marry or not, is
   not a question for every man to decide for himself. "That the unmarried
   state is better, is a saying not for every one, and indeed only for
   such as it is divinely intended for." [330] That is, those to whom the
   requisite grace is given, "Omnes hujus dicti capaces esse negans,
   significat electionem non esse positam in manu nostra, acsi de re nobis
   subjecta esset consultatio. Si quis utile sibi esse putat uxore carere,
   atque ita nullo examine habito, coelibatus legem sibi edicit, longe
   fallitur. Deus enim, qui pronuntiavit bonum esse, ut viro adjutrix sit
   mulier, contempti sui ordinis poenam exiget: quia nimium sibi arrogant
   mortales, dum se a coelesti vocatione eximere tentant. Porro non esse
   omnibus liberum, eligere utrum libuerit, inde probat Christus, quia
   speciale sit continentiæ donum: nam quum dicit, non omnes esse capaces,
   sed quibus datum est, clare demonstrat non omnibus esse datum." [331]
   Those to whom it is given to lead an unmarried life, as our Lord
   teaches (Matt. xix. 10), are not only those who by their natural
   constitution are unfit for the marriage state, but those whom God calls
   to special service in his Church and whom He fits for that work.

   The doctrine which Paul teaches on this subject is perfectly coincident
   with the teachings of our Lord. He recognizes marriage as a divine
   institution; as in itself good; as the normal and proper state in which
   men and women should live; but as it is necessarily attended by many
   cares and distractions, it was expedient in times of trouble, to remain
   unmarried. This is the purport of Paul's teachings in First Corinthians
   ii. No one of the sacred writers, whether in the Old or in the New
   Testament, so exalts and glorifies marriage as does this Apostle in his
   Epistle to the Ephesians. He, therefore, is not the man, guided as he
   was in all his teachings by the Spirit of God, to depreciate or
   undervalue it, as only the less of two evils. It is a positive good:
   the union of two human persons to supplement and complement the one the
   other in a way which is necessary to the perfection or full development
   of both. The wife is to her husband what the Church is to Christ.
   Nothing higher than this can possibly be said.

   History.

   No one can read the Epistles of Paul, especially those to the Ephesians
   and Colossians, without seeing clear indications of the prevalence,
   even in the apostolic churches, of the principles of that philosophy
   which held that matter was contaminating; and which inculcated
   asceticism as the most efficacious means of the purification of the
   soul. This doctrine had already been adopted and reduced to practice by
   the Essenes among the Jews. Farther East, under a somewhat different
   form, it had prevailed for ages before the Christian era, and still
   maintains its ground. According to the Brahminical philosophy the
   individuality of man depends on the body. Complete emancipation from
   the body, therefore, secures the merging of the finite into the
   infinite. The drop is lost in the ocean, and this is the highest and
   ultimate destiny of man. It is not therefore to be wondered at, that
   the early fathers came more or less under the influence of these
   principles, or that asceticism gained so rapidly and maintained so long
   its ascendancy in the Church. The depreciation of the divine
   institution of marriage, and the exaltation of virginity into the first
   place among Christian virtues, was the natural and necessary
   consequence of this spirit. Ignatius called voluntary virgins "the
   jewels of Christ." Justin Martyr desired celibacy to prevail to the
   "greatest possible extent." Tatian regarded marriage as inconsistent
   with spiritual worship. Origen "disabled himself in his youth" and
   regarded marriage as a pollution. Hieracas made "virginity a condition
   of salvation." Tertullian denounced second marriage as criminal, and
   represented celibacy as the ideal of Christian life, not only for the
   clergy, but also for the laity. Second marriage was early prohibited so
   far as the clergy were concerned, and soon came in their case the
   prohibition of marriage altogether. The Apostolical Constitutions
   prohibited priests from contracting marriage after consecration. The
   Council of Ancyra, A.D. 314, allowed deacons to marry, provided they
   stipulated for the privilege before ordination. The Council of Elvira,
   A.D. 305, forbade the continuance of the marriage relation (according
   to the common interpretation of its canons) to bishops, presbyters, and
   deacons on pain of deposition. [332] Jerome was fanatical in his
   denunciation of marriage; and even Augustine was carried away by the
   spirit of the age. In answer to the objection that if men acted on his
   principles the world would be depopulated, he answered So much the
   better, for in that case Christ would come the sooner. [333] Siricius,
   Bishop of Rome A.D. 385, decided that marriage was inconsistent with
   the clerical office; and was followed in this view by his successors.
   Great opposition, however, was experienced in enforcing celibacy, and
   it required all the energy of Gregory VII. to have the decisions of
   councils carried into effect. Ultimately, however, the rule, so far as
   the clergy are concerned, was acquiesced in, and received the
   authoritative sanction of the Council of Trent. That Council decided,
   [334] "Si quis dixerit, statum conjugalem anteponendum esse statui
   virginitatis, vel coelibatus, et non esse melius, et beatius manere in
   virginitate aut coelibatu, quam jungi matrimonio: anathema sit." On
   this assumed higher virtue of celibacy, in the preceding canon it was
   ordered: "Si quis dixerit, clericos in sacris ordinibus constitutos,
   vel regulares, castitatem solemniter professos, posse matrimonium
   contrahere, contractumque validum esse, non obstante lege
   ecclesiastica, vel voto: et oppositum nil aliud esse, quam damnare
   matrimonium; posseque omnes contrahere matrimonium, qui non sentiunt se
   castitatis, etiam si eam voterint, habere donum; anathema sit; cum Deus
   id recte petentibus non deneget, nec patiatur nos supra id, quod
   possumus, tentari."

   Although the doctrine that virginity, as the Roman Catechism expresses
   it, "summopere commendatur," as being better, and more perfect and holy
   than a state of marriage, is made the ostensible ground of the enforced
   celibacy of the clergy, it is manifest that hierarchical reasons had
   much to do in making the Romish Church so strenuous in insisting that
   its clergy should be unmarried. This Gregory VII. avows when he says,
   [335] "Non liberari potest ecclesia a servitute laicorum, nisi
   liberentur clerici ab uxoribus." And Melancthon felt authorized to say
   in reference to the celibacy of the clergy in the Church of Rome, "Una
   est vera et sola causa tuendi coelibatus, ut opes commodius
   administrentur et splendor ordinis retineatur." [336]

   As the Reformation was a return to the Scriptures as the only
   infallible rule of faith and practice; and as in the Scriptures
   marriage is exalted as a holy state, and no preeminence in excellence
   is assigned to celibacy or virginity; and as the Reformers denied the
   authority of the Church to make laws to bind the conscience or to
   curtail the liberty with which Christ had made his people free,
   Protestants pronounced with one voice against the obligation of
   monastic vows and of the celibacy of the clergy.

   The Greek Church petrified at an early date. It assumed the form which
   it still retains, before the doctrine of the special sanctity of
   celibacy had gained ascendancy. It abides therefore by the decisions of
   the Council of Chalcedon, A.D. 451, and of Trullo, A.D. 692, which
   permitted marriage to priests and deacons. Those Greeks who are in
   communion with the Church of Rome enjoy the same liberty. Benedict XIV.
   declared in reference to them, "Etsi expetendum quam maxime esset, ut
   Græci, qui sunt in sacris ordinibus constituti, castitatem non secus ac
   Latini servarent. Nihilominus, ut eorum clerici, subdiaconi, diaconi et
   presbyteri uxores in eorum ministerio retineant, dummodo ante sacros
   ordines, virgines, non viduas, neque corruptas duxerint, Romana non
   prohibet Ecclesia. Eos autem, qui viduam vel corruptam duxerunt, vel ad
   secunda vota, prima uxore mortua, convolarunt, ad subdiaconatum,
   diaconatum et presbyteratum promoveri omnino prohibemus." [337] In the
   Russian Church the priests are required to be married men; but second
   marriages are forthem prohibited. The bishops are chosen from the monks
   and must be unmarried.

   Marriage a Divine Institution.

   Marriage is a divine institution. (1.) Because founded on the nature of
   man as constituted by God. He made man male and female, and ordained
   marriage as the indispensable condition of the continuance of the race.
   (2.) Marriage was instituted before the existence of civil society, and
   therefore cannot in its essential nature be a civil institution. As
   Adam and Eve were man led not in virtue of any civil law, or by the
   intervention of a civil magistrate, so any man and woman cast together
   on a desert island, could lawfully take each other as husband and wife,
   It is a degradation of the institution to make it a mere civil
   contract. (3.) God commanded men to marry, when He commanded them to
   increase, and multiply and replenish the earth. (4.) God in his word
   has prescribed the duties belonging to the marriage relation; He has
   made known his will as to the parties who may lawfully be united in
   marriage; He has determined the continuance of the relation; and the
   causes which alone justify its dissolution. These matters are not
   subject to the will of the parties, or to the authority of the State.
   (5.) The vow of mutual fidelity made by husband and wife, is not made
   exclusively by each one to the other, but by each to God. When a man
   connects himself with a Christian Church he enters into covenant with
   his brethren in the Lord; mutual obligations are assumed; but
   nevertheless the covenant is made with God. He joins the Church in
   obedience to the will of God; he promises to regulate his faith and
   practice by the divine word; and the vow of fidelity is made to God. It
   is the same in marriage. It is a voluntary, mutual compact between
   husband and wife. They promise to be faithful to each other; but
   nevertheless they act in obedience to God, and promise to Him that they
   will live together as man and wife, according to his word. Any
   violation of the compact is, therefore, a violation of a vow made to
   God.

   Marriage is not a sacrament in the sense in which baptism and the
   Lord's Supper are sacraments, nor in the sense of the Romish Church;
   but it is none the less a sacred institution. Its solemnization is an
   office of religion. It should, therefore, be entered upon with due
   solemnity and in the fear of God; and should be celebrated, i.e., the
   ceremony should be performed by a minister of Christ. He alone is
   authorized to see to it that the law of God is adhered to; and he alone
   can receive and register the marriage vows as made to God. The civil
   magistrate can only witness it as a civil contract, and it is
   consequently to ignore its religious character and sanction to have it
   celebrated by a civil officer. As the essence of the marriage contract
   is the mutual compact of the parties in the sight of God and in the
   presence of witnesses, it is not absolutely necessary that it should be
   celebrated by a minister of religion or even by a civil magistrate. It
   may be lawfully solemnized, as among the Quakers, without the
   intervention of either. Nevertheless as it is of the greatest
   importance that the religious nature of the institution should be kept
   in view, it is incumbent on Christians, so far as they themselves are
   concerned, to insist that it should be solemnized as a religious
   service.

   Marriage as a Civil Institution.

   As a man's being a servant of God and bound to make his word the rule
   of his faith and practice, is not inconsistent with his being a servant
   of the state, and bound to render obedience to its laws; so it is not
   inconsistent with the fact that marriage is an ordinance of God, that
   it should be, in another aspect, a civil institution. It is so
   implicated in the social and civil relations of men that it of
   necessity comes under the cognizance of the state. It is therefore a
   civil institution. (1.) In so far as it is, and must be, recognized and
   enforced by the state. (2.) It imposes civil obligations which the
   state has the right to enforce. The husband is bound to sustain his
   wife, for example, and he is constrained by the civil law to the
   performance of this duty. (3.) Marriage also involves, on both sides,
   rights to property; and the claims of children born in wedlock to the
   property of their parents. All these questions concerning property fall
   legitimately under the control of the civil law. In many countries not
   only property, but rank, title, and political prerogatives are
   implicated with the question of marriage. (4.) It belongs to the state,
   therefore, as the guardian of these rights, to determine what marriages
   are lawful and what unlawful; how the contract is to be solemnized and
   authenticated; and what shall be its legal consequences. All these laws
   Christians are bound to obey, so far as obedience to them is consistent
   with a good conscience.

   The legitimate power of the state in all these matters is limited by
   the revealed will of God. It can make nothing an impediment to marriage
   which the Scriptures do not declare to be a bar to that union. It can
   make nothing a ground of dissolving the marriage contract which the
   Bible does not make a valid ground of divorce. And the state can attach
   none other than civil pains and penalty to the violation of its laws
   concerning marriage. This is only saying that a Christian government is
   bound to respect the conscientious convictions of the people. It is a
   violation of the principles of civil and religious liberty for the
   state to make its will paramount to the will of God. Plain as this
   principle seems to be, it is nevertheless constantly disregarded in
   almost all Christian nations, whether Catholic or Protestant. In
   England, for example, it is still the law, that no member of the royal
   family can marry without the consent of the reigning sovereign. If this
   meant nothing more than that any member of the royal family thus
   marrying, should forfeit for himself and his children all right of
   succession to the crown, it might be all right. But the real meaning is
   that such a marriage is null and void that parties otherwise lawfully
   married and whom God has joined together as man and wife, are not man
   and wife. This is to bring the law of man and the law of God into
   direct collision, and make the human supersede the divine. In Prussia a
   subordinate officer of the army cannot marry without the consent of his
   commander. If he should marry without that consent, it might be right
   to make him throw up his commission; but to say that his wife is not a
   wife, is not only untrue, but it is a monstrous injustice and cruelty.
   In England, until of late years, no marriage was valid unless
   solemnized in church, within canonical hours, and by a man in priest's
   orders. This law was designed specially for the protection of heiresses
   from the wiles of fortune-hunters. It might be just to determine that
   no marriage not thus solemnized should convey any right to property;
   but to say that parties married five minutes after twelve o'clock,
   noon, are not married at all, whereas had the ceremony been performed
   ten minutes sooner, they would be truly man and wife, shocks the
   conscience and common sense of men. So in this country before the
   abolition of slavery, according to the laws of our Southern States, no
   slave could marry. A young white man married a young woman, whom no one
   in the community supposed had a drop of African blood in her veins. It
   was proved, however, that she was a slave. Her husband purchased her,
   manumitted her, repudiated her, married another woman, and was received
   into the communion of a Presbyterian Church. The law of God was thus
   regarded as a mere nullity. [338]

   Because marriage is in some of its aspects a civil institution, to be
   regulated within certain limits, by the civil law, men have treated it
   as though it were a mere business engagement. They ignore its character
   as a divine institution, regulated and controlled by divine laws. Civil
   legislatures should remember that they can no more annul the laws of
   God than the laws of nature. If they pronounce those not to be married
   who, by the divine law, are married; or if they separate those whom God
   hath joined together, their laws are absolute nullities at the bar of
   conscience and in the sight of God.

   Monogamy.

   Marriage is a compact between one man and one woman to live together,
   as man and wife, until separated by death. According to this
   definition, first, the marriage relation can subsist only between one
   man and one woman; secondly, the union is permanent, i.e., it can be
   dissolved only by the death of one or both of the parties, except for
   reasons specified in the word of God; and thirdly, the death of one of
   the parties dissolves the union, so that it is lawful for the survivor
   to marry again.

   As to the first of these points, or that the Scriptural doctrine of
   marriage is opposed to and condemns polygamy, it is to be remarked, --

   1. That such has been the doctrine of the Christian Church in all ages
   and in every part of the world. There has never been a church calling
   itself Christian which tolerated a plurality cf wives among its
   members. There could hardly be a stronger proof than this fact that
   such is the law of Christ. It is morally certain that the whole Church
   cannot have mistaken, on such a subject as this, the mind and will of
   its divine Head and Master.

   2. Marriage as originally constituted and ordained by God was between
   one man and one woman. And the language of Adam when he received Eve
   from the hands of her Maker, proves that such was the essential nature
   of the relation: "And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and
   flesh of my flesh. . . . . Therefore shall a man leave his father and
   his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one
   flesh." (Gen. ii. 23, 24.) Or, as our Lord quotes and expounds the
   passage, "They twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more
   twain, but one flesh." (Mark x. 8.) "The two," and no more than two,
   become one. This was not only the language of unfallen Adam in
   Paradise, but the language of God uttered through the lips of Adam, as
   appears not only from the circumstances of the case, but also from our
   Lord's attributing to them divine authority, as He evidently does in
   the passage just quoted. Thus the law of marriage as originally
   instituted by God, required that the union should be between one man
   and one woman. This law could be changed only by the authority by which
   it was originally enacted. Delitzsch remarks on this passage: [339] "In
   these words not only the deepest spiritual union, but a union
   comprehending the whole nature of man, an all comprehending personal
   communion, is represented as the essence of marriage; and monogamy is
   set forth as its natural and divinely appointed form."

   3. Although this original law was partially disregarded in later times
   it was never abrogated. Polygamy and divorce were in a measure
   tolerated under the Mosaic law, yet in all ages among the Hebrews,
   monogamy was the rule, and polygamy the exception, as it was among
   other civilized nations of antiquity. Polygamy first appears among the
   descendants of Cain. (Gen. iv. 19.) Noah and his sons had each but one
   wife. Abraham had but one wife, until the impatience of Sarah for
   children led him to take Hagar as a concubine. The same rule of
   marriage was observed by the prophets as a class. Polygamy was confined
   in a great measure to kings and princes. There was also an honourable
   distinction made between the wife and the concubine. The former
   retained her preeminence as the head of the family. Numerous passages
   of the Old Testament go to prove that monogamy was considered as the
   law of marriage, from which plurality of wives was a departure.
   Throughout the Proverbs, for example, it is the blessing of a good
   wife, not of wives, that is continually set forth. (Prov. xii. 4; xix.
   14; xxxi. 10 ff.) The apocryphal books contain clear evidence that
   after the exile monogamy was almost universal among the Jews; and it
   may be inferred from such passages as Luke i. 5; Acts v. 1, and many
   others, that the same was true at the time of the advent of Christ.

   With regard to the toleration of polygamy under the Mosaic law, it is
   to be remembered that the seventh commandment belongs to the same
   category as the sixth and eighth. These laws are not founded on the
   essential nature of God, and therefore are not immutable. They are
   founded on the permanent relations of men in their present state of
   existence. From this it follows, (1.) That they bind men only in their
   present state. The laws of property and marriage can have no
   application, so far as we know, to the future world, where men shall be
   as angels, neither marrying nor giving in marriage. (2.) These laws
   being founded on the permanent and natural relations of men, cannot be
   set aside by human authority, because those relations are not subject
   to the will or ordinance of men. (3.) They may however be dispensed
   with by God. He commanded the Israelites to despoil the Egyptians and
   to dispossess the Canaanites, but this does not prove that one nation
   may, of its own motion, seize on the inheritance of another people. If
   God, therefore, at any time said to any people granted permission to
   practise polygamy, then so long as that permission lasted and for those
   to whom it was given, polygamy was lawful, and at all other times and
   for all other persons it was unlawful. This principle is clearly
   recognized in what our Saviour teaches concerning divorce. It was
   permitted the Jews under the Mosaic law to put away their wives; as
   soon as that law was abolished, the right of divorce ceased.

   4. Monogamy, however, does not rest exclusively on the original
   institution of marriage, or upon the general drift of the Old Testament
   teaching, but mainly on the clearly revealed will of Christ. His will
   is the supreme law for all Christians, and rightfully for all men. When
   the Pharisees came to Him and asked Him whether a man could lawfully
   put away his wife, He answered, that marriage as instituted by God was
   an indissoluble union between one man and one woman; and, therefore,
   that those whom God had joined together no man could put asunder. This
   is the doctrine clearly taught in Matthew xix. 4-9; Mark x. 4-9; Luke
   xvi. 18; Matthew v. 32. In these passages our Lord expressly declares
   that if a man marries while his first wife is living he commits
   adultery. The exception which Christ himself makes to this rule, will
   be considered under the head of divorce.

   The Apostle teaches the same doctrine in Romans vii. 2, 3: "The woman
   which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband, so long as he
   liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her
   husband. So then, if while her husband liveth, she be married to
   another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be
   dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though
   she be married to another man." The doctrine of this passage is that
   marriage is a compact between one man and one woman, which can be
   dissolved only by the death of one of the parties. So in 1 Corinthians
   vii. 2: "Let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her
   own husband," it is taken for granted that, in the Christian Church, a
   plurality of wives is as much out of the question as a plurality of
   husbands. This assumption runs through the whole New Testament. We not
   only never read of a Christian's having two or more wives; but whenever
   the duty of the marriage relation is spoken of, it is always of the
   husband to his wife, and of the wife to her husband. In the judgment,
   therefore, of the whole Christian Church, marriage is a covenant
   between one man and one woman to live together as husband and wife
   until separated by death.

   5. This Scriptural law is confirmed by the providential law which
   secures the numerical equality of the sexes. Had polygamy been
   according to the divine purpose, we should naturally expect that more
   women would be born than men. But the reverse is the fact. There are
   more men than women born into the world. The excess, however, is only
   sufficient to provide for the greater peril to life to which men are
   exposed. The law of providence is the numerical equality of the sexes;
   and this is a clear intimation of the will of God that every man should
   have his own wife, and every woman her own husband. Such being the will
   of God, as revealed both in his word and in his providence, everything
   which tends to counteract it must be evil in its nature and
   consequences. The doctrine which depreciated marriage, and made
   celibacy a virtue, flooded the Church with corruption. And everything
   in our modern civilization and modes of living which renders marriage
   difficult, and consequently infrequent, is to be deprecated, and if
   possible removed. That every man should have his own wife and every
   woman her own husband, is the divinely appointed preventive of the
   "Social Evil" with all its unutterable horrors. [340] Every other
   preventive is human and worthless. Rather than that the present state
   of things should continue, it would be better to return to the old
   patriarchal usage, and let parents give their sons and daughters in
   marriage as soon as they attained the proper age, on the best terms
   they can.

   6. As all the permanently obligatory laws of God are founded on the
   nature of his creatures, it follows that if He has ordained that
   marriage must be the union of one man and one woman, there must be a
   reason for this in the very constitution of man and in the nature of
   the marriage relation. That relation must be such that it cannot
   subsist between one and many; between one man and more than one woman.
   This is plain, first, from the nature of the love which it involves;
   and secondly, from the nature of the union which it constitutes. First,
   conjugal love is peculiar and exclusive. It can have but one object. As
   the love of a mother for a child is peculiar, and can have no other
   object than her own child, so the love of a husband can have no other
   object than his wife, and the love of a wife no other object than her
   husband. It is a love not only of complacency and delight, but also of
   possession, of property, and of rightful ownership. This is the reason
   why jealousy in man or woman is the fiercest of all human passions. It
   involves a sense of injury; of the violation of the most sacred rights;
   more sacred even than the rights of property or life. Conjugal love,
   therefore, cannot by possibility exist except between one man and one
   woman. Monogamy has its foundation in the very constitution of our
   nature. Polygamy is unnatural, and necessarily destructive of the
   normal, or divinely constituted relation between husband and wife.

   Secondly, in another aspect, the union involved in marriage cannot
   exist except between one man and one woman. It is not merely a union of
   feeling and of interests. It is such a union as to produce, in some
   sense, identity. The two become one. Such is the declaration of our
   Lord. Husband and wife are one, in a sense which justified the Apostle
   in saying as he does, in Ephesians v. 30, that the wife is bone of her
   husband's bone, and flesh of his flesh. She is his body. She is himself
   (v. 28). Such is this union that "Qui uxorem repudiat, quasi dimidiam
   sui partem a seipso avellit. Hoc autem minime patitur natura, ut corpus
   suum quisque discerpat." What all this means it may be hard for us to
   understand. It is certain, -- (1.) That it does not refer to anything
   material, or to any identification of substance. When Adam said of Eve,
   "This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh," he doubtless
   referred to her being formed out of his body. But as these words are
   used by the Apostle to express the relation of all wives to their
   husbands, they must be understood of something else than identity of
   substance. (2.) The oneness of man and wife, of which the Scriptures
   speak cannot be understood in any sense inconsistent with their
   distinct subsistence or personality. They may be very different in
   character and destiny. The one may be saved, the other lost. (3.) It is
   evident, however, that the meaning of the strong language of Scripture
   on this subject is not exhausted, by representing the marriage union as
   being merely one of affection; or by saying that the husband is the
   complement of the wife and the wife of the husband; that is, that the
   marriage relation is necessary to the completeness of our nature and to
   its full development in the present state of existence; that there are
   capacities, feelings, and virtues which are not otherwise or elsewhere
   called into exercise. All this may be true, but it is not the whole
   truth. (4.) There is, in a certain sense, a community of life between
   husband and wife. We are accustomed to say, and to say truly, that the
   life of parents is communicated to their children. Each nation and
   every historical family has a form of life by which it is
   distinguished. As, therefore, the life of a father and the life of his
   son are the same, in that the blood (i.e., the life) of the parent
   flows in the veins of his children; so in an analogous sense the life
   of the husband and wife is one. They have a common life, and that
   common or joint life is transmitted to their offspring. This is the
   doctrine of the early Church. The Apostolical Constitutions say: [341]
   he gune koinonos esti biou, enoumene eis hen soma ek duo para Theou.

   The analogy which the Apostle traces out in Ephesians v. 22-33, between
   the conjugal relation and the union between Christ and his Church,
   brings out the Scriptural doctrine of marriage more clearly than
   perhaps any other passage in the Bible. No analogy is expected to
   answer in all respects, and no illustration borrowed from earthly
   relations can bring out all the fulness of the things of God. The
   relation, therefore, between a husband and his wife, is only an
   adumbration of the relation of Christ to his Church. Still there is an
   analogy between the two, (1.) As the Apostle teaches, the love of
   Christ to his Church is peculiar and exclusive. It is such as He has
   for no other class or body of rational creatures in the universe. So
   the love of the husband for his wife is peculiar and exclusive. It is
   such as he has for no other object; a love in which no one can
   participate. (2.) Christ's love for his Church is self-sacrificing. He
   gave himself for it. He purchased the Church with his blood. So the
   husband should, and when true, does, in all things sacrifice himself
   for his wife. (3.) Christ and his Church are one; one in the sense that
   the Church is his body. So the husband and wife are in such a sense
   one, that a man in loving his wife loves himself. (4.) Christ's life is
   communicated to the Church. As the life of the head is communicated to
   the members of the human body; and the life of the vine to the
   branches, so there is, in a mysterious sense, a community of life
   between Christ and his Church. In like manner, in a sense no less truly
   mysterious, there is a community of life between husband and wife.

   From all this it follows that as it would be utterly incongruous and
   impossible that Christ should have two bodies, two brides, two
   churches, so it is no less incongruous and impossible that a man should
   have two wives. That is, the conjugal relation, as it is set forth in
   Scripture, cannot by possibility subsist, except between one man and
   one woman.

   Conclusions.

   1. If such be the true doctrine of marriage, it follows, as just
   stated, that polygamy destroys its very nature. It is founded on a
   wrong view of the nature of woman; places her in a false and degrading
   position; dethrones and despoils her; and is productive of innumerable
   evils.

   2. It follows that the marriage relation is permanent and indissoluble.
   A limb may be violently severed from the body, and lose all vital
   connection with it; and husband and wife may be thus violently
   separated, and their conjugal relation annulled; but in both cases the
   normal connection is permanent.

   3. It follows that the state can neither constitute nor dissolve the
   marriage relation. It can no more free a husband or wife "a vinculo
   matrimonii," than it can free a father "a vinculo paternitatis." It may
   protect a child from the injustice or cruelty of its father, or even,
   for due cause, remove him from all parental control, and it may
   legislate about its property, but the natural bond between parents and
   children is beyond its control. So the state may legislate about
   marriage, and determine its accidents and legal consequences; it may
   decide who, in the sight of the law, shall be regarded as husband and
   wife, and when, or under what circumstances, the legal or civil rights
   and privileges arising out of the relation shall cease to be enforced;
   and it may protect the person and rights of the wife, and, if
   necessary, remove her from the control of her husband, but the conjugal
   bond it cannot dissolve. All decrees of divorce "a vinculo matrimonii,"
   issued by civil or ecclesiastical authorities, so far as the conscience
   is concerned, are perfectly inoperative, unless antecedently to such
   decree and by the law of God, the conjugal relation has ceased to
   exist.

   4. It follows from the Scriptural doctrine of marriage that all laws
   are evil which tend to make those two whom God pronounces to be one;
   such laws, for example, as give to the wife the right to conduct
   business, contract debts, and sue and be sued, in her own name. This is
   attempting to correct one class of evils at the cost of incurring
   others a hundred-fold greater. The Word of God is the only sure guide
   of legislative action as well as of individual conduct.

   5. It need hardly be remarked that it follows from the nature of
   marriage, that next to murder, adultery is the greatest of all social
   crimes, under the Old Dispensation it was punishable with death. And
   even now it is practically impossible to convict a husband of murder
   who kills the man who has committed adultery with his wife. This comes
   from human laws being in conflict with the laws of nature and of God.
   The law of God regards marriage as identifying a man and his wife; the
   laws of the state too often regard it as merely a civil contract, and
   give an injured husband no redress but a suit for damages for the
   pecuniary loss he has sustained by being deprived of the services of
   his wife. The penalty for adultery, to be in any due proportion to the
   magnitude of the crime, should be severe and degrading.

   6. The relative duties of husband and wife arising out of their
   relation, may be expressed in a few comprehensive words. The husband is
   to love, protect, and cherish his wife as himself, i.e., as being to
   him another self. The duties of the wife are set forth in the
   time-honoured Christian formula, "love, honour, and obey."

   Converted Polygamists.

   The question has been mooted, Whether a polygamist, when converted to
   Christianity, should be required to repudiate all his wives but one, as
   a condition of his admission into the Christian Church? The answer to
   this question has been sought from three sources: First, the Scriptural
   doctrine of marriage; secondly, the example of the Apostles when
   dealing with such cases; and thirdly, from a consideration of the
   effects which would follow from making monogamy an indispensable
   condition of admission to the Church.

   As to the first point, it is admitted by all Christians, that it ie the
   law of God, the law of Christ, and consequently the law of the
   Christian Church that polygamy is sinful, being a violation of the
   original and permanently obligatory law of marriage. As every man who
   enters the Church professes to be a Christian, and as every Christian
   is bound to obey the law of Christ, it seems plain that no man should
   be received into the communion of the Church who does not conform to
   the law of Christ concerning marriage. The only question is, Whether
   Christ has made a special exception in favour of those who in the times
   of their ignorance, contracted the obligations of marriage with more
   than one woman? It is of course possible that such an exception might
   have been made. It would be analogous to the temporary suspension of
   the original law of marriage in favour of the hardhearted Jews. Has
   then such an exception been made? This is the second point to be
   considered. It concerns a matter of fact. Those who assume that such an
   exception has been made, are bound to produce the clearest evidence of
   the fact. This is necessary not only to satisfy the consciences of the
   parties concerned, but also to justify a departure from a plainly
   revealed law of God. It would be a very serious matter to set up in a
   heathen country, a church not conformed in this matter to the usual law
   of Christendom. Missionaries are sent forth to teach not only Christian
   doctrines but Christian morals. And the churches which they found,
   profess to be witnesses for Christ as to what He would have men to
   believe, and as to what He would have them to do. They ought not to be
   allowed to bear false testimony. It is certain that there is no clear
   and definite expression of the will of Christ, recorded in the New
   Testament, that the case contemplated should be an exception to the
   Scriptural law of marriage. There is no instance recorded in the New
   Testament, of the admission of a polygamist to the Christian Church. It
   has, indeed, been inferred from 1 Timothy iii. 2, where the Apostle
   says, a bishop must be "the husband of one wife," that a private member
   of the Church might have more wives than one. But this is in itself a
   very precarious inference; and being inconsistent with Christ's express
   prohibition, it is altogether inadmissible. The meaning of the passage
   has been much disputed. What the Apostle requires is that a bishop
   should be in all respects an exemplary man: not given to wine, no
   striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; the husband of one wife, i.e., not
   a polygamist. This no more implies that other men may be polygamists,
   than his saying that a bishop must not be greedy of filthy lucre and
   not a brawler, implies that other men may be covetous or contentious.
   According to another and widely accepted interpreation of the passage
   in 1 Timothy iii. 2, and the corresponding passage in Titus i. 6, the
   injunction of the Apostle is that a man who has been married more than
   once, must not be appointed a bishop or presbyter. If this be the true
   meaning of the Apostle, his language affords still less ground for the
   argument drawn from it in favour of the lawfulness of polygamy in
   church members. If even second marriage was forbidden to presbyters, a
   fortiori must polygamy be regarded as inconsistent with the law of
   Christ.

   This interpretation was very generally adopted in the early Church,
   during the Middle Ages, and by Romanists, and is sustained by many of
   the recent commentators. Bishop Ellicott decides in favour of this
   interpretation. His reasons are, -- (1.) The opinion of the early
   writers and of some councils. (2.) The special respect paid among
   pagans to a woman who was "univira." (3.) The propriety, in the case of
   episkopoi and diakonoi, of a greater temperance. (4.) And the
   manifestation of a greater sanctity (semnotes) of a single marriage,
   which he thinks is indicated even in Scripture (Luke ii. 36, 37). The
   objections to it are, In the first place, that it rests on an
   unscriptural view of marriage. According to the Bible, marriage is a
   better, higher, and holier, because the normal state, than celibacy. It
   was only in the interest of the doctrine of the peculiar sanctity of
   celibacy, that this interpretation was adopted by the fathers.

   In the second place, it rests on the no less unscriptural assumption of
   the superior holiness of the clergy. No higher degree of moral purity
   is required of them than of other men, for the simple reason that every
   man is required to be perfectly holy in heart and life. The
   interpretation in question gained the stronger hold of the Church as
   the doctrine of "the grace of orders," and of the priesthood of the
   clergy gained ascendancy. When the Reformation came and swept away
   these two doctrines, it removed the two principal supports of the
   interpretation in question. It is not to be admitted that there can be
   anything unholy in second marriages, which an infinitely holy God
   declares to be lawful (Rom. vii. 3), nor can it be conceded that the
   clergy are holier than other believers, seeing that the only priesthood
   in the Church on earth is the priesthood common to all believers.

   In the third place, the interpretation which makes the Apostle
   interdict second marriages to bishops and deacons, is contrary to the
   natural meaning of the words. The parallel passage in Titus i. 5, 6,
   reads thus: "That thou shouldest, . . . . . ordain elders in every
   city, as I had appointed thee: if any be blameless, the husband of one
   wife, etc;" ei' tis estin . . . mias gunaikos, aner, if any one is at
   this present time the husband of one wife.' It is the present state and
   character of the man that are to be taken into the account. He might
   before have been unmarried, or even a polygamist, but when ordained, he
   must, if married at all, be the husband of but one woman. "Qui sit: non
   autem, Qui fuerit," says Calvin in his comment on 1 Timothy iii. 2. And
   on Titus i. 6 he says, "Qui defuncta uxore alteram jam coelebs inducit,
   nihilominus unius uxoris maritus censeri debet. Non enim eligendum
   docet qui fuerit maritus unius uxoris, sed qui sit." Whichever of these
   interpretations of 1 Timothy iii. 2, be adopted, whether we understand
   the Apostle to forbid that a polygamist, or that a man twice married,
   should be admitted to the ministry, in neither case does the passage
   give authority to receive a polygamist into the fellowship of the
   Church. Considering, then, that monogamy is the undoubted law of
   Christ; considering that we have no evidence that He made an exception
   in favour of heathen converts; and considering the great importance
   that churches, founded in heathen lands, should bear true witness of
   the doctrines and precepts of Christianity, it would seem clear that no
   man having more than one wife should be admitted to Christian
   fellowship.

   The third aspect of this question concerns the effects of enforcing the
   Christian law of marriage in heathen lands. It is urged that this would
   result in great cruelty and injustice. For a man to cast off women whom
   he had engaged to protect and cherish, to abandon not only them but
   their children, it is said, cannot be reconciled with any right
   principle. To this it may be replied, (1.) That in many heathen
   countries it is not the husband who supports the wives, but the wives
   who support the husband. They are his slaves, and sustain him by their
   labour. There would be no great hardship in his setting them free. (2.)
   But when this is not the case, it does not follow that because a man
   ceases to regard several women as his wives, he should cease to provide
   for them, and for the welfare of his children. This in any event, as a
   Christian, he is bound to do.

   It is also suggested, as a difficulty in this matter, that it is hard
   to determine which of his several wives a converted polygamist should
   retain. Some say, that it is the one first married; others say, that he
   should be allowed to make his own selection. If marriage among the
   heathen were what it is in Christian countries, there would be no room
   for doubt on this subject. Then the first contract would be the only
   binding one, and all the rest null and void. But in the Christian sense
   of the word there has been no marriage in any case. There has been no
   promise and vow of mutual fidelity. The relation of a heathen
   polygamist to the women of his harem, is more analogous to concubinage
   than to Christian marriage. The relation of a heathen polygamist to his
   numerous wives, is so different from the conjugal relation as
   contemplated in Scripture, as to render it at least doubtful whether
   the husband s obligation is exclusively, or preeminently, to the woman
   first chosen. This is a point of casuistry to which those who expect to
   labour in heathen countries should direct their attention. The Romish
   Church decides in favour of the first wife. The Roman Catechism [342]
   says: "Atque ob eam rem fieri intelligimus, ut, si infidels quispiam,
   gentis suæ more et consuetudine, plures uxores duxisset, cum ad veram
   religionem conversus fuerit, jubeat eum Ecclesia ceteras omnes
   relinquere, ac priorem tantum justæ et legitimæ uxoris loco habere."

   Divorce.

   The questions which call for, at least a brief consideration, under
   this head are, (1.) What is divorce, and what are its legitimate
   effects? (2.) What are the Scriptural grounds of divorce? (3.) What are
   the Romish doctrine, and practice on this subject? (4.) What are the
   doctrine and practice of Protestant Churches and countries? (5.) What
   is the duty of the Church and of its officers in cases where the laws
   of the state on this subject are in conflict with the law of God? Works
   on civil and canon law, when treating of divorce, take a much wider
   range than this, but the points above indicated seem to include those
   of most interest and importance to the theologian.

   Divorce; its Nature and Effects.

   Divorce is not a mere separation, whether temporary or permanent, "a
   mensa et thoro." It is not such a separation as leaves the parties in
   the relation of husband and wife, and simply relieves them from the
   obligation of their relative duties. Divorce annuls the "vinculum
   matrimonii," so that the parties are no longer man and wife. They stand
   henceforth to each other in the same relation as they were before
   marriage. That this is the true idea of divorce is plain from the fact
   that under the old dispensation if a man put away his wife, she was at
   liberty to marry again. (Deut. xxiv. 1, 2.) This of course supposes
   that the marriage relation to her former husband was effectually
   dissolved. Our Lord teaches the same doctrine. The passages in the
   Gospels, referring to this subject, are Matthew v. 31, 32; xix. 3-9;
   Mark x. 2-12; and Luke xvi. 18. The simple meaning of these passages
   seems to be, that marriage is a permanent compact, which cannot be
   dissolved at the will of either of the parties. If, therefore, a man
   arbitrarily puts away his wife and marries another, he commits
   adultery. If he repudiates her on just grounds and marries another, he
   commits no offence. Our Lord makes the guilt of marrying after
   separation to depend on the ground of the separation. Saying, that if a
   man puts away his wife for any cause save fornication, and marries
   another, he commits adultery'; is saying that the offence is not
   committed if the specified ground of divorce exists.' And this is
   saying that divorce, when justifiable, dissolves the marriage tie.

   Although this seems so plainly to be the doctrine of the Scriptures,
   the opposite doctrine prevailed early in the Church, and soon gained
   the ascendancy. Augustine himself taught in his work "De Conjugiis
   Adulterinis," [343] and elsewhere, that neither of the parties after
   divorce could contract a new marriage. In his "Retractions," however,
   he expresses doubt on the subject. It passed, however, into the canon
   law, and received the authoritative sanction of the Council of Trent,
   which says, [344] "Si quis dixerit, ecclesiam errare, cum docuit et
   docet, juxta evangelicam et apostolicam doctrinam, propter adulterium
   alterius conjugum matrimonii vinculum non posse dissolvi; et utrumque,
   vel etiam innocentem, qui causam adulterio non dedit, non posse, altero
   conjuge vivente, aliud matrimonium contrahere; moecharique eum, qui,
   dimissa adultera, aliam duxerit, et eam, quæ, dimisso adultero, alii
   nupserit; anathema sit." This is the necessary consequence of the
   doctrine, that the marriage relation can be dissolved only by death.
   The indisposition of the mediæval and Romish Church to admit of
   remarriages after divorce, is no doubt to be attributed in part to the
   low idea of the marriage state prevailing in the Latin Church. It had
   its ground, however, in the interpretation given to certain passages of
   Scripture. In Mark x. 11, 12, and in Luke xvi. 18, our Lord says
   without any qualification: "Whosoever putteth away his wife, and
   marrieth another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that
   is put away from her husband, committeth adultery." This was taken as
   the law on the subject, without regard to what is said in Matthew v.
   31, 32, and xix. 3-9. As, however, there is no doubt of the genuineness
   of the passages in Matthew, they cannot be overlooked. One expression
   of the will of Christ is as authoritative and as satisfactory as a
   thousand repetitions could make it. The exception stated in Matthew,
   therefore, must stand. The reason for the omission in Mark and Luke may
   be accounted for in different ways. It is said by some that the
   exception was of necessity understood from its very nature, whether
   mentioned or not. Or having been stated twice, its repetition was
   unnecessary. Or what perhaps is most probable, as our Lord was speaking
   to Pharisees, who held that a man might put away his wife when he
   pleased, it was enough to say that such divorces as they were
   accustomed to, did not dissolve the bonds of marriage, and that the
   parties remained as much man and wife as they were before. Under the
   Old Testament, divorce on the ground of adultery, was out of the
   question, because adultery was punished by death. And, therefore, it
   was only when Christ was laying down the law of his own kingdom, under
   which the death penalty for adultery was to be abolished, that it was
   necessary to make any reference to that crime.

   It has been earnestly objected to the doctrine that adultery dissolves
   the marriage bond, that both parties, the guilty as well the innocent
   become free, and either may contract a new marriage. If this be so, it
   is said, that all that a man, who wishes to get rid of his wife, has to
   do, is to commit that offence. He will then be at liberty to marry whom
   he chooses. To this it might be a sufficient answer to say that the
   objection bears rather against the wisdom of the law, than against the
   fact that it is the law; or in other words, the objection is against
   the plain meaning of the words of Christ. But it is to be remembered,
   that adultery is a crime in the sight of man as well as in the sight of
   God, and as such it ought to be punished. Under the old dispensation it
   was punished by death; under the new, it may be punished by
   imprisonment, or by prohibition of any future marriage. Christ leaves
   the punishment of this, as of other crimes, to be determined by his
   disciples in their civil capacity. All He does is to teach what its
   effects are, "in foro conscientiæ," as to the marriage bond.

   Grounds of Divorce.

   As already stated, marriage is an indissoluble compact between one man
   and one woman. It cannot be dissolved by any voluntary act of
   repudiation on the part of the contracting parties; nor by any act of
   the Church or State. "Those whom God has joined together, no man can
   put asunder." The compact may, however, be dissolved, although by no
   legitimate act of man. It is dissolved by death. It is dissolved by
   adultery; and as Protestants teach, by wilful desertion. In other
   words, there are certain things which from their nature work a
   dissolution of the marriage bond. All the legitimate authority the
   state has in the premises is to take cognizance of the fact that the
   marriage is dissolved; officially to announce it, and to make suitable
   provision for the altered relation of the parties.

   Under the preceding head it has already been shown that according to
   the plain teaching of our Saviour the marriage bond is annulled by the
   crime of adultery. The reason of this is, that the parties are no
   longer one, in the mysterious sense in which the Bible declares a man
   and his wife to be one. [345] The Apostle teaches on this subject the
   same doctrine that Christ had taught. The seventh chapter of his First
   Epistle to the Corinthians is devoted to the subject of marriage, in
   reference to which several questions had been proposed to him.

   He first lays down the general principle, founded on the Word of God
   and the nature of man, that it is best that every man should have his
   own wife and every wife her own husband; but in view of the "present
   (or imminent) distress," he advises his readers not to marry. He writes
   to the Corinthians as a man would write to an army about to enter on a
   most unequal conflict in an enemy's country, and for a protracted
   period. He tells them: This is no time for you to think of marriage.
   You have a right to marry. And in general it is best that all men
   should marry. But in your circumstances marriage can only lead to
   embarrassment and increase of suffering.' This limitation of his advice
   not to marry, to men in the circumstances of those to whom the advice
   is given, is not only stated in so many words in verse 26, but it is
   the only way in which Paul can be reconciled with himself or with the
   general teaching of the Bible. It has already been remarked, that no
   one of the sacred writers speaks in more exalted terms of marriage than
   this Apostle. He represents it as a most ennobling spiritual union,
   which raises a man out of himself and makes him live for another; a
   union so elevated and refining as to render it a fit symbol of the
   union between Christ and his Church. Marriage, according to this
   Apostle, does for man in the sphere of nature, what union with Christ
   does for him in the sphere of grace.

   Having thus given it as a matter of advice that it was best, under
   existing circumstances, for Christians not to marry, he proceeds to
   give directions to those who were already married. Of these here were
   two classes: first, those where both husband and wife were Christians;
   and secondly, those where one of the parties was a believer and the
   other an unbeliever, i.e., a Jew or a heathen. With regard to the
   former he says, that as according to the law of Christ the marriage is
   indissoluble, neither party had the right to repudiate the other. But
   if, in violation of the law of Christ, a wife had deserted her husband,
   she was bound either to remain unmarried, or to be reconciled to her
   husband. The Apostle thus impliedly recognizes the principle that there
   may be causes which justify a woman's leaving her husband, which do not
   justify a dissolution of the marriage bond.

   With regard to those cases in which one of the parties was a Christian
   and the other an unbeliever, he teaches, first, that such marriages are
   lawful, and, therefore, ought not to be dissolved. But, secondly, that
   if the unbelieving partner depart, i.e., repudiates the marriage, the
   believing partner is not bound; i.e., is no longer bound by the
   marriage compact. This seems to be the plain meaning. If the
   unbelieving partner is willing to continue in the marriage relation,
   the believing party is bound; bound, that is, to be faithful to the
   marriage compact. If the unbeliever is not willing to remain, the
   believer in that case is not bound; i.e., bound by the marriage
   compact. In other words, the marriage is thereby dissolved. This
   passage is parallel to Romans vii. 2. The Apostle there says, a wife
   "is bound by the law to her husband, so long as he liveth; but if the
   husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband." So here he
   says, A wife is bound to her husband if he is willing to remain with
   her; but if he deserts her, she is free from him.' That is, wilful
   desertion annuls the marriage bond. This desertion, however, must be
   deliberate and final. This is implied in the whole context. The case
   contemplated is where the unbelieving husband refuses any longer to
   regard his believing partner as his wife.

   This interpretation of the passage is given not only by the older
   Protestant interpreters, but also by the leading modern commentators,
   as De Wette, Meyer, Alford, and Wordsworth, and in the Confessions of
   the Lutheran and Reformed Churches. Even the Romanists take the same
   view. They hold, indeed, that among Christians marriage is absolutely
   indissoluble except by the death of one of the parties. But if one of
   the partners be an unbeliever, then they hold that desertion annuls the
   marriage contract. On this point Cornelius à Lapide, of Louvain and
   Rome, says, "Nota, Apostolum permittere hoc casu non tantum thori
   divortium sed etiam matrimonii; ita ut possit conjux fidelis aliud
   matrimonium inire." Lapide refers to Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and
   Ambrose in support of this opinion. [346] The Canon Law, under the
   title "Divortiis" teaches the same doctrine. Wordsworth's comment on
   the passage is, "Although a Christian may not put away his wife, being
   an unbeliever, yet if the wife desert her husband (chorizetai) he may
   contract a second marriage."

   The Romanists indeed rest their sanction to remarriage in the case
   supposed, on the ground that there is an essential difference between
   marriage where one or both the parties are heathen, and marriage where
   both parties are Christians. This, however, makes no difference. Paul
   had just said that such unequal marriages were lawful and valid.
   Neither party could legitimately repudiate or leave the other. The
   ground of divorce indicated is not difference of religion, but
   desertion.

   There is a middle ground taken by many, both ancients and moderns, in
   the interpretation of this passage. They admit that desertion justifies
   divorce, but not the remarriage of the party deserted. To this it may
   be objected, --

   1. That this is inconsistent with the nature of divorce. We have
   already seen that divorce among the Jews, as explained by Christ, and
   as understood in the apostolic Church, was such a separation of man and
   wife as dissolved the marriage bond. This idea was expressed in the use
   of the words apoluein, aphienai, chorizein and these are the words here
   used.

   2. This interpretation is inconsistent with the context and with the
   design of the Apostle. Among the questions submitted to his decision,
   was this, Is it lawful for a Christian to remain in the marriage
   relation with an unbeliever?' Paul answers, Yes; such marriages are
   lawful and valid. Therefore if the unbeliever is willing to continue
   the marriage relation, the believer remains bound; but if the
   unbeliever refuses to continue the marriage, the believer is no longer
   bound by it.' To say that the believer is no longer bound to give up
   his or her religions which seems to be Neander's idea, or is not bound
   to force himself or herself upon an unwilling partner, would be nothing
   to the point. No Christian could think himself bound to give up his
   religion, and no one could think it possible that married life could be
   continued without the consent of the parties. The question, in this
   sense, was not worth either asking or answering.

   3. Desertion, from the nature of the offence, is a dissolution of the
   marriage bond. Why does death dissolve a marriage? It is because it is
   a final separation. So is desertion. Incompatibility of temper,
   cruelty, disease, crime, insanity, etc., which human laws often make
   grounds of divorce, are not inconsistent with the marriage relation. A
   woman may have a disagreeable, a cruel, or a wicked husband, but a man
   in his grave, or one who refuses to recognize her as his wife, cannot
   be her husband.

   It is said, indeed, that this doctrine makes marriage depend on the
   option of the parties. Either may desert the other; and then the
   marriage is dissolved. The same objection was made to our Lord's
   doctrine that adultery destroys the marriage bond. It was maid that if
   this be so, either party might dissolve the marriage, by committing
   that crime. As the objections are the same, the answer is the same. As
   adultery is a crime, so is desertion; and both should be punished. The
   question is not what these crimes deserve, but what are their
   legitimate effects, according to the Scriptures, on the marriage
   relation.

   That desertion is a legitimate ground of divorce, was therefore, as
   before mentioned, the doctrine held by the Reformers, Luther, Calvin,
   and Zwingle, and almost without exception by all the Protestant
   churches. [347]

   Doctrine of the Church of Rome.

   Marriage is thus defined in the Roman Catechism: "Matrimonium est viri,
   et mulieris maritalis conjunctio inter legitimas personas, individuam
   vitæ consuetudinem retinens." The clause "inter legitimas personas," is
   explained by saying, "Qui a nuptiarum conjunctione legibus omnino
   exclusi sunt, ii matrimonium inire non possunt; neque, si ineant, ratum
   est, exempli enim gratia: qui intra quartum gradum propinquitate
   conjuncti sunt, puerque ante decimum quartum annum, aut puella ante
   duodecimum, quæ ætas legibus constituta est, ad matrimonii justa
   foedera ineunda apti esse non possunt." The clause, "Individuam vitæ
   consuetudinem retinens," it is said, "indissolubilis vinculi naturam
   declarat quo vir, et uxor colligantur." [348]

   Marriage is to be contemplated under two aspects. It is an institution
   founded in nature, and therefore exists wherever men exist. It is a
   lawful institution among the heathen as well as among Christians. But
   as it is an ordinance of God it has a character among those who know
   the true God and thus regard it, far higher than it has for those who
   are the worshippers of false gods. And, therefore, marriage, under the
   old dispensation, had a much higher character than it had among the
   heathen. Nevertheless, among Christians marriage is something far more
   sacred than it was under the Mosaic economy. Christ had raised it te
   the dignity of a sacrament. [349]

   Marriage a Sacrament.

   The word sacrament is one of vague and various meaning. Sometimes it
   means that which is sacred or consecrated; sometimes that which has, or
   is intended to have a sacred meaning; i.e., an external sign of some
   religious truth or grace; sometimes a divinely appointed external rite
   instituted to be a means of grace; and sometimes a divinely appointed
   external sign that contains and conveys the grace which it signifies.
   It is in this last sense that the word is used by Romanists; and it is
   in this sense they teach that marriage is a sacrament. The principal
   Scriptural authority for this doctrine they find in Ephesians v. 32,
   where, as they understand the passage, the words to musterion touto
   mega estin, rendered in the Vulgate, "Sacramentum hoc magnum est," are
   spoken of marriage. According to this version and interpretation, the
   Apostle does indeed directly assert that marriage is a mystery. But
   (1.) The words do not refer to marriage, but to the mystical union
   between Christ and his people as appears from the Apostle's own
   explanation in the following clause: "I speak concerning Christ and the
   Church." The two subjects, the union of husband and wife and the union
   between Christ and his people, had been so combined and interwoven in
   the preceding verses, that it would have been difficult to determine to
   which the words, "This is a great mystery," were intended to refer, had
   not the Apostle himself told us. But (2.) Even if the Apostle does say
   that the marriage union is a great mystery, which in one sense it
   clearly is, that would not prove that it is a sacrament. The word
   "mystery," as used in the Bible, means something hidden or unknown;
   something which can be known only by divine revelation. Thus the Gospel
   itself is repeatedly said to be a mystery (Eph. iii. 3-9); the future
   conversion of the Jews is said to be a mystery (Rom. xi. 25); the
   incarnation is said to be the great mystery of godliness (1 Tim. iii.
   16); and anything obscure or enigmatical is called a mystery (Rev.
   xvii. 6); thus the mystery of the seven candlesticks is their secret
   meaning. If, therefore, Paul says that marriage is a great mystery in
   the sense that no one can fully understand what is meant when God says
   that husband and wife are one, or even in the sense that marriage has a
   sacred import, that it is a symbol of a great religious truth, this is
   what all Protestants admit and what is clearly taught in Scripture.
   Paul had himself just set forth marriage as the great analogue of the
   mystical union of Christ and the Church. (3.) Admitting still further
   that marriage was properly called "sacramentum," that would prove
   nothing to the purpose. That Latin word had not the sense attached to
   it by Romanists until long after the apostolic age. It has not that
   sense even in the Vulgate. In 1 Timothy iii. 16, the manifestation of
   God in the flesh is declared to be the "great mystery of godliness,"
   which the Vulgate translates "magnum pietatis sacramentum;" but
   Romanists do not hold that the incarnation is a sacrament in the
   ecclesiastical sense of that term. The Latin Church, however, having
   gradually come to attach to the word the idea of a divinely appointed
   rite or ceremony, which signifies, contains, and conveys grace, and
   finding, as the words were understood, marriage declared in Ephesians
   v. 32 to be a "sacramentum," it came to teach that it was a sacrament
   in the same sense as baptism and the Lord's Supper.

   Romanists then teach that marriage is a sacrament not merely because it
   is the sign or symbol of the union of Christ and his Church. The Roman
   Catechism says, [350] (1). That no one should doubt "quod scilicet
   viri, et mulieris conjunctio, cujus Deus auctor est, sanctissimi illius
   vinculi, quo Christus dominus cum Ecclesia conjungitur, sacramentum, id
   est, sacrum signum sit." If this were all, no Protestant could object.
   (2). But Romanists teach that marriage is a sacrament because it not
   only signifies but also confers grace. The ceremony, including the
   consent of the parties, the benediction, and the intention of the
   priest, renders the bride and groom holy. It sanctifies them. "Ex opere
   operato," it transforms mere natural human love into that holy
   spiritual affection which renders their union a fit emblem of the union
   of Christ and the Church. On this point the Council of Trent says:
   [351] "Gratiam, vero, quæ naturalem illum amorem perficeret, et
   indissolubilem unitatem confirmaret, conjugesque sanctificaret, ipse
   Christus, venerabilium sacramentorum institutor, atque perfector, sua
   nobis passione promeruit." It would be a great blessing if this were
   so. Facts, however, prove that the sacramental efficacy of matrimony no
   more so sanctifies husbands and wives as to make their mutual love like
   the holy love of Christ for his Church, than baptism confers (to those
   not opposing an obstacle) all the benefits, subjective and objective,
   of the redemption of Christ. If the sacramentarian theory were true,
   all Christians would be perfect and Christendom would be paradisaical.

   Marriage between Christians, according to Romanists, is indissoluble.
   Neither adultery nor desertion justifies divorce. Death alone can sever
   the bond. It is not to be inferred from this, however, that marriage is
   a more sacred institution among Romanists than among Protestants. Any
   departure from Scriptural rules is sure to work evil. The denial that
   adultery destroys the marriage bond, leads naturally, and in fact has
   led, not only to render that crime more frequent, but also to
   unscriptural devices to remedy the injustice of forcing a husband or
   wife to maintain the conjugal relation with a guilty partner. One of
   these devices is the multiplication of the causes of separation "a
   mensa et thoro"; and another still more unscriptural, is the
   multiplying the reasons which render marriage null and void "ab
   initio." No less than sixteen causes which render marriages null are
   enumerated by Romish theologians. [352]

   The causes which justify separation without divorce, are vows,
   adultery, apostasy, and crimes. Under the last head they include
   cruelty and prodigality. If the parties had not been baptized, divorce
   "a vinculo" was allowed when one of the partners became a Romanist and
   the other refused to, and also for any serious crime. The whole matter
   is in the hands of the Church, which claims the right of making and
   unmaking impediments to marriage at pleasure. "Si quis dixerit
   Ecclesiam non potuisse constituere impedimenta, matrimonium dirimentia,
   vel in iis constituendis errasse; anathema sit." [353] At one period
   the Church of Rome made consanguinity within the seventh degree an
   impediment to marriage; at present it forbids marriage within the
   fourth degree inclusive. "The old Catholic theory of marriage," says
   President Woolsey, "was practically a failure in all its parts, in its
   ascetic frown on marriage, in its demand from the clergy of an
   abstinence not required from the Christian laity, in teaching that
   nothing but death could release the married pair from their
   obligations. When it sought for impracticable virtue, and forbade to
   some what God had allowed to all, it opened a fountain of vice with the
   smallest incitement to virtue." [354]

   Laws of Protestant Countries concerning Divorce.

   It has already been shown that Protestants, making the Scriptures their
   guide, taught that the dissolution of the bond of marriage was
   allowable only for the two offences of adultery and wilful desertion.
   So far as the churches and their confessions are concerned, this is
   still the doctrine of almost all Protestant denominations. When,
   however, marriage came to be regarded as essentially a civil contract,
   it gradually fell under the jurisdiction of the state, and laws were
   passed varying in different countries, as legislators were influenced
   by mere views of justice or expediency. The legislation of all European
   nations was greatly influenced by the old Roman law; and, therefore,
   when marriage was removed from the exclusive jurisdiction of the
   Church, the laws concerning it were more or less adopted from the
   ancient code. The Roman laws concerning divorce were very lax. Mutual
   consent was, even after the Roman emperors became Christian, regarded
   as a sufficient reason for dissolving the bond of marriage. When the
   Church gained the ascendancy over the State, and the pope became the
   virtual legislator of Christendom, divorce for any reason was
   forbidden; and when and where the pope in his turn was dethroned, there
   was a general tendency to return to the laxity of the Roman
   legislation.

   England.

   England was an exception to this rule. It discarded less of popish
   usages than any other Protestant nation. For a long time after the
   Reformation no special law concerning divorce was passed. The
   ecclesiastical courts could decree separation "a mensa et thoro," but a
   full divorce "a vinculo" could be obtained only by a special act of
   Parliament. Under the reign of the present sovereign all such questions
   were removed from the ecclesiastical courts and remitted to a civil
   tribunal. That tribunal is authorized to grant judicial separation "a
   mensa et thoro" on the ground of adultery, or cruelty, or desertion
   without just cause for two years and upward; and dissolution of
   marriage on account of simple adultery on the part of the wife, or
   aggravated adultery on the part of the husband. Such divorce gives both
   parties liberty to contract a new marriage. "On the whole, with serious
   defects," says President Woolsey, "it seems to us to be an excellent
   law. It does honour to the Christian country where it is in force, and
   it is certainly a great improvement on the former mode of regulating
   divorce in England." [355] It may be a good law in comparison with the
   lawlessness that preceded it, and in comparison with the lax
   legislation of other Protestant nations, but it is not good so far as
   it is not conformed to the Scriptures. The New Testament makes no such
   distinction as is made in this law, between adultery on the part of the
   wife and the same offence on the part of the husband. And it is not
   good in not allowing wilful desertion to be a legitimate ground of
   divorce, if, as Protestants almost universally believe, the Bible
   teaches the contrary.

   France.

   In France the laws of the Romish Church were in force until the
   Revolution. That event threw everything into confusion, and the
   sanctity of marriage was in a great degree disregarded. Under the
   empire of the first Napoleon, the civil code allowed divorce, (1.) for
   simple adultery on the part of the wife; (2.) for aggravated adultery
   on the part of the husband; (3.) for outrages and cruelty; (4.) for the
   condemnation of either party to an infamous punishment; and (5.) for
   mutual persistent consent. The restoration of the Bourbons put an end
   to these laws and led to the entire prohibition of divorce.

   Germany.

   Among the Protestants of Germany, the views of the Reformers, as a
   general thing, controlled the action of the several states on this
   subject until about the middle of the eighteenth century, when the laws
   of marriage were greatly relaxed. Göschen attributes this change in a
   great measure to the influence of Thomasius ( 1728), who regarded
   marriage as merely a civil institution designed for the purposes of the
   state, and which, therefore, might be set aside whenever it failed to
   answer the desired end. [356] The present law of Prussia, although an
   improvement on the previous legislation, is far below the Scriptural
   standard. Besides adultery and wilful desertion, it makes many other
   offences grounds of divorce, for example, plots endangering the life or
   health of the other party; gross injuries; dangerous incompatibility of
   temper; crimes entailing an infamous punishment; habitual drunkenness
   and extravagance; and deliberate mutual consent, if there be no
   children fruit of the marriage to be dissolved.

   The United States.

   The laws of the several states of this Union on the subject of divorce
   vary from the extreme of strictness to the extreme of laxness. In South
   Carolina no divorce has ever been given. The effect of refusing to
   regard adultery as a dissolution of the marriage bond is, as proved by
   the experience of Catholic countries, to lead the people to regard that
   crime as a pardonable offence. It was indictable. In New York adultery
   is the only ground of divorce; but separation from bed and board is
   granted for cruelty, desertion, and refusal on the part of the husband
   to make provision for the support of the wife. In several of the other
   states, besides adultery and desertion, many other grounds are made
   sufficient to justify divorce; of these grounds the following are the
   principal: imprisonment, neglect to provide for the maintenance of the
   wife, habitual drunkenness, and cruelty. In some states the whole
   matter is left to the discretion of the courts. In the laws of Maine it
   is said that divorce "a vinculo" may be granted by any justice of the
   Supreme Court, "when in the exercise of a sound discretion, he deems it
   reasonable and proper, conducive to domestic harmony, and consistent
   with the peace and morality of society." The law of Indiana says
   divorce may be granted for any cause for which the court deems it
   proper. [357] In Rhode Island to the enumeration of specific causes is
   added, "and for any other gross misbehaviour and wickedness in either
   of the parties, repugnant to and in violation of the marriage
   covenant." In Connecticut the statute passed in 1849 allows divorce for
   "any such misconduct as permanently destroys the happiness of the
   petitioner and defeats the purpose of the conjugal relation." [358]

   Duty of the Church and of its Officers.

   There are certain principles bearing on this subject which will be
   generally conceded, (1.) Every legislative body is bound to conform its
   enactments to the moral law. This may be assumed as a self-evident
   proposition. (2.) Every Christian legislature is bound to conform its
   action to the laws of Christianity. By a Christian legislature is meant
   one which makes laws for a Christian people. It is not necessary that
   it should represent them as Christians, to be their agents in teaching,
   propagating, or enforcing the principles of the Christian religion. It
   is enough to constitute it a Christian legislature that the great body
   of its constituents who are bound to obey its laws are Christians. No
   one hesitates to say that Italy, Spain, and France are Catholic
   countries; or that England, Sweden, and Prussia are Protestant. As all
   the powers of legislatures are derived from the people, it is
   irrational to suppose that the people would delegate to their
   representatives authority to violate their religion. No legislature of
   a Christian state, therefore, can have the right to make laws
   inconsistent with the Christian religion. This principle, so reasonable
   and obvious, is conceded in the abstract. No state in this Union would
   dare to legalize adultery or bigamy. Before the Reformation all
   questions concerning marriage were under the jurisdiction of the
   Church; after that event they were, in Protestant countries, referred
   to the authorities of the state. "It never, however," says Stahl,
   "entered the minds of the Reformers, to assert that marriage was purely
   a civil institution, to be determined by civil, and not religious laws,
   or that the testimony of the Church as to the divine laws of marriage
   was not a binding rule for the legislation of the state." [359] And in
   still more general terms he declares that "What the Church as such [the
   body of Christians] testifies to be an unchangeable divine law, jus
   divinum,' and upholds within its sphere, is the impassable rule and
   limit for the legislation of a Christian state." [360]

   3. No act of any human legislature contrary to the moral law can bind
   any man, and no such act contrary to the law of Christ can bind any
   Christian. If, therefore, a human tribunal annuls a marriage for any
   reason other than those assigned in the Bible, the marriage is not
   thereby dissolved. In the judgment of Christians it remains in full
   force; and they are bound so to regard it. And on the other hand, if
   the state pronounces a marriage valid, which the Bible declares to be
   invalid, in the view of Christians it is invalid. There is no help for
   this. Christians cannot give up their convictions; nor can they
   renounce their allegiance to Christ. This state of conflict between the
   laws and the conscience of the people, is the necessary consequence, if
   a body making laws for a Christian people disregards an authority which
   the people recognize as divine.

   4. The laws of many of the states of this Union, on the matter of
   divorce, are unscriptural and immoral. If the former, they are the
   latter in the view of all who believe in the divine authority of the
   Bible. If the Scriptures be the only infallible rule of faith and
   practice, they contain the only standard of right and wrong. The moral
   law is not something self-imposed. It is not what any man or body of
   men may think right or expedient. It is the revealed will of God as to
   human conduct; and whatever is contrary to that will is morally wrong.
   If this be so, then there can be no doubt that the divorce laws of many
   of our states are immoral. They contravene the law of God. They annul
   marriages for other reasons than those allowed in Scripture, and even,
   in some cases, at the discretion of the courts. They pronounce persons
   not to be man and wife, who by the law of God are man and wife. They
   pronounce those to be legally married, whose union Christ declares to
   be adulterous. That is, they legalize adultery. This is a conclusion
   which cannot be avoided, except by denying either the authority of the
   Bible, or that it legislates on the subject of marriage. If marriage
   were a mere civil compact, with regard to which the Scriptures gave no
   special directions, it might be regulated by the state according to its
   news of wisdom or expediency. But if it be an ordinance of God; if He
   has revealed his will as to who may, and who may not intermarry, and
   who, when married, may or may not be released from the marriage bond,
   then the state has no more right to alter these laws than it has to
   alter the decalogue, and to legalize idolatry or blasphemy. There is no
   use in covering this matter over. It is wrong to regard anti-Christian
   laws as matters of small importance.

   The action of the state in this matter is not merely negative. It does
   not simply overlook or refuse to punish the violation of the Scriptural
   law of divorce, but it intervenes by its positive action, and declares
   that certain parties are not man and wife, between whom, according to
   the law of God, the bond of marriage still subsists. It condemns
   bigamy, but it sanctions what the Bible pronounces bigamy. The law of
   the state and the law of God, in this regard, are so opposed to each
   other, that he who obeys the one violates the other.

   5. As the Church and its officers are under the highest obligations to
   obey the law of Christ, it follows that where the action of the state
   conflicts with that law, such action must be disregarded. If a person
   be divorced on other than Scriptural grounds and marries again, such
   person cannot consistently be received to the fellowship of the Church.
   If a minister be called upon to solemnize the marriage of a person
   improperly divorced, he cannot, in consistency with his allegiance to
   Christ, perform the service. This conflict between the civil and divine
   law is a great evil, and has often, especially in Prussia, given rise
   to great difficulty.

   As all denominations of Christians, Romanists and Protestants, are of
   one mind on this subject, it is matter of astonishment that these
   objectionable divorce laws are allowed to stand on the statute-books of
   so many of our states. This fact proves either that public attention
   has not to a sufficient degree been called to the subject, or that the
   public conscience is lamentably blinded or seared. The remedy is with
   the Church, which is the witness of God on earth, bound to testify to
   his truth and to uphold his law. If Christians, in their individual
   capacity and in their Church courts, would unite in their efforts to
   arouse and guide public sentiment on this subject, there is little
   doubt that these objectionable laws would be repealed.

   The Social Evil.

   This is not a subject to be discussed in these pages; a few remarks,
   however, in reference to it may not be out of place.

   1. It is obviously Utopian to expect that all violations of the seventh
   commandment can be prevented, any more than that the laws against theft
   or falsehood should never be disregarded.

   2. The history of the world shows that the instinct which leads to the
   evil in question can never be kept within proper limits, except by
   moral principle, or by marriage.

   3. To these two means of correction, therefore, the efforts of the
   friends of virtue should be principally directed. There can be no
   efficient moral culture without religious training. If we would reform
   our fellow-men, we must bring and keep them from the beginning to the
   end of their lives under the influence of the truth and ordinances of
   God; to accomplish this work is the duty assigned to the Church.
   Besides this general moral culture, there is needed special effort to
   produce a proper public sentiment with regard to this special evil. So
   long as the seventh commandment can be violated without any serious
   loss of self-respect or of public confidence, one of the strongest
   barriers against vice is broken down. If loss of character as certainly
   followed a breach of the seventh commandment, as it follows theft or
   perjury, the evil would be to a good degree abated. This is already the
   fact with regard to certain classes. It is so with regard to women; and
   it is so in the case of the clergy. If a minister of the gospel be
   guilty of this offence, he is as certainly and effectually ruined as he
   would be by the commission of any other crime short of murder. The same
   moral law, however, binds all men. Theft in the case of one man is, in
   its essential character, just what it is in the case of any other man.

   4. The divinely appointed preventive of the social evil is laid down in
   1 Corinthians vii. 2: "Let every man have his own wife, and let every
   woman have her own husband." That there are serious difficulties, in
   the present state of society, in the way of frequent and early
   marriages, cannot be denied. The principal of these is no doubt the
   expensive style of living generally adopted. Young people find it
   impossible to commence life with the conveniences and luxuries to which
   they have been accustomed in their fathers houses, and therefore
   marriage is neglected or postponed. With regard to the poorer classes,
   provision might be made to endow young women of good character, so as
   to enable them to begin their married life in comfort. Arrangements may
   also be made in various ways to lessen the expense of family living.
   The end to be accomplished is to facilitate marriage. Those who are so
   happy as to find in a dictum of Scripture the ultimate reason and the
   highest motive, may see the end to be attained, although, as in the
   present case, they are obliged to leave the means of its accomplishment
   to experts in social science.

   Prohibited Marriages.

   That certain marriages are prohibited is almost the universal judgment
   of mankind. Among the ancient Persians and Egyptians, indeed, the
   nearest relations were allowed to intermarry and in the corrupt period
   of the Roman Empire, equal laxness more or less prevailed. These
   isolated facts do not invalidate the argument from the general judgment
   of mankind. What all men think to be wrong, must be wrong. This
   unanimity cannot be accounted for, except by assuming that the judgment
   in which men thus agree is founded on the constitution of their nature,
   and that constitution is the work of God. There are cases, therefore,
   in which the "vox populi" is the "vox Dei."

   The Ground or Reason of such Prohibitions.

   The reason why mankind so generally condemn the intermarriage of near
   relations cannot be physical. Physiology is not taught by instinct. It
   is, therefore, not only an unworthy, but is an altogether
   unsatisfactory assumption, that such marriages are forbidden because
   they tend to the deterioration of the race. The fact assumed may, or
   may not be true; but if admitted, it is utterly insufficient to account
   for the condemnatory judgment in question.

   The two most natural and obvious reasons why the intermarriage of near
   relations is forbidden are, first, that the natural affection which
   relatives have for each other is incompatible with conjugal love. They
   cannot coexist. The latter is a violation and destruction of the
   former. This reason need only be stated. It requires no illustration.
   These natural affections are not only healthful, but in the higher
   grades of relationship, even sacred. The second ground for such
   prohibitions is a regard to domestic purity. When persons are so nearly
   related to each other as to justify their living together as one
   family, they should be sacred one to the other. If this were not the
   case, evil could hardly fail to occur, when young people grow up in the
   familiarity of domestic life. The slightest inspection of the details
   of the law as laid down in the eighteenth chapter of Leviticus, shows
   that his principle underlies many of its specifications.

   J. D. Michaelis, in his work on the law of Moses, makes this the only
   reason for the Levitical prohibitions. He goes to the extreme of
   denying that "nearness of kin" is in itself any bar to marriage. His
   views had great influence, not only on public opinion, but even on
   legislation in Germany. That influence, however, passed away when a
   deeper moral and religious feeling gained ascendancy. [361]

   Augustine's Theory.

   Augustine advanced a theory on this subject, which still has its
   earnest advocates. He held that the design of all these prohibitory
   laws was to widen the circle of the social affections. Brothers and
   sisters are bound together by mutual love. Should they intermarry the
   circle is not extended. If they choose husbands and wives from among
   strangers, a larger number of persons are included in the bonds of
   mutual love. "Habita est ratio rectissima charitatis, ut homines quibus
   esset utilis atque honesta concordia, diversarum necessitudinum
   vinculis necterentur; nec unus in uno multas haberet, sed singulæ
   spargerentur in singulos; ac sic ad socialem vitam diligentius
   colligandam plurimæ plurimos obtinerent." Thus it would come to pass,
   "Ut unus homo haberet alteram sororem, alteram uxorem, alteram
   consobrinam, alterum patrem, alterum avunculum, alterum socerum,
   alteram matrem, alteram amitam, alteram socrum: atque ita se non in
   paucitate coarctatum, sed latius atque numerosius propinquitatibus
   crebris vinculum sociale diffunderet." [362]

   A writer in Hengstenberg's "Evangelische Kirchen-Zeitung," adopts and
   elaborately vindicates this theory. He endeavours to show that it
   answers all the criteria by which any theory on the subject should be
   tested. These marriages are called "abominations;" and he asks, Is it
   not shameful that the benevolent ordinance of God for extending the
   circle of the social affections should be counteracted? They are called
   "confusion," because they unite those whom God commands to remain
   separate. It also accounts for the propriety of the intermarriage of
   brothers and sisters in the family of Adam; for in the beginning the
   circle of affection did not admit of being enlarged. It even meets the
   case if the Levirate law which bound a man to marry the childless widow
   of his brother. The law which forbids the marriage of relations, holds
   only where the relationship is close. There must, therefore, be cases
   just on the line beyond which relationship is no bar to marriage. And
   with regard to those just within the line, there must be considerations
   which sometimes outweigh the objections to a given marriage. That God
   dispensed with the law forbidding the marriage of a man with his
   brother's widow, when the brother died without children, this German
   writer regards as impossible. "Evil," he says, "may be tolerated, but
   not commanded." He adds that it provokes a smile (man muss es naiv
   nennen) that Gerhard finds an analogy between the case in question and
   the permission given to the Israelites to despoil the Egyptians. [363]
   It is probable that the venerable Gerhard would smile at the writer's
   criticisms. In the first place, God can no more allow evil than He can
   command it. An act otherwise evil, ceases to be so when He either
   allows (i.e., sanctions) it, or commands it. If He commands a man to be
   put to deaths it ceases to be murder to put him to death. There are two
   principles of morality generally accepted and clearly Scriptural; one
   of which is, that any of those moral laws which are founded, not on the
   immutable nature of God, but upon the relations of men in the present
   state of existence, may be set aside by the divine law-giver whenever
   it seems good in his sight; just as God under the old dispensation set
   aside the original monogamic law of marriage. Polygamy was not sinful
   as long as God permitted it. The same principle is involved in the
   words of Christ, God loves mercy and not sacrifice. When two laws
   conflict, the weaker yields to the stronger. It is wrong to labour on
   the Sabbath, but any amount of labour on that day becomes a duty, if
   necessary to save life. In the case of the Levirate law, the
   prohibition to marry a brother's widow, yielded to what under the
   Mosaic economy was regarded as a higher obligation, that is, to
   perpetuate the family. To die childless was considered one of the
   greatest calamities.

   The question, however, concerning the rationale of these laws is one of
   minor importance. We may not be able to see exactly in all cases why
   certain things are forbidden. The fact that they are forbidden should
   satisfy the reason and the conscience. The two important questions in
   connection with this subject, to be considered, are, first, is the
   Levitical law respecting prohibited marriages still in force? and,
   second, how is that law to be interpreted, and what marriages does it
   forbid?

   Is the Levitical Law of Marriage still in force?

   1. It is a strong à priori argument in favour of an affirmative answer
   to that question, that it always has been regarded as obligatory by the
   whole Christian Church.

   2. The reason assigned for the prohibition contained in that law, has
   no special reference to the Jews. It is not found is their peculiar
   circumstances, nor in the design of God in selecting them to be
   depositaries of his truth to prepare the world for the coming of the
   Messiah. The reason assigned "is nearness of kin." This reason has as
   much force at one time as at another, for all nations as for any one
   nation. There was nothing peculiar in the relation in which Hebrew
   parents and children, Hebrew brothers and sisters, and Hebrew uncles
   and nieces, stood, which was the ground of these prohibitions. That
   ground was the nearness of the relationship itself as it exists in
   every and in all ages. There is, therefore, in the sight of God, a
   permanent reason why near relations ought not to intermarry.

   3. If the Levitical law be not still in force, we have no divine law on
   the subject. Then there is no such sin as incest. It is an offence only
   against the civil law, and a sin against God only in so far as it is
   sinful to violate the law of the state. But this is contrary to the
   universal judgment of men, at least of Christian men. For parents and
   children, brothers and sisters, to intermarry is universally considered
   as sin against God, irrespective of any human prohibition. But if a sin
   against God, it must be forbidden in his Word, or we must give up the
   fundamental principle of Protestantism, that the Scriptures are the
   only infallible rule of our faith and practice. As such marriages are
   nowhere in the Bible forbidden except in the Levitical law, if that law
   does not forbid them, the Bible does not forbid them.

   4. The judgments of God are denounced against the heathen nations for
   permitting the marriages which the Levitical law forbids. In Leviticus
   xviii. 8, it is said, "After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein
   ye dwelt shall ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan,
   whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their
   ordinances." This is the introduction to the law of prohibited
   marriages, containing the specification of the "ordinances" of the
   Egyptians and Canaanites, which the people of God were forbidden to
   follow. And in the twenty-seventh verse of the same chapter, at the
   close of these specifications, it is said, "All these abominations have
   the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is
   deified." Again, in ch. xx. 23, still in reference to these marriages,
   it is said, "Ye shall not walk in the manners of the nations which I
   cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore
   I abhorred them." This is a clear proof that these laws were binding,
   not on the Jews alone, but upon all people and at all times.

   5. The continued obligation of the Levitical law on this subject is
   also recognized in the New Testament. This recognition as involved in
   the constant reference to the law of Moses as the law of God. If in any
   of its parts or specifications it is no longer obligatory, that is to
   be proved. It contains much which we learn from the New Testament was
   designed simply to keep the Hebrews a distinct people; much which was
   typical; much which was a shadow of things to come, and which passed
   away when the substance was revealed. It contained, however, much which
   was moral and of permanent obligation. If God gives a law to men, those
   who deny its perpetual obligation are bound to prove it. The
   presumption is that it continues in force until the contrary is proved.
   It must be hard to prove that laws founded on the permanent social
   relations of men were intended to be temporary.

   Besides this general consideration, we find specific recognitions of
   the continued obligation of the Levitical law in the New Testament.
   John the Baptist, as recorded in Mark vi. 18 and Matthew xiv. 4, said
   to Herod that it was not lawful for him to have his brother Philip's
   wife. It matters not, as to the argument, whether Philip was living or
   not. The offence charged was not that he had taken another man's wife,
   but that he had taken his brother's wife. It may be objected to this
   argument that during the ministry of John the Baptist the law of Moses
   was still in force. This Gerhard denies, who argues from Matthew xi.
   13, "All the prophets and the law prophesied until John, that the
   Baptist's ministry belongs to the new dispensation. [364] This may be
   doubted. Nevertheless John expressed the moral sentiment of his age;
   and the record of the fact referred to by the Evangelists whose Gospels
   were written after the Christian Church was fully organized, is given
   in a form which involves a sanction of the judgment which the Baptist
   had expressed against the marriage of Herod with his brother's wife. It
   is also to be remembered that the Herodian family was Idumean, and
   therefore, that a merely Jewish law would have no natural authority
   over them.

   The Apostle Paul, moreover, in 1 Corinthians v. 1, speaks of a man's
   marrying his step-mother as an unheard of offence. That this was a case
   of marriage and not of adultery is plain because the phrase gunaika
   echein is never used in the New Testament except of marriage. This,
   therefore, is a clear recognition of the continued obligation of the
   law forbidding marriage between near relations, whether the
   relationship was by consanguinity or affinity.

   6. The Bible everywhere enforces those laws which have their foundation
   in the natural constitution of men. That this Levitical law is a divine
   authentication of a law of nature, may be inferred from the fact that
   with rare exceptions the intermarriage of near relations is forbidden
   among all nations. Paul says that the marriage of a man with his
   step-mother was unheard of among the heathen; i.e., it was forbidden
   and abhorred. Cicero exclaims, "Nuoit genero socrus. . . . . O mulieris
   incredibile et præter hanc unam in omni vita inauditum!" [365] Beza
   says, It must not be overlooked that the civil laws of the Romans agree
   completely in reference to this subject with the divine law. They
   seemed to have copied from it. [366]

   No Christian Church doubts the continued obligation of any of the laws
   of the Pentateuch, of which it can be said that the reason assigned for
   their enactment is the permanent relations of men; that the heathen are
   condemned for their violation; and that the New Testament refers to
   them as still in force: and which heathen nations under the guidance of
   natural conscience have enacted.

   How is the Levitical Law to be interpreted?

   Admitting the Levitical law of marriage to be still in force, the next
   question is, How is it to be interpreted? Is it to be understood as
   specifying the degrees of relation, whether of consanguinity or of
   affinity, within which intermarriage is forbidden? or, is it to be
   viewed as an enumeration of particular cases, so that no case not
   specifically mentioned is to be included in the prohibition?

   The former of these rules of interpretation is the one generally
   adopted; for the following reasons: --

   1. The language of the law itself. It begins with a general prohibition
   of marriage between those who are near of kin. Nearness of kindred is
   made the ground of the prohibition. The specifications which follow are
   intended to show what degree of nearness of kindred works a
   prohibition. This reason applies to many cases not particularly
   mentioned in Leviticus xvii. or elsewhere. The law would seem to be
   applicable to all cases in which the divinely assigned reason for its
   enactment is found to exist.

   2. The design of the law, as we have seen, is twofold: first, to keep
   sacred those relationships which naturally give rise to feelings and
   affections which are inconsistent with the marriage relation; and
   secondly, the preservation of domestic purity. As the natural
   affections are due partly to the very constitution of our nature, and
   partly to the familiarity and constancy of intercourse, and the
   interchange of kindly offices, it is natural that in the enumeration of
   the prohibited cases regard should be had, in the selection, to those
   in which this familiarity of intercourse, at the time the law was
   enacted, actually prevailed. In the East the family is organized on
   different principles from those on which it is organized in the West.
   Among the early Oriental nations especially, the males of a family with
   their wives remained together; while the daughters, being given in
   marriage, went away and were amalgamated with the families of their
   husbands. Hence it would happen that relatives by the father's side
   would be intimate associates, while those of the same degree on the
   mother's side might be perfect strangers. A law, therefore, constructed
   on the principle of prohibiting marriage between parties so related as
   to be already in the bonds of natural affection and who were
   domesticated in the same family circle, would deal principally in
   specifications of relationships on the father's side. It would not
   follow, however, from this fact, that relations of the same grade of
   kindred might freely intermarry, simply because they were not specified
   in the enumeration. The law in its principle applies to all cases,
   whether enumerated or not, in which the nearness of kin is the source
   of natural affection, and in which it leads to and justifies intimate
   association.

   3. Another consideration in favour of the principle of interpretation
   usually adopted, is, that the opposite rule would introduce the
   greatest inconsistencies into the law. The law forbids marriage between
   those near of kin; and, according to this rule, it goes on alternately
   permitting and forbidding marriages where the relationship is precisely
   the same. Thus, a man cannot marry the daughter of his son; but a woman
   may marry the son of her daughter; a man cannot marry the widow of his
   father's brother, but he may marry the widow of his mother's brother; a
   woman cannot marry two brothers, but a man may marry two sisters. These
   inconsistencies might be intelligible if the law were a temporary and
   local enactment, designed for a transient state of society; but they
   are utterly unaccountable if the law be one of permanent and universal
   obligation. A rule of interpretation which brings uniformity and
   consistency into these enactments of Scripture, is certainly to be
   preferred to one which renders them confused and inconsistent.

   Prohibited Degrees.

   The cases specifically mentioned are: 1. Mother. 2. Stepmother. 3.
   Grand-daughter. 4. Sister and half-sister, "born at home or born
   abroad," i.e., legitimate or illegitimate. 5. Aunt on the father's
   side. 6. Maternal aunt. 7. The wife of a father's brother. 8.
   Daughter-in-law. 9. Brother's wife. 10. A woman and her daughter. 11. A
   wife's grand-daughter. 12. Two sisters at the same time.

   The meaning of Leviticus xviii. 18, has been much disputed. The
   question is, Whether the words 'sh 'l'tth, "a woman to her sister," are
   to be understood in their idiomatic sense, "one to another," so that
   the law forbids bigamy, the taking of one wife to another during her
   lifetime; or, Whether they are to be taken literally, so that this law
   forbids a man's marrying the sister of his wife while the latter is
   living. It is certain that the words in question have in several places
   the idiomatic sense ascribed to them. In Exodus xxvi. 3, "Five curtains
   shall be coupled together one to another," literally, "a woman to her
   sister;" so in verse 5, the loops take hold, "a woman and her sister;"
   ver. 6, the taches of gold unite the curtains, "a woman and her
   sister." Also in ver. 17. Thus also in Ezekiel i. 9, it is said, "their
   wings were joined one to another," "a woman to her sister;" and again
   in ch. iii. 13. The words therefore admit of the rendering given in the
   margin of the English version. But it is objected to this
   interpretation in this case: (1.) That the words in question never mean
   "one to another," except when preceded by a plural noun; which is not
   the case in Leviticus xviii. 18. (2.) If this explanation be adopted,
   the passage contains an explicit prohibition of polygamy, which the law
   of Moses permitted. (3.) It is unnatural to take the words "wife" and
   "sister" in a sense different from that in which they are used
   throughout the chapter. (4) The ancient versions agree with the
   rendering given in the text of the English Bible. The Septuagint has
   gunaika ep adelphe autes; the Vulgate, "sororem uxoris tuæ."

   In this interpretation the modern commentators almost without exception
   agree. Thus Maurer renders the passage: "Uxorem ad (i.e., præter)
   sororem ejus ne ducito,' i.e., Nolli præter tuam conjugem aliam insuper
   uxorem ducere, quæ illius soror est." [367] Baumgarten's comment is:
   "From the fact that the prohibition of the marriage of a wife's sister
   is expressly conditioned on the life of the former, we must infer with
   the Rabbins, that after the death of the wife this marriage is
   permitted. True, the degree of affinity is here the same as in ver. 16,
   but there the relationship is on the male, here on the female side;
   this makes a difference, because under the Old Testament the woman had
   not attained to the same degree of personality and independence as the
   man." [368] Rosenmüller says: "Uxorem ad sororem ejus ne ducas, duas
   sorores ne ducas in matrimonium, scil. vhyyh in vita ejus, i.e., uxore
   tua vivente. Non igitur prohibet Moses matrimonium cum sorores uxoris
   mortuæ." [369] Knobel says: "Finally, a man shall not marry . . . . the
   sister of his wife, so long as the latter lives. . . . . To marry one
   after the other, after the death of the other, is not forbidden." [370]
   Keil understands v. 18 in the same way. It forbids, according to his
   view, a man's having two sisters, at the same time, as his wives.
   "After the death of the first wife," he adds, "marriage with her sister
   was allowed." [371]

   The inference which these writers draw from the fact that in this
   passage the marriage of a wife's sister is forbidden during the life of
   the wife, that the marriage of the sister, after the death of the wife,
   is allowed, is very precarious. All that the passage teaches is, that
   if a man chooses to have two wives, at the same time, which the law
   allowed, they must not be sisters; and the reason assigned is, that it
   would bring the sisters into a false relation to each other. This
   leaves the question of the propriety of marrying the sister of a
   deceased wife just where it was. This verse has no direct bearing on
   that subject.

   The cases not expressly mentioned in Leviticus xviii., although
   involving the same degree of kindred as those included in the
   enumeration, are: 1. A man's own daughter. This is a clear proof that
   the enumeration was not intended to be exhaustive. 2. A brother's
   daughter. 3. A sister's daughter. 4. A maternal uncle's widow. 5. A
   brother's son's widow. 6. A sister's son s widow. 7. The sister of a
   deceased wife.

   As nearness of kindred is made the ground of prohibition, and as these
   cases are included within "the degrees" specified, the Church has
   considered them as belonging to the class of prohibited marriages. It
   is, however, to be considered that the word "prohibited," as here used,
   is very comprehensive. Some of the marriages specified in the Levitical
   law are prohibited in very different senses. Some are pronounced
   abominable, and those who contract them are made punishable with death.
   Others are pronounced unseemly, or evil, and punished by exclusion from
   the privileges of the theocracy. Others again incur the penalty of
   dying childless; probably meaning that the children of such marriages
   should not be enrolled in the family registers which the Jews were so
   careful to preserve.

   As this distinction is recognized in the law itself, so it is founded
   in the nature of the case. As nearness of kin varies from the most
   intimate relationship to the most distant, so these marriages vary in
   their impropriety from the highest to the lowest degree. Some of them
   may, in certain cases, be wrong, not in themselves, but simply from the
   obligation to uphold a salutary law. That is, there may be cases to
   which the law, but not the reason of the law applies. For example; a
   man may go thousands of miles from home and marry: his wife would stand
   in a very different relation to her husband's brothers, than had she
   lived in the same house with them. The law forbidding a woman to marry
   the brother of her deceased husband, would apply to her; but the reason
   of that law would affect her in a very slight degree; nevertheless,
   even in her case, the law should be observed.

   There is another obvious remark that ought to be made. Strong
   repugnance is often felt and expressed against the Levitical law, not
   only because it is regarded as placing all the marriages specified on
   the same level, representing all as equally offensive in the sight of
   God, but also from the assumption that all the marriages forbidden are,
   if contracted, invalid. This is a wrong view of the subject. It is
   inconsistent with the law itself, and contrary to the analogy of
   Scripture. The law recognizes a great disparity in the impropriety of
   these marriages. Some, as just remarked, are utterly abominable and
   insufferable. Others are specified because inexpedient or dangerous, as
   conflicting with some ethical or prudential principle.

   It is in this as in many other cases. The Mosaic law discountenanced
   and discouraged intermarriage between the chosen people and their
   heathen neighbours. With regard to the Canaanites, such intermarriages
   were absolutely forbidden; with other heathen nations, although
   discountenanced, they were tolerated. Joseph married an Egyptian;
   Moses, a Midianite; Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter. Such marriages,
   in the settled state of the Jewish nation, may have been wrong, but
   they were valid. Even now under the Christian dispensation, believers
   are forbidden to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers. It does
   not follow from this that every marriage between a believer and an
   unbeliever is invalid. These remarks are not out of place. The truth
   suffers from being misapprehended. If the Bible is made to teach what
   is contrary to the common sense, or the intuitive judgments of men, it
   suffers great injustice. No man can force himself to believe that a
   man's marrying the sister of a deceased wife is the same kind of
   offence as a father's marrying his own daughter. The Bible teaches no
   such doctrine; and it is a slander so to represent it.

   Concluding Remarks.

   The laws of God are sacred. They are founded, not only on his infinite
   wisdom, but also on the nature of his creatures, and, therefore, should
   be sedulously observed. There may, in some cases, be honest difference
   of opinion as to what the law or will of God is, but when ascertained,
   it is our wisdom and duty to make it the rule of our conduct. This is
   so obvious that the statement of it may seem entirely superfluous. It
   is so common. however, for men professing to be Christians to make
   their own feelings, opinions, and views of expediency, the rule of
   action for themselves and others, that it is by no means a work of
   supererogation, to reiterate on all proper occasions the truism that
   there is no wisdom like God's wisdom, and that men are never wise
   except when they follow the wisdom of God as revealed in his Word, even
   when they have to do it blindly.

   There are certain principles which underlie the marriage laws of the
   Bible, which all men in their private capacity and when acting as
   legislators, would do well to respect, --

   1. The first is, that marriage is not a mere external union; it is not
   simply a mutual compact; it is not merely a civil contract. It is a
   real, physical, vital, and spiritual union, in virtue of which man and
   wife become, not merely in a figurative sense, but really, although in
   a mysterious sense, one flesh. This is not only expressly declared by
   Christ himself to be the nature of marriage, but it is the doctrine
   which underlies the whole Levitical law on this subject. Nearness of
   kin is expressed constantly by saying that one is "flesh of the flesh"
   of the other, s'r vsrv, "Carnem carnis suæ s. corporis sui esse
   cognatam propinquam, quæ est ut caro ejusdem corporis." [372] According
   to the Scriptures, therefore, husband and wife are the nearest of all
   relations to each other. According to the spirit, and most of the
   legislation of the present age, they are no relations at all. They are
   simply partners. If one member of a business firm die, his property
   does no; go to his partner, but to his own family; so if a wife die,
   without children, her property does not go to her husband, but to her
   third or fourth cousins. They, in the eye of the law, are more nearly
   related to her than her husband. This is not the light in which God
   looks upon marriage.

   2. The second principle which underlies these marriage-laws is, that
   affinity is as real a bond of relationship as consanguinity. Fully one
   half of the marriages specified in Leviticus are prohibited on the
   ground of affinity. The same form of expression is used to designate
   both kinds of relationship. Those related to each other by affinity are
   said to be "flesh of the flesh," one of the other, just as blood
   relations; because all the specifications contained in the eighteenth
   chapter of Leviticus are included under the general prohibition
   contained in the sixth verse, "None of you shall approach to any that
   is near of kin to him;" under this head are included step-mothers;
   mothers-in-law; step-daughters; sisters-in-law (as when a man is
   forbidden to marry the widow of his brother); uncle's wife, etc. These
   relationships are traced out in the line of affinity, just as far as
   they are in that of consanguinity. The declaration, therefore,
   contained in the Westminster Confession, [373] "The man may not marry
   any of his wife's kindred nearer in blood than he may of his own, nor
   the woman of her husband's kindred nearer in blood than of her own," is
   a simple and comprehensive statement of the law as laid down in
   Leviticus. In saying that affinity is as real a bond of relationship as
   consanguinity, it is not meant that it is as strong. A daughter is a
   nearer relation than a step-daughter, or daughter-in-law; a mother than
   a step-mother; a sister than a sister-in-law. This, as we have seen, is
   recognized in the law itself. The Bible asserts nothing inconsistent
   with fact or nature. In making affinity a real bond of kindred, it is
   meant that it is no merely nominal, or conventional, or arbitrary. It
   has its foundation in nature and fact.

   Mr. Bishop, in his elaborate work on "Marriage and Divorce," says, " A
   truly enlightened view will doubtless discard altogether affinity as an
   impediment, while it will extend somewhat the degrees of consanguinity
   within which marriages will be forbidden." [374] He also teaches [375]
   that "the relationship by affinity" ceases "with the dissolution which
   death brings to the marriage. . . . . If, when a man's wife dies, she
   is still his wife, then, of course, her sister is still his
   sister. . . . . If, on the other hand, the wife is no more the wife
   after her death, then is her sister no more the sister of the husband.
   And though men who have no other idea of religion than to regard it as
   a bundle of absurd and loathed forms, may not be able to see how the
   termination of the relationship by the death of the wife is of any
   consequence in the case, yet men who discern differently and more
   wisely, will discover nothing unseemly in practically acting upon a
   fact which everybody knows to exist."

   It is very evident that Mr. Bishop never asked himself what, in the
   present connection, the word "relationship" means. Had he had any clear
   idea of the meaning of the word, he never could have written the above
   sentences. By relationship is here meant the relation in which parties
   stand to each other; and that, in the case supposed, is a matter of
   feeling, affection, and intimacy. This relationship is not dissolved by
   the death of the person through whom it arose. A wife's sister
   continues to cherish to her widowed brother-in-law the same sisterly
   affection after, as before her sister's death. She can live with him,
   guide his house, and take charge of his children, without the slightest
   violation of her self-respect, and without fear of incurring the
   disrespect of others.

   Besides, if relationship by affinity is dissolved by death, then a son
   may, on the death of his father, marry his step-mother, which Paul says
   (1 Cor. v. 1) was not tolerated among the heathen. We have not come to
   that yet. On the principle of Mr. Bishop, a man may marry his
   mother-in-law, his daughter-in-law, and, on the death of the mother,
   his step-daughter. All this the Bible forbids; and whatever religion in
   some of its manifestations may be, the Bible, surely, is not "a bundle
   of absurd and loathed forms." It is the wisdom of God, in the presence
   of which the wisdom of man is foolishness.

   3. The great truth contained in these laws is, that it is the will of
   God, the dictate of his infinite and benevolent wisdom that the
   affections which belong to the relation in which kindred (whether by
   consanguinity or affinity) stand to each other, should not be
   disturbed, perverted, or corrupted by that essentially different kind
   of love which is appropriate and holy in the conjugal relation; and
   that a protecting halo should be shed around the family circle.

   [328] Calvin in his comment on this verse says: "Non multo post
   Apostoli mortem exorti sunt Encratitæ (qui nomen sibi a continentia
   indiderunt) Taciani; Cathari; Montanus cum sua secta, et tandem
   Manichæi, qui ab esu carnium et conjugio abhorrerent, et tanquam res
   profanas damnarent. . . . . Excipiunt [Papistæ] se Encratitis et
   Manichæis esse dissimiles, quia non simpliciter usum conjugii et
   carnium interdicunt, sed certis tantum diebus cogunt ad carnis
   abstinentiam, solos autem monachos et sacerdotes cum monialibus ad
   votum coelibatus cogunt. Verum hæc. . . . . nimis frivola est
   excusatio. Nam sanctimoniam nihilo minus in his rebus locant; deinde

   [345] That the word porneia, as used in Matthew v. 32, and xix. 9,
   means adultery, there can be no reasonable doubt. Porneia is a general
   term including all unlawful cohabitation, as Theodoret on Romans i. 29

   § 12. The Eighth Commandment.

   This commandment forbids all violations of the rights of property. The
   right of property in an object is the right to its exclusive possession
   and use.

   The foundation of the right of property is the will of God. By this is
   meant, (1.) That God has so constituted man that he desires and needs
   this right of the exclusive possession and use of certain things. (2.)
   Having made man a social being, He has made the right of property
   essential to the healthful development of human society. (3.) He has
   implanted a sense of justice in the nature of man, which condemns as
   morally wrong everything inconsistent with the right in question. (4.)
   He has declared in his Word that any and every violation of this right
   is sinful.

   This doctrine of the divine right of property is the only security for
   the individual or for society. If it be made to rest on any other
   foundation, it is insecure and unstable. It is only by making property
   sacred, guarded by the fiery sword of divine justice, that it can be
   safe from the dangers to which it is everywhere and always exposed.

   Numerous theories have been advanced on this subject. These theories
   have had a twofold object: the one to explain the nature and ground of
   the right; the other to explain how the right was originally acquired.
   These objects are distinct and should not be confounded.

   1. The modern philosophical theory that might is right, that the
   strongest is always the best, includes indeed both these objects. If
   being is the only good, and if it is true the more of being the more of
   good, then he who has the most of being, he in whom the infinite is
   most fully revealed, has the right to have and to hold whatever he
   chooses to possess.

   2. If a regard to our individual well-being be the only ground of moral
   obligation, then a man has the right to whatever will make him happy.
   He may, and he certainly would, make a great mistake, if he supposed
   that taking what does not belong to him would promote his happiness;
   but he is restrained from such injustice only by a sense of prudence.
   He is entitled to have whatever in fact would make him happy, and for
   that reason.

   3. If regard to the general good, the greatest happiness of the
   greatest number, or expediency, as Paley makes it, be the rule and
   ground of duty, then it will always be a matter of opinion, a matter on
   which men will ever differ, what is, and what is not expedient. One
   might think that a community of goods would promote the greatest good,
   and then he would, at least in his own conscience, be entitled to act
   on that principle. Others might think that agrarianism, or the periodic
   distribution of all the land of the country in equal portions among the
   people, would promote the general good, and then that would be to them
   the rule of action. There would be no end to the devices to promote the
   greatest good, if the rights of men rested on no other foundation than
   that of expediency.

   Some of the most distinguished legal and philosophical writers of the
   present age teach that "property is founded on utility." With some,
   however, utility is not the ground, but rather the test of human rights
   and duties. The fact that an institution or a course of conduct is
   conducive to the public good, is not so much the reason why it is
   right, as a proof that it is right and in accordance with the will of
   God. "God designs the happiness of all his sentient creatures. Some
   human actions forward that benevolent purpose, or their tendencies are
   beneficent and useful. Other human actions are adverse to that purpose,
   or their tendencies are mischievous or pernicious. The former, as
   promoting his purpose, God has enjoined. The latter, as opposed to his
   purpose, God has forbidden. He has given us the faculty of observing;
   of remembering; and of reasoning; and by duly applying those faculties,
   we may collect the tendencies of our actions. Knowing the tendencies of
   our actions, and knowing his benevolent purpose, we know his tacit
   commands." [376] It is no doubt true that it is a fair and conclusive
   argument that a thing is right or wrong in itself and conformed or
   opposed to the will of God, that its tendency is of necessity and
   always to produce, on the one hand, good. or, on the other, evil. But
   this is a roundabout way of getting at the truth. Whether an
   institution or a course of action be useful or not, must be a matter of
   opinion. And if a matter of opinion, men will differ about it; and the
   opinion of one man, or even of the majority of men, will have no
   authority over others. God has revealed his will in his Word, and in
   the constitution of our nature. Paul says that even the heathen "do by
   nature the things contained in the law," that the law is "written in
   their hearts." (Rom. ii. 14, 15.) Property is sacred, not because in
   our opinion it is a useful institution, and hence inferentially
   approved by God, but He has said in the Bible, and says in every man's
   conscience, "Thou shalt not steal." Mr. Austin's theory does not
   prevent his teaching that "property jus in rem," depends on "principles
   of utility." [377]

   4. Paley says also that "the real foundation of our right [to property]
   is the law of the land." He admits, however, that the law may authorize
   the most flagitious injustice. He therefore makes a distinction between
   the words and the intention of the law; and adds: "With the law, we
   acknowledge, resides the disposal of property; so long, therefore, as
   we keep within the design and intention of a law, that law will justify
   us, as well in foro conscientiæ, as in foro humano, whatever be the
   equity or expediency of the law itself." [378] The law of the land has
   indeed legitimately much to do with questions of property; but the
   right itself does not rest upon that law, and is, in the sight of God,
   independent of it. The right exists prior to all law of the state. The
   law cannot ignore that right. It cannot rightfully deprive a man of his
   property, except in punishment of crime, or on the ground of stringent
   necessity, and, in the latter case, with due compensation. Property,
   however, is not the creature of the law. No unjust law gives a title to
   property, valid in the sight of God; that is, a title which should
   satisfy a conscientious man in entering upon its possession and use.
   Even when the law is not unjust, it may work, not legal, but moral
   injustice. A will, for example, may clearly express the wishes and
   intention of a testator, but for some clerical or technical error be
   set aside and the property go to a person for whom it was not intended.
   Such person would have a legal, but not a morally valid title to the
   property. Good men are sometimes heard to say: "We will take all the
   law gives us;" in saying this, they do not apprehend the full meaning
   of their words; it amounts to saying that in matters of property they
   will make the law of the land, and not the law of God, the rule of
   their conduct.

   5. It is a very common doctrine that the right of property is founded
   on common consent, or on the social compact. Men agree that each man
   may appropriate to himself a portion of what originally is common to
   all. But this consent only recognizes a right; it does not create it.
   If a man takes a glass of water from a stream common to all, it is of
   right his; and he has no need to appeal to any compact or consent to
   justify his appropriating it to himself. The question how a man
   acquires a right to property, and the nature of the right itself, as
   before remarked, are different questions, although intimately related.

   6. Both are included in the common theory on the subject. If a man puts
   under culture a portion of unappropriated land, it is for the time
   being his, on the principle that a man owns himself, and therefore the
   fruits of his labour. Exclusive possession and use of the land in
   question are necessary to secure the man those fruits; he has,
   therefore, the right to the land as long as he uses it. If he abandons
   it, his right ceases. On the other hand, if his use is continued, so as
   to involve occupancy, his right of possession becomes permanent. It is
   on this principle men act in mining districts in unoccupied lands. Each
   man, the first comer, stakes out for himself a claim; this he works, or
   is entitled to keep to himself. If he abandons it and goes elsewhere,
   it ceases to be his. If he permanently occupies it, it is permanently
   his. The right of property is thus made to rest on occupancy and use;
   in other words, on labour. But even this, according to Blackstone, is
   not a natural right. "All property," he says, "must cease upon death,
   considering men as absolute individuals, and unconnected with civil
   society: for then, by the principles before established, the next
   immediate occupant would acquire a right in all that the deceased
   possessed. But as, under civilized governments which are calculated for
   the peace of mankind, such a constitution would be productive of
   endless disturbances, universal law of almost every nation (which is a
   kind of secondary law of nature) has either given the dying person a
   power of continuing his property, by disposing of his possessions by
   will or, in case he neglects to dispose of it, or is not permitted to
   make any disposition at all, the municipal law of the country then
   steps in, and declares who shall be the successor, representative, or
   heir of the deceased; that is, who alone shall have a right to enter
   upon this vacant possession, in order to avoid that confusion which its
   becoming again common would occasion." On the same page, speaking of
   the right of inheritance, he says: "We are apt to conceive at first
   view that it has nature on its side; yet we often mistake for nature
   what we find established by long and inveterate custom. It is a wise
   and effectual, but clearly a political establishment; since the
   permanent right of property, vested in the ancestor himself, was no
   natural, but merely a civil right." [379] He had said before, [380]
   "Necessity begat property; and in order to insure that property,
   recourse was had to civil society, which brought along with it a long
   train of inseparable concomitants; states, government, laws,
   punishments, and the public exercise of religions duties." This seems
   to be inverting the natural order of things. Disregard of the moral law
   would result in endless evil, and there is an absolute necessity that
   its commands should be observed and enforced; but the obligation of the
   law does not rest on that necessity; it is altogether anterior and
   independent of it. So the right of property is anterior and independent
   of the necessity of its being held sacred, in order to secure the
   wellbeing of mankind. The fact is, that the right of property is
   analogous to the right of life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness. It
   does not come from men; it is not given by man; and it cannot be
   ignored, or arbitrarily interfered with by man. It rests on the will of
   God as revealed in the constitution of our nature and in our relation
   to persons and things around us.

   7. Stahl, the distinguished German jurist, gives substantially the
   following account of the matter. Man was formed out of the earth; but a
   divine spirit was breathed into him. He is, therefore, on the one hand,
   dependent on the material world; on the other, exalted above it. He is
   placed here as its lord and owner. The things of the outer world are
   given to him for the satisfaction of his physical wants, and of his
   spiritual necessities. He, therefore, has power and right over things
   external, and they must be permanently and securely under his control.
   This is the foundation of the right of property. Property is the means
   for the development of the individuality of the man. The manner in
   which it is acquired and used, reveals what the man is; his food,
   clothing, and habitation; his expenditures for sensual enjoyment, for
   objects of taste, of art, and of science, and for hospitality,
   benevolence, and the good of society; and the consecration of his
   acquisitions to the interests of a higher life, -- these in their
   totality as they rest on the right of property, make out a man's
   portrait. Property, however, is specially designed to enable a man to
   discharge his moral duties. Every man has duties of his own to perform;
   duties which belong to him alone, not to others, not to society; duties
   which arise out of his personal vocation and standing, especially such
   as belong to his own family. Therefore he must have what is exclusively
   his own. Property, therefore, is not intended for mere
   self-gratification or support; nor is it a mere objectless mastery over
   things external; it is the necessary means to enable a man to fulfil
   his divinely-appointed destiny. Herein lies the divine right of
   property! [381]

   The right of property, therefore, is not founded on the law of the
   land, or on any explicit or implied contract among men; but upon the
   law of nature. It is true that natural, as distinguished from positive
   laws, have been differently explained. "As the science of ethics," says
   Lord Mackenzie, "embraces the whole range of moral duties, its province
   is evidently much wider than that of jurisprudence, which treats only
   of those duties that can be enforced by external law." [382] The
   duties, however, which can be thus enforced are of two kinds; those
   which arise from the natural, and those which arise from common or
   statute law. "By the law of nature," says Chancellor Kent, [383] "I
   understand those fit and just rules of conduct which the Creator has
   prescribed to man as a dependent and social being, and which are to be
   ascertained from the deduction of right reason, though they may be more
   precisely known and more explicitly declared by divine revelation."
   Cicero, teaches that God is the author of natural law, and that its
   duties are of unchangeable obligation. He says, "Nec erit alia lex
   Romæ, alia Athenis, alia nunc, alia posthac; sed et omnes gentes et
   omni tempore una lex et sempiterna et immutabilis continebit, unusque
   erit communis quasi magister et imperator omnium deus." [384]

   Lord Mackenzie gives the doctrine of Cicero the sanction of his own
   judgment: "Where," he says, "the law of nature absolutely commands or
   forbids, it is immutable and of universal obligation, so that, although
   it may be confirmed, it cannot be controlled by human laws without a
   manifest violation of the divine will." [385]

   In these days, when so many are disposed to throw off the authority of
   God, and regard marriage and property as mere creatures of the law,
   which may be regulated or ignored at the caprice or will of the people,
   it is well to remind them that there is a law higher than any law of
   man, enforced by the authority of God, which no man and no community
   can violate with impunity.

   Although the right of property involves the right of absolute control,
   so that a man can do what he will with his own, it does not follow that
   this right is unlimited, or that the civil law has no legitimate
   control over the use or distribution of his property. A man has no
   right to use his knowledge or strength to the injury of his fellow-men;
   neither can he use his property so as to make it a public nuisance; nor
   can he devote it to any immoral or hurtful object; nor can he dispose
   of it by will so as to militate against the public policy. Of course,
   as different nations are organized on different principles, the laws
   regulating the use and distribution of property must also differ. Among
   the Hebrews the land of Canaan was originally distributed equitably
   among the several families. The head of the family had not the
   unrestricted control of what was thus given him. He could not finally
   alienate it. His sons, not his daughters, unless there were no sons,
   were his heirs. The first-born had a double portion. (Deut. xxi. 15
   ff.) These limitations of the right of property were ordained by God,
   in order that the ends of the theocracy might be accomplished. God saw
   fit to render it impossible that any large portion of the land should
   be engrossed by one or by a few families. In England public policy has
   assumed that it is important to maintain a powerful order of nobility.
   To secure that end the laws of primogeniture and entail have been long
   in force, with the result that the greater part of the land in Great
   Britain is in the hands of comparatively few families. This unequal
   distribution of property has gone on rapidly increasing, so that Hugh
   Miller, when editor of the "Edinburgh Witness," said that England was
   now like a pyramid poised on its apex. In France the right of a
   testator to dispose of his property is very much limited. "If any one
   die without issue or ascendants, he may leave his whole property to
   strangers; but if a man at his death has one lawful child, he can only
   so dispose of the half of his estate; if he leave two children, the
   third; and if he leave three or more children, the fourth." In Scotland
   "if a man die without either wife or issue, his whole property is at
   his own disposal; if he leave a wife and issue, his goods or personal
   property are divided into three equal parts, one of which goes to his
   wife as jus relictæ, another to his children as legitim (i.e., legitima
   portio), and the third is at his own disposal; if he leave no wife, he
   may dispose of one half, and the other half goes to his children, and
   so e converso, if he leave no children, the wife is entitled to one
   half, and he may bequeath the other." [386] These facts are referred to
   simply as illustrations of the way in which the law, both divine and
   human, may limit the exercise of the right of property while the
   sacredness of that right, as higher than any human law, is fully
   recognized.

   Community of Goods.

   Community of goods does not necessarily involve the denial of the right
   of private property. When Ananias, having sold a possession, kept back
   part of the price, Peter said to him: "While it remained was it not
   thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power?" (Acts
   v. 4.) Any number of men may agree to live in common, putting all their
   possessions and all the fruits of their labour into a common fund, from
   which each member is supplied according to his wants. This experiment
   was tried on a small scale and for a short time, by the early
   Christians in Jerusalem. "The multitude of them that believed were of
   one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the
   things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things
   common. . . . . Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as
   many as were possessors of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the
   prices of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the
   Apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man as he had
   need." (Acts iv. 32-35.) Some indeed say that these passages do not
   imply any actual community of goods. Having "all things common" is
   understood to mean, "No one regarded his possessions as belonging
   absolutely to himself, but as a trust for the benefit of others also."
   This interpretation seems inconsistent with the whole narrative. Those
   who had possessions sold them. They renounced all control over what was
   once their own. The price was handed over to the Apostles and
   distributed by them or under their direction.

   On the narrative as given in the Acts it may be remarked, --

   1. That the conduct of these early Christians was purely spontaneous.
   They were not commanded by the Apostles to sell their possessions and
   to have all things in common. There is not the slightest intimation
   that the Apostles gave any encouragement to this movement. They seem
   simply to have permitted it. They allowed the people to act under the
   impulse of their own feelings, each one doing what he pleased with his
   own.

   2. It can hardly be deemed unnatural that the early Christians were led
   into this experiment. To us the wonders of redemption are "the old, old
   story," inexpressibly precious indeed, but it has lost the power of
   novelty. In those to whom it was new it may well have produced an
   ecstatic bewilderment, which led their judgment astray. There are two
   great truths involved in the Gospel, the clear perception of which may
   account for the determination of those early converts to have all
   things in common. The one is that all believers are one body in Christ
   Jesus; all united to Him by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit; all
   equally partakers of his righteousness; all the objects of his love;
   and all destined to the same inheritance of glory. The other great
   truth is contained in the words of Christ, "Inasmuch as ye have done it
   unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."
   It was no wonder, then, that men whose minds were filled with these
   truths, were oblivious of mere prudential considerations.

   3. This experiment, for all that appears, was confined to the
   Christians in Jerusalem, and was soon abandoned. We never hear of it
   elsewhere or afterwards. It has, therefore, no preceptive force.

   4. The conditions of the success of this plan, on any large scale,
   cannot be found on earth. It supposes something near perfection in all
   embraced within the compass of its operation. It supposes that men will
   labour as assiduously without the stimulus of the desire to improve
   their condition and to secure the welfare of their families as with it.
   It supposes absolute disinterestedness on the part of the more wealthy,
   the stronger, or the more able members of the community. They must be
   willing to forego all personal advantages from their superior
   endowments. It supposes perfect integrity on the part of the
   distributors of the common fund, and a spirit of moderation and
   contentment in each member of the community, to be satisfied with what
   offers, and not he, may think to be his equitable share. We shall have
   to wait till the millennium before these conditions can be fulfilled.
   The attempt to introduce a general community of goods in the present
   state of the world, instead of elevating the poor, would reduce the
   whole mass of society to a common level of barbarism and poverty. The
   only secure basis of society is in those immutable principles of right
   and duty which God has revealed in his Word, and written upon the
   hearts of men. And these truths, even if acknowledged as matters of
   opinion, lose their authority and power if they cease to be regarded as
   revelations of the mind and will of God, to which human reason and
   human conduct must conform.

   Communism and Socialism.

   Heaven is not higher than "the lower parts of the earth," than the
   principles and aims of the early Christians were exalted above those of
   the modern advocates of the community of goods. This idea is not of
   modern origin. It appears in different forms in all ages of the world.
   It entered into the scheme of Plato's Republic, for in his view private
   property was the chief source of all social evils. It was included in
   the monasticism of the Middle Ages. Renunciation of the world included
   the renunciation of all property. Voluntary poverty was one of the vows
   of all monastic institutions. It was adopted by many of the mystical
   and fanatical sects which appeared before the Reformation, as the
   Beghards, and "Brethren of the Free Spirit," who taught that the world
   should be restored to its paradisiacal state, and that all the
   distinctions created by law, whether of social organization, property,
   or marriage, should be done away. At the time of the Reformation the
   followers of Münzer adopted the same principles, and their efforts to
   carry them into practice led to the miseries of the "peasant-war." All
   these movements were connected with fanatical religious doctrines. The
   leaders of these sects claimed to be inspired, and represented
   themselves as the organs and messengers of God.

   Modern communism, on the contrary, so far as its general character is
   concerned, is materialistic and atheistic, and in some of its forms
   pantheistic. [387] This is consistent with the admission that some of
   its advocates, as St. Simon, Fourier, and others were sincere and
   benevolent men. Some of them, indeed, said that they only desired to
   carry out the principle of brotherly love so often inculcated by
   Christ. Communism and socialism are not properly convertible terms,
   although often used to designate the same system. The one has reference
   more especially to the principle of community in property; the latter
   to the mode of social organization. With Fourier, the former warn
   subordinate to the latter. He did not entirely deny the right of
   property, but insisted that society was badly organized. Instead of
   living in distinct families, each struggling for support and
   advancement, men should be gathered in large associations having common
   property, and all labouring for a common fund. That fund was to be
   distributed according to the capital contributed by each member, and
   according to the time and skill employed in the common service.
   Proudhon, immortalized by the book in which the question "What is
   property?" is answered by saying, "Property is theft," makes the rule
   for the distribution of the common fund to be the time devoted to
   labour. Louis Blanc puts capital, labour, and skill out of
   consideration, and makes the wants of the individual the only rule of
   distribution. It is common to all these schemes that the right to
   property in land or its productions is denied. The two latter deny to a
   man all property in his own skill or talents; and the last, even in his
   labour, so that the idlest and least efficient member of society
   should, according to it, receive as much as the most industrious and
   useful.

   The denial of the right of property is, to a great extent, connected
   with the rejection of religion and of marriage. Marriage, next to
   religion and property, was declared to be the greatest means of social
   misery. Children were not to belong to their parents, but to the state;
   inclination and enjoyment were to be the motive and the end and the
   rule of life. [388]

   International Society.

   France has been the birthplace and the principal seat of Communism in
   its modern form. The principles involved in the system have made wide
   progress in other countries, and leavened to a fearful extent the minds
   of the labouring classes both in Europe and in America. Organization
   and combination among the scattered millions said to be included in the
   membership of this society have given it an importance which has forced
   itself on the attention of almost all Christian states. What the
   principles and aims of this formidable body are, it is not easy
   satisfactorily to state. There has been no authoritative annunciation
   of principles recognized by all the affiliated societies. They differ,
   within certain limits, doubtless, among themselves. Some find their fit
   representatives in the Communists of Paris as they revealed themselves
   during the current year (1871). Others would shrink from the excesses
   which rendered the name of Communists an object of execration and
   abhorrence in all parts of the civilized world. Enough, however, is
   known of the designs of the society in question, to render it certain
   that its success would involve the overthrow of all existing
   governments; in placing all power in the hands, not of the people, but
   of a particular class, the operatives, the proletariat (the men without
   land); in the dissolution of society as at present organized; the
   abolition of private property; the extinction of the family; the
   abrogation of all marriage laws; and the proscription of religion, and
   especially of Christianity, as a public evil. Such are the avowed
   objects of some of the leaders of the movement, and such are the
   logical consequences of the principles advocated by the more reticent
   of their number.

   It is a historical fact that Communism had its origin in its modern
   form in materialistic atheism; in the denial of God, who has the right
   to give laws to men, and the power and the purpose to enforce those
   laws by the retributions of justice; in the belief that the present
   life is the whole period of existence allotted to men, and that the
   enjoyments of this life are, therefore, all that men have to desire or
   expect. These principles had long been inculcated by such men as
   Rousseau, Voltaire, d'Holbach, Diderot, and others. To produce a
   conflagration, however, there must be not only fire, but combustible
   materials. These materialistic principles would have floated about as
   mere speculations, had there not been such a mass of suffering and
   degradation among the people. It was minds burdened with the
   consciousness of misery and the sense of injustice which were inflamed
   by the new doctrines, and which burst forth in a fire that for a time
   set all Europe in a blaze. We must not attribute all the evil either to
   the infidels or to the people. Had it not been for the preceding
   centuries of cruelty and oppression, France had not furnished such a
   bloody page to the history of modern Europe.

   "L'Internationale" for March 27th, 1870, expressed succinctly the
   object of the International Society: "The rights of the working-men,
   that is our principle; the organization of the working-men, that is our
   means of action; social revolution, that is our end." It is
   "working-men," artisans, not the mass of the people, educated or
   uneducated; but a single class whose interests are to be regarded. It
   is not a political revolution, the change of one form of government for
   another, that is the end aimed at; but a social revolution, a complete
   upturning of the existing order of society.

   As this institution is looming up with such portentous aspect in every
   direction, the question is, How is it to be met, and its influence
   counteracted? Open outbreaks may be suppressed by force, but the evil
   cannot be healed by any such means. Artillery is inefficient against
   opinions. If Communism, as organized in this society, owes its origin
   to the causes above specified, the rational method of procedure is, to
   correct or remove those causes. If Communism is the product of
   materialistic Atheism, its cure is to be found in Theism; in bringing
   the people to know and believe that there is a God on whom they are
   dependent and to whom they are responsible; in teaching them that this
   is not the only life, that the soul is immortal, and that men will be
   rewarded or punished in the world to come according to their character
   and conduct in the present life; that consequently well-being here is
   not the highest end of existence; that the poor here may hereafter be
   far more blessed than their rich neighbours; and that it is better to
   be Lazarus than Dives. It will be necessary to bring them to believe
   that there is a divine providence over the affairs of the world; that
   events are not determined by the blind operation of physical causes;
   but that God reigns; that He distributes to every one severally as He
   pleases; "that the Lord maketh poor and maketh rich;" that it is not
   the rich and the noble, but the poor and the lowly, that are his
   special favourites; and that the right of property, the right of
   marriage, the rights of parents and magistrates, are all ordained by
   God, and cannot be violated without incurring his displeasure and the
   certain infliction of divine punishment. To imbue the minds of the mass
   of the people, especially in great cities, will be a slow and difficult
   work; but it is absolutely necessary. If Materialism and Atheism are
   practically embraced by the mass of any community, it will inevitably
   perish. The religious training of the people, however, is only one half
   of the task which society has to accomplish, to secure its own
   existence and prosperity. The great body of the people must be rendered
   comfortable, or at least have the means of becoming so; and they must
   be treated with justice. Misery and a sense of wrong are the two great
   disturbing elements in the minds of the people. They are the slumbering
   fires which are ever ready to break out into destructive conflagration.

   Violations of the Eighth Commandment.

   It may well be doubted whether society is more in danger from the
   destructive principles of Communism, than from the secret or tolerated
   frauds which, to so great an extent, pervade almost all ate departments
   of social life. If this commandment forbids all unfair or unjust
   appropriation of the property of others to our own use or advantage, if
   every such appropriation is stealing in the sight of God, then theft is
   the most common of all the outward transgressions of the decalogue. It
   includes not merely vulgar theft such as the law can detect and punish,
   but, --

   1. All false pretences in matters of business; representing an article
   proposed for purchase or exchange to be other and better than it is.
   This includes a multitude of sins. Articles produced at home are sold
   as foreign productions, and the price asked and given is determined by
   this fraudulent representation. Shawls of Paris are sold as Indian;
   wines manufactured in this country are sold as the productions of
   France, Portugal, or Madeira. It is said that more Champagne wine is
   drunk in Russia than is made in France. More cigars are consumed in
   this country, under the name of Havanas, than Cuba produces. A great
   part of the paper made in the United States bears the stamp of London
   or Bristol. This kind of fraud has scarcely any limit. It does not seem
   to disturb any man's conscience. Worse than this is the selling things
   as sound and genuine, which in fact are spurious and often worthless.
   So wide-spread is fraud in matters of trade that it has become a legal
   maxim, "Let the buyer take care of himself." He should expect to be
   cheated, and therefore is required to be always on his guard. It is not
   uncommon to hear men say to a clergyman, "If I were dealing with a man
   of business, I would of course try to cheat him; for I know he would
   try to cheat me. But as you are not a man of business, I make an
   exception in your case, and will deal honestly."

   Under this head of false pretences comes the adulteration of articles
   of food, of medicine, and of the materials for clothing. The extent to
   which this is carried is fearful. The English Parliament not long since
   appointed a commission to examine into the adulterations of articles of
   food sold by the green grocers in London. The result of the examination
   was that only six out of every hundred of the specimens collected were
   pure, i.e., were what they were represented or declared to be. There is
   no reason to suppose that London is peculiar or preeminent in this kind
   of fraud. The same complaint is made of the adulteration of drugs. This
   evil was so great that some governments have taken the preparation of
   medicine for their navies and armies into their own hands. If we are to
   believe the public papers, the greater part of the wines and other
   liquors, spirituous and malt, sold to the public, are not only
   adulterated but mixed with poisonous drugs. The clothing furnished
   soldiers in active service, exposed to all the severities, and changes
   of weather, was and often is, made of worthless materials. There would
   be no end to the enumeration of frauds of this kind. A prominent
   English journal recently said that the great part of the revenue of the
   British government was taken up in endeavouring to prevent and detect
   frauds against the public.

   2. Another large class of violations of the eighth commandment
   comprises attempts to take undue advantage of the ignorance or of the
   necessities of our fellow-men. It is of the nature of theft if a man
   sells an article knowing it to be of less value than he to whom he
   offers it for sale takes it to be. If a man is aware that the credit of
   a bank is impaired, or that the affairs of a railroad, or of any other
   corporation, are embarrassed, and takes advantage of that knowledge, to
   dispose of the stock or notes of such corporations to those ignorant on
   the subject, demanding more for them than their actual worth, he is
   guilty of theft, if the command, "Thou shalt not steal," forbids all
   unfair acquisition of the property of our neighbour. In like manner all
   unfair attempts to enhance or depress the value of articles of
   commerce, are violations of the law of God. Unfounded reports are often
   designedly circulated to have this enhancing or depressing effect on
   values, so that advantage may be taken of the unwary or uninformed. It
   is an offence of the same kind to engross commodities to enhance their
   price. "He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but
   blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it." (Prov. xi.
   26.) Again it is a violation of the law to take advantage of the
   necessities of our fellow-men and to demand an exorbitant price for
   what they may need. In the recent dreadful conflagration in Chicago a
   thousand dollars were demanded for the use of a horse and wagon for a
   single hour. It may be said that there is no fixed standard of value;
   that a thing may be worth what it costs the man who owns it; or what it
   is worth to the man who demands it; or what it will bring in open
   market. If an hour's use of the horse and wagon was worth more to the
   man in Chicago than a thousand dollars, it may be said that it was not
   unfair to demand that sum. If this be so, then if a man perishing of
   thirst is willing to give his whole estate for a glass of water, it
   would be right to exact that price; or if a man in danger of drowning
   should offer a thousand dollars for a rope, we might refuse to throw it
   to him for a less reward. Such conduct every man feels would be worthy
   of execration. The fact is that things have an intrinsic value, however
   determined, which cannot be enhanced because our suffering fellow-men
   may be in pressing need of them.

   3. This commandment forbids also depriving men of property, on the
   ground of any mere technical flaw, or legal defect in their title. Such
   defect may be the effect of unavoidable ignorance; or loss by
   shipwreck, fire, theft, or other so called accident, of the evidence of
   their right. The law may in such cases be inexorable: it may be on the
   whole right that it should be so, but nevertheless the man who avails
   himself of such defect to get possession or his neighbour's property,
   breaks the command which says "Thou shalt not steal;" i.e., thou shalt
   not take what in the sight of God does not belong to you. Gambling
   falls under the same category where advantage is taken of the unwary or
   unskilful, to deprive them of their property without compensation. It
   is, however, impossible to enumerate or to classify the various methods
   of fraud. The code of morals held by many business and professional men
   is very far below the moral law as revealed in the Bible. This is
   especially true in reference to the eighth commandment in the
   decalogue. Many who have stood well in society, and even in the Church,
   will be astonished at the last day to find the word "Thieves" written
   after their names in the great book of judgment.

   accustomed to find his way through the mazes of Dr. Guerike's

   § 13. The Ninth Commandment.

   This commandment forbids all violations of the obligations of veracity.
   The most aggravated of this class of offences is bearing false wituess
   against our neighbour. But this includes every offence of the same
   general character; as the command thou shalt uot kill, forbids all
   indulgence or manifestation of malice.

   The command to keep truth inviolate belongs to a different class from
   those relating to the Sabbath, to marriage, or to property. These are
   founded on the permanent relations of men in the present state of
   existence. They are not in their own nature immutable. God may at any
   time suspend or modify them. But truth is at all times sacred, because
   it is one of the essential attributes of God, so that whatever
   militates against, or is hostile to truth is in opposition to the very
   nature of God. Truth is, so to speak, the very substratum of Deity. It
   is in such a sense the foundation of all the moral perfections of God,
   that without it they cannot be conceived of as existing. Unless God
   really is what He declares Himself to be; unless He means what He
   declares Himself to mean; unless He will do what He promises, the whole
   idea of God is lost. As there is no God but the true God, so without
   truth there is and can be no God. As this attribute is the foundation,
   so to speak, of the divine, so it is the foundation of the physical and
   moral order of the universe. What is the immutability of the laws of
   nature, but a revelation of the truth of God? They are manifestations
   of his purposes. They are promises on which his creatures rely, and by
   which they must regulate their conduct. If those laws were capricious,
   if the same effects did not uniformly follow from the same causes, the
   very existence of living beings would be impossible. The food of one
   day might be poison the next. If a man did not reap what he sowed,
   there could be no security for anything. The truth of God, therefore,
   is written on the heavens. It is the daily proclamation made by the
   sun, moon, and stars in their solemn procession through space, and it
   is echoed back by the earth and all that it contains.

   The truth of God, too, is the foundation of all knowledge. How do we
   know that our senses do not deceive us; that consciousness is not
   mendacious? that the laws of belief which by the constitution of our
   nature we are forced to obey, are not false guides? Unless God be true
   there can be no certainty in anything; much less can there be any
   security; we can have no confidence in the future: no assurance that
   evil will not ultimately triumph over good, darkness over light, and
   confusion and misery over order and happiness. There is, therefore,
   something awfully sacred in the obligations of truth. A man who
   violates the truth, sins against the very foundation of his moral
   being. As a false god is no god, so a false man is no man; he can never
   be what man was designed to be; he can never answer the end of his
   being. There can be in him nothing that is stable, trustworthy, or
   good.

   There are two classes of sins which the ninth commandment forbids. The
   first is, all forms of detraction; everything which is unjustly or
   unnecessarily injurious to our neighbour's good name; and the second,
   all violations of the laws of truth. This latter, indeed, includes the
   former. Bearing false witness, however, being the definite thing
   forbidden, should be separately considered.

   Detraction.

   The highest form of this offence is bearing false testimony in a court
   of justice. This includes the guilt of malice, falsehood, and mockery
   of God; and its commission justly renders a man infamous, and places
   him outside of the pale of society. As it strikes at the security of
   character, property, and even of life, it is an offence which cannot be
   passed by with impunity. The false swearer is, therefore, a criminal in
   the sight of the civil law, and subject to public disgrace and
   punishment.

   Slander is an offence of the same character. It differs from the sin of
   bearing false witness, only in not being committed in a judicial
   process, and in not being attended by the same effect. The slanderer,
   however, does bear false witness against his neighbour. He does it in
   the ears of the public, and not in those of a jury. The offence
   includes the elements of malice and falsehood against which the command
   is specially directed. The circulation of false reports,
   "tale-bearing," as it is called in Scripture, is indicative of the same
   state of mind, and comes under the same condemnation. As the law of God
   takes cognizance of the thoughts and intents of the heart, in
   condemning an external act it condemns the disposition which tends to
   produce it. In condemning all speaking ill of our neighbour, the
   Scriptures condemn a suspicious temper, a disposition to impute bad
   motives, and an unwillingness to believe that men are sincere and
   honest in the avowal of their principles and aims. This is the opposite
   of that charity which "thinketh no evil," "believeth all things, hopeth
   all things." It is still more opposed to the spirit of this law, that
   we should cherish or express satisfaction in the disgrace of others,
   even if they be our competitors or enemies. We are commanded to
   "rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep." (Rom.
   xii. 15.)

   The usages of life, or the principles of professional men, allow of
   many things which are clearly inconsistent with the requirements of the
   ninth commandment. Lord Brougham is reported to have said in the House
   of Lords, that an advocate knows no one but his client. He is bound per
   fus et nefas, if possible, to clear him. If necessary for the
   accomplishment of that object, he is at liberty to accuse and defame
   the innocent, and even (as the report stated) to ruin his country.
   [389] It is not unusual, especially in trials for murder, for the
   advocates of the accused to charge the crime on innocent parties and to
   exert all their ingenuity to convince the jury of their guilt. This is
   a cruel and wicked injustice, a clear violation of the command which
   says. "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour."

   Falsehood.

   1. The simplest and most comprehensive definition of falsehood is,
   enunciatio falsi. This enunciation need not be verbal. A sign or
   gesture may be as significant as a word. If, to borrow Paley's
   illustration, a man is asked which of two roads is the right one to a
   given place, and he intentionally points to the wrong one, he is as
   guilty of falsehood as if he had given the wrong directions in words.
   This is true; nevertheless there is a power peculiar to words. A
   thought, a feeling, or a conviction is not only more clearly revealed
   in the consciousness when clothed in words, but it is thereby
   strengthened. Every man feels this when he says, "I believe;" or, "I
   know that my Redeemer liveth."

   2. The above definition of falsehood, although resting on high
   authority, is too comprehensive. It is not every enunciatio falsi which
   is a falsehood. This enunciation may be made through ignorance or
   mistake, and therefore be perfectly innocent. It may even be deliberate
   and intentional. This we see in the case of fables and parables, and in
   works of fiction. No one regards the Iliad or the Paradise Lost as a
   repertorium of falsehoods. It is not necessary to assume that the
   parables of our Lord, are veritable histories. They were not designed
   to give a narrative of actual occurrences. Intention to deceive,
   therefore, is an element in the idea of falsehood. But even this is not
   always culpable. When Pharaoh commanded the Hebrew midwives to slay the
   male children of their countrywomen, they disobeyed him. And when
   called to account for their disobedience, they said, "The Hebrew women
   are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered
   ere the midwives come in unto them. Therefore God dealt well with the
   midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty." (Ex. i.
   19, 20.) In 1 Samuel xvi. 1, 2, we read that God said to Samuel, "I
   will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king
   among his sons. And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will
   kill me. And the Lord said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am
   come to sacrifice to the Lord." Here, it is said, is a case of
   intentional deception actually commanded. Saul was to be deceived as to
   the object of Samuel's journey to Bethlehem. Still more marked is the
   conduct of Elisha as recorded in 2 Kings vi. 14-20. The king of Syria
   sent soldiers to seize the prophet at Dothan. "And when they came down
   to him, Elisha prayed unto the Lord, and said, Smite this people I pray
   thee with blindness. And He smote them with blindness, according to the
   word of Elisha. And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way neither
   is this the city: follow me and I will bring you to the man whom ye
   seek. But he led them to Samaria. And it came to pass, when they were
   come into Samaria, that Elisha said, Lord, open the eyes of these men,
   that they may see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and
   behold, they were in the midst of Samaria;" that is, in the hands of
   their enemies. The prophet. however, would not allow them to be
   injured; but commanded that they should be fed and sent back to their
   master. Examples of this kind of deception are numerous in the Old
   Testament. Some of them are simply recorded facts, without anything to
   indicate how they were regarded in the sight of God; but others, as in
   the cases above cited, received either directly or by implication the
   divine sanction. Of our blessed Lord himself it is said in Luke xxiv.
   28, "He made as though (prosepoieito, he made a show of) he would have
   gone further." He so acted as to make the impression on the two
   disciples that it was his purpose to continue his journey. (Comp. Mark
   vi. 48.) Many theologians do not admit that the fact recorded in Luke
   xxiv. 28, involved any intentional deception; because the "simulatio
   non fuerit in verbis veritati contradicentibus, sed in gestibus
   veritati consentientibus. Christus . . . . agebat, ut qui iturus esset
   longius, et revera iturus fuerat, nisi rogatus fuisset a discipulis,
   alia fortasse ratione se iis manifesturus. . . . . Alii dicunt,
   simulationem fuisse tentatoriam, æque ac illam, quæ in Abrahami
   historia a scriptore sacro commemoratur Gen. xxii. 2. In eandem
   sententiam descendunt Beausobre et L'Enfant, qui in notis gallicis ad
   Luc. xxiv. 28, ita scribunt: C'est un feinte innocente et pleine
   d'amour, par laquelle Jésus-Christ veut éprouver la foi de ses
   disciples. Ainsi en usent les medicins à l'égard des malades, et les
   pères à l'égard de leurs enfans." [390]

   It is the general sentiment among moralists that stratagems in war are
   allowable; that it is lawful not only to conceal intended movements
   from an enemy, but also to mislead him as to your intentions. A great
   part of the skill of a military commander is evinced in detecting the
   intentions of his adversary, and in concealing his own. Few men would
   be so scrupulous as to refuse to keep a light in a room, when robbery
   was apprehended, with the purpose of producing the impression that the
   members of the household were on the alert.

   On these grounds it is generally admitted that in criminal falsehoods
   there must be not only the enunciation or signification of what is
   false, and an intention to deceive, but also a violation of some
   obligation. If there may be any combination of circumstances under
   which a man is not bound to speak the truth, those to whom the
   declaration or signification is made have no right to expect him to do
   so. A general is under no obligation to reveal his intended movements
   to his adversary; and his adversary has no right to suppose that his
   apparent intention is his real purpose. Elisha was under no obligation
   to aid the Syrians in securing his person and taking his life; and they
   had no right to assume that he would thus assist them. And, therefore,
   he did no wrong in misleading them. There will always be cases in which
   the rule of duty is a matter of doubt. It is often said that the rule
   above stated applies when a robber demands your purse. It is said to be
   right to deny that you have anything of value about you. You are not
   bound to aid him in committing a crime; and he has no right to assume
   that you will facilitate the accomplishment of his object. This is not
   so clear. The obligation to speak the truth is a very solemn one; and
   when the choice is left a man to tell a lie or lose his money, he had
   better let his money go. On the other hand, if a mother sees a murderer
   in pursuit of her child, she has a perfect right to mislead him by any
   means in her power, because the general obligation to speak the truth
   is merged or lost, for the time being, in the higher obligation. This
   principle is not invalidated by its possible or actual abuse. It has
   been greatly abused. Jesuits taught that the obligations to promote the
   good of the Church absorbed or superseded every other obligation. And,
   therefore, in their system not only falsehood and mental reservation,
   but perjury, robbery, and assassination became lawful if committed with
   the design of promoting the interests of the Church. Notwithstanding
   this liability to abuse, the principle that a higher obligation
   absolves from a lower stands firm. It is a dictate even of the natural
   conscience. It is evidently right to inflict pain in order to save
   life. It is right to subject travellers to quarantine, although it may
   grievously interfere with their wishes or interests, to save a city
   from pestilence. The principle itself is clearly inculcated by our Lord
   when He said, "I will have mercy and not sacrifice;" and when He taught
   that it was right to violate the Sabbath in order to save the life of
   an ox, or even to prevent its suffering. The Jesuits erred in assuming
   that the promotion of the interests of the Church (in their sense
   especially of the word Church) was a higher duty than obedience to the
   moral law. They erred also in assuming that the interests of the Church
   could be promoted by the commission of crime; and their principle was
   in direct violation of the Scriptural rule that it is wrong to do evil
   that good may come.

   The question now under consideration is not whether it is ever right to
   do wrong, which is a solecism; nor is the question whether it is ever
   right to lie; but rather what constitutes a lie. It is not simply an
   "enunciatio falsi," nor, as it is commonly defined by the moralists of
   the Church of Rome, a "locutio contra mentem loquentis;" [391] but
   there must be an intention to deceive when we are expected and bound to
   speak the truth. That is, there are circumstances in which a man is not
   bound to speak the truth, and therefore there are cases in which
   speaking or intimating what is not true is not a lie. The Roman
   moralists just referred to, answer the question, Whether it is ever
   lawful to lie? in the negative. Dens, for example goes so far as to
   say: "Non licet mentiri (i.e., to utter what is not true, as he defines
   the word mendacium') ad avertendum mortem aut interitum Reipublicæ, vel
   quæcunque alia mala: in hujusmodi perplexitatibus debent homines
   confugere ad auxilium Dei, angeli custodis," etc. [392] This is a sound
   rule, provided the obligation to speak the truth exists. It is far
   better that a man should die or permit a murder to be committed, than
   that he should sin against God. Nothing could tempt the Christian
   martyrs to save their own lives or the lives of their brethren by
   denying Christ, or by professing to believe in false gods; in these
   cases the obligation to speak the truth was in full force. But in the
   case of a commanding general in time of war, the obligation does not
   exist to intimate his true intentions to his adversary. Intentional
   deception in his case is not morally a falsehood. Although the Romanist
   theologians lay down the rule that a mendacium is never lawful, and
   although they define mendacium as stated above, yet they teach that if
   a confessor is asked whether he knows a fact confided to him in the
   confessional, he is at liberty to answer, No; meaning that he does not
   know it scientia communicabili. That is, he is authorized, according to
   their own definition of the word, to tell a downright falsehood. He may
   be right to reply to the question, Whether he knows a fact communicated
   to him in his character of confessor, by saying, "I am not at liberty
   to answer;" but it is hard to see how he could be justified in a direct
   falsehood. [393]

   In order to include the third element entering into the nature of
   criminal falsehood, Paley defines a lie to be a violation of a promise.
   Every violation of a promise is not a lie, for it may not include the
   other elements of a falsehood; but every lie is a violation of a
   promise. It arises out of the very nature of human society, and from
   the relation in which men of necessity stand to each other, that every
   man is expected to speak the truth, and is under a tacit but binding
   promise not to deceive his neighbours by word or act. If in any case he
   is guilty of intentional deception, he must be able to show that in
   that particular case the obligation does not exist; that is, that the
   party deceived has no right to expect the truth, and that no virtual
   promise is violated in deceiving him. This is certainly the fact in
   military manoeuvres, and in some other cases of rare occurrence.

   This, however, is not always admitted. Augustine, for example, makes
   every intentional deception, no matter what the object or what the
   circumstances, to be sinful. "Ille mentitur," he says, "qui aliud habet
   in animo, et aliud verbis vel quibuslibet significationibus enuntiat."
   [394] Again he says, [395] "Nemo autem dubitat mentiri eum qui volens
   falsum enuntiat causa fallendi: quapropter enuntiationem falsam cum
   voluntate ad fallendum prolatam, manifestum est esse mendacium." He
   reviews the cases recorded in the Bible which seem to teach the
   opposite doctrine. This would be the simplest ground for the moralist
   to take. But, as shown above, and as generally admitted, there are
   cases of intentional deception which are not criminal.

   Kinds of Falsehood.

   Augustine divides falsehood into no less than eight classes. But these
   differ for the most part simply as to their subject matter, or their
   effects. The division as given by Thomas Aquinas and very generally
   adopted since, [396] is into three classes; the pernicious, the
   benevolent, and the jocose. Under the first head come all falsehoods
   which are instigated by any evil motive and are designed to promote
   some evil end. It includes not only the direct enunciation of what is
   false, but also all quibbling or prevarication.

   Mental Reservation.

   This class includes also all cases of mental reservation. It should be
   said in justice to the teachers of Moral Theology in the Romish Church,
   that, although the Jesuits made themselves so obnoxious by asserting
   the propriety of mental reservation, they at least in general terms
   condemn it. "Restrictio mentalis," says Gury, "est actus mentis verba
   alicujus propositionis ad alium sensum quam naturalem et obvium
   detorquentis vel restringentis." This he says is unlawful, because it
   is "simpliciter mendacium." It is true these theologians make serious
   modifications of this rule. It is only of reservation "proprie
   mentalis," that is, when the true meaning of the speaker cannot be
   detected, that this condemnation is pronounced. If it be possible, from
   the circumstances of the mode of expression, to know what he means, the
   rule does not always apply. There are cases in which it is allowable to
   permit a man to deceive himself. Under this head is brought in the case
   above referred to. It is said that a confessor may properly say that he
   does not know a thing, when he means that he does not know it as a man,
   or with a knowledge that is communicable. So it is said that if a man
   be asked by one who has no right to interrogate him, whether he has
   committed a crime, he may say, No; meaning none that he was bound to
   confess. So also it is taught that public persons, ambassadors,
   magistrates, advocates, etc., may use mental reservation in its wider
   sense. In like manner a servant may say his master is not at home, whom
   he knows to be in the house, because such denial so often means that
   the person inquired for does not wish to be seen. [397] This opens a
   very wide door of which not only Jesuits, but men professing to be
   Protestants and Christians freely avail themselves. To an unsophistical
   mind all the instances above specified are cases of unmitigated
   falsehood.

   The extent to which the Jesuits carried the principle of mental
   reservation is a matter of notoriety. The three rules by which they
   perverted the whole system of morals, and which threatened to overturn
   the very foundations of society, and which led at one time to the
   suppression of the order, were, --

   1. The doctrine that the character of an act depended solely on the
   intention. If the intention be good, the act is good; whether it be
   falsehood, perjury, murder, or any other conceivable crime. Pascal
   quotes the Jesuit moralist Escobar as laying down the general
   principle, "that promises are not binding unless there was an intention
   of keeping them, at the time they were made." [398] On the same
   principle, that the intention determines the character of the act, the
   murder of Henry III. in 1589; of the Prince of Orange in 1584; of Henry
   IV. of France in 1610; and especially the massacres on the feast of St.
   Bartholomew, were all justified. This principle is not confined to the
   Jesuits. When in 1819 young Sand murdered Kotzebue, the poet, from
   political motives, he not only justified the act to the last, but
   perhaps the general sentiment among his younger countrymen was that of
   approbation. Even De Wette, the distinguished theologian and
   commentator, in a letter of consolation to the mother of Sand, spoke of
   the assassination as "a favourable sign of the times." [399] It was
   regarded very much as the killing of Marat by Charlotte Corday is
   regarded by the public to this day. When the doctrine comes to be
   formalized as a moral principle that the intention determines the
   character of the act, so that murder committed for the good of the
   Church or the State is commendable, then the law of God is set at
   nought and the bonds of society are unloosed.

   2. The doctrine of probability. If it was probable that an act was
   right there was no sin in committing it, although in the conviction of
   the agent the act was wrong; and an act was probably right, if among
   the moralists there was a difference of opinion on the subject.

   3. The above-mentioned doctrine of mental reservation. It was taught
   that a man might innocently swear he did not do a certain thing,
   provided he said to himself, not audibly to others, "I mean I did not
   do it ten years ago." All these different kinds of lying, though
   referred to different heads by the Jesuit teachers, belong properly to
   the class of pernicious falsehoods, such as the law of God utterly
   condemns.

   The second class, called "mendacia officiosa," includes all falsehoods
   uttered for a good object. Such as those told the sick by their
   attendants, to comfort or encourage them; those told by detectives for
   the discovery of crimes; or those which are designed to prevent evil or
   secure good for ourselves or others. All such falsehoods are pronounced
   by Romanists to be venial sins, mere peccadilloes. [400] The example
   given by Dens, in the place referred to, of this class of sins, is the
   case of a man having money, denying that he has it to avoid being
   robbed. This is very different from the doctrine of Augustine, who
   teaches that it is unlawful to lie to save life, or even to save a
   soul. [401] Augustine's position is consistent with what was said
   above, that there are occasions on which a higher obligation absolves
   from a lower, as our Lord himself teaches. But that principle applies
   to the case of falsehood only when the enunciation of what is untrue
   ceases to be falsehood in the criminal sense of the word. It has been
   seen that three elements enter into the nature of falsehood properly so
   called, (1.) The enunciation of what is false. (2.) The intention to
   deceive. (3.) The violation of a promise; that is, the violation of the
   obligation to speak the truth, the obligation which rests upon every
   man to keep faith with his neighbour. In military manoeuvres, as above
   remarked, there is no expectation, and no right for expectation, that a
   general will reveal his true intentions to his adversary, and therefore
   in that case deception is not falsehood, because there is no violation
   of an obligation. But when a confessor was called upon by a heathen
   magistrate to say whether he was a Christian, he was expected, and
   bound to speak the truth, although he knew the consequence would be a
   cruel death. So when a man is asked if he has money about him, he is
   expected to speak the truth, and has no right to lie any more than a
   Christian had a right to lie to save his life. The doctrine that
   "mendacia officiosa" are only venial sins, rests on the principle that
   the intention determines the character of the act. The simple
   Scriptural rule is, that he who does "evil that good may come," his
   "damnation is just."

   It is a fact of experience, that, so far as our inner life at least is
   concerned, exorbitant attention to how to do a thing destroys the
   ability to do it. An adept in logic may be a very poor reasoner; and a
   man who spends his life in studying the rules of elocution may be a
   very indifferent orator. So a man versed in all the subtleties of
   casuistry is apt to lose the clear and simple apprehension of right and
   wrong. Professor Gury has for the motto of his book on moral theology,
   the words of St. Gregory: "Ars artium regimen animarum." Very true, but
   it is a bad way to lead a man to a given point to put him into a
   labyrinth. These books of casuistry only serve to mystify the plainest
   subjects. Indulging in such subtleties can hardly fail to lead to the
   adoption of false principles. It is very plain that the man who was at
   once a prince and a bishop, could not well be drunk as prince and sober
   as bishop; yet, as we have seen, these books teach that a priest may
   lie as a man, and yet speak truth as a vicar of God. The plain
   directions of the Word of God and a conscience enlightened by his
   Spirit, are safer guides in matters of duty than all the books on moral
   theology the Jesuits evet wrote. This is not saying that morals are not
   a proper subject of study, or that there is not a call in that field
   for the exercise of discrimination and distinction. The objection is
   not to the study of morals, but to inordinate devotion to that
   department, and to the perplexing and perverting subtleties of
   casuistry.

   Pious Frauds.

   Pious fraud was reduced by Romanists to a science and an art. It was
   called economics, from oikonomia, "dispensatio rei familiaris," the
   discretionary use of things in a family according to circumstances. The
   theory is founded on the principle that if the intention be lawful, the
   act is lawful. Any act, therefore, designed to promote any "pious" end
   is justifiable "in foro conscientiæ." This principle was introduced at
   an early period into the Christian Church. Mosheim attributes to it a
   heathen origin. [402] He says that the Platonists and Pythagoreans
   taught that it was commendable to lie to promote a good end. The evil,
   however, had probably an independent origin wherever it appeared. It is
   plausible enough to rise spontaneously in any mind not under the
   control of the Word and Spirit of God.

   Augustine had to contend against this error in his day. There were
   certain orthodox Christians who thought it right falsely to assert that
   they were Priscillianists in order to gain their confidence and thus be
   able to convict them of heresy. This brought up the question whether it
   was allowable to commit a fraud for a good end; in other words, whether
   the intention determined the character of the act. Augustine took the
   negative of the question, and argued that a lie was always a lie, and
   always wicked that it was not lawful to tell a falsehood for any
   purpose whatever. "Interest quidem plurimum," he says, "qua causa, quo
   fine, qua intentione quid fiat: sed ea quæ constat esse peccata, nullo
   bonæ causæ obtentu, nullo quasi bono fine, nulla velut bona intentione
   facienda sunt. . . . . Cum vero jam opera ipsa peccata sunt; sicut
   furta, stupra, blasphemiæ, vel cætera talia; quis est qui dicat causis
   bonis esse facienda, ut vel peccata non sint, vel quod est absurdius,
   justa peccata sint? Quis est qui dicat: ut habeamus quod demus
   pauperibus, faciamus furta divitibus; aut, testimonia falsa vendamus,
   maxime si non inde innocentes læduntur, sed nocentes potius damnaturis
   judicibus eruuntur?" [403] He specially condemns all "pious frauds,"
   i.e., frauds committed in pretended service of religion.

   Notwithstanding the authority of Augustine, the doctrine that it was
   right to use fraud in efforts to promote the interests of the Church,
   was openly avowed by some of his contemporaries and many of his
   immediate successors, and during the Middle Ages was the practical rule
   of the Romish Church, as it is at the present day. Among the early
   advocates of this lax principle of morals is found the name even of
   Jerome. In his epistle to Pammachius, he says, that in teaching, a man
   is bound to be honest, but in dealing with an adversary, he may do what
   he pleases; it is right "nunc hæc nunc illa proponere. Argumentari ut
   libet, aliud loqui, aliud agere, panem, ut dicitur, ostendere, lapidem
   tenere." [404] The principle that the intention sanctifles the deed, is
   clearly asserted by John Cassian, a disciple of Chrysostom. Falsehood,
   he says, is like poison: taken moderately and in illness, it may be
   salutary; but if taken inopportunely, it is fatal. "Non enim Deus
   verborum tantum actuumque nostrorum discussor et judex, sed etiam
   propositi ac destinationis inspector est. . . . . Ille tamen intimam
   cordis inspiciens pietatem, non verborum sonum, sed votum dijudicat
   voluntatis, quia finis, operis et affectus considerandus est
   perpetrantis." [405]

   Forgeries.

   The principle having been once admitted that it is right to deceive in
   order to accomplish a good object, there was no limit set in practice
   to its application. Hence, --

   1. Even from the earliest times genuine works of the apostolic fathers
   were corrupted by interpolations; and works were issued bearing the
   names of authors who were dead long before the works were written.
   Besides the apocryphal books which are now admitted to be spurious, the
   Letters of Ignatius, a portion of which are generally received as
   authentic, were so corrupted as to be the source of an extended and
   permanent evil influence. Of these letters there are, as is well known,
   three recensions, the larger containing fifteen epistles, the shorter,
   and the Syrian, founded on a Syriac translation. The larger collection
   is given up by scholars as spurious; as to the others, many who admit
   their authenticity, insist that they are more or less corrupted by
   interpolation. [406]

   The so-called "Apostolical Constitutions" are a collection of rules or
   canons derived partly from the New Testament, partly from the decisions
   of early provincial councils, and partly from tradition; all, however,
   imposed on the Church as of apostolical authority. As the number of
   councils increased there was a necessity for renewed collections of
   their decisions. These collections included "decretals" issued by the
   Bishop of Rome; both classes being included under the name of "canons,"
   these collections were gradually consolidated into the Canon Law. It
   was a natural and easy method of imposing on the Church to insert
   spurious decretals in the collections from time to time, and to found
   on these forgeries exorbitant pretensions to priestly dignity and
   power. The most notorious of these impositions is what is known as the
   Decretals of Isidore, Bishop of Seville, the most distinguished writer
   of the seventh century. He died A.D. 636. The collection which went
   under his name did not make its appearance until the ninth century. It
   contains many genuine decretals and canons, but also litany that are
   manifest forgeries. The author of the collection and of the spurious
   documents it contains is unknown. Its date is fixed by Gieseler between
   829 and 845. These decretals "were soon circulated," says that
   historian, "in various collections, appealed to without suspicion in
   public transactions, and used by the popes, from Nicolaus I.,
   immediately after he had become acquainted with them (864), without any
   opposition being made to their authenticity, and continued in
   undiminished reputation, till the Reformation led to the detection of
   the cheat. On these false decretals were founded the pretensions of the
   popes to universal sway in the Church; while the pretended donatio
   Constantini M.,' a fiction of an earlier time, but soon adopted into
   them, was the first step from which the papacy endeavoured to elevate
   itself even above the state." [407] The authenticity of these documents
   was first seriously attacked by the Magdeburgh Centuriators, who were
   answered by the Jesuit Turrianus. "The question was decided by Dav.
   Blondelli Pseudoisidorus et Turrianus vapulantes, Genev. 1628. The
   Ultramontanists, though they admit the deception, deny the revolution
   of ecclesiastical principles caused by it." [408] These decretals
   attribute to the pope absolute supremacy over the Church, over
   patriarchs, bishops, and priests. To him an appeal lies in all
   questions of doctrine, and his decisions are final. The gift of
   Constantine conferred on the pontiff more than imperial dignity and
   power. It conveyed the sovereignty of the city of Rome, of Italy, and
   of the western provinces. Among other things it says, "Et sicut nostram
   terrenam imperialem potentiam, sic ejus (Petri) sacrosanctam Romanam
   Ecclesiam decrevimus veneranter honorari, et amplius quam nostrum
   imperium terrenumque thronum, sedem sacratissimam b. Petri gloriose
   exaltari: tribuentes ei potestatem et gloriæ dignitatem, atque vigorem
   et honorificentiam imperialem. Unde ut pontificalis apex non vilescat,
   sed magis quam imperii dignitas, gloria et potentia decoretur, ecce tam
   palatium nostrum, ut prædictum est, quam Romanam urbem, et omnes
   Italiæ, seu occidentalium regionum provincias, loca et civitates
   præfato beatissimo Pontifici nostro Sylvestro, universali papæ,
   contradimus atque relinquimus: et ab eo et a successoribus ejus per
   hanc divalem nostram, et pragmaticum constitutum decernimus disponenda,
   atque juri sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ concedimus permansura." [409]

   False Miracles.

   The second great class of pious frauds by which the Church of Rome has
   for ages endeavoured to sustain its errors and confirm its power, is
   that of pretended miracles. On this subject it may be remarked, --

   1. That there is nothing in the New Testament inconsistent with the
   occurrence of miracles in the post-apostolic age of the Church. The
   Apostles were indeed chosen to be the witnesses of Christ, to bear
   testimony to the facts of his history and to the doctrines which He
   taught. And among the signs of an Apostle, or necessary credentials of
   his commission, was the power to work miracles. (Rom. xv. 18, 19; 2
   Cor. xii. 12.) When the Apostles had finished their work, the necessity
   of miracles, so far as the great end they were intended to accomplish
   was concerned, ceased. This, however, does not preclude the possibility
   of their occurrence, on suitable occasions, in after ages. It is a mere
   question of fact to be decided on historical evidence. In some few
   cases the nature of the event, its consequences, and the testimony in
   its support, have constrained many Protestants to admit the
   probability, if not the certainty of these miraculous interventions.
   [410] Among the controversial writings which the great questions in
   debate in the late Vatican Council have called forth, there are two of
   special interest which have already been translated and circulated in
   this country. The one is entitled "The Pope and The Council," [411] a
   series of papers written by German Catholic scholars of distinction. It
   is a historical argument against Ultramontanism. Among other things it
   demonstrates that the claims of the Ultramontanists have been sustained
   by a regular system of forgeries in all ages of the Church. [412]

   The other work is by the late Abbe Gratry, [413] one of the most
   distinguished Romish ecclesiastics of France, whose death has just been
   announced. In these masterly letters the writer establishes two points,
   as he says truly beyond the possibility of rational denial. The first
   is, that the popes have erred when speaking "ex cathedra," and
   therefore are not infallible; and the second, that the claims of Papal
   infallibility have been sustained by the most bare-faced and persistent
   forgeries and frauds. Both of these points are proved specially in the
   case of Pope Honorius. Yet, sad to say, this eminent man, not long
   before his death, submitted to the decree of the Vatican Council by
   which the infallibility of the Pope was made an article of faith. He
   said he "erased" all he had written aganst that doctrine. [414]

   2. During the first hundred years after the death of the Apostles we
   hear little or nothing of the working of miracles by the early
   Christians. On this point Bishop Douglass says, "If we except the
   testimonies of Papias and Irenæus, who speak of raising the
   dead, . . . . I can find no instances of miracles mentioned by the
   fathers before the fourth century, as what were performed by Christians
   in their times, but the cures of diseases, particularly the cures of
   demoniacs, by exorcising them, which last, indeed, seems to be the
   favourite standing miracle, and the only one which I find (after having
   turned over their writings carefully and with a view to this point):
   they challenged their adversaries to come and see them perform." [415]
   The fathers of the fourth century freely speak of the age of miracles
   as past, that such interpositions, being no longer necessary, were no
   longer to be expected. Thus Chrysostom says: "Ne itaque ex eo, quod
   nunc signa non fiunt, argumentum ducas tunc etiam non fuisse. Etenim
   tunc utiliter fiebant, et nunc utiliter non fiunt." [416] And Augustine
   says: "Cur, inquiunt, nunc illa miracula, quæ prædicatis facta esse,
   non fiunt? Possem quidem dicere, necessaria fuisse priusquam crederet
   mundus, ad hoc ut crederet mundus." [417] However these declarations
   may be reconciled with the fact that these fathers, themselves, give
   accounts of what passed for miracles in their day, they at least show
   that in their view there was such a difference between the Scriptural
   and ecclesiastical miracles that they did not belong to the same
   category. Although these miracles were unfrequent in the early ages of
   the Church, yet they rapidly increased in number until they became
   matters of every day's occurrence.

   3. They admit of being classified on different principles. As to their
   nature, some are grave and important; others are trifling, childish,
   and even babyish; others are indecorous; and others are irreverent and
   even blasphemous. Professor Newman, one of the richest prizes gained by
   the Romanists from the Church of England in this generation, is candid
   enough to admit the contrast between the Scriptural and what he calls
   ecclesiastical miracles. Of the former, he says, [418] "The miracles of
   Scripture are, as a whole, grave, simple, and majestic: those of
   ecclesiastical history often partake of what may not unfitly be called
   a romantic character, and of that wildness and inequality which enters
   into the notion of romance." He says, [419] "It is obvious to apply
   what has been said to the case of the miracles of the Church, as
   compared with those in Scripture. Scripture is to us a garden of Eden,
   and its creations are beautiful as well as very good,' but when we pass
   from the Apostolic to the following ages, it is as if we left the
   choicest valleys of the earth, the quietest and most harmonious
   scenery, and the most cultivated soil, for the luxuriant wildernesses
   of Africa or Asia, the natural home or kingdom of brute nature,
   uninfluenced by man." A more felicitous illustration can hardly be
   imagined. The contrast between the Gospels and the legends of the
   saints, is that between the divine and the human and even the animal;
   between Christ (with reverence be it spoken) and St. Anthony. Another
   principle on which these ecclesiastical miracles may be classified, is
   the design for which they were wrought or adduced. Some are brought
   forth as proofs of the sanctity of particular persons, or places, or
   things; some to sustain particular doctrines, such as purgatory,
   transubstantiation, the worshipping of the saints and of the Virgin
   Mary, etc., some for the identification of relics. It is no injustice
   to the authorities of the Church of Rome, to say, that whatever good
   ends these miracles may in any case be intended to serve, they have in
   the aggregate been made subservient to the accumulation of money and to
   the increase of power. The amount of money drawn from the single
   doctrine of purgatory and the assumed power of the keys over that
   imaginary place of torture, is beyond all computation. And the whole
   fabric of priestly power, the most absolute and the most dreaded ever
   exercised over men, would fall to the ground if it were not the belief
   of the people, founded mainly on "lying wonders," that the priests have
   power to forgive sin, to save or to destroy souls at will, or at
   discretion. If this doctrine be false, the whole Romish system is
   false. Romanists, therefore, have everything at stake on this question.
   Bishop Jeremy Taylor, writing to a lady "seduced to the Church of
   Rome," said long ago, "All the points of difference between us and your
   Church are such as do evidently serve the ends of covetousness and
   ambition, of power and riches." [420]

   4. A fourth general remark on this subject is, that it is no just
   matter of reproach to the authorities and people of the Romish Church
   that they believed in these false miracles. Faith in the frequently
   recurring interference of supernatural influences in the affairs of
   men, was for ages universal. Even so late as the seventeenth century
   Protestants as well as Catholics, of all ranks, believed in ghosts,
   witches, necromancy, and demonocracy. Cotton Mather's "Magnalia" is a
   match for the Legends of the Saints.

   5. It is not that Romanists believed in the frequent occurrence of
   miracles, but that they propagated reports of miracles, knowing them to
   be false; that this was done for the purposes of deceit; that this is
   persisted in to the present day; and that the honour, truth, integrity,
   and infallibility of the Church are pledged in support of their actual
   occurrence. The truth of Christianity depends on the historical truth
   of the account of the miracles recorded in the New Testament. The truth
   of Romanism depends on the truth of the miracles to which it appeals.
   What would become of Protestantism if it depended on the demonology of
   Luther, or the witch stories of our English forefathers. The Romish
   Church, in assuming the responsibility for the ecclesiastical miracles,
   has taken upon itself a burden which would crush the shoulders of
   Atlas. These "lying wonders" are endorsed, not only by the negative
   action of the authorities of the Church, by allowing them to be
   believed and cited in proof of its doctrines and divine mission; not
   only by the recognized expounders of its faith referring to them and
   asserting their truth; but also by solemn official action of the
   highest ecclesiastical dignitaries, including a long succession of
   popes. As no one could be canonized unless his saintship was sustained
   by at least four miracles, when any one was proposed for canonization a
   commission was appointed to ascertain the facts of his life, and
   especially of the miracles which he wrought. This commission reported
   to the Pope, who, if satisfied, decreed the enrolment of the candidate
   in the list of saints. These official documents contain the record of
   the most trivial, and, on other grounds, most objectionable miracles.
   [421] And to such miracles the Church of Rome has given her sanction,
   and on the truth of these it must stand or fall.

   There are, however, two special and standing miracles to which
   Romanists are fully committed, and which in the judgment probably of
   nine tenths of the educated men in Christendom are barefaced
   impostures. The Church of Rome by its highest dignitaries and
   representatives asserted and still continues to assert that the house
   in which the Virgin Mary dwelt in Nazareth was, when that city fell
   into the hands of the infidels, transported by angels and deposited at
   Loretto, a village a few miles from Ancona in Italy. The first step in
   this transportation occurred in 1291 from Nazareth to Dalmatia; the
   second in 1294 to the neighbourhood of Recanati; and the third in 1295
   to its present location. The house is thirty feet long, fifteen wide,
   and eighteen high, and is built of wood and brick. It is now greatly
   adorned, having a silver door and a silver grating, and stands in the
   midst of a large church erected over and around it. Its shrine was
   enriched with offerings of priceless value, and is regarded as the
   Mecca of Italy; the number of pilgrims amounting sometimes to two
   hundred thousand in a single year. The annual income of the house,
   apart from presents, is stated to be thirty thousand dollars. [422] The
   original house is said to be a fac-simile of hundreds of others in the
   neighborhood of Ancona. It is obvious that such a frail building could
   not, without a miracle, have been preserved thirteen hundred years;
   another miracle would be required to identify it after so long a
   period; another stupendous miracle to account for its transportation to
   Dalmatia; and two more nearly as great to explain its reaching its
   present location. The only conceivable design of all these miracles,
   must be to sustain the doctrines and authority of the Romish Church,
   and to pour money into its treasury. Both these objects they have
   accomplished to a wonderful degree. No man who is not prepared to
   accept all these miracles without a particle of evidence, can
   rationally believe in the Church of Rome.

   The other standing miracle for which the Romish Church is responsible
   before the whole world, is the annual liquefaction of the blood of St.
   Januarius at Naples. The tradition concerning him is, that he was
   thrown by his heathen persecutors into a heated oven, where he remained
   three days uninjured. He was afterwards exposed to wild beasts, who
   became as lambs in his presence. He was finally beheaded, A.D. 305. A
   woman is said to have caught and preserved a portion of his blood. This
   with other of his remains was carried to Naples, being identified as
   usual by a miracle, as it is said, "Neapolitani beatum Januarium
   revelatione commoti sustulerunt." The blood, preserved with great care
   in the cathedral, is contained in two crystal vials, a larger and
   smaller one. In its ordinary state it is a hard substance, sometimes
   represented as filling the vial, and sometimes as appearing in a hard
   round lump. The blood of other saints is said to liquefy on the
   anniversaries of their martyrdom, but the blood of Januarius becomes
   liquid whenever the vial containing it is brought near to the skull of
   the saint, which is still preserved. It turns readily when good is
   impending, and refuses to change when evil is at hand. It thus serves
   the purpose of an oracle. It is annually produced and exhibited to
   crowds of devotees gathered in the cathedral on the first Sunday of
   May, and also on the nineteenth day of September and twentieth of
   December, and at other times on extraordinary emergencies. To this
   miracle the Church of Rome is fully committed as it is exhibited every
   year under the eyes of the pope and the highest dignitaries of the
   Church. There is not a particle of evidence for the facts above stated
   concerning this saint, which may not be pleaded for any one of the
   thousands of stories of fairies and witches with which the histories of
   all nations abound, except the liquefaction of the blood. As to that,
   however, it is to be said that there is no evidence that the substance
   contained in the vial is blood; or if blood, that it is human blood; or
   if human, that it is the blood of Januarius; or if his, that the cause
   of the liquefaction is bringing the vial into proximity to the saint's
   cranium. All that the people are allowed to see, the change of a
   dark-red solid substance into a fluid, any chemist could effect at five
   minutes notice. It is true, as Dr. Newman admits, that these miracles
   do not so much prove the truth of the Church, as the Church proves the
   truth of the miracles. Then what are they worth?

   Relics.

   Relics are the remains of sacred persons and things, which are not only
   to be cherished as memorials, but to which "cultus" or a certain degree
   of religious worship is due, and which are imbued with supernatural
   power. They heal the sick, restore sight to the blind, hearing to the
   deaf, soundness to the maimed, and even, at times, life to the dead. Of
   these the Catholic world is full. [423] Dr. Newman in his "Lectures on
   the Present Position of Catholics in England," delivered after his
   reconciliation with the Church of Rome, says, "At Rome there is the
   True Cross, the Crib of Bethlehem, and the Chair of St. Peter; portions
   of the Crown of Thorns are kept at Paris; the Holy Coat is shown at
   Treves; the Winding-sheet at Turin: at Monza the iron Crown is formed
   out of a nail of the Cross; and another nail is claimed for the Duomo
   of Milan; and pieces of Our Lady's habit are to be seen in the
   Escurial. The Agnus Dei, blest medals, the Scapula, the cord of St.
   Francis, all are the medium of divine manifestations and graces." [424]

   There is here opened an illimitable field for pious fraud. First, in
   palming upon the credulous people spurious relics, and, secondly in
   falsely attributing to them supernatural power. It has been proved in
   many cases that remains passed off as relics of the saints were bones
   of animals. In other cases it is impossible that all should be genuine,
   as bodies, or the same parts of bodies, of one and the same man are
   exhibited in different places. There is, as has often been asserted,
   enough wood of the true cross, held sacred in different localities, out
   of which to construct a large building. Writing not long after the
   alleged discovery of the cross on which the Saviour died, Cyril of
   Jerusalem says, "Sanctum crucis lignum testatur, quod ad hodiernum
   usque diem apud nos conspicitur, ac per eos qui fide impellente ex eo
   frusta decerpunt orbem fere totum hinc jam opplevit." And again, he
   speaks of "crucis lignum, quod per particulas ex hoc loco per totum
   orbem distributum est." [425] St. Paulinas, who is one of the long list
   of witnesses quoted in defence of the veneration of relics, says "that
   a portion of the cross kept at Jerusalem gave off fragments of itself
   without diminishing." This is the only way in which the fact in
   question can be accounted for. If this solution be not admitted, then
   it must be acknowledged that, at least, the great majority of the
   portions of the cross now on exhibition must be spurious. There is no
   historical evidence of any value that any portion of the true cross has
   been preserved. Nothing was heard of it until A.D. 327. About that
   time, according to the legend, the Empress Helena, in searching for the
   Holy Sepulchre, found at the depth of thirty feet from the surface of
   the earth, three crosses, assumed to be those mentioned in the Gospels.
   The true cross was identified, some say, by its inscription; others, by
   a sick woman being touched by the one and the other without effect, but
   restored to perfect health the moment the true cross came in contact
   with her body. Others say that a corpse was restored to life by the
   touch of the true cross. In reference to this account it may be
   remarked, (1.) That there is a strong antecedent improbability that the
   crosses used on Calvary were ever buried. The assumption that it was
   the custom of the Jews to bury those implements of torture, rests on a
   very precarious foundation. (2.) The cross was a very slight structure,
   as it could be borne by one man; and, therefore, if buried
   superficially, as it must have been at first, it could hardly have
   continued undecayed three hundred years, especially considering the
   ploughings and overturnings to which the Holy City was subjected. (3.)
   The historical evidence in support of this legend is of little account.
   Cyril of Jerusalem, twenty years after the date assigned to the
   discovery, does indeed say that the true cross was then in Jerusalem,
   as Jerome does some sixty years later, but neither of them makes any
   mention of Helena in connection with the cross or the sepulchre. It
   may, therefore, be admitted that what passed for the true cross was
   then in Jerusalem, but the account of its recovery and identification
   remains without support. (4.) The historian Eusebius, a contemporary
   and eye-witness, makes no mention of the finding of the cross, an event
   the belief in which agitated all Christendom, and led to the immense
   aggrandizement of the bishopric of Jerusalem. It is inconceivable that
   such an event, if within his knowledge, should have been passed over in
   silence by such a historian, who had so much at heart to enchance the
   glory of his patron the Emperor. (5.) Calvary and the sepulchre we know
   were without the city. The place where the cross is said to have been
   found is in the centre of the modern city. Whether the city has so
   changed its limits as to bring the place of the crucifixion and burial
   of Christ within its boundaries, is a much debated question. Dr.
   Robinson, one of the most reliable of explorers, says, "The hypothesis
   which makes the second wall so run as to exclude the alleged site of
   the Holy Sepulchre, is on topographical grounds untenable and
   impossible." [426] That is, assuming the truth of the statement of the
   Evangelists that Christ was crucified without the walls, it is
   topographically impossible that the alleged site of the Holy Sepulchre
   should be the true one. And thus the whole foundation of the legend of
   finding the cross on that spot falls to the ground. Dr. Robinson winds
   up his long discussion of this question in the following words: "Thus
   in every view which I have been able to take of the question, both
   topographical and historical, whether on the spot or in the closet, and
   in spite of all my previous prepossessions, I am led irresistibly to
   the conclusion, that the Golgotha and the tomb now shown in the Church
   of the Holy Sepulchre, are not upon the real places of the crucifixion
   and resurrection of our Lord. The alleged discovery of them by the aged
   and credulous Helena, like her discovery of the cross, may not
   improbably have been the work of pious fraud. It would perhaps not be
   doing injustice to the Bishop Macarius and his clergy, if we regard the
   whole as a well laid and successful plan for restoring to Jerusalem its
   former consideration, and elevating his see to a higher degree of
   influence and dignity." [427]

   Dr. Newman says we must either admit the discovery of the cross, or
   believe the Church of Jerusalem guilty of imposture. [428] It is hard
   to decide how much is due in this matter to fraud, and how much to
   superstitious credulity. That both prevailed for ages in the Church is
   an undoubted historical fact. Are we to believe all that Gregory of
   Nyssa said of Gregory of Neo-Cæsarea, or what the fathers relate of St.
   Anthony; are we to admit all the legends of the saints, to avoid
   charging credulity or fraud against good men? It is lamentable that
   good men advocated the principle that it is right to deceive for a good
   end. It is undeniable that the doctrine of pious frauds has been avowed
   and acted upon in the Church of Rome ever since it began to aspire to
   ecclesiastical supremacy. Was not the pretended donation of Italy by
   Constantine to the pope a fraud? Are not the Isidorian Decretals a
   fraud? Are not the miracles wrought in proof of the delivery of souls
   from purgatory, frauds? Is not the alleged house of the Virgin Mary at
   Loretto a fraud? Is not the foot-print (ex pede Hercules) on a marble
   slab in the Cathedral of Rouen, a fraud? Is not the feather from the
   wing of the Archangel Gabriel preserved in one of the Cathedrals of
   Spain, a fraud? The whole Catholic world is full of frauds of this
   kind; and the only possible ground for Romanists to take is, that it is
   right to deceive the people for their good. "Populus vult decipi," is
   the excuse a Romish priest once made to Coleridge in reference to this
   matter.

   Secondly, pious frauds are practised, not only in the exhibition of
   false relics, but also in falsely attributing to them supernatural
   power. Dr. Newman says: "The store of relics is inexhaustible; they are
   multiplied through all lands, and each particle of each has in it at
   least a dormant, perhaps an energetic virtue of supernatural
   operation." [429] Bellarmin of course teaches the same [430] dootrine.
   Cyril of Jerusalem says, "Et Elisæum qui semel et iterum suscitavit,
   dum viveret, et post mortem: vivus resurrectionem per suam ipsius
   animam operatus est, ut autem non animæ solum justorum honorarentur,
   sed crederetur etiam in justorum corporibus jacere vim, projectus in
   monumentum Elisæi mortuus prophetæ corpus attingens, vitam concepit, 4
   Kin. iv. 13, ut ostenderetur, absente etiam anima inesse vim corpori
   sanctorum propter animam justam, quæ in eo habitaverat." [431] Dr.
   Newman says that miracles wrought by relics are of daily occurrence in
   all parts of the world. It is not that people are favourably affected
   by them through the imagination or feelings, but that the relics
   themselves are imbued with supernatural power. Thus Dr. Newman, one of
   the most cultivated men of the nineteenth century, has come round to
   the pure, simple, undiluted fetichism of Africa.

   Our Lord warned his disciples against being deceived by lying wonders.
   The Bible (Deut. xiii. 1-3) teaches that any sign or wonder given or
   wrought in support of any doctrine contrary to the Word of God, is,
   without further examination, to be pronounced false. If, therefore,
   such doctrines as the supremacy of the pope; the power of priests to
   forgive sins; the absolute necessity of the sacraments as the only
   channels of communicating the merits and grace of Christ; the necessity
   of auricular confession; purgatory; the adoration of the Virgin and of
   the consecrated wafer: and the worship of saints and angels, are
   contrary to the Holy Scriptures, then to a certainty all the pretended
   miracles wrought in their support are "lying wonders;" and those who
   promulgate and sustain them are guilty of pious fraud. If, therefore,
   as Newman says, The Catholic Church, from east to west, from north to
   south, is, according to our conceptions, hung with miracles: so much
   the worse. It is hung all over with the symbols or ensigns of apostasy.

   [414] It is perfectly intelligible that a man who admits the
   infallibility of general councils, may be able to subject his strongest
   personal convictions to the judgment of the Church. But not less than
   three oecumenical councils and twenty Popes had pronounced Honorious a
   heretic. How could the council of the Vatican reverse those decisions?
   Besides, Gratry and his Gallican and German coadjutors denied that the
   late council was either oecumenical or free. Father Hyacinth wrote to
   Gratry on his recantation, and said to him, "You speak of erasing what
   you have written, but how can you erase the facts which you have
   demonstrated, or the convictions you have produced in the minds of the
   faithful?"

   [418] Two Essays on Scripture Miracles and on Ecclesiastical. By John
   Henry Newman, formerly Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, 2d edit.
   London, 1870, p. 116. These Essays, it should be stated, were first
   published before Dr. Newman entered the Church of Rome. The former was
   written in 1825-26, and the latter in 1842-43. He was reconciled to
   Rome in 1845. In the second edition of the united essays published in
   1870, he endorses them anew with slight qualification. His words are
   (p. viii.), "These distinct views of miraculous agency, thus
   contrasted, involve no inconsistency with each other; but it must be
   owned that, in the essay upon the Scriptural miracles, the author goes
   beyond both the needs and the claims of his argument, when, in order to
   show their special dignity and beauty, he depreciates the purpose and
   value of the miracles of Church history. To meet this undue
   disparagement in his first essay, of facts which have their definite
   place in the divine dispensation, he points out in his second the
   essential resemblance which exists between many of the miracles of
   Scripture and those of the later times; and it is with the same drift
   that, in this edition, a few remarks at the foot of the page have been
   added in brackets." This qualification was hardly necessary, as the
   fourth chapter of the second essay contains the most ingenious defence
   of ecclesiastical miracles anywhere to be found. It is generally
   understood that Prof. Newman was in heart a Romanist some years before
   his secession from the Church of England. Of his his famous Tract
   Number 90 of the Oxford series, is a sufficient proof.

   [421] Accounts of these miracles may be found, not only in the original
   documents, but also in numerous works, as those of Bishop Stillingfleet
   and others, written to expose the impostures of the Romish Church. The
   Rev. John Cumming of London, in his Lectures on Romanism (Boston,
   1854), has cited from these official records examples sufficiently
   numerous to satisfy any ordinary man. For example, it is said of Santa
   Rosa Maria of Lima, among many others, that the Virgin often appeared
   to her and talked with her, that the Saviour came to her in the form of
   a child leaning on his mother's arm, to collect roses scattered on the
   ground, and then the Divine infant took one of them and said "Thou art
   the rose." (Cumming, p. 629). When her tomb was opened fifteen years
   after death, her remains "exhaled the odor of roses." Of St. Philip
   Neri it is said that he was so agitated by the love of God, that the
   Lord broke two of his ribs to give freer action to his heart. (p. 634)
   Of Sister Maria Francisca, it is certified that when placing a holy
   Bambino (i.e., image of the infant Jesus) into the manger, such a light
   emanated from the Bambino as to blind her for three days. On another
   occasion, when dressing the image, she said, "My little child, if you
   do not stretch out your feet I cannot put on your shoes and stockings,"
   and the wooden image immediately stretched out its feet. It is also
   asserted that she obtained from Christ permission to suffer vicariously
   for a limited time, in the place of some of her friends, the pains of
   purgatory, and accordingly endured for a month the most intense
   agonies. It is further said, that she had imparted to her the
   sufferings of Christ, his bloody sweat, the anguish of the crown of
   thorns, his scourgings and agonies on the cross, and his wounds visibly
   impressed upon her. (Cumming, pp. 649-653) Cardinal Wiseman edited a
   book including the lives of several saints, and among them that of St.
   Veronica Giuliani, who was canonized so recently as 1839. Of this
   saint, he says, among many similar things, that God recompensed her
   readiness to drink of the chalice of suffering, by making her a
   partaker of the torments of Christ's passion. Christ accordingly
   appeared to her and took the crown of thorns and placed it on her head.
   (Cumming, pp. 665-675). Such are some of the miracles and which Rome
   rests her claims to be the only true Church and the infallible teacher
   of man.

   [423] The language of the Council of Trent in reference to the honour
   due to the relics of the saints has already been quoted when treating
   of the second commandment. Perrone in his Prælectiones Theologicæ, De
   Cultu Sanctorum, iv. 71, edit. Paris, 1861, vol. ii. p. 112, b, adduces
   as one of his arguments in favour of the worship of relics the
   declaration of the Epistle of the Church of Smyrna, that the heathen
   feared "ne Christiani, relicto Christo, Polycarpum adorare inciperent;
   omni idcirco qua poterant ratione martyrum corpora, ne a Christianis
   colerentur, ethnici gladiatorum corporibus commiscebant; in
   amphitheatris feris, in aquis piscibus ut vorarentur exponebant; aut
   saltem igne illa cremabant, cinere dispergentes, uti ex martyrum actis
   constat." It was "adoration," "worship," that was to be rendered to
   these relics. The distinction between the different kinds of worship,
   had little effect on the popular mind. Perrone himself teaches that the
   "material heart of Christ" was to be adored latriæ cultu. De

   § 14. The Tenth Commandment.

   Is a general prohibition of covetousness. "Thou shalt not covet," is a
   comprehensive command. Thou shalt not inordinately desire what thou
   hast not; and especially what belongs to thy neighbour. It includes the
   positive command to be contented with the allotments of Providence; and
   the negative injunction not to repine, or complain on account of the
   dealings of God with us, or to envy the lot or possessions of others.
   The command to be contented does not imply indifference, and it does
   not enjoin slothfulness. A cheerful and contented disposition is
   perfectly compatible with a due appreciation of the good things of this
   world, and diligence in the use of all proper means to improve our
   condition in life.

   Contentment can have no other rational foundation than religion.
   Submission to the inevitable is only stoicism, or apathy, or despair.
   The religions of the East, and of the ancient world generally, so far
   as they were the subject of thought, being essentially pantheistic,
   could produce nothing but a passive consent to be borne along for a
   definite period on the irresistible current of events, and then lost in
   the abyss of unconscious being. The poor and the miserable could with
   such a faith have little ground for contentment, and they would be
   under the strongest temptation to envy the rich and the fortunate. But
   if a man believes that there is a personal God infinite in power,
   wisdom, and love; if he believes that God's providence extends over all
   creatures and over all events; and if he believes that God orders
   everything, not only for the best on the whole, but also for the best
   for each individual who puts his trust in Him and acquiesces in his
   will, then not to be contented with the allotments of infinite wisdom
   and love must be folly. Faith in the truths referred to cannot fail to
   produce contentment, wherever that faith is real. When we further take
   into view the peculiar Christian aspects of the case; then we remember
   that this universal government is administered by Jesus Christ, into
   whose hands, as He himself tells us, all power in heaven and earth has
   been committed, than we know that our lot is determined by Him who
   loved us and gave Himself for us, and who watches over his people as a
   shepherd watches over his flock, so that a hair of our heads cannot
   perish without his permission. And when we think of the eternal future
   which He has prepared for us, then we see that the sorrows of this life
   are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in
   us, and that our light afflictions, which are but for a moment, shall
   work out for us a far more exceeding and an eternal weight of glory;
   then mere contentment is elevated to a peace which passes all
   understanding, and even to a joy which is full of glory. All this is
   exemplified in the history of the people of God as recorded in the
   Bible. Paul could not only say, "I have learned, in whatsoever state I
   am, therewith to be content" (Phil. iv. 11); but he could also say: "I
   take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in
   persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake." (2 Cor. xii. 10.) This
   has measurably been the experience of thousands of believers in all
   ages. Of all people in the world Christians are bound in whatsoever
   state they are therewith to be content. It is easy to utter these
   words, and easy for those in comfort to imagine that they are
   exercising the grace of contentment; but when a man is crushed down by
   poverty and sickness, surrounded by those whose wants he cannot supply;
   seeing those whom he loves, suffering and wearing away under their
   privations, then contentment and submission are among the highest and
   rarest of Christian graces. Nevertheless, it is better to be Lazarus
   than Dives.

   The second form of evil condemned by this commandment is envy. This is
   something more than an inordinate desire of unpossessed good. It
   includes regret that others should have what we do rot enjoy; a feeling
   of hatred and malignity towards those more favoured than ourselves; and
   a desire to deprive them of their advantages. This is a real cancer of
   the soul; producing torture and eating out all right feelings. There
   are, of course, all degrees of this sin, from the secret satisfaction
   experienced at the misfortunes of others, or the unexpressed desire
   that evil may assail them or that they may be reduced to the same level
   with ourselves, to the Satanic hatred of the happy because of their
   happiness, and the determination, if possible, to render them
   miserable. There is more of this dreadful spirit in the human heart,
   than we are willing to acknowledge. Montesquieu says that every man has
   a secret satisfaction in the misfortunes even of his dearest friends.
   As envy is the antithesis of love, it is of all sins the most opposed
   to the nature of God, and more effectually than any other excludes us
   from his fellowship.

   Thirdly, the Scriptures, however, make mention most frequently of
   covetousness under the form of an inordinate desire of wealth. The man
   of whom covetousness is the characteristic has the acquisition of
   wealth as the main object of his life. This fills his mind, engrosses
   his affections, and absorbs his energy. Of covetousness in this form
   the Apostle says it is the root of all evil. That is, there is no evil
   -- from meanness, deceit, and fraud, up to murder -- to the commission
   of which covetousness has not prompted men, or to which it does not
   always threaten to impel them. Of the covetous man in this sense of the
   word the Bible says, (1.) That he cannot enter heaven. (1 Cor. vi. 10.)
   (2.) That he is an idolater. (Eph. v. 5.) Wealth is his God, i.e., that
   to which he gives his heart and consecrates his life. (3.) That God
   abhors him. (Ps. x. 3.)

   This commandment has a special interest, as it was the means, as St.
   Paul tells us, of leading him to the knowledge of sin. "I had not known
   lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet." (Rom. vii. 7.)
   Most of the other commandments forbid external acts, but this forbids a
   state of the heart. It shows that no external obedience can fulfil the
   demands of the law; that God looks upon the heart, that He approves or
   disapproves of the secret affections and purposes of the soul; that a
   man may be a pharisee, pure outwardly as a whited sepulchre, but
   inwardly full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness.

CHAPTER XX.

  THE MEANS OF GRACE

   By means of grace are not meant every instrumentality which God may
   please to make the means of spiritual edification to his children. The
   phrase is intended to indicate those institutions which God has
   ordained to be the ordinary channels of grace, i.e., of the
   supernatural influences of the Holy Spirit, to the souls of men. The
   means of grace, according to the standards of our Church, are the word,
   sacraments, and prayer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Word.

   1. The word of God, as here understood, is the Bible. And the Bible is
   the collection of the canonical books of the Old and New Testaments.

   2. These books are the word of God because they were written by men who
   were prophets, his organs, or spokesmen, in such a sense that whatever
   they declare to be true or obligatory, God declares to be true and
   binding. These topics have already been considered in the first volume
   of this work, so far as they fall within the limits of systematic
   theology.

   3. The word of God, so far as adults are concerned, is an in
   dispensable means of salvation. True religion never has existed, and
   never can exist, where the truths revealed in the Bible are unknown.
   This point also has already been discussed when speaking of the
   insufficiency of natural religion.

   4. The word of God is not only necessary to salvation, but it is also
   divinely efficacious to the accomplishment of that end. This appears,
   (a.) From the commission given to the Church. After his resurrection
   our Lord said to his disciples: "Go ye therefore, and teach all
   nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and
   of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I
   have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of
   the world. Amen." (Matt. xxviii. 19, 20). The words as recorded in Mark
   xvi. 15, 16, are, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
   every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but
   he that believeth not shall be damned." The end to be accomplished, was
   the salvation of men. The means of its accomplishment was teaching. The
   disciples were to teach what Christ had taught them. That is, they were
   to teach the Gospel to every creature under heaven. All means derive
   their efficiency from the ordinance of God; as He has ordained the
   Gospel to be the means of salvation, it must be efficacious to that
   end. (b.) This appears further from the manner in which the Apostles
   executed the commission which they had received. They went everywhere,
   preaching Christ. They were sent to teach; and teaching was their whole
   work. "I determined," said Paul, "not to know anything among you, save
   Jesus Christ and him crucified." (1 Cor. ii. 2.) (c.) The power of the
   Word is proved from many direct assertions in the Bible. Paul tells the
   Romans that he was not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, because "it is
   the power of God unto salvation." (Rom. i. 16.) To the Corinthians he
   says, in view of the utter impotence of the wisdom of the world, that
   "it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that
   believe." (1 Cor. i. 21.) The preaching of Christ crucified was "unto
   the Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto
   them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God,
   and the wisdom of God." (Vers. 23, 24.) In the Epistle to the Hebrews
   it is said: "The word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
   any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and
   spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the
   thoughts and intents of the heart." (Heb. iv. 12.)

   The sacred writers, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, are
   exuberant in their praise of the Word of God, as its power was revealed
   in their own experience. "The law of the Lord," says the Psalmist, "is
   perfect, converting the soul." (Ps. xix. 7.) By the law of the Lord is
   meant the whole revelation which God has made in his Word to determine
   the faith, form the character, anu control the conduct of men. It is
   this revelation which the Psalmist pronounces perfect, that is,
   perfectly adapted to accomplish the end of man's sanctification and
   salvation. "Thy word." he says "is a lamp unto my feet, and a light
   unto my path." (Ps. cxix. 105.) "The testimony of the Lord is sure,
   making wise the simple: the statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing
   the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes:
   the fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever: the judgments of the
   Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they
   than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the
   honeycomb." (Ps. xix. 7-10.) Almost every one of the hundred and
   seventy-six verses of the one hundred and nineteenth Psalm contains
   some recognition of the excellence or power of the Word of God. "Is not
   my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh
   the rock in pieces?" (Jer. xxiii. 29.)

   In the New Testament the same divine efficacy is attributed to ths Word
   of God. It is the gospel of our salvation, i.e., that by which we are
   saved. Paul said that Christ commissioned him to preach the Gospel to
   the Gentiles, saying, for this purpose I appeared unto thee to make
   thee minister and a witness, delivering thee from the Gentiles, "unto
   whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from
   darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may
   receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are
   sanctified by faith that is in me." (Acts xxvi. 17, 18.) All this was
   to be effected by the Gospel. The same Apostle writing to Timothy says:
   "From a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to
   make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
   All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
   doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
   righteousness." (2 Tim. iii. 15, 16.) The Apostle Peter says that men
   are "born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the
   word of God which liveth and abideth forever." (1 Pet. i. 23.) Our Lord
   prayed, "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." (John
   xvii. 17.)

   Testimony of History.

   There can, therefore, be no doubt that the Scriptures teach that the
   Word of God is the specially appointed means for the sanctification and
   the salvation of men. This doctrine of the Bible is fully confirmed by
   the experience of the Church and of the world. That experience teaches,
   -- First, that no evidences of sanctification, no indications of the
   saving influences of the Spirit are found where the Word of God is
   unknown. This is not saying that none such occur. We know from the
   Bible itself, "That God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation
   he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him."
   (Acts x. 34, 35.) No one doubts that it is in the power of God to call
   whom He pleases from among the heathen and to reveal to them enough
   truth to secure their salvation. [432] Nevertheless it remains a fact
   patent to all eyes that the nations where the Bible is unknown sit in
   darkness. The absence of the Bible is just as distinctly discernible as
   the absence of the sun. The declaration of the Scriptures is that "the
   whole world lieth in wickedness" (1 John v. 19); and that declaration
   is confirmed by all history.

   A second fact on which the testimony of experience is equally clear is,
   that true Christianity flourishes just in proportion to the degree in
   which the Bible is known, and its truths are diffused among the people.
   During the apostolic age the messengers of Christ went everywhere
   preaching his Gospel, in season and out of season; proving from the
   Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God;
   requiring those to whom they preached to search the Scriptures;
   exhorting younger ministers to preach the Word; to hold forth the Word
   of life; to give attendance to reading, exhortation, and doctrine; to
   meditate upon these things and to give themselves wholly to them.
   During this period the Gospel made more rapid progress, and perhaps
   brought forth more abundant fruits than during any equally long period
   of its history. When, however, the truth began to be more and more
   corrupted by the speculations of philosophy, and by the introduction of
   the Jewish doctrines concerning ceremonies and the priesthood; when
   "reserve" in preaching came into vogue, and it was held to be both
   lawful and wise to conceal the truth, and awaken reverence and secure
   obedience by other means; and when Christian worship was encumbered by
   heathen rites, and the trust of the people turned away from God and
   Christ, to the virgin and saints, then the shades of night overspread
   the Church, and the darkness became more and more intense, until the
   truth or light was almost entirely obscured. At the Reformation, when
   the chained Bible was brought from the cloisters, given to the press,
   and scattered over Europe, it was like the bright rising of the sun:
   the darkness was dissipated; the Church arose from the dust, and put on
   her beautiful garments, for the glory of God had arisen upon her.
   Wherever the reading and preaching of the Word was unrestricted, there
   light, liberty, and true religion prevailed, in a proportionate degree.
   Wherever the Bible was suppressed and the preaching of its truths was
   forbidden, there the darkness continued and still abides.

   A third important fact equally well established is, that true religion
   prevails in any community, in proportion to the degree in which the
   young are instructed in the facts and indoctrinated in the truths of
   the Bible. This, in one view, is included under the previous head, but
   it deserves separate notice. The question does not concern the reason
   why the religious education of the young is so important; or the way in
   which that education can most advantageously be secured; but simply the
   fact that where the young are from the beginning imbued with the
   knowledge of the Bible, there pure Christianity abides; and where they
   are allowed to grow up in ignorance of divine truth, there true
   religion languishes and loses more and more its power. Such is the
   testimony of experience.

   It is, therefore, the united testimony of Scripture and of history that
   the Bible, the Word of God, is the great means of promoting the
   sanctification and salvation of men, that is, of securing their
   temporal and eternal well being. Those consequently who are opposed to
   religion; who desire the reign of indifferentism, or the return of
   heathen doctrines and heathen morality, are consistent and wise in
   their generation, in endeavouring to undermine the authority of the
   Bible; to discourage its circulation; to discountenance attendance on
   its preaching; and especially to oppose its being effectually taught to
   the young. Those on the other hand who believe that without holiness no
   man can see God, and that without the light of divine truth, holiness
   is impossible, are bound as pastors, as parents, and as citizens to
   insist that the Bible shall have free course, and that it shall be
   faithfully taught to all under their influence or for whose training
   they are responsible.

   To what is the Power of the Word to be attributed?

   It being admitted as a fact that the Bible has the power attributed to
   it, the question arises, To what is that due? To this question
   different answers are given. Some say that its whole power lies in the
   nature of the truths which it contains. This is the doctrine held by
   Pelagians and Rationalists. On this subject it may be remarked, (1.)
   That all truth has an adaptation to the human mind and tends to produce
   an impression in accordance with its nature. If a mind could be
   conceived or destitute of all truth, it would be in a state of idiocy.
   The mind is roused to action and expanded, and its power is increased
   by the truth, and, other things being equal, in proportion to the
   amount of truth communicated to it. (2.) It is the tendency of all
   moral truth in itself considered, to excite right moral feelings and to
   lead to right moral action. (3.) It is further conceded that the truths
   of the Bible and the sources of moral power therein contained are of
   the highest possible order. The doctrine, for example, therein taught
   concerning God, that He is a Spirit, infinite, eternal, and
   unchangeable in being, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and
   truth, is immeasurably above all that human reason ever discovered or
   human philosophy ever taught. There is more moral power in that single
   truth, than in all the systems of moral philosophy. The same may be
   said of what the Bible teaches of God's relation to the world. He is
   not merely its creator and architect, but also its constant preserver
   and governor; everywhere present, working with and by his creatures,
   using each according to its nature, and overruling all things to the
   accomplishment of the highest and most beneficent designs. To his
   rational creatures, especially to men, He reveals Himself as a father,
   loving, guiding, and providing for them; never afflicting them
   willingly, but only when it would be morally wrong to do otherwise. The
   Bible doctrine concerning man is not only true, conformed to all that
   man reveals himself to be, but it is eminently adapted to make him what
   he was designed to be: to exalt without inflating; to humble without
   degrading him. The Bible teaches that God made man out of the dust of
   the earth and breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a
   living soul conformed to the image of God in knowledge, righteousness,
   and holiness. Thus man is apparently the lowest of God s rational
   creatures, but made capable of indefinite progress in capacity,
   excellence, and blessedness. The actual state of man however exhibits a
   sad contrast with this account of his original condition. The Bible
   accordingly informs us that man fell from the state in which he was
   created by sinning against God. Thus sin was introduced into the world:
   all men are sinners, that is, guilty, polluted, and helpless. These are
   facts of consciousness, as well as doctrines of the Bible. The
   Scriptures however inform us that God so loved the world that He gave
   his only begotten Son, that whoso believeth on Him might not perish but
   have everlasting life. We are told that this Son is the image of God,
   equal with God. By Him were all things created that are in heaven, and
   that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or
   dominions, or principalities or powers: all things were created by Him
   and for Him; and He is before all things, and by Him all things
   consist. This divine Person, for us and for our salvation, took upon
   Him our nature, fulfilled all righteousness, bore our sins in his own
   body on the tree; and having died for our offences, rose again for our
   justification; and is now seated at the right hand of the majesty on
   high; all power in heaven and earth having been committed to his hands.
   There is more of power to sanctify, to elevate, to strengthen and to
   cheer in the single word Jesus, which means "Jehovah-saviour," than in
   all the utterances of men since the world began. This divine and
   exalted Saviour has sent forth his disciples to preach his Gospel to
   every creature, promising pardon, sanctification, and eternal life,
   including a participation in his glory, to every one, on the sole
   condition that he receive Him as his God and Saviour, and, trusting in
   Him alone for salvation, honestly endeavour to do his will; that is, to
   love God with all his heart and his neighbour as himself, and to do to
   others as he would have others do to him. In view of all these truths,
   God asks, "What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have
   not done in it?" All the resources of moral power are exhausted in the
   Bible. Every consideration that can affect the intellect, the
   conscience, the feelings, and the hopes of man is therein presented:
   yet all in vain.

   There are two conditions necessary for the production of a given
   effect. The one is that the cause should have the requisite efficiency;
   and the other, that the object on which it acts should have the
   requisite susceptibility. The sun and rain shed their genial influences
   on a desert, and it remains a desert; when those influences fall on a
   fertile plain, it is clothed with all the wonders of vegetable
   fertility and beauty. The mid-day brightness of the sun has no more
   effect on the eyes of the blind than a taper; and if the eye be bleared
   the clearest light only enables it to see men as trees walking. It is
   so with moral truth: no matter what may be its inherent power, it fails
   of any salutary effect unless the mind to which it is presented be in a
   fit state to receive it.

   The minds of men since the fall are not in a condition to receive the
   transforming and saving power of the truths of the Bible and therefore
   it is necessary, in order to render the Word of God an effectual means
   of salvation, that it should be attended by the supernatural power of
   the Holy Spirit. The Apostle says expressly, "The natural man receiveth
   not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him:
   neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned." (1
   Cor. ii. 14.) In the preceding chapter he had said, that the same
   gospel which to the called was the power and wisdom of God, was to the
   Jews a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness. Our Lord said to
   the Jews: "Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot
   hear my Word. He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear
   them not because ye are not of God." (John viii. 43, 47.) Everything
   that the Scriptures teach of the state of men since the fall proves
   that until enlightened by the Holy Ghost they are spiritually blind,
   unable to discern the true nature of the things of the Spirit, and
   therefore incapable of receiving a due impression from them.

   Experience confirms this teaching of the Bible. It shows that no mere
   moral power of truth as presented objectively to the mind is of any
   avail to change the hearts of men. There once appeared on earth a
   divine person clothed in our nature; exhibiting the perfection of moral
   excellence in the form of a human life: holy, harmless, undefiled, and
   separate from sinners; humble, disinterested, beneficent, tender,
   patient, enduring, and dispensing blessings on all who approached him.
   Yet this person was to the men of his generation without form or
   comeliness. He came to his own and his own received him not. They
   rejected him and preferred a murderer. And in what respect are we
   better than they? How is Christ regarded by the mass of the men of this
   generation? Multitudes blaspheme Him. The majority scarcely think of
   Him. He is to them no more than Socrates or Plato. And yet there is in
   Him such a revelation of the glory of God, as would constrain every
   human heart to love and adore Him, had not the god of this world
   blinded the eyes of those who believe not. It is vain therefore to talk
   of the moral power of truth converting men.

   There are some who throw a vail over this rationalistic doctrine, and
   delude themselves and others into the belief that they stand on more
   Scriptural ground than Rationalists, because they admit that the Spirit
   is operative in the truth. Every theist believes that God is everywhere
   present in the world and always sustaining and coöperating with
   physical causes in the production of their various effects. So the
   Spirit is in the world, everywhere present and everywhere active,
   coöperating with moral causes in producing their legitimate effects.
   There is nothing in the operation of physical causes transcending their
   legitimate effects; and there is nothing in the regeneration,
   conversion, and sanctification of men which transcends the legitimate
   effects of moral truth. The one series of effects is just as natural,
   and just as little supernatural, as the other. It has already been
   shown on a previous page, [433] that this is all that the most advanced
   rationalists require. It excludes the supernatural, which is all they
   demand. In the effects produced by physical causes guided by the
   providential efficiency of God, there is nothing which exceeds the
   power of those causes; and in the effects produced by the moral power
   of the truth under the coöperation of the Spirit, there is nothing
   which exceeds the power of the truth. The salvation of the soul is as
   much a natural process as the growth of a plant. The Scriptures clearly
   teach that there is an operation of the Spirit on the soul anterior to
   the sanctifying influence of the truth, and necessary to render that
   influence effective. A dead man must be restored to life, before the
   objects of sense can produce upon him their normal effect. Those
   spiritually dead must be quickened by the almighty power of God, before
   the things of the Spirit can produce their appropriate effect. Those
   spiritually blind must have their eyes opened before they can discern
   the things freely given, or revealed, to them of God. This influence
   being anterior to, cannot be through, the truth. Hence we find numerous
   prayers in every part of the Scriptures for this antecedent work of the
   Spirit; prayers that God would change the hearts, open the eyes, and
   unstop the ears of men; or that He would give them ears to hear, and
   eyes to see. The Spirit is everywhere represented as a personal agent,
   distributing his gifts to every one severally as He will. He arouses
   their attention, controls their judgments, and awakens their
   affections. He convinces them of sin, righteousness, and judgment. He
   works in the people of God both to will and to do. He teaches, guides,
   comforts, and strengthens. His influence is not confined to one
   activity producing an initial change, and then leaving the renewed soul
   to the influences of the truth and of the ordinances, it is abiding. It
   is not however the influence of a uniformly acting force coöperating
   with the truth; but that of a person, acting when and where He pleases;
   more at one time than at another, sometimes in one way and sometimes in
   another. He is a "Helper" who can be invoked, or who can be grieved and
   resisted. All these representations of the Scriptures, which are
   utterly inconsistent with the purely rationalistic doctrine, as well as
   with the doctrine which either confounds the operations of the Spirit
   with the providential efficiency of God, or regards them as analogous,
   have impressed themselves on the general consciousness of the Church.
   Every believer feels that he stands to the Holy Spirit in the relation
   which one person sustains to another: a person on whom he is dependent
   for all good; whose assistance must be sought, and whose assistance may
   be granted or withheld at pleasure; and who may come or withdraw either
   for a season or forever. Such has been the faith of the Church in all
   ages, as is manifest from its creeds, its hymns, and its prayers. While
   all Christians admit that God's providential efficiency extends over
   all his works, and that all good in fallen man is due to the presence
   and power of his Holy Spirit, yet they have ever felt and believed,
   under the guidance of the Scriptures, that the divine activity in these
   different spheres is entirely different. The spheres themselves are
   different; the ends to be accomplished are different; and the mode of
   operation is different. In nature (especially in the external world)
   God acts by law; his providential efficiency is a "potentia ordinata;"
   in grace it is more a "potentia absoluta," untrammelled by law. It is
   personal and sovereign. He does not act continuously or in any one way;
   but just as He sees fit. He works in us "both to will and to do of his
   good pleasure." (Phil. ii. 13.) As just remarked, therefore, every
   Christian feels his dependence not upon law, but on the good-will of a
   person. Hence the prayers so frequent in Scripture, and so constantly
   on the lips of believers, that the Spirit would not cast us off; would
   not give us up; would not be grieved by our ingratitude or resistance:
   but that He would come to us, enlighten us, purify, elevate,
   strengthen, guide, and comfort us; that He would come to our
   households, renew our children, visit our churches, and multiply his
   converts as the drops of the morning dew; and that He would everywhere
   give the Word of God effect.

   This sovereignty in the operations of the Spirit is felt and recognized
   by every parent, by every pastor, and by every missionary. It is the
   revealed purpose of God that it must be acknowledged. "See your calling
   brethren," says the Apostle; not the wise, the great, the good, but the
   foolish, those who are of no account, hath God chosen in order "that no
   flesh should glory in his presence." (1 Cor. i. 26-29.) No man is to be
   allowed to attribute his conversion or salvation to himself, to law, or
   to the efficiency of means. It is in the hands of God. It is of Him
   that any man is in Christ Jesus. (1 Cor. i. 30.) In like manner He so
   gives or withholds the influences of the Spirit that every minister of
   the Gospel, as the Apostles themselves did, should feel and acknowledge
   that his success does not depend on his official dignity, or his
   fidelity, or his skill in argument, or his power of persuasion, but
   simply and solely on the demonstration of the Spirit, given or withheld
   as He sees fit. Why was it that so few were converted under the
   ministry of Christ, and so many thousands under that of the Apostles?
   Why is it that a like experience has marked the whole history of the
   Church? The only Scriptural or rational answer that can be given to
   that question is, "Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy
   sight." We know indeed that the Spirit's sovereignty is determined in
   its action by infinitely wise and good reasons; and we know that his
   withholding his coöperation is often judicial and punitive, that He
   abandons individuals, churches, communities, and nations who have
   sinned away their day of grace. It is important that we should
   remember, that, in living under the dispensation of the Spirit, we are
   absolutely dependent on a divine Person, who gives or withholds his
   influence as He will; that He can be grieved and offended; that He must
   be acknowledged, feared, and obeyed; that his presence and gifts must
   be humbly and earnestly sought, and assiduously cherished, and that to
   Him all right thoughts and right purposes, all grace and goodness, all
   strength and comfort, and all success in winning souls to Christ, are
   to be ascribed.

   The Office of the Word as a Means of Grace.

   Christians then do not refer the saving and the sanctifying power of
   the Scriptures to the moral power of the truths which they contain; or
   to the mere coöperation of the Spirit in a manner analogous to the way
   in which God coöperates with all second causes, but to the power of the
   Spirit as a divine Person acting with and by the truth, or without it,
   as in his sovereign pleasure He sees fit. Although light cannot restore
   sight to the blind, or heal the diseases of the organs of sight, it is
   nevertheless essential to every exercise of the power of vision. So the
   Word is essential to all holy exercises in the human soul.

   In every act of vision there are three essential conditions -- 1. An
   object. 2. Light. 3. An eye in a healthful or normal state. In all
   ordinary cases this is all that is necessary. But when the object to be
   seen has the attribute of beauty, a fourth condition is essential to
   its proper apprehension, namely, that the observer have æsthetic
   discernment or taste natural or acquired. Two men may view the same
   work of art. Both have the same object before them and the same light
   around them. Both see alike all that affects the organ of vision; but
   the one may see a beauty which the other fails to perceive; the same
   object therefore produces on them very different effects. The one it
   delights, elevates, and refines; the other it leaves unmoved if it does
   not disgust him. So when our blessed Lord was upon earth, the same
   person went about among the people; the same Word sounded in their
   ears; and the same acts of power and love were performed in their
   presence. The majority hated, derided, and finally crucified Him.
   Others saw in Him the glory of the only begotten Son of God full of
   grace and truth. These loved, adored, worshipped, and died for Him.
   Without the objective revelation of the person, doctrines, work, and
   character of Christ, this inward experience of his disciples had been
   impossible. But this outward revelation would have been, and in fact
   was to most of those concerned, utterly in vain, without the power of
   spiritual discernment. It is clear, therefore, what the office of the
   Word is, and what that of the Holy Spirit is in the work of
   sanctification. The Word presents the objects to be seen and the light
   by which we see; that is, it contains the truths by which the soul is
   sanctified, and it conveys to the mind the intellectual knowledge of
   those truths. Both these are essential. The work of the Spirit is with
   the soul. That by nature is spiritually dead; it must be quickened. It
   is blind; its eyes must be opened. It is hard; it must be softened. The
   gracious work of the Spirit is to impart life, to open the eyes, and to
   soften the heart. When this is done, and in proportion to the measure
   in which it is done, the Word exerts its sanctifying influence on the
   soul.

   It is a clear doctrine of the Bible and fact of experience that the
   truth when spiritually discerned has this transforming power. Paul was
   full of pride, malignity, and contempt for Christ and his Gospel. When
   the Spirit opened his eyes to behold the glory of Christ, he instantly
   became a new man. The effect of that vision -- not the miraculous
   vision of the person of the Son of God but the spiritual apprehension
   of his divine majesty and love -- lasted during the Apostle's life, and
   will last to all eternity. The same Apostle, therefore, teaches us that
   it is by beholding the glory of Christ that we are transformed into his
   image, from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord. (2 Cor. iii.
   18.) Hence the Scriptures so constantly represent the heavenly state,
   as seeing God. It is the beatific vision of the divine glory, in all
   its brightness, in the person of the Son of God, that purifies,
   ennobles, and enraptures the soul; filling all its capacities of
   knowledge and happiness. It is thus that we are sanctified by the
   truth; it is by the spiritual discernment of the things of the Spirit,
   when He opens, or as Paul says, enlightens the eyes of our
   understanding. We thus learn how we must use the Scriptures in order to
   experience their sanctifying power. We must diligently search them that
   we may know the truths therein revealed; we must have those truths as
   much as possible ever before the mind; and we must pray earnestly and
   constantly that the Spirit may open our eyes that we may see wondrous
   things out of his law. It matters little to us how excellent or how
   powerful the truths of Scripture may be, if we do not know them. It
   matters little how well we may know them, if we do not think of them.
   And it matters little how much we think of them, if we cannot see them;
   and we cannot see them unless the Spirit opens the eyes of our heart.

   We see too from this subject why the Bible represents it as the great
   duty of the ministry to hold forth the Word of life; by the
   manifestation of the truth to commend themselves to every man's
   conscience in the sight of God. This is all they need do. They must
   preach the Word in season and out of season, whether men will hear, or
   whether they will forbear. They know that the Gospel which they preach
   is the power of God unto salvation, and that if it be hid, it is hid to
   them that are lost: in whom the God of this world hath blinded the
   minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel
   of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. (2 Cor. iv.
   4.) Paul may plant and Apollos water, but God only can give the
   increase.

   Besides this general sanctifying power of the Word of God, when
   spiritually discerned, it is to be further remarked that it is the
   means of calling forth all holy thoughts, feelings, purposes, and acts.
   Even a regenerated soul without any truth before is, would be in blank
   darkness. It would be in the state of a regenerated infant; or in the
   state of an unborn infant in relation to the external world; having
   eyes and ears, but nothing to tall its faculties of sight and hearing
   into exercise. It is obvious that we can have no rational feelings of
   gratitude, love, adoration and fear toward God, except in view of the
   truths revealed concerning Him in his Word. We can have no love or
   devotion to Christ, except so far as the manifestation of his character
   and work is accepted by us as true. We can have no faith except as
   founded on some revealed promise of God; no resignation or submission
   except in view of the wisdom and love of God and of his universal
   providence as revealed in the Scriptures; no joyful anticipation of
   future blessedness which is not founded on what the Gospel makes known
   of a future state of existence. The Bible, therefore, is essential to
   the conscious existence of the divine life in the soul and to all its
   rational exercises. The Christian can no more live without the Bible,
   than his body can live without food. The Word of God is milk and strong
   meat, it is as water to the thirsty, it is honey and the honeycomb.

   The Lutheran Doctrine.

   This doctrine has already been briefly, and, perhaps, sufficiently
   discussed on a preceding page; [434] it cannot, however, be properly
   overlooked in this connection. The Lutherans agree in words with
   Rationalists and Remonstrants, in referring the efficiency of the Word
   of God in the work of sanctification to the inherent power of the
   truth. But Rationalists attribute to it no more power than that which
   belongs to all moral truth; such truth is from its nature adapted to
   form the character and influence the conduct of rational creatures, and
   as the truths of the Bible are of the highest order and importance,
   they are willing to concede to them a proportionate degree of power.
   The Lutherans, on the other hand, teach, -- First, that the power of
   the Word which is inherent and constant, and which belongs to it from
   its very nature as the Word of God, is supernatural and divine.
   Secondly, that its efficiency is not due to any influence of the
   Spirit, accompanying it at some times and not at others, but solely to
   its own inherent virtue. Thirdly, that its diversified effects are due
   not to the Word's having more power at one time than at another; or to
   its being attended with a greater or less degree of the Spirit's
   influence, but to the different ways in which it is received. Christ,
   it is said, healed those who had faith to be healed. He frequently
   said: "According to your faith be it unto you," or "Thy faith hath
   saved thee." It was not because there was more power in the person of
   Christ when the woman touched his garment, than at other times, that
   she was healed, but because of her faith. Fourthly, that the Spirit
   never operates savingly on the minds of men, except through and in the
   Word. Luther in the Smalcald Articles says: "Constanter tenendum est,
   Deum nemini Spiritum vel gratiam suam largiri nisi per verbum et cum
   verbo externo et præcedente, ut ita præmuniamus nos adversum
   enthusiastas, i.e., spiritus, qui jactitant se ante verbum et sine
   verbo Spiritum habere." [435] And in the Larger Catechism, [436] he
   says: In summa, quicquid Deus in nobis facit et operatur, tantum
   externis istius modi rebus et constitutionibus operari dignatur."
   Luther went so far as to refer even the inspiration of the prophets to
   the "verbum vocale," or external word. [437]

   This divine power of the Word, however, is not, as before remarked, to
   be referred to the mere moral power of the truth. On this point the
   Lutheran theologians are perfectly explicit. Thus Quenstedt [438] says:
   "Verbum Dei non agit solum persuasiones morales, proponendo nobis
   objectum amabile; sed vero, reali, divino et ineffabili influxu
   potentiæ suæ gratiosæ." This influx of divine power, however, is not
   something occasional, giving the word a power at one time which it has
   not at another. It is something inherent and permanent. Quenstedt says:
   [439] "Verbo Dei virtus divina non extrinsecus in ipso usu demum,
   accedit, sed . . . . in se et per se, intrinsice ex divina ordinatione
   et communicatione, efficacia et vi conversiva et regeneratrice præditum
   est, etiam ante et extra omnem usum." And Hollaz [440] says it has this
   power "propter mysticam verbi cum Spiritu Sancto unionem intimam et
   individuam."

   Professor Schinid, of Erlangen, in his "Dogmatik der
   evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche," quotes from the leading Lutheran
   theologians their views on this subject. Hollaz, for example, says that
   this "vis divina" is inseparably conjoined with the Word; that the Word
   of God cannot be conceived of without the Spirit; that if the Holy
   Spirit could be separated from the Word, it would not be the Word of
   God, but the word of man. [441] Quenstedt says that the action of the
   Word and of the Spirit is one and indivisible. Baier says: [442] "Nempe
   eadem illa infinita virtus, quæ essentialiter, per se et independenter
   in Deo est, et per quam Deus nomines illuminat et convertit, verbo
   communicata est: et tanquam verbo communicata, divina tamen, hic
   spectari debet." A distinction, says Quenstedt, is to be made between
   the natural instruments, such as the staff of Moses, or rod of Aaron,
   which God uses to produce supernatural effects, and those, as the Word
   and sacraments, which are "sua essentia supernaturalia. . . . . Illa
   indigent novo motu et elevatione nova ad effectum novum ultra propriam
   suam et naturalem virtutem producendum; hæc vero a prima institutione
   et productione sufficienti, hoc est, divina et summa vi ac efficacia
   prædita sunt, nec indigent nova et peculiari aliqua elevatione ultra
   efficaciam ordinariam, jamdum ipsis inditam ad producendum spiritualem
   effectum." [443] That the Word is not always efficacious is not because
   it is attended by greater power in one case than another, but because
   of the difference in the moral state of those to whom it is presented.
   On this point Quenstedt says, "Quanquam itaque effectus Verbi divini
   prædicati nonnunquam impediatur, efficacia tamen ipsa, seu virtus
   intrinseca a verbo tolli et separari non potest. Et ita per accidens
   fit inefficax, non potentiæ defectu, sed malitiæ motu, quo ejus
   operatio impeditur, quo minus effectum suum assequatur." [444] A piece
   of iron glowing with heat, if placed in contact with anything easily
   combustible, produces an immediate conflagration. If brought in contact
   with a rock, it produces little sensible effect. So the Word of God
   fraught with divine power, when presented to one mind regenerates,
   converts, and sanctifies, and when presented to another leaves it as it
   was, or only exasperates the evil of its nature. It is true these
   theologians say that the operation of the Word is not physical, as in
   the case of opium, poison, or fire; but moral, "illustrando mentem,
   commovendo voluntatem," etc. Nevertheless the illustration holds as to
   the main point. The Word has an inherent, divine, and constant power.
   It produces different effects according to the subjective state of
   those on whom it acts. The Spirit acts neither on them nor on it more
   at one time than at another.

   Remarks.

   1. It is obvious that this peculiar theory has no support from
   Scripture. The Bible does indeed say that the Word of God is quick and
   powerful; that it is the wisdom of God and the power of God; and that
   it convinces, converts, and sanctifies. But so does the Bible say that
   Christ gave his Apostles power to work miracles; and that they went
   about communicating the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, healing
   the sick, and raising the dead. But the power was not in them. Peter
   was indignant at such an imputation. "Why look ye so earnestly on us,"
   he said to the people, "as though by our own power or holiness we had
   made this man to walk?" If the Apostles working miracles did not prove
   that the power was in them, the effects produced by the Word do not
   prove that the power is in it.

   2. This doctrine is inconsistent with the constant representations of
   the Scriptures, which set forth the Spirit as attending the Word and
   giving it effect, sometimes more and sometimes less; working with and
   by the truth as He sees fit. It is inconsistent with the command to
   pray for the Spirit. Men are not accustomed to pray that God would give
   fire the power to burn or ice to cool. If the Spirit were always in
   mystical, indissoluble union with the Word, giving it inherent divine
   power, there would be no propriety in praying for his influence as the
   Apostles did, and as the Church in all ages has ever done, and
   continues to do.

   3. This theory cuts us off from all intercourse with the Spirit and all
   dependence upon Him as a personal voluntary agent. He never comes; He
   never goes; He does not act at one time more than at another. He has
   imbued the Word with divine power, and sent it forth into the world.
   There his agency ends. God has given opium its narcotic power, and
   arsenic its power to corrode the stomach, and left them to men to use
   or to abuse as they saw fit. Beyond giving them their properties, He
   has nothing to do with the effects which they produce. So the Spirit
   has nothing to do with the conviction, conversion, or sanctification of
   the people of God, or with illuminating, consoling, or guiding them,
   beyond once for all giving his Word divine power. There it is: men may
   use or neglect it as they please. The Spirit does not incline them to
   use it. He does not open their hearts, as He opened the heart of Lydia,
   to receive the Word. He does not enlighten their eyes to see wondrous
   things out of the law.

   4. Lutherans do not attribute divine power to the visible words or to
   the audible sounds uttered, but to the truth which these conventional
   signs are the means of communicating to the mind. They admit that this
   truth, although it has inherent in it divine power, never produces any
   supernatural or spiritual effect unless it is properly used. They admit
   also that this proper use includes the intellectual apprehension of its
   meaning, attention, aud the purpose to believe and obey. Yet they
   believe in infant regeneration. But if infants are incapable of using
   the Word; and if the Spirit never operates except in the Word and by
   its use, how is it possible that infants can be regenerated. If,
   therefore, the Bible teaches that infants are regenerated and saved, it
   teaches that the Spirit operates not only with and by the Word, but
   also without it, when, how, and where He sees fit. If Christ healed
   only those who had faith to be healed, how did He heal infants, or
   raise the dead?

   5. The theory in question is contrary to Scripture, in that it assumes
   that the reason why one man is saved and another not, a simply that one
   resists the supernatural power of the Word and another does not. Why
   the one resists, is referred to his own free will. Why the other does
   not resist, is referred not to any special influence, but to his own
   unbiased will. Our Lord, however, teaches that those only come to Him
   who are given to Him by the Father; that those come who besides the
   outward teaching of the Word, are inwardly taught and drawn of God. The
   Apostle teaches that salvation is not of him that willeth or of him
   that runneth, but of God who showeth mercy. The Lutheran doctrine
   banishes, and is intended to banish, all sovereignty in the
   distribution of saving grace, from the dispensations of God. To those
   who believe that that sovereignty is indelibly impressed on the
   doctrines of the Bible and on the history of the Church and of the
   world, this objection is of itself sufficient. The common practical
   belief of Christians, whatever their theories may be, is that they are
   Christians not because they are better than other men; not because they
   coöperate with the common and sufficient grace given to all men; not
   because they yield to, while others resist the operation of the divine
   Word; but because God in his sovereign mercy made them willing in the
   day of his power; so that they are all disposed to say from the heart,
   "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory."

   6. This Lutheran doctrine is inconsistent with the experience of
   believers individually and collectively. On the day of Pentecost, what
   fell upon the Apostles and the brethren assembled with them? It was no
   "verbum vocale;" no sound of words; and no new external revelation. The
   Spirit of God Himself, enlightened their minds and enabled them to
   remember and to understand all that Christ had taught, and they spoke
   every man, as the Spirit (not the Word) gave them utterance. Here was a
   clear manifestation of the Spirit's acting directly on the minds of the
   Apostles. To say that the effects then exhibited were due to the divine
   power inherent in the words of Christ; and that they had resisted that
   power up to the day of Pentecost, and then yielded to its influence, is
   an incredible hypothesis. It will not account for the facts of the
   cast. Besides, our Lord promised to send the Spirit after his
   ascension. He commanded the disciples to remain in Jerusalem until they
   were imbued with power from on high. When the Spirit came they were
   instantly enlightened, endowed with plenary knowledge of the Gospel,
   and with miraculous gifts. How could the "verbum vocale" impart the
   gift of tongues, or the gift of healing? What according to the Lutheran
   theory is meant by being full of the Holy Ghost? or, by the indwelling
   of the Spirit? or, by the testimony of the Spirit? or, by the
   demonstration of the Spirit? or, by the unction of the Holy One which
   teaches all things? or, by the outpouring of the Spirit? In short, the
   whole Bible, and especially the evangelical history and the epistles of
   the New Testament, represents the Holy Spirit not as a power imprisoned
   in the truth, but as a personal, voluntary agent acting with the truth
   or without it, as He pleases. As such He has ever been regarded by the
   Church, and has ever exhibited himself in his dealings with the
   children of God.

   7. Luther, glorious and lovely as he was -- and he is certainly one of
   the grandest and most attractive figures in ecclesiastical history --
   was impulsive and apt to be driven to extremes. [445] The enthusiasts
   of his age undervalued the Scriptures, pretending to private
   revelations, and direct spiritual impulses, communicating to them the
   knowledge of truths unrevealed in the Bible, and a rule of action
   higher than that of the written Word. This doctrine was a floodgate
   through which all manner of errors and extravagances poured forth among
   the people and threatened the overthrow of the Church and of society.
   Against these enthusiasts all the Reformers raised their voices, and
   Luther denounced them with characteristic vehemence. In opposition to
   their pretensions he took the ground that the Spirit never operated on
   the minds of men except through the Word and sacraments; and, as he
   held the conversion of sinners to be the greatest of all miracles, he
   was constrained to attribute divine power to the Word. He was not
   content to take the ground which the Church in general has taken, that
   while the Word and sacraments are the ordinary channels of the Spirit's
   influence, He has left himself free to act with or without these or any
   other means, and when He makes new revelations to individuals they are
   authenticated to others by signs, and miracles, and divers gifts; and
   that in all cases, however authenticated, they are to be judged by the
   written Word as the only infallible rule of faith or practice; so that
   if an Apostle or an angel from heaven should preach any other gospel
   than that which we have received, he is to be pronounced accursed.
   (Gal. i. 8.) "We are of God:" said the Apostle John, "he that knoweth
   God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby we know
   the spirit of truth and the spirit of error." (1 John iv. 6.) The
   Scriptures teach that not only the Holy Spirit, but also other spirits
   good and evil have access to the minds of men, and more or less
   effectually control their operations. Directions, therefore, are given
   in the Bible to guide us in discriminating between the true and false.

   The power of individual men, who appear in special junctures, over the
   faith and character of coming generations, is something portentous. Of
   such "world controllers," at least in modern times, there are none to
   compare with Martin Luther, Ignatius Loyola, and John Wesley. Though so
   different from each other, each has left his impress upon millions of
   men. Our only security from the fallible or perverting influence of
   man, is in entire, unquestioning submission to the infallible Word of
   God.

   § 2. The Sacraments. Their Nature.

   Usage of the Word Sacrament.

   1. In classical usage the word "sacramentum" means, in general,
   something sacred. In legal proceedings the money deposted by contending
   parties was called "sacramentum," because when forfeited it was applied
   to sacred purposes. "Ea pecunia, quæ in judiciuin venit in litibus,
   sacramentum a sacro." "Sacramentum æs significat, quod poenæ nomine
   penditur, sive eo quis interrogatur sive contenditur." Then in a
   secondary sense it meant a judicial process. In military usage it
   expressed the obligation of the soldier to his leader or country; then
   the oath by which he was bound; and generally an oath; so that in
   ordinary language "sacramentum dicere" meant to swear. [446]

   2. The ecclesiastical usage of the word was influenced by various
   circumstances. From its etymology and signification it was applied to
   anything sacred or consecrated. Then to anything which had a sacred or
   hidden meaning. In this sense it was applied to all religious rites and
   ceremonies. This brought it into connection with the Greek word
   musterion, which properly means a secret; something into the knowledge
   of which a man must be initiated. Hence in the Vulgate "sacramentum" is
   used as the translation of musterion in Ephesians i. 9, iii. 9, v. 32;
   Colossians i. 27; 1 Timothy iii. 16; Revelation i. 20, xvii. 7. It was
   therefore used in the wide sense for any sign which had a secret
   import. Thus Augustine says, [447] "Nimis autem longum est,
   convenienter disputare de varietate signorum, quæ cum ad res divinas
   pertinent, sacramenta appellantur." And again he says, [448] "Ista
   fratres dicuntur sacramenta, quia in eis aliud videtur, aliud
   intelligitur. Quod videtur speciem habet corporalem, quod intelligitur,
   fructum habet spiritualem." All religious rites and ceremonies, the
   sign of the cross, anointing with oil, etc., were therefore called
   sacraments. Augustine frequently calls the mystical or allegorical
   exposition of Scripture, a sacrament. Jerome [449] says, "Sacramenta
   Dei sunt prædicare, benedicere ac confirmare, communionem reddere,
   visitare infirmos, orare." [450] Lombard says, "Sacramentum est sacræ
   rei signum." [451]

   The Theological Usage and Definition of the Word.

   3. It is evident that the signification of the word "sacrament" is so
   comprehensive and its usage so lax, that little aid can be derived from
   either of those sources in fixing definitely its meaning in Christian
   theology. Hence theologians soon began to frame definitions of the word
   more or less exact, derived from the teachings of the New Testament on
   the subject. The two simplest and most generally accepted of such
   definitions are the one by Augustine and the other by Peter Lombard.
   The former says, [452] "Accedit verbum ad elementum, et fit
   sacramentum;" the latter, [453] "Sacramentum est invisibilis gratiæ
   visibilis forma." These definitions however are too vague.

   It is obvious that the only safe and satisfactory method of arriving at
   the idea of a sacrament, in the Christian sense of the word, is to take
   those ordinances which by common consent are admitted to be sacraments,
   and by analyzing them determine what are their essential elements or
   characteristics. We should then exclude from the category all other
   ordinances, human or divine, in which those characteristics are not
   found. Baptism and the Lord's Supper are admitted to be sacraments.
   They are (1.) Ordinances instituted by Christ. (2.) They are in their
   nature significant, baptism of cleansing; the Lord's Supper of
   spiritual nourishment. (3.) They were designed to be perpetual. (4.)
   They were appointed to signify, and to instruct; to seal, and thus to
   confirm and strengthen; and to convey or apply, and thus to sanctify,
   those who by faith receive them. On this principle the definition of a
   sacrament given in the standards of our Church is founded. "A
   sacrament," it is said, "is an holy ordinance instituted by Christ;
   wherein, by sensible signs, Christ and the benefits of the New Covenant
   are represented, sealed, and applied to believers." [454]

   To the same effect the other Reformed Symbols speak. For example, the
   Second Helvetic Confession says: "Sunt sacramenta symbola mystica, vel
   ritus sancti, aut sacræ actiones, a Deo ipso institutæ, constantes
   verbo suo, signis, et rebus significatis, quibus in ecclesia summa sua
   beneficia, homini exhibita, retinet in memoria, et subinde renovat,
   quibus item promissiones suas obsignat, et quæ ipse nobis interius
   præstat, exterius repræsentat, ac veluti oculis contemplanda subiicit,
   adeoque fidem nostram, Spiritu Dei in cordibus nostris operante,
   roborat et auget: quibus denique nos ab omnibus aliis populis et
   religionibus separat, sibique soli consecrat et obligat, et quid a
   nobis requirat, significat." [455]

   The definition given in the Geneva Catechism is that a sacrament is
   "externa divinæ erga nos benevolentiæ testificatio, quæ visibili signo
   spirituales gratias figurat, ad obsignandas cordibus nostris Dei
   promissiones, quo earum veritas melius confirmetur." [456]

   The Heidelberg Catechism says, that sacraments are "sacra et in oculos
   incurrentia signa, ac sigilla, ob eam causam a Deo instituta, ut per ea
   nobis promissionem Evangelii magis declarat et obsignet: quod scilicet
   non universis tantum, verum etiam singulis credentibus, propter unicum
   illud Christi sacrificium in cruce peractum, gratis donet remissionem
   peccatorum, et vitam æternam." [457]

   The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England teach [458] that
   "Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of
   Christian men's profession; but rather they be certain sure witnesses
   and effectual signs of grace, and God's will toward us, by the which He
   doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also
   strengthen and confirm our faith in Him."

   Lutheran Doctrine.

   The Lutheran definition of the sacraments agrees in all essential
   points with that of the Reformed churches. In the Augsburg Confession,
   its authors say: "De usu sacramentorum docent, quod sacramenta
   instituta sint, non modo ut sint notæ professionis inter homines, sed
   magis ut sint signa et testimonia voluntatis Dei erga nos, ad
   excitandam et confirmandam fidem in his, qui utuntur, proposita. Itaque
   utendum est sacramentis ita, ut fides accedat, quæ credat
   promissionibus, quæ per sacramenta exhibentur et ostenduntur." [459]

   In the Apology for that Confession it is said: "Si sacramenta vocamus
   ritus, qui habent mandatum Dei, et quibus addita est promissio gratiæ,
   facile est judicare, quæ sint proprie sacramenta. Nam ritus ab
   hominibus instituti non erunt hoc modo proprie dicta sacramenta. Non
   est enim auctoritatis humanæ, promittere gratiam. Quare signa sine
   mandato Dei instituta, non sunt certa sigua gratiæ, etiamsi fortasse
   rudes docent, aut admonent aliquid." [460]

   "Dicimus igitur ad sacramenta proprie sic dicta duo potissimum requiri,
   videlicet verbum et elementum, juxta vulgatum illud Augustini: Accedit
   verbum ad elementum, et fit sacramentum.' Fundamentum hujus adsertionis
   ex ipsa natura et fine sacramentorum pendet, cum enim sacramenta id,
   quid in verbo evangelii prædicatur, externo elemento vestitum sensibus
   ingerere debeant, ex eo sponte sequitur, quod nec verbum sine elemento,
   nec elementum sine verbo constituat sacramentum. Per verbum
   intelligitur primo mandatum atque institutio divina, per quam elementum
   . . . . . separatur ab usu communi, et destinatur usui sacramentali;
   deinde promissio atque ea quidem evangelio propria, per sacramentum
   adplicanda et obsignanda. Per elementum non quodvis, sed certum et
   verbo institutionis expressum accipitur." [461] In all this the
   Reformed and Lutherans are agreed. The differences between them in
   relation to the sacraments do not concern their nature.

   Romish Doctrine.

   The distinctive doctrine of the Romish Church on this subject is that
   the sacraments contain the grace which they signify, and that such
   grace is conveyed "ex opere operato." That is, they have a real
   inherent and objective virtue, which renders them effectual in
   communicating saving benefits to those who receive them. In a certain
   sense these words may be used to express the Lutheran doctrine; but
   that doctrine differs from the Romanist doctrine, as will appear when
   the efficacy of the sacraments comes to be considered. The language of
   the Council of Trent on this subject is: "Si quis dixerit sacramenta
   novæ legis non continere gratiam, quam significant; aut gratiam ipsam
   non ponentibus obicem non conferre; quasi signa tantum externa sint
   acceptæ per fidem gratiæ, vel justitiæ, et notæ quædam Christianæ
   professionis, quibus apud homines discernuntur fideles ab infidelibus;
   anathema sit." [462]

   The Roman Catechism defines a sacrament "Rem esse sensibus subjectam,
   quæ ex Dei institutione sanctitatis et justitiæ tum significandæ, tum
   efficiendæ vim habet." [463] As the task devolved on the Council of
   Trent was to present and harmonize the doctrines elaborated by the
   Schoolmen in opposition to the doctrines of the Reformers, the
   definitions and explanations given by the writers of the Middle Ages
   throw as much light on the decrees of the Council as the expositions of
   the later theologians of the Latin Church. On this point Thomas Aquinas
   says: "Oportet, quod virtus salutifera a divinitate Christi per ejus
   humanitatem in ipsa sacramenta derivetur. . . . . Sacramenta ecelesiæ
   specialiter habent virtutem ex passione Christi, cujus virtus
   quodammodo nobis copulatur per susceptionem sacramentorum." [464]
   Again: "Ponendo quod sacramentum est instrumentalis causa gratiæ,
   necesse est simul ponere, quod in sacramento sit quædam virtus
   instrumentalis ad inducendum sacramentalem effectum. . . . . Sicut
   virtus instrumentalis acquiritur instrumento, ex hoc ipso quod movetur
   ab agente principali, ita et sacramentum consequitur spiritualem
   virtutem ex benedictione Christi et applicatione ministri ad usum
   sacramenti." Thus Thomas's own opinion was adopted by the Council as
   opposed to that of the Scotists to which Thomas refers, in the same
   connection: "Illi qui ponunt quod sacramenta non causant gratiam, nisi
   per quandam concomitantiam ponunt quod in sacramento non sit aliqua
   virtus, quæ operetur ad sacramenti effectum, est tamen virtus divina
   sacramento assistens, quæ sacramentalem effectum operatur." [465] This
   is very nearly the doctrine of the Reformed Church upon the subject.
   Bellarmin's illustration of the point in hand is that as fire is the
   cause of combustion when brought into contact with proper materials, so
   the sacraments produce their effect by their own inherent virtue.
   "Exemplum," he says, "esse potest in re naturali. Si ad ligna
   comburenda, primum exsiccarentur ligna, deinde excuteretur ex silice,
   tum applicaretur ignis ligno, et sic tandem fieret combustio; nemo
   diceret, causam immediatam combustionis esse siccitatem aut excussionem
   ignis ex silice aut applicationem ignis ad ligna, sed solum ignem, ut
   causam primariam, et solum calorem seu calefactionem, ut causam
   instrumentalem." [466]

   "Jam vero sacramenta gratiam, quam significant, continere, eamque
   conferre virtute sibi insita, seu ex opere operato, Scripturæ, patres,
   constansque Ecclesiæ sensus traditionalis luculentissime docent." [467]
   According to Romanists, therefore, a sacrament is a divine ordinance
   which has the inherent or intrinsic power of conferring the grace which
   it signifies.

   Remonstrant Doctrine.

   It has already been shown that it was the tendency of the Remonstrants
   to eliminate, as far as possible, the supernatural element from
   Christianity. They therefore regarded the sacraments not properly as
   means of grace, but as significant rites intended to bring the truth
   vividly before the mind, which truth exerted its moral influence on the
   heart. "Sacramenta cum dicimus, externas ecclesiæ ceremonias seu ritus
   illos sacros ac solennes intelligimus, quibus veluti foederalibus
   signis ac sigillis visibilibus Deus gratiosa beneficia sua, in foedere
   præsertim evangelico promissa, non modo nobis repræsentat et adumbrat,
   sed et certo modo exhibet atque obsignat: nosque vicissim palam
   publiceque declaramus ac testamur, nos promissiones omnes divinas vera,
   firma atque obsequiosa fide amplecti, et beneficia ipsius jugi et grata
   semper memoria celebrare velle." [468]

   "Restat, ut dicamus, Deum gratiam suam per sacramenta nobis exhibere,
   non eam actu per illa conferendo; sed per illa tanquam signa clara ac
   evidentia eam repræsentando et ob oculos ponendo non eminus aut sub
   figuris quibusdam tanquam multo post futuram, sed tanquam præsentem: ut
   ita in signis istis tanquam in speculo quodam, exhibitionem iliam
   gratiæ, quam Deus nobis concessit, quasi conspiciamus. Estque hæc
   efficacia nulla alia quam objectiva, quæ requirit facultatem cognitivam
   rite dispositam, ut apprehendere possit illud, quod signum objective
   menti offert. Hinc videmus, quomodo sacramenta in nobis operentur,
   nimirum tanquam signa repræsentantia menti nostræ rem cujus signa sunt.
   Neque alia in illis quæri debet efficacia." [469]

   Zwingle alone of the Reformers seems inclined to this view of the
   sacraments: "Sunt . . . . . sacramenta," he says, "signa vel ceremoniæ,
   pace tamen omnium dicam, sive neotericorum sive veteram, quibus se homo
   Ecclesiæ probat aut candidatum aut militem esse Christi, redduntque
   Ecclesiam totam potius certiorem de tua fide quam te. Si enim fides tua
   non aliter fuerit absoluta, quam ut signo ceremoniali egeat, fides non
   est: fides enim est, qua nitimur misericordiæ Dei inconcusse, firmiter
   et indistracte, ut multis locis Paulus habet." [470] Elsewhere he says:
   "Credo, imo scio omnia sacramenta, tam abesse ut gratiam conferant, ut
   ne adferant quidem aut dispensent. . . . . Dux autem vel vehiculum
   Spiritui non est necessarium, ipse enim est virtus et latio qua cuncta
   feruntur, non qui ferri opus habeat: neque id unquam legimus in
   scripturis sacris, quod sensibilia, qualia sacramenta sunt, certo secum
   ferrent Spiritum, sed si sensibilia unquam lata sunt cum Spiritu, jam
   Spiritus fuit qui tulit, non sensibilia. Sic cum ventus vehemens
   ferretur, simul adferebantur linguæ venti virtute, non ferebatur ventus
   virtute linguarum." [471] It is obvious that all that Zwingle here says
   of the sacraments, might be said of the Word of God; and, therefore, if
   he proves anything he proves that the sacraments are not means of
   grace; he proves the same concerning the Word, to which the Scriptures
   attribute such an important agency in the sanctification and salvation
   of men.

   § 3. Nnmber of the Sacraments.

   If the word sacrament be taken in the wide sense in which it was used
   in the early Church for any significant religious rite, it is obvious
   that no definite limit can be set to their number. If the word be
   confined to such divine ordinances as answer the conditions which
   characterize baptism and the Lord's Supper, then it is evident that
   they are the only sacraments under the Christian dispensation; and such
   is the view taken by all Protestants. It is true that in the Apology
   for the Augsburg Confession it is said: "Vere sunt sacramenta,
   baptismus, Coena Domini, absolutio, quæ est sacramentum poenitentiæ.
   Nam hi ritus habent mandatum Dei et promissionem gratiæ, quæ est
   propria Novi Testamenti." The last was soon dropped out of the list of
   sacraments, although the Lutherans retained confession as a distinct
   Church institution. The confession however was to be general, an
   enumeration of sins not being required, and the absolution which
   followed was simply declarative, and not judicial, as among the
   Romanists. The Reformed symbols required private confession to be made
   to God, and general confession in the congregation of the people; and
   recommended in extraordinary cases, where the conscience is burdened ot
   the mind perplexed, private confession to the pastor or spiritual
   adviser.

   The Romanists have seven sacraments, adding to baptism and the Lord's
   Supper, matrimony, orders, penance, confirmation, and extreme unction.
   Matrimony, however, although a divine institution, was not ordained for
   signifying, sealing, and applying to believers the benefits of
   redemption, and therefore, is not a sacrament. The same may be said of
   orders. And as to confirmation, penance, and extreme unction, in the
   sense in which Romanists use those terms, they are not divine
   institutions at all.

   Confirmation.

   Confirmation indeed, or a service attending the introduction of those
   baptized in infancy, into full communion in the Church, was early
   instituted and long continued among Protestants as well as among
   Romanists. Those who had been baptized in infancy, had their standing
   in the Church on the ground of the profession of faith and the
   engagements made in their name, by their parents or sponsors. When they
   came to years of discretion, they were examined as to their knowledge
   and conduct, and if found competently instructed and free from scandal,
   they assumed the obligation of their baptismal vows upon themselves,
   and their church membership was confirmed. In all this, however, there
   was nothing of a sacramental character.

   This simple service the Romanists have exalted into a sacrament. The
   "material," they say, is the anointing with oil, or the imposition of
   hands; or as Thomas Aquinas and Bellarmin say, the two united. Perrone
   makes the anointing the essential thing. The gift or grace conveyed,
   "ex opere operato," is that supernatural influence of the Holy Ghost,
   which enables the recipient to be faithful to his baptismal vows. The
   administrator must be a prelate, as prelates only are the official
   successors of the Apostles, and, therefore, they only have the power of
   conveying the Holy Spirit by the imposition of hands, which was one of
   the prerogatives of the apostleship.

   Penance.

   Romanists distinguish between "poenitentia," repentance or penitence,
   as a virtue and as a sacrament. As a virtue it consists in sorrow for
   sin, a determination to forsake it, and a purpose "ad sui vindictam in
   compensationem injuriæ Deo per peccatum illatæ" i.e., a purpose to make
   satisfaction to God. As a sacrament it is an ordinance instituted by
   Christ for the remission of sins committed after baptism, through the
   absolution of a priest having jurisdiction. The matter of the sacrament
   is the act of the penitent including contrition, confession, and
   satisfaction. The form is the act of absolution on the part of the
   priest. By contrition is meant sorrow, or remorse. It is not necessary
   that this contrition should be anything more than a natural, as
   distinguished from a gracious, exercise or state of mind; or as the
   Romanists express it, it is not necessary that contrition should be
   "caritate perfecta." The confession included in this assumed sacrament,
   must be auricular; it must include all mortal sins; a sin not confessed
   is not forgiven. This confession is declared by the Council of Trent to
   be necessary to salvation. "Si quis negaverit, confessionem
   sacramentalem vel institutam, vel ad salutem necessariam esse jure
   divino; aut dixerit, modum secreti confitendi soli sacerdoti, quem
   Ecclesia catholica ab initio semper observavit, et observat, alienum
   esse ab institutione et mandato Christi, et inventum esse humanum;
   anathema sit." [472] In sin there is both a "reatus culpæ" and a
   "reatus poenæ." The former, together with the penalty of eternal death,
   is removed by absolution; but "reatus poenæ" as to temporal punishment,
   to be endured either in this life or in purgatory, remains or may
   remain. Hence the necessity of satisfaction for sin in the sense above
   stated. The absolution granted by the priest, is not merely
   declaratory, but judicial and effective. On this point the Romish
   Church teaches "1º Christum delere peccata sacerdotum ministerio; 2º
   sacerdotes sedere judices in tribunali poenitentiæ; 3º illorum
   sententiam ratam in coelis esse; 4º sacerdotes hac potestate præstare
   angelis et archangelis ipsis." [473] This doctrine that no real sin,
   committed after baptism, can be forgiven unless confessed to a priest;
   that the priest has the power to remit or retain; that he carries at
   his girdle the keys uot only of the visible Church on earth, but also
   of heaven and hell; and that he opens and no man shuts, and shuts and
   no man opens, is one of the strongest links of the chain by which the
   Church of Rome leads captive the souls of men. No wonder that she says
   that the power of a priest is above that even of angels and archangels.

   Orders.

   Orders or ordination is made a sacrament, because instituted or
   commanded by Christ, and because therein the supernatural power of
   consecrating the body and blood of Christ and of forgiving sin is
   conferred. It is thus defined: "Ordo sacer et sacramentum divinitus
   institutum, quo tribuitur potestas consecrandi corpus et sanguinem
   Domini, nec non remittendi et retinendi peccata." On this subject the
   Council of Trent says: "Si quis dixerit, per sacram ordinationem non
   dari Spiritum Sanctum, ac proinde frustra episcopos dicere: Accipe
   Spiritum Sanctum; aut per eam non imprimi characterem; vel eum, qui
   sacerdos semel fuit, laicum rursus fieri posse; anathema sit." [474]
   The right and power to ordain belong exclusively to prelates, for they
   alone possess the apostolical prerogative of communicating the Holy
   Spirit by the imposition of hands. The Apostles, however, had only the
   power of communicating miraculous gifts. They neither claimed nor
   pretended to exercise the power of conferring the sanctifying or saving
   influences of the Spirit. As the Church of Rome claims for its clergy a
   power far above that of angels or archangels, so it claims for its
   bishops powers far transcending those of the Apostles.

   Matrimony.

   Matrimony is declared to be a sacrament because, although not
   instituted by Christ, it was made by Him the symbol of the mystical
   union between the Church and its divine head; and because by its due
   celebration divine grace is conferred upon the contracting parties. It
   is thus defined: "Sacramentum novæ legis, quo significatur conjunctio
   Christi cum Ecclesia, et gratia confertur ad sanctificandam viri et
   mulieris legitimam conjunctionem, ad uniendos arctius conjugum animos,
   atque ad prolem pie sancteque in virtutis officiis et fide christiana
   instituendam." [475]

   Extreme Unction.

   This is defined to be a sacrament wherein by the anointing with oil
   (per unctionem olei benedicti) and prayer in the prescribed form, by
   the ministration of a priest, grace is conferred to the baptized
   dangerously ill, whereby sins are remitted and the strength of the soul
   is increased. "Si quis dixerit, sacram infirmorum unctionem non
   conferre gratiam, nec remittere peccata, nec alleviare infirmos; sed
   jam cessasse, quasi olim tantum fuerit gratia curationum; anathema
   sit." "Si quis dixerit, presbyteros Ecclesiæ, quos B. Jacobus
   adducendos esse infirmum inunguendum hortatur, non esse sacerdotes ab
   Episcopo ordinatos, sed ætate seniores, in quavis communitate; ob idque
   proprium extremæ unctionis ministrum non esse solum sacerdotem;
   anathema sit." [476]

   Reasons for fixing the Number of the Sacraments at Seven.

   It is a work of supererogation for Romanists to assign any reason for
   making the number of the sacraments seven, and neither more nor less,
   other than the decision of the Church. If the Church be infallible her
   judgment on the question is decisive; if it be not infallible no other
   reason is of any avail. They admit that there is no authority from
   Scripture on this point, and on no subject in dispute between them and
   Protestants, can appeal be made with less show of reason to the
   testimony of tradition. Romish theologians, therefore, while they claim
   common consent in support of their doctrine on this subject, avail
   themselves of all the collateral aid they can command. Thomas Aquinas
   says that there is an analogy between the natural and spiritual life of
   man. He is born; he is strengthened; he is nourished; he needs means of
   recovery from illness; he needs to propagate his race; to live under
   the guidance of legitimate authority; and to be prepared for his
   departure from this world. The sacraments provide for all these
   necessities of his spiritual life. He is born in baptism; strengthened
   by confirmation; nourished by the Lord's Supper; recovered from
   spiritual illness by penance; the Church is continued by holy
   matrimony; the sacrament of orders provides for the Christian a
   supernaturally endowed guide; and extreme unction prepares him for
   death. Thus through the seven sacraments all his spiritual wants are
   supplied.

   Then again as there are seven cardinal virtues, there should be seven
   sacraments. Besides seven is a sacred number: there are seven days in
   the week; every seventh year was Sabbatical; and there were seven
   golden candlesticks, and seven stars in the right hand of Christ. It is
   not wonderful therefore that there should be seven sacraments. It is
   obvious that all this amounts to nothing. The two sacraments instituted
   by Christ for the definite purpose of "signifying, sealing, and
   applying to believers," the benefits of redemption, stand alone in the
   New Testament. No other ordinance has the same characteristics or the
   same design. Admitting, therefore, that the Fathers and the Church were
   unanimous in calling any number of other sacred institutions
   sacraments, that would not prove that they belong to the same category
   as baptism, and the Lord's Supper.

   It is, however, notorious that no such general consent can be pleaded
   in support of the seven sacraments of the Romanists. The simple facts
   on this subject are, -- (1.) As already remarked, in the early Church
   every sacred rite was called a sacrament. Then their number was
   indefinite. (2.) The preeminence of baptism and the Lord's Supper over
   all other sacred rites being recognized, they were called, as by
   Augustine, the chief sacraments. (3.) When attention was directed to
   the fact that something is true of baptism and the Lord's Supper, which
   is true of no other sacred ordinances or rites, that they, and they
   only, of external ceremonies were appointed to be "means of grace,"
   then they were declared in this light to be the only Christian
   sacraments. Justin Martyr, [477] Cyril of Jerusalem, [478] and
   Augustine, [479] so speak of them. [480] (4.) As a ritualistic spirit
   increased in the Church, first one and then another rite was assumed to
   be a "means of grace," not always, however, the same rites, and thus
   the number of sacraments was increased. (5.) For centuries, however, no
   definite number was admitted by anything like general consent. Some
   made the number three; the Pseudo Dionysius in the sixth century made
   six. Peter Damiani, the friend of Gregory VII., made twelve.
   "Ratherius, Bishop of Verona ( 974), Fulbert, Bishop of Chartres (
   1028), Bruno, Bishop of Wurzburg ( 1045), Rupert, Abbot of Deutz (
   1135), admitted only baptism and the Lord's Supper; others, as
   Theodulf, Bishop of Orleans ( 821), Agobard, Bishop of Lyons ( 840),
   Lanfranc, Bishop of Canterbury ( 1089), Hildebert, Bishop of Tours (
   1134), Hugo, of St. Victor ( 1141), call them duo sanctæ ecclesiæ
   sacramenta.'" [481] (6.) It is certain, says the writer just quoted,
   that Peter Lombard ( 1164) is the first who enumerated the seven
   sacraments as held by the Romanists. He gives no reason for fixing on
   the number seven; but that which was already on hand in the traditional
   sanctity, attributed to that number. It was regarded as the symbol of
   universality and perfection. This was sufficient for deciding on an
   arbitrary number. What has been said is enough to show that Romanists
   have not even any plausible ground for their appeal to common consent
   in support of their doctrine on this subject. Such appeal on their
   theory is unnecessary. If the Church be infallible, and if the Church
   testifies that Christ ordained matrimony, extreme unction, etc., to be
   sacraments; that testimony is decisive. If, however, the Church, in the
   papal sense of the word, be the very reverse of infallible, then its
   testimony, so far as the faith of Christians is concerned, amounts to
   nothing.

   § 4. The Efficacy of the Sacraments.

   Zwinglian and Remonstrant Doctrine.

   According to the doctrine of Zwingle afterwards adopted by the
   Remonstrants, the sacraments are not properly "means of grace." They
   were not ordained to signify, seal, and apply to believers the benefits
   of Christ's redemption. They were indeed intended to be significant
   emblems of the great truths of the Gospel. Baptism was intended to
   teach the necessity of the soul's being cleansed from guilt by the
   blood of Christ and purified from the pollution of sin by the renewing
   of the Holy Ghost. They were further designed to be perpetual memorials
   of the work of redemption, and especially to be the means by which men
   should, in the sight of the Church and of the world, profess themselves
   to be Christians. As a heathen, when he desired to be admitted into the
   commonwealth of Israel, received circumcision, which was the divinely
   appointed seal of the Abrahamic covenant, so participation in the
   Christian sacraments was the appointed means for the public profession
   of faith in Christ. Paul presents the matter in this light in 1
   Corinthians x. 15-22, where he argues that participation in the sacred
   rites of a religion involves a profession of that religion, whether it
   be Christian, Jewish, or heathen. The sacraments, therefore, are
   "badges of Christian men's profession." This doctrine, however,
   attributes to them no other than what Zwingle calls in the passage
   above quoted, "an objective power;" that is, the objective presentation
   of the truth which they signify to the mind.

   "Ex quibus hoc colligitur sacramenta dari in testimonium publicum ejus
   gratiæ, quæ cuique privato prius adest. . . . . Ob hanc causam
   sacramenta, quæ sacræ sunt cerimoniæ (accedit enim verbum ad elementum
   et fit sacramentum), religiose colenda, hoc est in precio habenda, et
   honorifice tractanda sunt, ut enim gratiam facere non possunt, Ecclesiæ
   tamen nos visibiliter sociant, qui prius invisibiliter sumus in illam
   recepti, quod cum simul cum promissionis divinæ verbis in ipsorum
   actione pronunciatur ac promulgatur, summa religione suscipiendum est."
   [482] In his treatise on true and false religion, Zwingle says:
   "Impossibile est, ut res aliqua externa fidem hominis internam
   confirmet et stabiliat." [483] And again he says [484] that the
   sacraments as other memorials can only produce historical, but not
   religious faith. Zwingle in the use of such language, had doubtless
   more a negative, than an affirmative object before his mind. He was
   more intent on denying the Romish doctrine of the inherent power of the
   sacraments, than of asserting anything of their real efficacy.
   Nevertheless it is true that Zwingle has ever been regarded as holding
   the lowest doctrine concerning the sacraments of any of the Reformers.
   They were to him no more means of grace than the rainbow or the heaps
   of stone on the banks of the Jordan. By their significancy and by
   association they might suggest truth and awaken feeling, but they were
   not channels of divine communication.

   Doctrine of the Reformed Church.

   The first point clearly taught on this subject in the Symbols of the
   Reformed Church is that the sacraments are real means of grace, that
   is, means appointed and employed by Christ for conveying the benefits
   of his redemption to his people. They are not, as Romanists teach, the
   exclusive channels; but they are channels. A promise is made to those
   who rightly receive the sacraments that they shall thereby and therein
   be made partakers of the blessings of which the sacraments are the
   divinely appointed signs and seals. The word grace, when we speak of
   the means of grace, includes three things. 1st. An unmerited gift, such
   as the remission of sin. 2d. The supernatural influence of the Holy
   Spirit. 3d. The subjective effects of that influence on the soul.
   Faith, hope, and charity, for example, are graces.

   The second point in the Reformed doctrine on the sacraments concerns
   the source of their power. On this subject it is taught negatively that
   the virtue is not in them. The word virtue is of course here used in
   its Latin sense for power or efficiency. What is denied is that the
   sacraments are the efficient cause of the gracious effects which they
   produce. The efficiency does not reside in the elements, in the water
   used in baptism, or in the bread and wine used in the Lord's Supper. It
   is not in the sacramental actions; either in giving, or in receiving
   the consecrated elements. Neither does the virtue or efficiency due to
   sacraments reside in, or flow from the person by whom they are
   administered. It does not reside in his office. There is no
   supernatural power in the man, in virtue of his office, to render the
   sacraments effectual. Nor does their efficiency depend on the character
   of the administrator in the sight of God; nor upon his intention; that
   is, his purpose to render them effectual. The man who administers the
   sacraments is not a worker of miracles. The Apostles and others at that
   time in the Church, were endued with supernatural power; and they had
   to will to exercise it in order to its producing its legitimate effect.
   It is not so with the officers of the Church in the administration of
   the sacraments. The affirmative statement on this subject is, that the
   efficacy of the sacraments is due solely to the blessing of Christ and
   the working of his Spirit. The Spirit, it is to be ever remembered, is
   a personal agent who works when and how He will. God has promised that
   his Spirit shall attend his Word; and He thus renders it an effectual
   means for the sanctification of his people. So He has promised, through
   the attending operation of his Spirit, to render the sacraments
   effectual to the same end.

   The third point included in the Reformed doctrine is, that the
   sacraments are effectual as means of grace only, so far as adults are
   concerned, to those who by faith receive them. They may have a natural
   power on other than believers by presenting truth and exciting feeling,
   but their saving or sanctifying influence is experienced only by
   believers.

   All these points are clearly presented in the standards of our own
   Church. The sacraments are declared to be means of grace, that is,
   means for signifying, sealing, and applying the benefits of redemption.
   It is denied that this virtue is in them, or in him by whom they are
   administered. It is affirmed that their efficiency in conveying grace,
   is due solely to the blessing of Christ and the coöperation of his
   Spirit; and that such efficiency is experienced only by believers. Thus
   in the Shorter Catechism, the sacraments are said to be holy ordinances
   "instituted by Christ; wherein, by sensible signs, Christ and the
   benefits of the new covenant are represented, sealed, and applied to
   believers." [485] In the Larger Catechism the sacraments are said to be
   instituted "to signify, seal, and exhibit unto those that are within
   the covenant of grace, the benefits of his [Christ's] mediation." [486]
   The word "exhibit," as here used, means to confer, or impart, as the
   Latin word "exhibere" also sometimes means. That such is the sense of
   the word in our standards, is plain because the exhibition here spoken
   of is confined to those within the covenant; and because this word is
   interchanged and explained by the word "confer." Thus in the Confession
   of Faith [487] it is said, "The grace which is exhibited in, or by the
   sacraments, rightly used, is not conferred by any virtue in them." And
   again, [488] that by the right use of baptism "the grace promised is
   not only offered, but really exhibited and conferred by the Holy Ghost,
   to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto,
   according to the counsel of God's own will, in his appointed time."
   With this view of the sacraments as means of grace all the other
   leading symbols of the Reformed Churches agree. Thus the First Helvetic
   Confession [489] says, "Asserimus, sacramenta non solum tesseras
   quasdam societatis Christianæ, sed et gratiæ divinæ symbola esse,
   quibus ministri, Domino, ad eum finem, quem ipse promittit, offert et
   efficit, cooperentur." The Gallican Confession says: "Fatemur talia
   esse signa hæc exteriora, ut Deus per illa Sancti sui Spiritus virtute,
   operetur, ne quicquam ibi frustra nobis significetur." [490] In the
   Geneva Catechism [491] it is said: "Quid est sacramentum? Externa
   divinæ erga nos benevolentiæ testificatio, quæ visibili signo
   spirituales gratias figurat, ad obsignandos cordibus nostris Dei
   promissiones, quo earum veritas melius confirmetur. . . . . Vim
   efficaciamque sacramenti non in externo elemento inclusam esse
   existimas, sed totam a Spiritu Dei manare? Sic sentio: nempe, ut
   virtutem suam exerere Domino placuerit per sua organa, quem in finem ea
   destinavit." The language of the Belgic Confession [492] is to the same
   effect: "Sunt enim sacramenta signa, ac symbola visibilia rerum
   internarum et invisibilium, per quæ, ceu per media, Deus ipse virtute
   Spiritus Sancti in nobis operatur. Itaque signa illa minime vana sunt,
   ant vacua: nec ad nos decipiendos aut frustrandos instituta."

   These symbols of the Reformed Churches on the continent of Europe agree
   with those of our own Church, not only in representing the sacraments
   as real means of grace, but also in denying that their efficacy is due
   to their inherent virtue, or to him who administers them, and in
   affirming that it is due to the attending operation of the Spirit, and
   is conditioned on the presence of faith in the recipient. This is plain
   from the quotations already made, which might be multiplied
   indefinitely. On this point Calvin says: "Neque sacramenta hilum
   proficere sine Spiritu Sancti virtute." And again: "Spiritus Sanctus
   (quem non omnibus promiscue sacramenta advehunt, sed quem Dominus
   peculiariter suis confert) is est qui Dei gratias secum affert, qui dat
   sacramentis in nobis locum, qui efficit ut fructificent." [493] Guerike
   [494] gives as one of the main points of difference between the
   Lutherans and Reformed on this subject, that the latter deny the
   inherent power of the sacraments, and insist that the "virtus Spiritus
   Sancti extrinsecus accidens" is the source of all their sanctifying
   influence.

   There is, therefore, a strict analogy, according to the Reformed
   doctrine, between the Word and the sacraments as means of grace. (1.)
   Both have in them a certain moral power due to the truth which they
   bring before the mind. (2.) Neither has in itself any supernatural
   power to save or to sanctify. (3.) All their supernatural efficiency is
   due to the coöperation or attending influence of the Holy Spirit. (4.)
   Both are ordained by God to be the channels or means of the Spirit's
   influence, to those who by faith receive them. Nothing is said in the
   Bible to place the sacraments above the Word as a means of
   communicating to men the benefits of Christ's redemption. On the
   contrary, tenfold more is said in Scripture of the necessity and
   efficiency of the Word in the salvation of men, than is therein said or
   implied of the power of the sacraments.

   Besides the points already referred to as characteristic of the
   Reformed doctrine on the sacraments, there is a fourth, which is, that
   the grace or spiritual benefits received by believers in the use of the
   sacraments, may be attained without their use. This, however may
   perhaps be more properly considered, when the necessity of the
   sacraments comes under consideration.

   The Lutheran Doctrine.

   There are two points specially insisted upon by Lutherans in reference
   to the efficacy of the sacraments. The first is, the absolute necessity
   of faith in order to any real sanctifying or saving benefit being
   derived from the use of those ordinances. On this point they are in
   perfect accord with the Reformed. Hase is right when he says that the
   idea, "That a sacrament can confer saving benefit without faith is
   utterly destructive of Protestantism." [495] Augustine had long ago
   taught the doctrine, "Unde ista tanta virtus aquæ, ut corpus tangat, et
   cor abluat, nisi faciente verbo: non quia dicitur, sed quia creditur."
   [496] And Bernard of Clairvaux says: "Sacramentum enim sine re
   sacramenti sumenti mors est: res vero sacramenti, etiam, præter
   sacramentum, sumenti vita æterna est." [497]

   The Lutheran symbols on this point are perfectly explicit. In the
   "Augsburg Confession" [498] it is said: "Itaque utendum est sacramentum
   ita, ut fides accedat, quæ credat promissionibus, quæ per sacramenta
   exhibentur et ostenduntur. Damnant igitur illos, qui docent, quod
   sacramenta, ex opere operato justificent, nec docent fidem requiri in
   usu sacramentorum, quæ credat remitti peccata."

   In the "Apology for the Augsburg Confession" [499] it is said.
   "Damnamus totum populum scholasticorum doctorum, qui docent, quod
   sacramenta non ponenti obicem conferant gratiam ex opere operato, sine
   bono motu utentis. Hæc simpliciter Judaica opinio est, sentire, quod
   per ceremoniam justificemur, sine bono motu cordis, hoc est, sine
   fide. . . . . At sacramenta sunt signa promissionum. Igitur in usu
   debet accedere fides. . . . . Loquimur hic de fide speciali, quæ
   præsenti promissioni credit, non tantum quæ in genere credit Deum esse,
   sed quæ credit offerri remissionem peccatoram."

   The second point in the doctrine of Lutherans in regard to the efficacy
   of the sacraments is one in which they differ from the Reformed, and as
   Guerike, himself a strenuous Lutheran, correctly says, approximate to
   the Romanists. They hold that the efficacy of the sacraments is due to
   their own inherent virtue or power; a power independent, on the one
   hand, of the attendant influences of the Spirit (extrinsecus accidens),
   and, on the other hand, of the faith of the recipient. Faith, indeed,
   is necessary to any saving or sanctifying effect, but that is only a
   subjective condition on which the beneficial operation of the power,
   inherent in the sacraments, is suspended. Bellarmin's illustration is
   applicable to the Lutheran doctrine as well as to his own. Fire will
   not cause wood to burn unless the wood be dry; but its dryness does not
   give fire its power. Luther's own favourite illustration was drawn from
   the case of the woman who touched the Saviour's garment. There was
   inherent healing virtue in Christ. Those who touched him without faith
   received no benefit. The woman having faith was healed the moment she
   touched the hem of his garment. Her faith, however, was in no sense the
   source of the power which resided in Christ. Guerike complains that the
   Reformed teach that "the visible signs do not as such convey any
   invisible divine grace; that without the sacraments the Christian may
   enjoy through faith the same divine gifts which the sacraments are
   intended to convey, and hence do not admit their absolute necessity,
   much less that they are the central point of the Christian method of
   salvation (der christlichen Heilsanstalt)." [500]

   Luther did not at first hold this inherent power of the sacraments, but
   seemed disposed to adopt even the low views of Zwingle. In his work on
   the Babylonish Captivity he says, "Baptismus neminem justificat, nec
   ulli prodest, sed fides in verbum promissionis, cui additur
   baptismus. . . . . Nec verum esse potest, sacramentis inesse vim
   efficacem justificationis seu esse signa efficacia gratiæ." [501]
   Melancthon uses much the same language: "Non justificant signa, ut
   Apostolus ait, Circumcisio nihil est: ita baptismus nihil est.
   Participatio mensæ Domini nihil est: sed testes sunt kai sphragides
   divinæ voluntatis erga te, quibus conscientia tua certa reddatur, si de
   gratia, de benevolentia Dei erga se dubitet. . . . . Quæ alii
   sacramenta, nos signa appellamus, aut si ita libet, signa
   sacramentalia. Nam sacramentum ipsum Christum Paulus vocat." [502]
   "Hinc apparet, quam nihil signa sint, nisi fidei exercendæ mnemosuna."
   [503]

   As, however, Luther understood our Lord's words in John iii 6, as
   teaching the necessity of baptism, he inferred that if the sacrament is
   necessary to salvation it must have saving power. But as the Bible
   teaches that no one can be saved without faith, he held that the
   sacraments could have no saving effect unless the recipient was a
   believer. We have thus the two essential elements of the Lutheran
   doctrine of the sacraments; they have inherent, saving, sanctifying
   power; but that power takes effect for good only upon believers.

   The necessity of faith is clearly stated in the passages already quoted
   from the "Augsburg Confession" and the "Apology;" the inherent power of
   the sacraments in opposition to the Reformed doctrine is as clearly
   taught in the Lutheran standards. Both points are included in some of
   the proof passages which follow. Guerike says: "It is undoubtedly the
   Lutheran, in opposition to the Reformed doctrine of virtus Spiritus
   sancti extrinsecus accedens,' that the grace is in, and not merely with
   or by (mit oder neben), the sacraments." [504] He refers to the
   language of Luther in his Larger Catechism in reference to baptism.
   Luther says: "Interrogatus, quid baptismus sit? ita responde: non esse
   prorsus aquam simplicem, sed ejusmodi, quæ verbo et præcepto Dei
   comprehensa, et illi inclusa sit, et per hoc sanctificata ita ut nihil
   aliud sit, quam Dei seu divina aqua." He adds, however, "non quod aqua
   hæc per sese quavis alia sit præstantior, sed quod ei verbum ac
   præceptum Dei accesserit. Quocirca mera sycophantia est et diaboli
   illusio, quod hodie nostri novi spiritus, ut blasphement et contumelia
   afficiant baptismum, verbum et institutionem Dei ab eo divellunt, nec
   aliter intuentur eum, quam aquam e putreo haustam ac deinceps ita
   blasphemo ore blaterant: Quid vero utilitatis manus aquæ plena
   præstaret animæ? Quis vero adeo vecors et inops animi est, qui hoc
   ignoret, divulsis baptismi partibus, aquam esse aquam? Qua vero fronte
   tu tibi tantum sumis, ut non verearis ab ordinatione Dei pretiosissimum
   keimelion avellere, quo Deus illam constrinxit et inclusit, neque inde
   divelli vult aut sejungi? Quippe verbum Dei, aut præceptum, item nomen
   Dei, in aqua ipse solet esse nucleus, qui thesaurus ipso coelo et terra
   omnibus modis nobilior est et præstantior." [505]

   Lutherans are wont to refer to the analogy between the Word and
   sacraments. The difference between them and the Reformed as to the
   sacraments, is analogous to the difference between the two churches as
   to the Word. The Reformed refer the supernatural power of the Word, not
   to the literal Word as written or spoken; not to the mere moral truth
   therein revealed, but to the coöperation, or as Paul calls it, the
   demonstration, of the Spirit. The Lutherans, on the other hand, teach
   that there is inherent in the divine Word (not in the letters or the
   sound but in the truth), a supernatural, divine virtue, inseparable
   from it, and independent of its use; and which is the same to believers
   and unbelievers; sanctifying and saving the former, because of their
   faith, and not benefiting the latter, because of their voluntary
   resistance. So the sacraments have an inherent, divine power, certain
   of producing saving effects, if they meet with faith in those who
   receive them. "The Lutheran Church," says Guerike, "regards the
   sacraments as actions, wherein God, through external signs by Him
   appointed, offers and confers his invisible and heavenly gifts; they
   see in the sacraments visible signs, which in virtue of the divine word
   of promise pronounced over them, in such sense contain the invisible
   divine gifts they signify, that they communicate them (mittheilen) to
   all who partake of them, although only to believers to their good."
   [506]

   This inherent divine virtue of the sacraments does not reside in the
   elements; nor does it flow from him who administers them; nor is it due
   to the concurrent operation of the Holy Spirit; but to the Word. The
   elements employed are in themselves mere elements; with the Word, they
   are divinely efficacious, because the divine Word, wherever it is, is
   fraught with this divine, supernatural, saving, and sanctifying power
   which always takes effect on those who have faith to receive it

   Dr. Schmid of Erlangen, however, admits that there is a difference of
   view on this subject, between the earlier and later theologians of his
   Church. The former made the sacrament consist of the element and the
   Word, and referred its supernatural effect to the inherent divine power
   of the latter, agreeably to Luther's representation in his Larger
   Catechism, where, when speaking of baptism, he says, in words already
   quoted: "non tantum naturalis aqua sed etiam divina, coelestis, sancta
   et salutifera aqua (est) . . . . hocque nonnisi verbi gratia, quod
   coeleste ac sanctum verbum est." The later theologians, however, from
   the time of Gerhard, did not make the sacrament consist of the element
   and the Word; but of something terrestrial and something celestial. The
   former is the element or external symbol, "quod est res corporea
   visibilis . . . . ordinata ad hoc, ut sit rei coelestis vehiculum et
   medium exhibitivum." The latter, or "res coelestis," is "res
   invisibilis et intelligibilis, re terrena visibili, tanquam medio
   divinitus ordinato exhibita, a qua fructus sacramenti principaliter
   dependet." According to this view the efficacy of the sacrament does
   not depend upon the Word, but upon this "res coelestis," of which the
   "res terrena" is the vehicle and medium. The office of the Word is to
   unite the two. It is called the "aition poietikon, hoc est, efficere,
   ut duæ illæ partes essentiales unum sacramentum constituant in usu
   sacramentorum." [507] This doctrine of the later Lutherans is attended
   with serious difficulties. It brings them into conflict with Luther and
   Lutherans of the older school who are strenuous in referring the
   efficacy of the sacraments to the Word. The elements without the Word,
   are mere elements. It is the Word in which the supernatural power
   resides which produces the effect the sacrament is intended to
   accomplish. But according to this later view there are in the
   sacraments two things, the sign and the thing signified; a "res
   terrena" and a "res coelestis." They are so united that where the one
   is given and received by faith, the other is received. This "res
   coelestis," however, is not the Word. In the case of the eucharist, for
   example, it is the real body and blood of Christ, and these being
   inseparably united with his soul and divinity, it is this marvellous
   gift, and not the Word, which makes the Lord's Supper the
   life-sustaining food of the soul.

   So far as the efficacy of the sacraments is concerned, the main point
   of difference between the Lutherans and the Reformed is, that the
   latter attribute their sanctifying power to the attending influences of
   the Spirit; the former to the inherent, supernatural power of the Word
   which is an essential part of these divine ordinances. Even on this
   point Chemnitz expresses himself in a way to which any Reformed
   theologian may assent. "Recte Apologia Augustanæ confessionis dicit,
   eundem esse effectum, eandem virtutem, seu efficaciam, et verbi et
   sacramentorum, quæ sunt sigilla promissionum. . . . . Sicut igitur
   Evangelium est potentia Dei ad salutem omni credenti: non quod magica
   quædam vis characteribus, syllabis, aut sono verborum inhæreat, sed
   quia est medium, organon seu instrumentum, per quod Spiritus Sanctus
   efficax est, proponens, offerens, exhibens, distribuens et applicans
   meritum Christi, et gratiam Dei, ad salutem omni credenti: ita etiam
   sacramentis tribuitur vis et efficacia: non quod in sacramentis extra
   sen præter meritum Christi, misericordiam Patris, et efficaciam
   Spiritus Sancti, quærenda sit gratia ad salutem; sed sacramenta sunt
   causæ instrumentales ita, quod per illa media seu organa, Pater vult
   gratiam suam exhibere, donare, applicare: Filius meritum suum
   communicare credentibus: Spiritus Sanctus efficaciam suam exercere, ad
   salutem omni credenti." [508]

   The Lutheran doctrine as generally presented and as stated above,
   stands opposed, (1.) To the doctrine of the Romanists which denies the
   necessity of a living faith in the recipient in order to his
   experiencing the efficacy of the sacraments; and which not only
   represents them as imbued with an inherent power, but also teaches that
   they confer grace "ex opere operato." (2.) To the doctrine which makes
   the sacraments merely badges of a Christian profession. (3.) To the
   doctrine which represents them as mere allegories or significant
   exhibitions of truth. (4.) To the doctrine which regards them as merely
   commemorative, as a portrait or monument may be. (5.) To the doctrine
   which denies to them inherent efficacy and refers their sanctifying
   influence to the accompanying power of the Holy Spirit; and (6.) To the
   doctrine which assumes that they confer nothing which may not be
   obtained by faith without them. In all these points, with the exception
   of the last two, Lutherans and Reformed are agreed.

   Doctrine of the Church of Rome on the Efficacy of the Sacraments.

   It has already been stated that the Romanists teach, (1.) That the
   sacraments contain the grace which they signify. (2.) That they convey
   that grace "ex opere operato." (3.) That there is a certain efficacy
   common to all the sacraments. They all convey grace, i.e., "gratia
   gratum faciens, sanctificans;" and besides this common influence, in
   baptism, confirmation, and orders, there is conveyed an indelible
   character (quoddam indelebile) in virtue of which they can never be
   repeated. (4.) That the conditions of the efficacy of the sacraments on
   the part of the administrator are, first, that he have authority (this
   is limited in its application to baptism); and second, that he have the
   intention of doing what the Church designs to be done; and in regard to
   the recipient, that he does not oppose an obstacle. The sacraments are
   declared to be effectual "non ponentibus obicem."

   In what Sense do the Sacraments contain Grace?

   By this is meant that they possess in them inherent virtue of rendering
   holy those to whom they are administered. Their power in the sphere of
   religion is analogous to that of articles of the "materia medica" in
   the sphere of physics. Some have a narcotic power; some act on one
   organ and some on another; some are stimulants, and some are sedatives.
   Or to refer to the illustration so familiar with Bellarmin; the
   inherent virtue of the sacraments to confer grace, is analogous to that
   of fire to burn. Fire produces combustion because it is ordained by God
   and imbued with power to that end. The sacraments confer grace because
   they are endowed with grace-imparting efficacy and are ordained by God
   for that purpose. "Containing grace and "conferring grace" "virtute
   sibi insita," are explanatory forms of expression. The sacraments are
   said to contain grace because they confer it by their inherent virtue.
   This is intended as a denial that their efficacy is due to the moral,
   or to the supernatural power of the truth; or to the attending
   influences of the Spirit, or to the subjective state of those who
   receive them.

   As to the peculiar effect ascribed to baptism, confirmation, and
   orders, little is said. These sacraments are never repeated. For this
   some reason was to be assigned, and, therefore, it was assumed that
   they left an indelible impression on the soul. What that is, cannot be
   stated further than by saying that it is a "Signum quoddam spirituale
   et indelebile in anima impressum. Qui eo insigniti sunt, deputantur ad
   recipienda vel tradenda aliis ea, quæ pertinent ad cultum Dei." [509]
   The language of the Council of Trent sheds no light on the subject. It
   simply says: [510] "Si quis dixerit, in tribus sacramentis, baptismo
   scilicet confirmatione, et ordine, non imprimi characterem in anima,
   hoc est signum quoddam spirituale et indelebile, unde ea iterari non
   possunt; anathema sit." The only passages of Scripture referred to by
   Perrone in support of this assumption, are 2 Corinthians i. 22, and
   Ephesians i. 13, in which the Apostle speaks of all believers being
   sealed by the Holy Spirit. In those passages there is not the slightest
   reference to any sacramental impression. In the second part of the
   Roman Catechism in answer to the question, What "character" in this
   connection signifies, it is said that it is something which cannot be
   removed, and which renders the soul fit to receive or to perform
   certain spiritual benefits or functions. Thus in baptism a certain
   something is impressed upon the soul by which it is prepared to receive
   the benefit of other sacraments, and by which it is distinguished from
   the souls of the unbaptized. In confirmation the soul is marked as a
   soldier of Christ and prepared to contend against all spiritual
   enemies. In orders something is received which fits the recipient to
   administer the sacraments, and which distinguishes him from all other
   Christians.

   Ex Opere Operato.

   The Council of Trent anathematizes, as we have seen, not only those who
   deny that the sacraments convey grace, but also those who deny that
   they convey it "ex opere operato." The meaning of this phrase is
   intelligible enough if left unexplained. It has been obscured by the
   explanations given by Romanists themselves, as well as by the
   conflicting views of Protestants on the subject. To say that the
   sacraments contain grace; that they convey it "virtute sibi insita,"
   that they convey it "ex opere operato," all amount to the same thing.
   The simple meaning is that such is the nature of the sacraments that,
   when duly administered, they produce a given effect. There is no
   necessity and no propriety in looking beyond them to account for the
   effect produced. If you place a coal of fire on a man's hand, it
   produces a certain effect. That effect follows without fail. It follows
   from the very nature of the thing done and from the act of doing it. It
   makes no difference, whether we say that the coal contains heat; or,
   that it burns in virtue of its inherent nature; or that the effect is
   produced "ex opere operato."

   Of course there are certain conditions necessary in order to the
   production of the effect. The hand must be alive, otherwise it is not
   the hand of a man; it is simply a lump of clay. There must be no
   obstacle. If you interpose a porcelain plate between the coal and the
   hand, the hand will not be burnt. The coal must be ignited, not simply
   a piece of carbon. So the thing done must be a real sacrament. It must
   have everything essential to the integrity of the ordinance. The coal,
   in the case supposed, must be brought into contact with the hand; but
   whether it be placed there by the use of a silver spoon, or of a pair
   of iron tongs, makes no difference. So it makes no difference whether
   the priest who administers the sacrament be a good man or a bad man,
   whether he be orthodox or heretical. He must, however, do the thing;
   and he cannot do it without intending to do it. If the man's hand is to
   be burnt, in a given time and place, the coal must be intentionally
   placed upon it.

   Although the doctrine of the Church of Rome as to the way in which the
   sacraments convey grace, seems to be thus simple, there is no little
   apparent diversity among the theologians of that Church in their views
   on the subject. This diversity, however, is really more in the mode of
   stating the doctrine, than in the doctrine itself. Lutherans agree with
   Romanists in denying that the efficacy of the sacraments is due to the
   attending influences of the Holy Spirit; and they agree with them in
   attributing to them an inherent supernatural power. The main point of
   difference between them is that the Lutherans insist on the presence
   and exercise of faith in the recipient. According to them the
   sacraments convey grace only to believers. Whereas Romanists, as
   understood by Lutherans and indeed by all Protestants, deny this
   necessity of faith or of good dispositions in order to the due efficacy
   of the sacraments. This, however, Bellarmin pronounces a deliberate
   falsehood on the part of the Protestants; and he uses language on this
   subject which Luther himself might have employed, "Est merum
   mendacium," he says, "quod Catholici dicant, sacramenta prodesse
   peccatoribus: omnes enim Catholici requirunt poenitentiam, tanquam
   dispositionem ad gratiam rocipiendam" "Falsum est Catholicos non habere
   pro obice incredulitatem: omnes enim Catholici requirunt necessario in
   adultis actualem fidem, et sine ea dicunt neminem justificari." [511]
   "Voluntas, fides, et poenitentia in suscipiento adulto necessario
   requiruntur, ut dispositiones ex parte subjecti, non ut causæ activæ:
   non enim fides et poenitentia efficiunt gratiam sacramentalem, neque
   dant efficaciam sacramento; sed solum tollunt obstacula quæ impedirent,
   ne sacramenta suam efficaciam exercere possent; unde in pueris, ubi non
   requiritur dispositio, sine his rebus fit justificatio." [512] Luther
   would not agree with this last clause about infants; but to the rest of
   the paragraph he could hardly object. Then follows in Bellarmin the
   illustration quoted above. [513] Fire does not owe its efficacy to the
   dryness of the wood; nevertheless the dryness is a necessary condition
   of combustion.

   In another passage Bellarmin is still more explicit: "Igitur ut
   intelligamus, quid sit opus operatum, notandum est, in justificatione,
   quam recipit aliquis, dum percipit sacramenta, multa concurrere;
   nimirum ex parte Dei, voluntatem utendi illa re sensibili; ex parte
   Christi, passionem ejus; ex parte ministri potestatem, voluntatem,
   probitatem; ex parte suscipientis voluntatem, fidem, et poenitentiam;
   denique ex parte sacramenti ipsam actionem externam, quæ consurgit, ex
   debita applicatione formæ et materiæ. Cæterum ex his omnibus id, quod
   active, et proxime atque instrumentaliter efficit gratiam
   justificationis, est sola actio illa externa, quæ sacramentum dicitur,
   et hæc vocatur opus operatum, accipiendo passive (operatum) ita ut idem
   sit sacramentum conferre gratiam ex opere operato, quod conferre
   gratiam ex [vi] ipsius actionis sacramentalis a Deo ad hoc institutæ,
   non ex merito agentis vel suscipientis." [514]

   Notwithstanding all this the Romanists do teach the very doctrine which
   the Reformers charged upon them, and which the Protestant Symbols so
   strenuously condemn. This is clear, --

   1. Because the same words do not always mean the same thing. Bellarmin
   says that Romanists teach that faith on the part of the recipient is
   necessary in order to the efficacy of the sacraments, at least in the
   case of adults. Protestants say the same thing; and yet their meaning
   is entirely different. By faith, Protestants mean saving faith; that
   faith which is one of the fruits of the Spirit, which, if a man has,
   his salvation is certain. Romanists, however, mean by faith mere
   assent, which a man may have, and be in a state of condemnation, and
   perish forever. This is their formal definition of faith, as given by
   Bellarmin himself; and the Council of Trent pronounces accursed those
   who say that the assent given by unrenewed men to the truth, is not
   true faith. Romanists do not hold that sacraments convey grace to
   avowed atheists or professed infidels; but that they exert saving power
   on those having the kind of faith in the Church which the bandits of
   Italy profess and cherish. So also the repentance required is not the
   godly sorrow of which the Apostle speaks, but that remorse which wicked
   men often experience. These points have been abundantly proved in the
   preceding pages. [515] A coal of fire will burn a man's hand; it is
   true the man must be alive, but whether he is a good or bad man makes
   no difference. The sacraments confer grace by their inherent efficacy.
   It is true the recipient must be a believer; but whether he has what
   St. Peter calls "the precious faith of God's elect," or the same kind
   of faith that Simon Magus had, makes no difference.

   2. That this is the true doctrine of the Church of Rome is evident from
   the manner in which it is presented by its leading theologians. This
   appears from the great distinction which they make between the
   sacraments of the Old, and those of the New Testament. The former only
   signified, the latter confer grace. The latter are effectual "ex opere
   operato;" the former, as Thomas Aquinas says, were effectual only "ex
   fide et devotione suscipientis." Again, the necessity of anything good
   in the recipient is expressly denied. Thus Gabriel Biel ( 1495) says
   "Sacramentum dicitur conferre gratiam ex opere operato, ita quod ex eo
   ipso, quod opus illud, puta sacramentum, exhibitur, nisi impediat obex
   peccati mortalis, gratia confertur utentibus, sic quod præter
   exhibitionem signi foris exhibiti non requiritur bonus motus seu
   devotio interior in suscipiente." [516] In like manner also Duns Scotus
   declares, [517] "præter istam (primam causam meritoriam sc. Christum)
   non oportet dare aliam intrinsecam in recipiente, qua conjungatur Deo,
   antequam recipiat gratiam;" and Petrus de Palude, [518] "In sacramentis
   novæ legis non per se requiritur, quod homo se disponat: ergo per ipsum
   sacramentum disponitur." The later Romish theologians teach the same
   doctrine. Thus Klee [519] says that the sacraments, when rightly
   dispensed, are of necessity effectual. And Moehler says: "The Catholic
   Church teaches that the sacrament works in us, in virtue of its
   character as an ordinance of Christ, appointed for our salvation (ex
   opere operato, scl. a Christo,' instead of quod operatus est
   Christus'), i.e., the sacraments bring from the Saviour a divine power,
   which can be caused by no human frame of mind (Stimmung), nor by any
   spiritual state or effort, but which is given by God for Christ's sake
   directly in the sacrament." [520] It is true, he immediately adds, "Man
   must receive them, and must be susceptible of their impression, and
   this susceptibility expresses itself in repentance, in sorrow for sin,
   in longing for divine help, and in trusting faith; nevertheless he can
   only receive them, and hence only have the requisite susceptibility."
   All this, however, according to the Romish system, the unrenewed man
   has, or may have. In the case of infants there is nothing but
   passivity: simple non-resistance; and this is all that is required in
   the case of adults.

   3. One of the points of controversy between the Jansenists and Jesuits
   related to this very subject. The Jansenists maintained that the
   efficacy of the sacraments depended on the inward state of the
   recipient. If he were not in a state of grace, and in the exercise of
   faith when they were received, they availed nothing. This doctrine the
   Jesuits controverted, and their influence prevailed in the Church.
   Jansenism was condemned and suppressed.

   4. Another argument is derived from the constant practice of the Romish
   Church. There is no pretence of her recognized ministers demanding the
   profession, or evidence of what Protestants understand by saving faith
   in order to the reception of the sacraments, or as the condition of
   their sanctifying influence. On the contrary, they act on the
   principle, that the sacraments confer grace in the first instance. They
   baptize crowds of uninstructed heathen, without the slightest pretence
   that they are penitents or believers. If faith be a fruit of
   regeneration, and if, as Romanists all teach, regeneration is effected
   in baptism, how can the presence of faith in the recipient be a
   condition of the efficacy of baptism. [521]

   The Administrator.

   Lutherans and Reformed agree in teaching, first, that the efficacy of
   the sacraments does not depend on anything in him who administers them;
   and second, that as the ministry of the Word and sacraments are united
   in the Scriptures, it is a matter of order and propriety that the
   sacraments should be administered by those only who have been duly
   called and appointed to that service. In the Second Helvetic
   Confession, [522] therefore, it is said, "Baptismus pertinet ad officia
   ecclesiastica." According to the Westminster Confession, [523] "There
   be only two sacraments ordained by Christ our Lord in the Gospel. That
   is to say, baptism and the supper of the Lord: neither of which may be
   dispensed by any, but by a minister of the Word, lawfully ordained."

   The doctrine of the Lutheran Church is thus stated by Hollaz: "Jus
   dispensandi sacramenta Deus concredidit ecclesiæ, quæ exsecutionem aut
   exercitium hujus juris, observandi ordinis et euschemosunes causa
   commendavit ministris verbi divini vocatis et ordinatis. In casu autem
   extremæ necessitatis, ubi sacramentum est necessarium nec nisi periculo
   salutis omitti potest, quilibet homo Christianus (laicus aut femina)
   sacramentum initiationis valide celebrare potest." [524] This is
   considered as not inconsistent with the Augsburg Confession, which
   says: [525] "De ordine ecclesiastico docent, quod nemo debeat in
   ecclesia publice docere, aut sacramenta administrare, nisi rite
   vocatus."

   The doctrine of the Church of Rome on this subject is briefly stated in
   the canons enacted during the seventh session of the Council of Trent.
   [526] We read thus: "Si quis dixerit, Christianos omnes in verbo, et
   omnibus sacramentis administrandis habere potestatem; anathema sit."
   The Council say in "all" the sacraments; for the Church of Rome,
   although denying the power of any but canonically ordained priests to
   render the administration of the sacraments efficacious, admits of the
   efficacy of lay baptism. Again, "Si quis dixerit, in ministris, dum
   sacramentis conficiunt, et conferunt, non requiri intentionem saltem
   faciendi, quod facit ecclesia; anathema sit." Intention is defined to
   be the purpose of doing what Christ ordained and what the Church is
   accustomed to do. On this subject Bellarmin says, (1.) It is not
   necessary (in baptism at least) that the administrator should have an
   intelligent intention of doing what the Church does; for he may be
   ignorant of the doctrine of the Church; all that is required is that he
   intend to administer a Church ordinance. (2.) It is not necessary that
   he intend to do what the Church of Rome does; but what the true Church,
   whatever that may be, is accustomed to do. Hence, he says, the Catholic
   Church does not rebaptize those who have been baptized by the Geneva
   churches. "Non tollit efficaciam sacramenti error ministri circa
   ecclesiam, sed do fectus intentionis." (3.) That not actual intention,
   but only virtual, is required. "Virtualis dicitur, cum actualis
   intentio in præsenti non adest ob aliquam evagationem mentis, tamen
   paulo ante adfuit et in virtute illius sit operatio." [527] On this
   account the Roman Catechism says, that baptism administered by a
   heretic, a Jew, or a heathen, is efficacious: "Si id efficere
   propositum eis fuerit, quod ecclesia Catholica in eo administrationis
   genere efficit." [528] This agrees with the popular view of the
   doctrine of intention. The administrator must intend to produce the
   effect which the sacrament was designed to accomplish. If he baptizes,
   he must intend to regenerate; if he absolves, he must intend to
   absolve; if he consecrates the bread and wine, he must intend their
   transmutation; if he offers the host, he must intend it as a sacrifice;
   and if offered for a particular person, he must intend it to take
   effect for his benefit. According to this view everything depends on
   the will of the officiating priest.

   § 5. The Necessity of the Sacraments.

   The distinction between the necessity of precept and the necessity of
   means, is obvious and important. No one would be willing to say,
   without qualification, that it is unnecessary to obey an explicit
   command of Christ. And as He has commanded his disciples to baptize all
   who are received as members of his Church, in the name of the Father,
   of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and required his disciples statedly
   to commemorate his death by the celebration of the Lord's Supper, the
   strongest moral obligation rests upon his people to obey these
   commands. But the obligation to obey any command, such as to observe
   the Sabbath, to visit the sick, and to relieve the poor, depends on
   circumstances. No opportunity may be offered; or the discharge of the
   duty may be hindered by external circumstances; or we may lack the
   ability to render the service required. So with regard to the command
   to be baptized and to commemorate the Lord's death at his table, it is
   evident that many circumstances may occur to prevent obedience even on
   the part of those who have the disposition and purpose to do whatever
   their Lord requires at their hands. And even where obedience is not
   prevented by external circumstances, it may be prevented by ignorance,
   or by unfounded scruples of conscience.

   By the necessity of means is usually understood an absolute necessity,
   a "sine qua non." In this sense food is a necessity of life; light is
   necessary to the exercise of vision; the Word is necessary to the
   exercise of faith, for it is its object, the thing which is to be
   believed; and faith is, on the part of adults, necessary to salvation,
   for it is the act of receiving the grace of God offered in the Bible.
   And therefore times almost without number, it is said in Scripture,
   that we are saved by faith, that he that believeth shall be saved, and
   that he that believeth not shall not see life.

   The question between the Reformed on the one hand, and Lutherans and
   Romanists on the other, is in which of these senses are the sacraments
   necessary. According to the Reformed they have the necessity of
   precept. The use of them is enjoined as a duty; but they are not
   necessary means of salvation. Men may be saved without them. The
   benefits which they signify and which they are the means of signifying,
   sealing, and applying to believers, are not so tied to their use that
   those benefits cannot be secured without them. Sins may be forgiven,
   and the soul regenerated and saved, though neither sacrament has ever
   been received. The Lutherans and Romanists, on the other hand, hold
   that the sacraments are necessary means of grace, in the sense that the
   grace which they signify is not received otherwise than in their use.
   There is no remission of sin or regeneration without baptism; no
   reception of the body and blood of Christ to our spiritual nourishment
   and growth in grace, without the Lord's Supper; and, according to
   Romanists, no forgiveness of post-baptismal sins without priestly
   absolution; no grace of orders without canonical ordination; and no
   special preparation for death without extreme unction. This question is
   of importance chiefly in reference to baptism, and will therefore come
   up when that sacrament is under consideration. At present it is only
   the general teachings of these several churches that need be referred
   to. The "Consensus Tigurinus" is the most carefully considered and
   cautiously worded exposition of the doctrine of the Reformed in
   relation to the sacraments, belonging to the period of the Reformation.
   It was drawn up to settle the differences on this subject between the
   churches of Geneva and those of Zurich. It contains the statements in
   reference to the sacraments to which both parties agreed. It teaches
   [529] (1.) That the sacraments are "notæ ac tesseræ" of Christian
   fellowship and brotherhood; incitements to gratitude, faith, and a holy
   life, and "syngraphæ" binding us thereto. They were ordained especially
   that therein God might testify, represent, and seal to us his grace.
   (2.) The things signified are not to be separated from the signs. Those
   who by faith receive the latter receive also the former. (3.) That
   respect is to be had rather to the promise to which our faith is
   directed; for the elements without Christ "nihil sint quam inanes
   larvæ." (4.) The sacraments confer nothing "propria eorum virtute;" God
   alone works in us by his Spirit. They are organs or means by which God
   efficaciously operates. (5.) They are sometimes called seals, but the
   Spirit alone is properly the seal as well as the beginner and finisher
   of our faith. (6.) God does not operate in all who receive the
   sacraments, but only in his own chosen people. (7.) Hence the doctrine
   is to be rejected that the sacraments convey grace to all who do not
   oppose the obstacle of mortal sin. The grace of God is not so bound to
   the signs, that all who have the latter have the former. (8.) Believers
   receive without the sacraments the blessings which they receive in
   their use. "Extra eorum usum fidelibus constat, quæ illic figuratur
   veritas." Paul received baptism for the remission of sins; but his sins
   were remitted before he was baptized. Baptism was to Cornelius the
   layer of regeneration, but he had received the Spirit before he was
   thus externally washed. In the Lord's Supper we receive Christ, but
   Christ dwells in every believer, and we must have faith before we can
   acceptably approach the table of the Lord. (9.) The benefit of the
   sacraments is not confined to the time in which they are administered
   or received. God often regenerates long after baptism those baptized in
   infancy; some in early youth, some in old age. The benefit of baptism,
   therefore, continues through the whole life, because the promise
   signified therein continues always in force.

   As to the Lutheran doctrine on this subject, Guerike says that the
   three churches, the Greek, Roman, and Lutheran, "are agreed in holding
   that in the sacraments the visible signs as such really convey the
   invisible divine things, and therefore, that a participation of the
   sacraments is necessary in order to a participation of the heavenly
   gifts (göttliche Sache) therein contained. While on the contrary the
   Reformed Church teaches that the visible signs as such do not convey
   the invisible grace, and that the Christian can by faith receive the
   same divine benefits without the use of the sacraments, and
   consequently that the sacraments are not absolutely necessary, much
   less the middle point of the Christian plan of salvation." [530] The
   language of the Lutheran Symbols justifies this strong language of
   Guerike. Thus the signers of the Augsburg Confession, [531] "Damnant
   Anabaptistas qui improbant baptismum puerorum et affirmant pueros sine
   baptismo salvos fieri." And in the comment on that article in the
   "Apology for the Confession," it is said, [532] "Nonus articulus
   approbatus est, in quo confitemur, quod baptismus sit necessarius ad
   salutem, et quod pueri sint baptizandi, et quod baptismus puerorum non
   sit irritus, sed necessarius et efficax ad salutem." The Lutheran
   theologians, however, in treating of the necessity of baptism, make a
   distinction between adults and infants. With regard to the former,
   regeneration should precede baptism. In reference to them, the design
   of baptism is to seal and confirm the grace already received. In regard
   to infants it is the organ or means of regeneration. Thus Baier says:
   [533] "Hic autem, quod ad finem proximum attinet, diversitas occurrit,
   respectu subjectorum diversorum. Nam infantibus quidem æque omnibus per
   baptismum primum confertur et obsignatur fides, per quam meritum
   Christi illis applicetur: Adultis vero illis tantum, qui fidem ex verbo
   conceperunt ante baptismi susceptionem, baptismus eam obsignat et
   confirmat." So also Gerhard says: "Infantibus baptismus principaliter
   est medium ordinarium regenerationis et mundationis a peccatis, etc.
   Secundario autem sigillum justitiæ et fidei confirmatio; adultis
   credentibus baptismus principaliter præstat usum obsignationis ac
   testificationis de gratia Dei, huiothesia et vita æterna; sed minus
   principaliter renovationem et dona Spiritus Sancti auget. Infantes, per
   baptismum primitias Spiritus et fidei accipiunt: adulti qui per verbum
   primitias fidei et Spiritus Sancti acceperunt, per baptismum incrementa
   ejusdem consequuntur." [534]

   The doctrine of the Church of Rome on this subject is, not that all tho
   seven sacraments are necessary to salvation, but that each is necessary
   to the reception of the gift or grace which it is intended to convey.
   There can be no "grace of orders" without canonical ordination, but it
   is not necessary that every man should be ordained. The sacrament of
   penance is necessary only in the case of post-baptismal sin, and even
   the eucharist, which they regard as far the greatest of their
   sacraments "in dignity and mystery," is not necessary to infants.
   Baptism, however, being the only channel through which remission of
   sins and regeneration are conveyed, is absolutely necessary to
   salvation, And priestly absolution is absolutely necessary for the
   remission of sins committed after baptism. Such revolting consequences
   would flow from carrying this principle rigorously out, that Romanists
   shrink from its assertion. It would exclude many confessors and martyrs
   from the kingdom of heaven. It is, therefore, taught that when
   circumstances render it impossible that these sacraments can be
   received, the purpose and desire to receive them secure their benefits.
   These cases are, however, exceptions, and are generally overlooked in
   the statement of the doctrine. This exception does not apply to
   infants, and, therefore, they cannot enjoy its benefits. It is the
   doctrine of the Church of Rome that all unbaptized persons fail of
   eternal life. This is included in their idea of the Church. None are
   saved who are not within the pale of the true Church. None are within
   the pale of the Church who have not been baptized, and who are not
   subject to canonical bishops, and especially to the bishop of Rome. The
   unbaptized, therefore, not being in the Church, as defined by
   Romanists, are of necessity excluded from the kingdom of heaven.

   The language of the Roman standards is perfectly explicit. The Council
   of Trent says: [535] "Si quis dixerit, non dari gratiam per hujusmodi
   sacramenta semper, et omnibus, quantum est ex parte Dei, etiam si rite
   ea suscipiant, sed aliquando, et aliquibus anathema sit." And again:
   [536] "Si quis dixerit baptismum liberum esse, hoc est non necessarium
   ad salutem; anathema sit." In the Roman Catechism [537] we find the
   following: "Estne Baptismus ad salutem omnibus necessarius?" the answer
   is: "Sed cum ceterarum rerum cognitio, quæ hactenus expositæ sunt,
   fidelibus utillissima habenda sit, tum vero nihil magis necessarium
   videri potest, quam ut doceantur, omnibus hominibus baptismi legem a
   Domino præscriptam esse, ita ut, nisi per baptismi gratiam Deo
   renascantur, in sempiternam miseriam, et interitum a parentibus, sive
   illi fideles, sive infideles sint, procreentur." According to the
   Church of Rome, therefore, all the unbaptized, whether their parents be
   believers or infidels, are doomed to eternal misery and perdition. With
   regard to penance, the Council of Trent says: [538] "Est hoc
   sacramentum poenitentiæ lapsis post baptismum ad salutem necessarium,
   ut nondum regeneratis ipse baptismus." It also teaches that full
   confession of all sins committed after baptism is "jure divino"
   necessary, because our Lord Jesus Christ, about to ascend into heaven,
   left his priests as his vicars, as "præsides et judices," to whom all
   mortal sins, into which Christians may fall, are to be communicated,
   and who are authorized to pronounce the sentence of remission or
   retention. It is said, moreover, that our Lord teaches that priests,
   who themselves are in a state of mortal sin, in virtue of the power of
   the Holy Spirit given them in ordination, exercise, as ministers of
   Christ, this function of remitting sins, and those err who contend that
   wicked priests have not this power. All this is reiterated in the
   canons and amplified and enforced in the Catechism. [539]

   In this connection it is sufficient to remark, --

   1. That the doctrine that the sacraments are necessary to salvation, on
   the ground that they are the only channels for conveying to men the
   benefits of Christ's redemption, is clearly contrary to the express
   teachings of the Bible. The Scriptures everywhere teach that God looks
   upon the heart; that He requires of fallen men simply faith in our Lord
   Jesus Christ and repentance toward God as the only indispensable
   conditions of salvation; that all men have free access to God, through
   the mediation of Christ, to obtain at his hands the remission of sins
   and all the benefits of redemption; that they need no intervention of
   priests to secure for them this access or the communication of those
   benefits; and that no external rites have power in themselves to confer
   grace. God so loved the world, that He gave his only begotten Son, that
   whosoever believeth on Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
   He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not is
   condemned already. Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be
   saved. Whosoever calleth on the name of the Lord, shall be saved. Whoso
   believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. The Scripture
   cannot be broken. It cannot be that he who truly believes the record
   which God has given of his Son should fail of eternal life. We become
   the sons of God by faith in Jesus Christ. It is true we are commanded
   to be baptized, as we are commanded to confess Christ before men or to
   love the brethren. But these are duties to which faith secures
   obedience; they are not the means of salvation.

   2. This ritual system is utterly inconsistent with the whole genius of
   Christianity. God is a Spirit, and He requires those who worship Him,
   to worship Him in spirit and in truth. External rites are declared to
   be nothing. Circumcision is nothing. and uncircumcision is nothing. "He
   is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision,
   which is outward in the flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly;
   and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the
   letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God." (Rom. ii. 28, 29.)
   This is not merely a fact, but a principle. What St. Paul here says of
   circumcision and of Jews, may be said, and is substantially said of St.
   Peter in reference to baptism and Christianity. A man who is a
   Christian outwardly only, is not a Christian; and the baptism which
   saves, is not the washing of the body with water, but the conversion of
   the soul. (1 Peter iii. 21.) The idea that a man's state before God
   depends on anything external, on birth, on membership in any visible
   organization, or on any outward rite or ceremony, is utterly abhorrent
   to the religion of the Bible. It did not belong to Judaism except in
   the corrupt form of Pharisaism. It is true, that under the old
   dispensation a man could not be saved unless he belonged to the
   commonwealth of Israel, and was one of the children of Abraham. But
   according to St. Paul (Rom. ix. 8; Gal. iii. 7 and 29), this only meant
   that they must believe in Abraham's God and the promise of redemption
   through his seed. If a man of heathen birth and culture came to the
   knowledge of the truth, believed the doctrines which God had revealed
   to his chosen people, relied on the promise of salvation through
   Christ, and purposed to obey the law of God, then he was a Jew inwardly
   and one of Abraham's seed. His circumcision was only "a seal of the
   righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised."
   (Rom. iv. 11.) The doctrine that such a man, notwithstanding this
   thorough change in his inward state in knowledge, conviction, and
   character, is under the wrath and curse of God, until a little piece of
   flesh is cut from his body, never was a part of the religion of God. It
   is part and parcel of the religion of his great adversary. Any one,
   therefore, who teaches that no man can be saved without the rite of
   baptism, and that by receiving that rite he is made a child of God and
   heir of heaven, is antichrist, and "even now are there many
   antichrists." (1 John ii. 18.)

   3. This ritualistic system, which makes the sacraments the only
   channels of grace, and consequently absolutely necessary to salvation,
   naturally leads to the divorce of religion and morality. A man,
   according to this system, may be in the true Church a child of God, and
   assured of heaven, and yet utterly frivolous, worldly, and even immoral
   in his inward and outward life. This is illustrated on a large scale in
   every Roman Catholic country. In such countries some of the greatest
   devotees are openly wicked men. And wherever this system prevails we
   find its most zealous advocates among people of the world, who live at
   ease in full security of salvation, because they are in the Church and
   faithful in observing "days, and months, and times, and years;" and are
   punctiliously "subject to ordinances, touch not, taste not, handle
   not." [540] The great question at issue in the controversy with
   ritualism is, Whether a man's salvation depends on his inward state, or
   upon outward rites; or, as some would give it, Whether his state is
   determined by outward rites, or whether the rites depend for their
   value and efficacy on his inward state. In either form the question is,
   Are we saved by faith or by sacraments? The Apostle teaches us that "in
   Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision,
   but a new creature." (Gal. vi. 15.)

   4. The above remarks are not intended to apply, and it fact are not
   applicable to the Lutheran system. Lutherans do, indeed, teach the
   necessity of the sacraments, but as they also teach that true, living,
   saving faith is the indispensable condition of their efficacy; and, as
   they further teach that in the case of adults such faith produced by
   the Word precedes baptism, they do not make baptism the ordinary and
   indispensable channel for the communication of the saving influences of
   the Holy Spirit. They hold that all who, through the reading or hearing
   of the Word, are led to embrace the Lord Jesus Christ as their God and
   Saviour, are thereby made children of God and heirs of eternal life.
   They believe with the Apostle (Gal. iii. 26), that we "are all the
   children of God by faith in Christ Jesus." It is this doctrine of
   salvation by faith, or as Luther has it, "by faith alone," that has
   saved the Lutheran system from the virus of ritualism.

   § 6. Validity of the Sacraments.

   That is valid which avails for the end intended. The question,
   therefore, as to the validity of the sacraments is a question as to
   what is necessary to their being that which they purport to be. The
   answer to this question is that they must conform to the prescriptions
   given in the Bible concerning them. The elements employed must be those
   which Christ ordained. The form, or the manner in which those elements
   are given and received, must be in accordance with his directions; and
   the ordinance must be administered with the intention of doing what He
   has commanded. Thus if baptism be a washing with water, then it is
   necessary that water should be the element employed in its
   administration. If it be a washing with water in the name of the
   Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, then those words, or that
   form, must be used; and the ordinance must be administered and received
   in the faith of the Trinity. The general faith of the Church has been
   in favour of the validity of heretical baptism; but heresy was made to
   include other departures from the standard of faith, than the denial of
   the essential doctrines of the Gospel. Baptism is a Christian
   ordinance. It involves on the part of both the administrator and the
   recipient the profession of the Christian religion. It is perfectly
   evident that the same service, as to matter and form, performed by a
   heathen to a. heathen, who attached an entirely different meaning to
   what was done, could not be regarded as a Christian ordinance.

   The other condition necessary to the validity of the sacraments
   concerns the intention of those engaged in the service. They must
   intend to do what Christ commanded. If a man receives the ordinance of
   baptism he must intend to profess his faith in the Gospel and to accept
   the terms of salvation therein presented. And the administrator must
   have the purpose to initiate the recipient into the number of the
   professed disciples of Christ. A sacrament, therefore, administered by
   an idiot, or a maniac, or in sport, or in mockery, is utterly null and
   void. It has no meaning and is entirely worthless.

   The only question on which there is much diversity of opinion on this
   subject, is, Whether the validity of the sacraments depends on the
   official standing of the person by whom they are administered? We have
   seen that Romanists make canonical ordination or consecration
   absolutely essential. If any man but a bishop (in their sense of the
   word) should confirm or ordain, nothing is done. The service in either
   case is an empty one, conveying neither grace nor authority. If any
   other than a priest should absolve a penitent, no absolution takes
   place; and so of the Lord's Supper, the words of consecration
   pronounced by any lips but those of a canonically ordained priest,
   produce no change in the elements. The reason of this is, not merely
   that the officiator acts in such cases disorderly and improperly, but
   that he has neither the prerogative nor the power to render the
   sacraments effectual. They are invalid, because they do not avail to
   accomplish the end for which they were appointed. Romanists are guilty
   of a benevolent inconsistency in making baptism an exception to this
   rule. There is the same logical or theoretical reason that baptism
   should be invalid when administered by an unordained person, as that
   confirmation, ordination, or absolution, when thus administered, should
   be null and void. But as baptism is held to be essential to salvation,
   souls must often perish, when a priest is inaccessible, unless lay
   baptism be allowed. In cases of such emergency the Church of Rome,
   therefore, pronounces baptism to be valid (i.e., efficacious) when
   administered by a layman, a woman, or even by a pagan, provided the
   administrator really intends to baptize, i.e., to do what the Church
   contemplates in the administration of that ordinance.

   The standards of the Lutheran and Reformed Churches place preaching the
   Word and the administration of the sacraments on the same ground. They
   teach (1.) That Christ has appointed certain officers in his Church.
   (2.) That by his Spirit he calls and qualifies certain men for the
   discharge of the duties of those offices. (3.) That those who aspire to
   them are to be examined as to their call and qualifications. (4.) That
   if found competent they are to be set apart or ordained in an orderly
   manner to the office to which they deem themselves called. (5.) That
   the special functions of one class of these officers, are preaching and
   the administration of the sacraments. (6.) It follows from all this
   that for any one not thus called and ordained to undertake the exercise
   of either of these functions of the ministry, in a settled state of the
   Church, is wrong; it is a violation of the divinely constituted order
   of Christ's Church. According to this view, lay preaching and lay
   administration of the ordinances (in ordinary circumstances) are
   equally wrong. But are they invalid? That is a very different question.
   We know that Romanists, when they pronounce a sacrament invalid, mean
   that it is powerless. We know that when the old English law pronounced
   any marriage invalid if not solemnized by a man in holy orders, the
   meaning was, that the ceremony was null and void; that the parties were
   not married. But what can be meant by lay preaching being invalid? Is
   the Gospel invalid? Does it lose its truth, authority, or power? This
   cannot be. Neither its authority nor its power depend upon the clay
   lips by which it is proclaimed. Again, if a number of pious Christians
   assemble, where no minister can be had, to celebrate the Lord's Supper,
   in what sense is such a service invalid? Do they not commemorate the
   death of Christ? Are not the bread and wine to them the symbols of his
   body and blood? If faith be in exercise, may they not receive those
   symbols to their spiritual nourishment and growth in grace? Again, if
   baptism be a washing with water in the name of the Holy Trinity, to
   signify and seal our engrafting into Christ, does it cease to be, or to
   signify this if not administered by an ordained minister? Does not the
   man thus baptized make a profession of his faith in Christ? and does he
   not thereby become a member of that great body which confesses Him
   before men? Can it, therefore, be any more invalid than the Gospel,
   when preached by a laymen?

   What the Bible, therefore, seems to teach on this subject is, that
   Christ having appointed certain officers in his Church to preach his
   Word and to administer his ordinances, for any man, under ordinary
   circumstances not duly appointed, to assume the functions of the
   ministry, is irregular and wrong, because contrary to the order of
   Christ's Church. Further than this the Reformed and Lutheran standards
   do not appear to have gone.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 7. Baptism.

   "Baptism is a sacrament, wherein the washing with water, in the name of
   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, doth signify and
   seal our engrafting into Christ and partaking of the benefits of the
   covenant of grace, and our engagement to be the Lord's." [541]

   The Mode of Baptism.

   According to the definition given above, baptism is a washing with
   water. By washing is meant any such application of water to the body as
   effects its purification. This may be done by immersion, affusion, or
   sprinkling. The command, therefore, to baptize is simply a command to
   wash with water. It is not specifically a command to immerse, to
   affuse, or to sprinkle. The mode of applying water as the purifying
   medium is unessential. The only necessary thing is to make such an
   application of water to the person, as shall render the act significant
   of the purification of the soul.

   The first argument in favour of this view of the ordinance is an à
   priori one. As by common consent the design of the institution is
   either to symbolize or to effect the cleansing of the soul from the
   guilt and pollution of sin, by the blood and spirit of Christ, it would
   seem to follow that washing with water, however done, is all that is
   necessary to the integrity of the ordinance. The idea of purification
   is as clearly and as frequently signified by affusion as by immersion.
   Besides, to make anything so purely circumstantial as the manner in
   which water is used in the act of cleansing, essential to a Christian
   sacrament, which, according to some, is absolutely necessary to
   salvation, and, according to others, is essential to membership in the
   visible Church of Christ, is opposed to the whole nature of the Gospel.
   It is to render Christianity more Judaic than Judaism, even as
   understood by the Pharisees; for they purified themselves, their
   offerings, and holy places and utensils, by immersion, affusion, or
   sprinkling as was most appropriate or convenient.

   Use of the Word in the Classics.

   The second argument on this subject, is drawn from the usage of the
   word. In the Classics; in the Septuagint and the Apocryphal writings of
   the Old Testament; in the New Testament and in the writings of the
   Greek fathers, the words bapto, baptizo and their cognates, are used
   with such latitude of meaning, as to prove the assertion that the
   command to baptize is a command to immerse, to be utterly unauthorized
   and unreasonable.

   Ever since the Reformation and the rise of the Baptists as a distinct
   denomination, who hold that "baptizing is dipping, and dipping is
   baptizing," the meaning of the Greek words in question has been a
   matter of dispute, on which hundreds of volumes have been written. It
   is evidently impossible to enter on that discussion in these pages. All
   that can be attempted is a brief statement of the conclusions believed
   to be established, while the proofs on which those conclusions rest
   must be sought in works devoted to the subject. As to the classic use
   of the words in question, it is clear that bapto means (1.) To dip.
   (2.) To dye by dipping. (3.) To dye without regard to the mode in which
   it is done; as a lake is said to be baptized (i.e., dyed) by the blood
   shed in it; a garment is spoken of as baptized by colouring matter
   dropping on it. (4.) It also means to gild; also to glaze, as when
   earthenware is covered with any vitreous matter. (5.) To wet, moisten,
   or wash. (6.) To temper, as hot iron is tempered; this may be done by
   plunging or pouring. "Tempered, hupo elaiou," does not mean plunged
   into oil. (7.) To imbue. The mind is said to be baptized with
   fantasies; not plunged into them, for it is hupo ton phantasion. [542]

   A man is said to be "imbued with righteousness." This cannot mean
   "dipped." It is obvious, therefore, that a command to baptize, made in
   the use of the word bapto, cannot be limited to a command to dip,
   plunge, or immerse.

   As to the classic use of baptizo, it means, (1.) To immerse, or
   submerge. It is very frequently used when ships are spoken of as sunk
   or buried in the sea. They are then said to be baptized. (2.) To
   overflow or to cover with water. The sea-shore is said to be baptized
   by the rising tide. (3.) To wet thoroughly, to moisten. (4.) To pour
   upon or drench. (5.) In any way to be overwhelmed or overpowered. Hence
   men are said to be baptized with wine (hoi bebaptismenoi are the
   intoxicated), with opium, with debts, with puzzling questions. Wine is
   said to be baptized by having water poured into it. [543]

   The word baptizo, as Dr. Dale so strenuously argues, belongs to that
   class of words which indicate an effect to be produced without
   expressing the kind of action by which that effect is to be brought
   about. In this respect it is analogous to the word "to bury." A man may
   be buried by being covered up in the ground; by being placed in an
   empty cave; by being put into a sarcophagus; or even, as among our
   Indians, by being placed upon a platform elevated above the ground. The
   command to bury, may be executed in any of these ways. So with regard
   to the word baptizo, there is a given effect to be produced, without
   any specific injunction as to the manner; whether by immersion,
   pouring, or sprinkling.

   Use of the Words in the Septuagint and Apocrypha.

   These words are of rare occurrence in the Greek version of the Old
   Testament. In the fifth chapter of Second Kings we have the history of
   Naaman the Syrian, who came to the prophet to be healed of his leprosy.
   And "Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan
   seven times" (ver. 10). "Then went he down and dipped himself
   (ebaptisato) seven times in Jordan" (ver. 14). The only special
   interest in this passage is the proof it affords that baptism and
   washing are identical. The command to wash was obeyed by baptizing
   himself. The Vulgate does not change the words in the two passages,
   "Vade et lavare septies in Jordane" (ver. 10). "Descendit et lavit in
   Jordane septies" (ver. 14). The Septuagint has lousai in verse 10, and
   ebaptisato in verse 14.

   In Daniel iv. 33, it is said that the body of Nebuchadnezzar "was wet
   (baptized, ebaphe, [LXX. ver. 30]) with the dew of heaven." Here the
   idea of dipping is absolutely precluded.

   The word bapto, when meaning to dip, does not necessarily include the
   idea of entire immersion. A mere touch or partial immersion is often
   all the word is intended to express; as in Leviticus iv. 17: "The
   priest shall dip (bapsei) his finger in some of the blood." Leviticus
   xiv. 6: "As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,
   and the hyssop, and shall dip (bapsei) them and the living bird in the
   blood of the bird that was killed over the running water." All these
   things could not be immersed in the blood of a bird. Boaz said to Ruth,
   at meal-time "dip (bapseis) thy morsel in the vinegar." (Ruth ii. 14.)
   Joshua iii. 15. "The feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped
   (ebaphesan) in the brim of the water." 1 Samuel xiv. 27: Jonathan
   "dipped" (ebapsen) the end of the rod which was in his hand "in an
   honey-comb." Psalm lxviii. 23 (24), "That thy foot may be dipped
   (baphe) in the blood of thine enemies." These examples prove that even
   bapto, as used in the Septuagint, does not, when it means to dip,
   include the idea of complete immersion.

   baptizo (according to Trommius), besides the passage already quoted
   from 2 Kings v. 14, occurs in the Septuagint only in Isaiah xxi. 4,
   where the Greek is he anomia me baptizei, "iniquity baptizes (or
   overwhelms) me." The English version, adhering to the Hebrew, reads,
   "Fearfulness affrighted me." The Vulgate has "Tenebræ stupefecerunt
   me." The word occurs twice in the Apocrypha, Judith xii. 7, and Sirach
   xxxiv. 27 [xxxi. 25]. Wahl, [544] referring to these two passages,
   defines "baptomai, me lavo = niptomai, "I wash myself." In Sirach the
   expression is, baprizomenos apo nekrou, "baptized from a dead body,"
   i.e., purified from the uncleanness contracted by touching a dead body.
   Or, as Fritzsche translates it, "Der sich wäscht von einem Todten,
   einer Leiche, sich reinigt von der Befleckung, die ihm die Berührung
   des Leichen aus zugezogen, vrgl. 4 Moses xix. 11." [545] That is, "He
   that washes from a corpse purifies himself from the defilement
   occasioned by touching it." We learn from the passage referred to for
   illustration (Numbers xix. 11-13), that this purification was effected
   by sprinkling the ashes of a heifer. (See ver. 9, and compare Heb. ix.
   13.) In Numbers xix. 13, it is said, "Whosoever toucheth the dead body
   of any one that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the
   tabernacle of the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel,
   because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be
   unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him." The water of separation was
   the water in which the ashes of a red heifer had been mingled as
   described in the preceding part of the chapter. And it was the
   sprinkling of that water which effected the baptism, or purification,
   of the defiled person.

   The passage in Judith determines nothing either way as to the meaning
   of the word. It merely says, ebaptizeto en te parembole epi tes peges
   tou hudatos," she baptized herself in the camp at a fountain of water."
   If it be a settled point that baptizo always means to immerse, then
   this passage asserts that Judith immersed herself in the fountain. But
   if, as the vast majority of Christians believe, the word often means to
   wash, or purify, without regard to the way in which the purification is
   effected, then the passage cannot be proved to assert anything more
   than that Judith washed herself at the fountain. The circumstances of
   the case are all in favour of the latter interpretation. According to
   the narrative, the land had been invaded by an immense host of
   Assyrians under the command of Holofernes. Resistance seemed hopeless,
   and utter destruction was imminent. In this emergency Judith, a young,
   beautiful, and rich woman, inflamed with zeal for her country and her
   religion, determined to make a desperate effort for the salvation of
   her people. For this purpose, arrayed to the best advantage, she made
   her way into the enemies camp and presented herself to Holofernes and
   promised to aid him in the conquest of the land. The Assyrian general,
   captivated by her charms, treated her with great favour. She remained
   undisturbed in her tent for three days, but was permitted at night to
   resort to the fountain for purification. On the fourth day she was
   invited to a great feast, at which Holofernes drank to excess, so that
   when the guests had retired and the general was in a state of helpless
   intoxication, Judith, with the assistance of her maid, cut off his head
   and carried it to the camp of her own people. This led to the overthrow
   of the Assyrians and the deliverance of the land.

   The circumstances in this case which favour the assumption that Judith
   went to the fountain not for immersion, but for ablution, are, (1.) It
   was within the camp, necessarily, for such a host, of large dimensions.
   But a camp filled with soldiers does not seem to be an appropriate
   bathing-place for a lady of distinction even at night. (2.) Dr. Conant
   says: "There was evidently no lack of water for the immersion of the
   body, after the Jewish manner, namely by walking into the water to the
   proper depth, and then sinking down till the whole body was immersed."
   [546] The probability, however, seems all the other way. It must have
   been an extraordinary fountain, if it allowed of immersion in any such
   way. If the word baptizo can only mean "to immerse," these
   considerations amount to nothing. But if the word means to wash or to
   purify as well as to immerse, then they are of sufficient weight to
   turn the scale in favour of the former explanation. Of itself, however,
   the passage proves nothing.

   The New Testament Usage.

   The word baptein is used four times in the New Testament, in no one of
   which does it express the idea of entire immersion. In Luke xvi. 24,
   "That he may dip (bapse) the tip of his finger in water." The finger,
   when dipped in water, is not submerged. When placed horizontally on the
   water and slightly depressed, it retains more of the moisture than if
   plunged perpendicularly into it. John xiii. 26, speaks twice of dipping
   the sop (bapsas and embapsas). But a morsel held in the fingers, is
   only partly immersed. In Revelation xix. 13, the words peribeblemenos
   himatioi bebammenon haimati obviously mean clothed with a vesture
   stained or dyed with blood.' The allusion is probably to Isaiah lxiii.
   1 ff. "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
   Bozrah? . . . . Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy
   garments like him that treadeth in the wine-fat? I have trodden the
   wine-press alone; . . . . and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my
   garments, and I will stain all my raiment." In this case, therefore,
   the baptism was by sprinkling. Battizo occurs in the New Testament
   about eighty times; baptisma some twenty times; and baptismos four
   times. As every one admits that baptism may be effected by immersion,
   and as the purifications under the Old Testament (called by the
   Apostle, Hebrews ix. 10, in Greek, "diverse baptisms") were effected by
   immersion, affusion, and sprinkling, it would not be surprising if in
   some of these numerous passages, the baptism spoken of necessarily
   implied immersion. It so happens, or, it has been so ordered, however,
   that there is no such passage in the whole of the New Testament. The
   places in which these words occur may be arranged in the following
   classes: (1.) Those in which, taken by themselves, the presumption is
   in favour of immersion. (2.) Those in which the idea of immersion is
   necessarily excluded. (3.) Those which in themselves are not decisive,
   but where the presumption is altogether in favour of affusion.

   To the first class belong those passages which speak of the persons
   baptized going into (eis) the water, and "coming up out of the water."
   (Matt. iii. 16; Acts viii. 38, 39.) Such passages, however, must be
   isolated in order to create a presumption in favour of immersion.
   According to ancient accounts, the common way of baptizing was for the
   person to step into water, when water was poured on his head, and then
   he came up out of the water, not in the least incommoded by dripping
   garments. And when we remember that it is said concerning John, that
   "Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region
   around about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing
   their sins" (Matt. iii. 5, 6), it seems physically impossible that he
   should have immersed all this multitude. When all the circumstances are
   taken into view, the presumption in favour of immersion, even in this
   class of passages, disappears.

   2. The second class of passages, those from which the idea of immersion
   is excluded, includes all those which relate to the baptism of the
   Spirit. The Spirit is frequently said to be poured out on men; but men
   are never said to be dipped or immersed into the Holy Spirit. Such an
   idea is altogether incongruous. When, therefore, it is said that men
   are baptized by the Holy Spirit, as is so often done, the reference
   must be to effusion, or affusion of the Spirit by which the soul is
   cleansed from sin. As the Holy Spirit is a person, and not a mere
   influence or force, the preposition en used in this connection (Matt.
   iii. 11; Mark i. 8; John i. 33; Acts i. 5, xi. 16; 1 Cor. xii. 13) must
   have its instrumental force. The work performed in us by the Holy
   Spirit is a baptism. As water in the hands of John was the purifying
   medium for the body, so the Holy Spirit, as sent or given by Jesus
   Christ, purifies the soul. Some of the modern commentators are such
   purists that they are unwilling to allow of the slightest departure
   from classic usage in the Greek of the New Testament. They speak as
   though the sacred writers were Greek grammarians, instead of, as was in
   most cases the fact, unlettered men writing in what to them was a
   foreign language. Thus because the particle hina in classic Greek has
   always a telic force, they deny that it is ever used ecbatically in the
   New Testament, even in such cases as Luke xxii. 30, "I appoint unto you
   a kingdom, . . . . in order that ye may eat and drink at my table."
   John vi. 7, "Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for
   them, in order that every one of them may have a little." Romans xi.
   11, "Have they stumbled with the design that they should fall?" 1
   Corinthians xiv. 13, "Let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray
   in order that he may interpret," etc., etc. Thus, also, because the
   words pisteuo, pistis, and pistos in the classics are rarely found in
   construction with the preposition en they give the most unnatural
   interpretation to many passages in order to avoid admitting that
   construction in the New Testament. This is done in the face of such
   passagee as Mark i. 15, pisteuete en to euangeli'o. Galatians iii. 26,
   "Ye are all the children of God, dia tes pisteos en Christo Iesou."
   Ephesians i. 15, "After I heard of your, pistin en to Kurio Iesiou,"
   and many others of like kind. In like manner because the instrumental
   force of en is rare in the classics, it is avoided as much as possible
   in the Scriptures. Baptism en pneumati, instead of being understood as
   meaning a baptism by, or with the Spirit, is made to mean "in the
   sphere of the Spirit," and baptism en puri, baptism "in the sphere of
   fire." What this means, it would be difficult for most of those for
   whom the Bible is intended to understand. The baptism of John and that
   of Christ are contrasted. The one baptized with water; the other with
   the Holy Spirit. In Acts i. 5, it is said, "John truly baptized with
   water (hudati, the simple instrumental dative); but ye shall be
   baptized (en Pneumati hagio) with the Holy Ghost not many days hence."
   As to baptize hudati, cannot mean to immerse in water, so neither can
   baptising en to Pneumati mean immersing in the Spirit. The fact is
   baptizein does not express any particular mode of action. As to dye,
   expresses any kind of action by which an object is coloured; to bury,
   any kind of action by which an object is hidden and protected; so to
   baptize, expresses any act by which a person or thing is brought into
   the state of being wet, purified, or even stupefied, as by opium or
   wine.

   Another passage in which this word occurs where the idea of immersion
   is precluded, is 1 Corinthians x. 1, 2, "All our fathers were under the
   cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses
   in the cloud and in the sea." The people went through the sea dry shod.
   As far as known not a drop of water touched them. The cloud referred to
   was doubtless the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by
   night which guided the people through the wilderness. The simple and
   generally accepted meaning of the passage is, that as a man is brought
   by Christian baptism into the number of the professed and avowed
   disciples of Christ, so the Hebrews were brought by the supernatural
   manifestations of divine power specified, into the relation of
   disciples and followers to Moses. There is no allusion to immersion,
   affusion, or sprinkling in the case.

   Another passage belonging to this class is Mark vii. 4, "When they come
   from the market, except they wash (baptisontai), they eat not. And many
   other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing
   of cups, and pots, brazen vessels, and of tables (klinon, couches)." To
   maintain that beds or couches were immersed, is a mere act of
   desperation. Baptism means here, as it does everywhere when used of a
   religious rite symbolical purification by water, without the slightest
   reference to the mode in which that purification was effected.

   3. The third class of passages includes all those in which the idea of
   immersion, though not absolutely precluded, is to the last degree
   improbable. The late Dr. Edward Robinson, than whom there is no higher
   authority on all that relates to the topography and physical geography
   of Palestine and the habits of its inhabitants, so far as they are
   determined by the nature of the country, says: (1.) "The idea of
   private baths in families in Jerusalem and Palestine generally is
   excluded." (2.) "In Acts ii. 41, three thousand persons are said to
   have been baptized at Jerusalem apparently in one day at the season of
   Pentecost in June; and in Acts iv. 4, the same rite is necessarily
   implied in respect to five thousand more. Against the idea of full
   immersion in these cases there lies a difficulty, apparently
   insuperable, in the scarcity of water. There is in summer no running
   stream in the vicinity of Jerusalem, except the mere rill of Siloam a
   few rods in length; and the city is and was supplied with water from
   its cisterns and public reservoirs. [547] From neither of these sources
   could a supply have been well obtained for the immersion of eight
   thousand persons. The same scarcity of water forbade the use of private
   baths as a general custom; and thus also further precludes the idea of
   bathing" in such passages as Luke xi. 38; Mark vii. 28. He confirms his
   conclusion by further remarking, (3.) "In the earliest Latin versions
   of the New Testament, as, for example, the Itala, which Augustine
   regarded as the best of all, [548] which goes back apparently to the
   second century and to usage connected with the apostolic age, the Greek
   verb, baptizo, is uniformly given in the Latin form, "baptizo," and is
   never translated by "immergo," or any like word, showing that there was
   something in the rite of baptism to which the latter did not
   correspond. [549] (4.) The baptismal fonts still found [550] among the
   ruins of the most ancient Greek churches in Palestine, as at Tekoa and
   Gophna, and going back apparently to very early times, are not large
   enough to admit of the baptism of adult persons by immersion, and were
   obviously never intended for that use." [551]

   It is, therefore, to the last degree improbable that the thousands
   mentioned in the early chapters of Acts were baptized by immersion. The
   same improbability exists as to the case of the centurion in Cæsarea
   and the jailer at Philippi. With regard to the former, Peter said, "Can
   any man forbid water?" which naturally implies that water was to be
   brought to Cornelius, and not he be taken to the water. As to the
   jailer, it is said (Acts xvi. 33) that he and all his were baptized
   within the prison, as the narrative clearly implies, at midnight. There
   is the same improbability against the assumption that the eunuch,
   mentioned in Acts viii. 27-38, was baptized by immersion. He was
   travelling through a desert part of the country towards Gaza, when
   Philip joined him, "And as they went on their way they came unto a
   certain water (epi ti hudor, to some water)." There is no known stream
   in that region of sufficient depth to allow of the immersion of a man.
   It is possible, indeed, that there might have been a reservoir or tank
   in that neighbourhood. But that is not a fact to be assumed without
   evidence and against probability. It is said they "went down both into
   the water," and came "up out of the water." But that might be said, if
   the water were not deep enough to cover their ankles.

   The presumption is still stronger against immersion in the case
   mentioned in Mark vii. 4. It is there said of "the Pharisees and all
   the Jews," that "when they come from the market, except they baptize
   themselves (ean me baptisontai) they eat not." Let it be here
   considered, (1.) That private baths were in Jerusalem very rare, from
   the necessity of the case. (2.) That what is said, is not said merely
   of men of wealth and rank who might be supposed to have conveniences
   and luxuries which the common people could not command. It is said of
   the "Pharisees," a large class, and not only of that class, but of "all
   the Jews" It is wellnigh incredible, under such circumstances, that
   "all the Jews" should immerse themselves every time they came from the
   agora, i.e., "a place of public resort in towns and cities; any open
   place, where the people came together either for business or to sit and
   converse. In oriental cities such open places were at the inside of the
   gates; and here public business was transacted, and tribunals held, as
   also markets." [552] That all the Jews immersed themselves every time
   they came from such a place of public resort, is very hard to believe,
   considering that the facilities for such immersion were not at their
   command. (3.) The words baptize and wash are interchanged in this whole
   connection in such a way as to show that, in the mind of the writer,
   they were synonymous expressions. The Pharisees complained that the
   disciples ate with unwashen (aniptois) hands; for they eat not unless
   they wash (nipsontai) their hands; and when they come from the market
   they do not eat unless they wash (baptisontai), and they hold to the
   washing (baptismous) of cups, and pots, of brazen vessels, and of
   tables or couches. To baptize the hands was to wash the hands, and the
   usual mode of ablution in the east is by pouring water on the hands
   (see 2 Kings iii. 11).

   It is notorious that the various ablutions prescribed by the Mosaic law
   were effected sometimes by immersion, sometimes by affusion, and
   sometimes by sprinkling. And it is no less true that all these modes of
   purification are called by the sacred writers diaphoroi baptismoi, as
   in Hebrews ix. 10, and Mark vii. 4.

   So far, therefore, as the New Testament is concerned, there is not a
   single case where baptism necessarily implies immersion, there are many
   cases in which that meaning is entirely inadmissible, and many more in
   which it is in the highest degree improbable. If immersion were
   indispensable, why was not the word katadu,w used to express the
   command? If sprinkling were exclusively intended, why was not rhaino or
   rhantizo used? It is simply because the mode is nothing and the idea
   everything, that a word was chosen which includes all the modes in
   which water can be applied as the means of purification. Such a word is
   baptizo, for which there is no legitimate substitute, and therefore
   that word has been retained by all the Churches of Christendom, even by
   the Baptists themselves.

   The Patristic Usage.

   This is a wide and densely wooded field, in which a man may find
   anything he chooses to look for, unless it be for proof that the
   fathers always used the word baptizo in the sense of immersion. They
   speak of the waters of chaos as baptized by the Spirit of God brooding
   over them; they were thereby sanctified and a sanctifying power was
   imparted to the waters. The only point of interest here is, that
   Tertullian, for example, regarded this as "baptismi figura," a figure
   of baptism. The point of resemblance assuredly was not immersion.

   But besides this, Suicer gives and copiously illustrates, from the
   writing of the fathers, no less than eight "significations of the word
   baptism (vocis baptisma significationes)." (1.) The deluge was a
   baptism, not only for the world, purging away its sins, but also for
   Noah and his family, as a means of salvation. As they were saved by the
   waters buoying up the ark, so are we saved by baptism. (2.) The baptism
   of Moses when he passed through the Red Sea. The sea was the symbol of
   the water of baptism; the cloud, of the Holy Spirit. (3.) That of the
   Hebrews, as among them any person or thing impure, eloueto hudati, was
   washed with water. This washing, however done, was baptism. (4.) The
   baptism of John, which was regarded as introductory, not spiritual, or
   conferring the Spirit, but simply leading to repentance. (5.) The
   baptism of Jesus. Baptizei Iesous, all' en tneumati. Here immersion is
   precluded. (6.) Of tears, dia dakruon. "I know a fifth," says Gregory
   Nazianzen, [553] "by tears, but very laborious, when a man washes (ho
   louon) his pillow and his bed every night with his tears." (7.) Of
   blood. The martyrs were baptized with blood. Christ's cross and death
   were called his baptism, because thereby purification was made for the
   sins of men. (8.) The baptism of fire. This is sometimes understood of
   the Holy Spirit, who purifies as fire does; at others of the final
   conflagration when the earth is to be purified by fire. With the
   fathers, therefore, the act of purification, and not simply or only the
   act of immersion, was baptism. [554]

   It is not denied that baptizein means to immerse, or that it is
   frequently so used by the fathers as by the classic authors; it is not
   denied that the Christian rite was often administered, after the
   apostolic age, by immersion; it is not even denied that during certain
   periods of the history of the Church, and in certain regions, immersion
   was the common method in which baptism was administered. But it is
   denied that immersion is essential to baptism; that it was the common
   method in the apostolic Churches; that it was at any time or in any
   part of the Church the exclusive method; and more especially is it
   denied that immersion is now and everywhere obligatory or necessary to
   the integrity of Christian baptism. [555]

   The Catholicity of the Gospel.

   The third general argument on this subject is derived from the fact
   that the Gospel is designed for all classes of persons and for all
   parts of the earth. It is not intended exclusively for the strong and
   robust, but also for the weak, the sick, and the dying. It is not to be
   confined to the warm or temperate regions of the earth, but it is to be
   preached and its ordinances are to be administered wherever fallen men
   can be found. Baptism by immersion would be to many of the sick
   certainly fatal; to the dying impossible. To the inhabitants of
   Greenland, if possible, it would be torture and to those dwelling in
   the deserts of Arabia or Africa, it could be administered only at long
   intervals or at the end of a long pilgrimage. Yet baptism is an
   imperative duty. The command of Christ is, "Go ye, therefore, and teach
   all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
   and of the Holy Ghost." It is not to be believed that our blessed Lord
   would have enjoined an external rite as the mode of professing his
   religion, the observance of which, under many circumstances, would be
   exceedingly difficult, and sometimes impossible.

   Argument from the Design of the Ordinance.

   This argument was adverted to in the beginning of this section. It
   requires, however, a more particular consideration. (1.) It is admitted
   that baptism is a sign, and that the blessing which it signifies is
   purification from sin. (2.) It is admitted that the theocratical
   purifications, having the same general import, were effected by
   immersion, affusion, and sprinkling. (3.) It is admitted that the soul
   is cleansed from the guilt of sin by the blood of Christ. (4.) It is
   admitted that under the Old Testament the application of the blood of
   the sacrifices for sin was expressed by the act of sprinkling. It was
   sprinkled on the people (Ex. xxiv. 8) for whose benefit the sacrifices
   were offered; it was sprinkled upon the altar; and, by the High Priest,
   upon the mercy seat. In the New Testament the application of the blood
   of Christ is expressed by the same word. "Elect . . . . unto . . . .
   sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ." (1 Pet. i. 2.) "The blood of
   sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel." (Heb. xii.
   24.) (5.) It is admitted, further, that the purification of the soul
   from the moral pollution of sin is effected by the renewing of the Holy
   Ghost. (6.) It is admitted that the communication of the sanctifying
   influences of the Spirit is expressed in the use of two familiar
   figures, that of anointing with oil, and that of the pouring of water.
   Kings, priests, and prophets were anointed. The people of God are
   called his "anointed." The Apostle John says to believers: "Ye have an
   unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things. . . . . The
   anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you." (1 John ii. 20
   and 27.) The other figure is no less familiar. (Is. xxxii. 15; Joel ii.
   28.) The Spirit's influences are compared to rain which waters the
   earth, and to the dew which falls on the mown grass. From all this it
   appears that the truth symbolized in baptism may be signified by
   immersion, affusion, or sprinkling; but that the ordinance is most
   significant and most conformed to Scripture, when administered by
   affusion or sprinkling.

   theocratical washings and purifications, was the purification of the
   soul from sin (Entsündigung)." On p. 89 it is said, "We find the

   hagio kai puri, opp. en hudati eis metanoian. comp. Luke iii. 16, John
   i. 33. That is not the meaning of immersion, but of washing with the
   design of purification,' that is transferred, is plain from the
   antithesis between en hud. and en pn. whereby the two baptisms are
   distinguished."
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 8. The Formula of Baptism.

   This is authoritatively prescribed in Matthew xxviii. 19. Christ gave a
   command perpetually binding on his Church to baptize men "in the name
   of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." In this passage
   the preposition eis (eis to onoma) means unto, or, in reference to.
   Paul asks the Corinthians, "were ye baptized eis to onoma Paulou;" (1
   Cor. i. 13. Did your baptism make you the disciples of Paul?) He tells
   them (1 Cor. x. 2) that the fathers, "were baptized unto Moses" eis to
   Mosen, they were made and professed to be the disciples of Moses. So in
   Romans vi. 3, it is said we "were baptized eis Christon Iesoun unto
   Jesus Christ." Galatians iii. 27, "Baptized into (eis) Christ."
   According to this formula, he who receives baptism as a Christian rite,
   thereby professes to stand in that relation to the Father, Son, and
   Spirit which those who receive the religion of Christ sustain. That is,
   he professes to receive God the Father, as his father; God the Son, as
   his Saviour, and God the Holy Ghost as his teacher and sanctifier; and
   this involves the engagement to receive the Word, of which the Spirit
   is the author, as the rule of his faith and practice. [556]

   There are several cases in which baptism is said to have been
   administered en to onomati in, or on, the name of Christ, instead of
   eis to onoma into, or, in reference to. And in Acts ii. 38, the
   preposition epi is used, epi to onomati. It is doubtful whether
   anything materially different was intended to be expressed by this
   change of the prepositions and cases. To baptize, epi, or en onomati,
   means to baptize "upon the name," sc., of Christ, that is, upon the
   authority of Christ. The rite is administered in obedience to his
   command, in the form in which he prescribed, said with the intent for
   which he ordained it.

   In the Acts it is repeatedly said that the Apostles baptized their
   converts in "the name of Christ." It is not to be inferred from this
   fact that they departed from the form prescribed in Matthew xxviii. 19,
   and administered the ordinance in the use of the words, I baptize thee
   in the name of Christ;' or, I baptize thee eis Christon unto Christ.'
   Such inference is unnecessary; as baptism administered in the way
   prescribed in Matthew xxviii. 19, is a baptism both in the name, or, by
   the authority of Christ, and unto or in reference to Him. As this
   inference is unnecessary so it is improbable. It is in the highest
   degree improbable that the Apostles would have departed from the form
   so solemnly prescribed by their Divine Master; and it is moreover
   improbable that any such departure took place from the fact that the
   form prescribed in Matthew has been used in all ages and parts of the
   Church.

   § 9. The Subjects of Baptism.

   "Baptism is not to be administered to any that are out of the risible
   Church, till they profess their faith in Christ and obedience to Him:
   but the infants of such as are members of the visible Church are to be
   baptized." [557]

   The question, Who are the proper subjects of baptism? is determined by
   the design of the ordinance and the practice of the Apostles. It has
   been shown that, according to our standards, the sacraments (and of
   course baptism) were instituted, to signify, seal, and apply to
   believers the benefits of the redemption of Christ. The reception of
   baptism, so far as adults are concerned, is an intelligent, voluntary
   act, which from its nature involves, (1.) A profession of faith in
   Christ, and (2) A promise of allegiance to Him.

   This is clear, --

   1. From the command of Christ to make disciples of all nations,
   baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy
   Ghost. A disciple, however, is both a recipient of doctrines taught,
   and a follower. Every one, therefore, who is made a disciple by
   baptism, enrolls himself among the number of those who receive Christ
   as their teacher and Lord, and who profess obedience and devotion to
   his service.

   2. This is further clear from the uniform practice of the Apostles. In
   every case on record of their administering the rite, it was on the
   condition of a profession of faith on the part of the recipient. The
   answer of Philip to the eunuch who asked, What doth hinder me to be
   baptized? "If thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest,"
   discloses the principle on which the Apostles uniformly acted in this
   matter.

   3. This has in all ages been the practice of the Church. No man was
   admitted to baptism without an intelligent profession of faith in
   Christ, and a solemn engagement of obedience to Him. The practice of
   Romanist missionaries in baptizing the heathen in crowds, can hardly be
   considered as invalidating this statement.

   Although this has been the principle universally admitted, there has
   been no little diversity as to its application, according to the
   different views of the nature of the faith, and of the character of the
   obedience required by the Gospel. In some points, however, there has
   ever been a general agreement.

   Qualifications for Adult Baptism.

   1. Faith supposes knowledge of at least the fundamental doctrines of
   the Gospel. Some may unduly enlarge, and some unduly restrict the
   number of such doctrines; but no Church advocates the baptism of the
   absolutely ignorant. If baptism involves a profession of faith, it must
   involve a profession of faith in certain doctrines; and those doctrines
   must be known, in order to be professed. In the early Church,
   therefore, there was a class of catechumens or candidates for baptism
   who were under a regular course of instruction. This course continued,
   according to circumstances, from a few months, to three years. These
   catechumens were not only young men, but often persons in mature life,
   and of all degrees of mental culture. Where Christian churches were
   established in the midst of large heathen cities, the Gospel could not
   fail to excite general attention. The interest of persons of all
   classes would be more or less awakened. Many would be so impressed with
   the excellence of the new religion, as to desire to learn its doctrines
   and join themselves to the company of believers. These candidates for
   baptism, being in many cases men of the highest culture, it was
   necessary that their teachers should be men thoroughly instructed and
   disciplined. We accordingly find such men as Pantænus, Clemens, and
   Origen successively at the head of the catechetical school of
   Alexandria. [558] These schools, although primarily designed for
   converts from among the Jews and heathen, on account of their high
   character, soon began to be frequented by other classes, and especially
   by those who were in training for the ministry. When Christianity
   became the prevalent religion, and the ranks of the Church were filled
   up, not by converts of mature age, but by those born within its pale
   and baptized in their infancy, the necessity for such schools no longer
   existed. Their place, however, was supplied by the systematic
   instruction of the young in preparation for their confirmation or their
   first communion.

   2. All churches are agreed in demanding of adults who are candidates
   for baptism, a profession of their faith in Christ and the Gospel of
   his salvation.

   3. They agree in requiring of those who are baptized the renunciation
   of the world, the flesh, and the devil. This involves a turning from
   sin, and a turning to God.

   Although these principles are, as just remarked, generally admitted,
   there is, in practice, great diversity in their application. Where the
   Church was pure and its ministers faithful, these requisitions were
   strenuously enforced; but where the reverse was the case, the most
   formal, and often evidently insincere, assent to the creed of the
   Church was taken for a profession of faith; and a renunciation of the
   world compatible with devotion to its pleasures and its sins, was
   accepted in the place of genuine repentance. It is well, however, to
   have a clear idea of what the Church has a right to demand of adults
   when they apply for baptism. It is evident from the teachings of
   Scripture, and from the avowed principles of all Christian churches,
   that we are bound to require of all such candidates, (1.) A competent
   knowledge of the Gospel. (2.) A credible profession of faith. (3.) A
   conversation void of offence.

   The question, although thus simple in its general statement, in
   nevertheless one of great difficulty. As it is almost universally the
   fact that, so far as adults are concerned, the qualifications for
   baptism are the same as those for admission to the Lord's table, the
   question, What are the qualifications for adult baptism? resolves
   itself into the question, What are the qualifications for
   church-membership? The answer to that question, it is evident, must be
   determined by the views taken of the nature and the prerogatives of the
   Church. We accordingly find that there are three general views of the
   qualifications for adult baptism, founded on the three generic views of
   the nature of the Church.

   Romish Theory of the Church.

   First, the theory derived from the ancient theocracy and from the
   analogy between the Church and a civil commonwealth. The theocracy, or
   the Church, under the old dispensation, was essentially an externally
   organized body. All the natural descendants of Abraham, through Isaac,
   were, in virtue of their birth, members of the "Commonwealth of
   Israel." As such, independently of their own moral character or that of
   their parents, they were entitled to all the privileges of the economy
   under which they lived. They were freely admitted to the services of
   the Temple, to the Passover, and to all the sacred festivals, and
   typical institutions of the Mosaic dispensation, even to those which
   were truly of a sacramental character. The Hebrews were, of course,
   subject to the laws of the theocracy under which they lived; for minor
   offences they forfeited this or that privilege, or were subjected to
   some specified penalty; and for graver offences they were
   excommunicated or cut off from among the people. All this finds a
   parallel in the kingdoms of this world. All native born Englishmen are
   subjects of the crown, and are entitled to all the privileges of
   Englishmen; they may be good or bad citizens, but their citizenship
   does not depend upon their character, they may be punished for their
   offences, but they cannot be deprived of their rights as citizens
   unless they are outlawed.

   This theory has, by Romanists and Romanizers, been transferred bodily
   to the Church. The Church, according to them, is essentially an
   externally organized society. All born within its pale are "ipso facto"
   its members, and entitled to all its privileges. They are entitled to
   all its sacraments and ordinances, not in virtue of their character,
   but in virtue of their birthright. Thus Mr. Palmer, [559] of the Oxford
   Anglican School, says that the Scriptures make no mention of
   regeneration, sanctity, or real piety visible or invisible, as
   prerequisites for admission to the sacrament of baptism. [560] No doubt
   a pious Hebrew priest would exhort those who came to offer sacrifices
   or to celebrate the Passover, that they should attend on those services
   in a devout spirit and in the exercise of faith, assuring them that the
   mere external service was of no account. The Romanist, with his "ex
   opere operato" theory of the sacraments, could hardly go as far as
   that, but he would doubtless exhort the candidate for baptism, and all
   who come to the sacraments of the Church, to perform those duties in a
   proper spirit. But this has nothing to do with the right of approach.
   We may exhort citizens to exercise their civil rights conscientiously,
   and with a due regard to the interests of the country, but the rights
   themselves are not to be disputed.

   The same result is reached, although on a different theory, in all
   those countries in which Church and State are so united that the head
   of the State is the head of the Church; and that membership in the
   Church is a condition of citizenship in the State. This was the case
   for centuries in England, and is so to a great extent to the present
   day. The reigning sovereign is still the head of the Church, the
   supreme authority in administering its government. The laws of the
   Church are acts of Parliament; every Englishman, unless he voluntarily
   makes himself an exception, has a right to all the services of the
   Church, including the right to be buried as a Christian "in the sure
   hope of a blessed resurrection." Until of late years no man could hold
   any important office, especially in the army or navy, who was not in
   communion with the established Church. So also in Prussia, the head of
   the State governs the Church. No man, unless a Romanist or a Hebrew,
   can marry, become an apprentice, or enter on the practice of a
   profession without producing a certificate of baptism and confirmation.

   Puritan Theory of the Church.

   The second general theory of the nature of the Church is that, which
   for convenience sake, may be called the Puritan. The word Puritan has
   in history a much wider sense than that assigned to it in modern usage.
   In English history the designation Puritan was applied to all those,
   who under the reigns of Elizabeth and Charles I. were desirous of a
   further reformation of the Church. Many prelates, and thousands of
   Episcopalians and Presbyterians, were included in that class. Modern
   usage has confined the term to the Independents or Congregationalists,
   the followers of Brown and Robinson. They were, therefore, often called
   Brownists. According to them the visible Church consists of the
   regenerate; and it is the duty and the prerogative of the Church to sit
   in judgment on the question whether the applicant for admission to the
   sacraments is truly born of God. Hence in New England, there was a
   broad distinction made between the Church and the parish. The former
   consisted of the body of communicants; the latter of those who, though
   not communicants, frequented the same place of worship and contributed
   to the support of the minister and to other congregational expenses.
   "To join the Church," thus came to mean joining the number of those who
   were admitted to the Lord's Supper. This of course implies, that
   communicants only are in the Church. This view has gained ascendancy in
   this country even, to a great extent, among Presbyterians.

   The Common Protestant Theory.

   According to our standards the visible Church consists of all those who
   profess the true religion together with their children. The common
   Protestant theory of the Church agrees with that of the Puritans in the
   following points. (1.) That the true or invisible Church as a whole
   consists of the elect. This is the Church which Christ loved, for which
   He gave Himself, that He might sanctify it, and present it to Himself a
   glorious Church without spot or wrinkle. (Eph. v. 25-27.) (2.) That the
   true or invisible Church on earth consists of all true believers. (3.)
   That the profession of faith made by those who are baptized, or come to
   the table of the Lord, is a profession of true faith. That is, those
   baptized profess to be Christians. The point of difference between the
   theories concerns the duty and prerogative of the Church in the matter.
   According to the one view the Church is bound to be satisfied in its
   judgment that the applicant is truly regenerate; according to the
   other, no such judgment is expressed or implied in receiving any one
   into the fellowship of the Church. As Christ has not given his people
   the power to search the heart, He has not imposed upon them the duty
   which implies the possession of any such power. Both parties require a
   credible profession of faith on the part of the applicant for
   membership. But the one means by credible, that which constrains
   belief; the other, that which may be believed, i.e., that against which
   no tangible evidence can be adduced. If such applicant be a heretic, or
   if his manner of life contradicts his profession, he ought not to be
   received; and if already in the Church, he ought, as the Apostle says,
   to be rejected. The common Protestant doctrine is that nothing
   authorizes us to refuse a man admission to the Church, which would not
   justify his exclusion if already a member of it. If guilty of any
   "offence" or "scandal," he ought to be excluded; and if chargeable with
   any such "offence" or "scandal," he ought not to be admitted to
   membership, no matter what his profession or detail of experience may
   be. The late Dr. John M. Mason clearly and forcibly expresses the
   common doctrine on this subject, when he says: "A credible profession
   of Christianity, is all that she [the Church] may require in order to
   communion. She may be deceived; her utmost caution may be, and often
   has been, ineffectual to keep bad men from her sanctuary. And this,
   too, without her fault, as she is not omniscient. But she has no right
   to suspect sincerity, to refuse privilege, or inflict censure, where
   she can put her finger upon nothing repugnant to the love or the laws
   of God." [561] And on the following page he says: "A profession of
   faith in Christ, and of obedience to Him, not discredited by other
   traits of character, entitles an adult to the privileges of his
   Church."

   This is not the place for the discussion of the question concerning the
   nature of the Church. These theories are simply mentioned here because
   of their bearing on the subject of adult baptism. According to all
   these theories believing adults are, by the command of Christ, entitled
   to Christian baptism. Much more difficulty attends the question
   concerning

   [560] This is not inconsistent with what was said above of all churches
   requiring as the conditions of adult baptism, competent knowledge, a
   profession of faith, and the renunciation of the world. What was there

   § 10. Infant Baptism.

   The difficulty on this subject is that baptism from its very nature
   involves a profession of faith; it is the way in which by the ordinance
   of Christ, He is to be confessed before men; but infants are incapable
   of making such confession; therefore they axe not the proper subjects
   of baptism. Or, to state the matter in another form: the sacraments
   belong to the members of the Church; but the Church is the company of
   believers; infants cannot exercise faith, therefore they are not
   members of the Church, and consequently ought not to be baptized.

   In order to justify the baptism of infants, we must attain and
   authenticate such an idea of the Church as that it shall include the
   children of believing parents. The word Church is used in Scripture and
   in common life, in many different senses, (1.) It means the whole body
   of the elect, as in Ephesians v. 25, and when the Church is said to be
   the body, or the bride of Christ, to be filled by his Spirit, etc. (2.)
   It means any number of believers collectively considered; or the whole
   number of believers residing in any one place, or district, or
   throughout the world. In this sense we use the word when we pray God to
   bless his Church universal, or his Church in any particular place. (3.)
   It is used as a collective term for the body of professed believers in
   any one place; as when we speak of the Church of Jerusalem, of Ephesus,
   or of Corinth. (4.) It is used of any number of professed believers
   bound together by a common standard of doctrine and discipline; as the
   Church of England, the Church of Scotland, the Lutheran Church, and the
   Reformed Church. And (5.) It is used for all the professors of the true
   religion throughout the world, considered as united in the adoption of
   the same general creed and in common subjection to Christ.

   It is evident that no one definition of the Church can include all the
   senses in which the word is legitimately used; and, therefore, that we
   may affirm of the Church in one sense of the word, what must be denied
   of it in a different sense; and the same person may be said to be, or
   not to be a member of the Church according to the meaning attached to
   the word. In the present discussion, by the Church is meant what is
   called the visible Church; that is, the whole body of those who profess
   the true religion, or, any number of such professors united for the
   purpose of the public worship of Christ, and for the exercise of mutual
   watch and care. With regard to infant baptism the following
   propositions may be maintained.

   First Proposition. The Visible Church is a Divine Institution.

   Concerning the Church in this sense, it is clearly taught in Scripture,
   that it is the will of God that such a Church should exist on earth.
   This no Christian denies. God has imposed duties upon his people which
   render it necessary for them thus to associate in a visible organized
   body. They are to unite in him worship; in teaching and propagating his
   truth; in testifying for God in all ages and in all parts of the world.
   He has prescribed the conditions of membership in this body, and taught
   who are to be excluded from its communion. He has appointed officers,
   specified their qualifications, their prerogatives, and the mode of
   their appointment. He has enacted laws for its government. Its rise,
   progress, and consummation are traced in history and prophecy, from the
   beginning to the end of the Bible. This is the kingdom of God of which
   our Lord discourses in so many of his parables, and which it is
   predicted is ultimately to include all the nations of the earth.

   Second Proposition. The Visible Church does not consist exclusively of
   the Regenerate.

   It is no less clearly revealed that it is not the purpose of God that
   the visible Church on earth should consist exclusively of true
   believers. This is plain, (1.) Because the attainment of such a result
   in any society or government administered by men is an impossibility.
   It would require that the officers of the Church or the Church itself
   should have the power to read the heart, and be infallible in judgments
   of character. (2.) The conditions which, under both dispensations, He
   has prescribed for admission into this visible society of his professed
   worshippers, are such as men not truly regenerated may possess. Those
   qualifications, as we have seen, are competent knowledge, and a
   credible profession of faith and obedience. (3.) Our Lord expressly
   forbids the attempt being made. He compares his external kingdom, or
   visible Church, to a field in which tares and wheat grow together. He
   charged his disciples not to undertake to separate them, because they
   could not, in all cases, distinguish the one from the other. Both were
   to be allowed to grow together until the harvest. (4.) Christ, to whom
   all hearts are known, admitted Judas to the number of his most favoured
   disciples, and even made him an Apostle. (5.) All attempts to make a
   Church consisting exclusively of the regenerate, have failed. So far as
   known, no such Church has ever existed on the face of the earth. This
   of itself is proof that its existence did not enter into the purpose of
   God.

   Third Proposition. The Commonwealth of Israel was the Church.

   (1.) It is so called in Scripture. (Acts vii. 38.) (2.) The Hebrews
   were called out from all the nations of the earth to be the peculiar
   people of God. They constituted his kingdom. (3.) To them were
   committed the oracles of God. They were Israelites to them pertained
   the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the
   law, and the service, and the promises. (Rom. ix. 4.) Nothing more can
   be said of the Church under the new dispensation. They were selected
   for a Church purpose, namely, to be witnesses for God in the world in
   behalf of the true religion; to celebrate his worship; and to observe
   his ordinances. Their religious officers, prophets, and priests, were
   appointed by God and were his ministers. No man could become a member
   of the Commonwealth of Israel, who did not profess the true religion;
   promise obedience to the law of God as revealed in his Word; and submit
   to the rite of circumcision as the seal of the covenant. There is no
   authorized definition of the Church, which does not include the people
   of God under the Mosaic law.

   Fourth Proposition. The Church under the New Dispensation is identical
   with that under the Old.

   It is not a new Church, but one and the same. It is the same
   olive-tree. (Rom. xi. 16, 17) It is founded on the same covenant, the
   covenant made with Abraham. It has, indeed, often been said that it is
   to belittle the truth to put the idea of a covenant between God and man
   in the place of a general law or economy. It is, however, to be
   remembered that God is a person, capable of speaking with other
   persons, of promising and threatening. These promises are not merely
   announcements of the results of cosmical laws, physical or moral. That
   Christ should be born of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Judah,
   and of the house of David, is not to be attributed to the working of
   any general law. Nothing pertaining to his advent, his person, his
   work, or to the application of his redemption, is to be accounted for
   in any such way. Our Lord gives us an infinitely higher idea of God's
   relation to the world when He tells us that He feeds the young ravens
   when they cry; and that the hairs of our heads are all numbered; than
   when He is regarded as merely the author or source of the physical and
   moral order of the universe. A covenant is a promise suspended upon a
   condition. It is beyond controversy that God did make such a promise to
   Adam, to Abraham, and to the Hebrew nation through Moses; and these
   transactions are in Scripture constantly called covenants. It does not,
   therefore, seem very reverent to speak of God as belittling his truth
   by the form in which He presents it.

   God, then, did enter into covenant with Abraham. In that covenant He
   promised that Abraham, although nearly a hundred years old, should have
   a son. He promised that his descendants, through Isaac, should be as
   numerous as the stars in heaven; that He would give them the land of
   Canaan for a possession; that He would be their national God, and that
   the Hebrews as a nation should be His peculiar people; and above all He
   promised the patriarch that in his seed all the nations of the earth
   should be blessed. By seed was not meant his descendants collectively,
   but one person, that is, Christ. (Gal. iii. 16.) The blessing promised,
   therefore, was the blessing of redemption through Christ, his promise
   to Abraham was a repetition of the promise made to our first parents
   after the fall, this promise was the Gospel. The Gospel or euangelion
   has a definite meaning in the Scriptures. It means the announcement of
   the plan of salvation through Christ, and the offer of that salvation
   to every one that believes. This Gospel, Paul says, was preached before
   unto Abraham. The pious Hebrews are, therefore, described as (tous
   proelpikotas en to Christo) those who hoped in Christ before his
   advent. (Eph. i. 12.) This promise of redemption made to Abraham was
   that "unto which," Paul says, "our twelve tribes, instantly servmng God
   day and night, hope to come." (Acts xxvi. 7.) The condition of all
   these Abrahamic promises was faith. This the Apostle abundantly
   teaches, especially in the fourth chapter of Romans and the third
   chapter of Galatians. Abraham believed in the promise of the birth of
   Isaac. (Rom. iv. 19, 20.) Those of his descendants who believed in the
   promises of national blessings made to the Hebrews, received those
   blessings, those who believed in the promise of redemption through
   Christ were made partakers of that redemption.

   Such being the nature of the covenant made with Abraham, it is plain
   that so far as its main element is concerned, it is still in force. It
   is the covenant of grace under which we now live, and upon which the
   Church is now founded. This cannot be doubted by any who admit the
   account just given of the Abrahamic covenant. This is clear because the
   promise is the same. Paul says (Gal. iii. 14) that the blessing
   promised to Abraham has come upon us. In his speech before Agrippa, he
   said: "I stand, and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God
   unto our fathers. . . . . For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am
   accused of the Jews." (Acts xxvi. 6, 7.) As the promise is the same, so
   also the condition is the same. The Apostle argues that men now must be
   justified by faith, because Abraham was thus justified. Christians,
   therefore, are said to be the sons or heirs of Abraham, because faith
   in the promise of redemption secures their redemption just as faith in
   the same promise secured his. And he tells the Galatians, "If ye be
   Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the
   promise." (Gal. iii. 29.) This doctrine, that the Church now rests on
   the Abrahamic covenant, in other words, that the plan of salvation
   revealed in the Gospel was revealed to Abraham and to the other Old
   Testament saints, and that they were saved just as men since the advent
   of Christ are saved, by faith in the promised seed, is not a matter
   incidentally revealed. It is wrought into the very substance of the
   Gospel. It is involved in all the teachings of our Lord, who said that
   He came not to destroy, but to fulfil; and who commanded inquirers to
   search the Old Testament Scriptures if they would learn what He taught.
   The Apostles did the same thing. The Bereans were commended, because
   they searched the Scriptures daily to see whether the doctrines taught
   by the Apostles accorded with that infallible standard. (Acts xvii.
   11.) The messengers of Christ constantly quoted the Old Testament in
   support of their teachings. Paul says that the Gospel which he preached
   had been taught already in the law and the prophets. (Rom. iii. 21.) He
   tells the Gentiles that they were grafted in the old olive-tree and
   made partakers of its root and fatness.

   The conclusion is that God has ever had but one Church in the world.
   The Jehovah of the Old Testament is our Lord; the God of Abraham,
   Isaac, and Jacob, is our covenant God and Father; our Saviour was the
   Saviour of the saints who lived before his advent in the flesh. The
   divine person who delivered the Israelites out of Egypt; who led them
   through the wilderness; who appeared in his glory to Isaiah in the
   temple; towards whose coming the eyes of the people of God were turned
   in faith and hope from the beginning, is He whom we recognize as God
   manifest in the flesh, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. He,
   therefore, who was the head of the theocracy is the head of the Church.
   The blood which He shed for us, was shed from the foundation of the
   world, as much "for the redemption of the transgressions which were
   under the first testament" (Heb. ix. 15), as for us and for our
   salvation. The promise unto which the twelve tribes, instantly serving
   God day and night, hoped to come (Acts xxvi. 7), is the promise on
   which we rely. The faith which saved Abraham was, both as to its nature
   and as to its object, that which is the condition of salvation under
   the Gospel. "The city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker
   is God" (Heb. xi. 10), is "Jerusalem the golden," the heaven to which
   we aspire.

   Fifth Proposition. The terms of admission into the Church before the
   Advent were the same that are required for admission into the Christian
   Church.

   Those terms were a credible profession of faith in the true religion, a
   promise of obedience, and submission to the appointed rite of
   initiation. Every sincere Israelite really received Jehovah as his God,
   relied upon all his promises, and especially upon the promise of
   redemption through the seed of Abraham. He not only bound himself to
   obey the law of God as then revealed, but sincerely endeavoured to keep
   all his commandments. Those who were Israelites only in name or form,
   or, as the Apostle expresses it, were "Jews outwardly," made the same
   professions and engagements, but did so only with the lips and not with
   the heart. If any from among the heathen assayed to enter the
   congregation of the Lord, they were received upon the terms above
   specified, and to a place equal to, and in some cases better than, that
   of sons and of daughters. If any Israelite renounced the religion of
   his fathers, he was cut off from among the people. All this is true in
   reference to the Church that now is. The Christian Church requires of
   those whom it receives to membership in visible communion, nothing more
   than a credible profession of faith, the promise of obedience to
   Christ, and submission to baptism as the rite of initiation. There has,
   therefore, been no change of the terms of admission to the Church,
   effected by the introduction of the Gospel.

   Sixth Proposition. Infants were Members of the Church under the Old
   Testament Economy.

   This is conclusively proved by the fact that infants, by the command of
   God, were circumcised on the eighth day after their birth. It is indeed
   said that circumcision was the sign of the national covenant between
   God and the Hebrews; and, therefore, that its administration to
   children was only a recognition of their citizenship in the
   commonwealth of Israel.

   To this it may be answered, first, that under the old economy the
   Church and State were identical. No man could be a member of the one
   without being a member of the other. Exclusion from the one was
   exclusion from the other. In the pure theocracy the high priest was the
   head of the State as well as the head of the Church. The priests and
   Levites were civil as well as religious officers. The sacrifices, and
   the festivals, even the Passover, ever regarded as a sacrament, were
   national as well as religious services. If, therefore, circumcision was
   a sign and seal of membership in the Hebrew nation, it was a sign and
   seal of membership in the Hebrew Church. All this arose from the nature
   of God's covenant with Abraham. In that covenant, as we have seen, were
   included both national and religious promises. God selected the
   descendants of that patriarch through Isaac to be a people peculiar to
   himself, He constituted them a nation to be secluded and hedged around
   from other nations, He gave them the land of Canaan for a habitation,
   and He enacted for them a code of laws, embracing their civil,
   national, social, personal, and religious duties. All these enactments
   were mingled together. The people were not regarded as bearing distinct
   relations to the magistrate and to God. All their obligations were to
   Him. They were a holy people; a Church in the form of a nation. The
   great promise, as we have seen, was the promise of the redemption of
   the world by the Messiah. To this everything else was subordinate. The
   main design of the constitution of the Hebrews as a distinct nation,
   and of their separation from all other people, was to keep alive the
   knowledge of that promise. Almost the whole significancy and value of
   the priesthood, sacrifices, and temple service, were to prefigure the
   person, offices, and work of the Messiah. To the Hebrews as a people
   were committed the "oracles of God;" this was their grand distinction.
   Those oracles had reference to the great work of redemption. To suppose
   a man to be a Jew, and not at least a professed believer in those
   promises and predictions, is a contradiction. A man, therefore, was a
   member of the Jewish commonwealth, only in virtue of his being a member
   of the Jewish Church; at least, he could not be the former without
   being the latter. Consequently, every child who was circumcised in
   evidence that he was one of the chosen people, was thereby sealed as a
   member of the Church of God as it then existed.

   Secondly, that circumcision was not the sign exclusively of the
   national covenant with the Hebrews, is plain because it was enjoined
   upon Abraham and continued in practice hundreds of years before the
   giving of the law on Mount Sinai, when the people were inaugurated as a
   nation. It was instituted as the sign of the covenant (that is the
   Scriptural and proper word) made with Abraham. The essential features
   of that covenant we learn from such passages as Genesis xii. 3, "In
   thee shall all families of the earth be blessed." xvii. 7, "I will
   establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in
   their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee,
   and to thy seed after thee." These passages are explained in the New
   Testament. They are shown to refer, not to temporal or national
   blessings, but to the blessings of redemption. Thus in Romans xv. 8, it
   is said, "Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth
   of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers." Christ has
   redeemed us from the curse of the law, that the blessing of Abraham
   might come on us. (Gal. iii. 14.) This covenant, the Apostle goes on to
   argue, "that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was
   four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should
   make the promise of none effect." In short, the whole New Testament is
   designed to show that the covenant made with Abraham, and the promises
   therein contained, were executed and fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Of that
   covenant circumcision was the sign and seal.

   Thirdly, this is directly asserted by the Apostle in Romans iv. 9-12,
   where he proves that circumcision cannot be the ground of
   justification, because Abraham was justified before he was circumcised,
   and "received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of
   the faith which he had being yet uncircumcised." This is saying that
   circumcision is the seal of the covenant which promises salvation on
   the condition of faith. That is, it is the seal of the covenant of
   grace, or of the plan of salvation which has been the only ground of
   hope for man since his apostasy. If, therefore, children were
   circumcised by the command of God, it was because they were included in
   the covenant made with their fathers.

   Fourthly, that circumcision was not merely a civil or national
   institution, is further plain from its spiritual import. It signifies
   the cleansing from sin, just as baptism now does. Thus we read even in
   the Old Testament of the circumcision of the heart. (Deut. x. 16; Jer.
   iv. 4; Ezek. xliv. 7.) Therefore uncircumcised lips are impure lips,
   and an uncircumcised heart is an unclean heart. (Ex. vi. 12; Lev. xxvi.
   41. See, also, Acts vii. 51.) Paul says the true circumcision is not
   that which is outward in the flesh; but that which is inward, of the
   heart, by the Spirit. (Rom. ii. 28, 29) Therefore the Apostle speaking
   of himself and of other believers says, "We are the circumcision, which
   worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no
   confidence in the flesh." (Phil. iii. 3.) Such being the spiritual
   import of circumcision, its reference to the national covenant was a
   very subordinate matter. Its main design was to signify and seal the
   promise of deliverance from sin through the redemption to be effected
   by the promised seed of Abraham.

   Children, therefore, were included in the covenant of grace as revealed
   under the old dispensation, and consequently were members of the Church
   as it was then constituted. In the sight of God parents and children
   are one. The former are the authorized representatives of the latter;
   they act for them; they contract obligations in their name. In all
   cases, therefore, where parents enter into covenant with God, they
   bring their children with them. The covenant made with Adam included
   all his posterity; the promise made to Abraham was to him and to his
   seed after him; and when the Mosaic covenant was solemnly inaugurated,
   it was said, "Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God;
   your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with all
   the men of Israel, your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that
   is in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy
   water: that thou shouldst enter into covenant with the Lord thy God,
   and into his oath, which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day."
   (Deut. xxix. 10-12.) It is vain to say that children cannot make
   contracts or take an oath. Their parents can act for them; and not only
   bring them under obligation, but secure for them the benefits of the
   covenants into which they thus vicariously enter. If a man joined the
   commonwealth of Israel he secured for his children the benefits of the
   theocracy, unless they willingly renounced them. And so when a believer
   adopts the covenant of grace, he brings his children within that
   covenant, in the sense that God promises to give them, in his own good
   time, all the benefits of redemption, provided they do not willingly
   renounce their baptismal engagements.

   This is really the turning point in the controversy concerning infant
   church-membership. If the Church is one under both dispensations; if
   infants were members of the Church under the theocracy, then they are
   members of the Church now, unless the contrary can be proved. The next
   proposition, therefore, on this subject, to be established is, the

   Seventh Proposition, that there is nothing in the New Testament which
   justifies the Exclusion of the Children of Believers from Membership in
   the Church.

   The "onus probandi" rests on those who take the negative on this
   subject. If children are to be deprived of a birthright which they have
   enjoyed ever since there was a Church on earth, there must be some
   positive command for their exclusion, or some clearly revealed change
   in the conditions of membership, which renders such exclusion
   necessary. It need hardly be said that Christ did not give any command
   no longer to consider the children of believers as members of the
   Church, neither has there been any change in the conditions of
   church-membership which necessarily works their exclusion. Those
   conditions are now what they were from the beginning. It was
   inevitable, therefore, when Christ commanded his Apostles to disciple
   all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and
   of the Holy Spirit, that they should act on the principle to which they
   had always been accustomed. When under the Old Testament, a parent
   joined the congregation of the Lord, he brought his minor children with
   him. When, therefore, the Apostles baptized a head of a family, it was
   a matter of course, that they should baptize his infant children. We
   accordingly find several cases of such household baptism recorded in
   the Acts of the Apostles. In Acts xvi. 15, it is said Lydia "was
   baptized, and her household," and of the jailer at Philippi (ver. 33),
   that "he and all his" were baptized; and in 1 Corinthians i. 16, Paul
   says that he baptized the household of Stephanas. The Apostles,
   therefore, acted on the principle which had always been acted on under
   the old economy. It is to be remembered that the history of the
   Apostolic period is very brief, and also that Christ sent the Apostles,
   not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, and, therefore, it is not
   surprising that so few instances of household baptism are recorded in
   the New Testament. The same remark applies substantially to the age
   immediately succeeding that of the Apostles. The Church increased with
   great rapidity, but its accessions were from without; adult converts
   from among the Jews and Gentiles, who in becoming Christians, brought,
   as a matter of course, their children with them into the fold of
   Christ. Little, therefore, during this period is heard of the baptism
   of infants. As soon, however, as children born within the Church
   constituted the chief source of supply, then we hear more of baptisms
   for the dead; the ranks of the Church, as they were thinned by the
   decease of believers, being filled by those who were baptized to take
   their places. In the time of Tertullian and Origen infant baptism is
   spoken of, not only as the prevailing usage of the Church, but as
   having been practised from the beginning. When Pelagius was sorely
   pressed by Augustine with the argument in support of the doctrine of
   original sin derived from the baptism of infants, he did not venture to
   evade the argument by denying either the prevalence of such baptisms or
   the divine warrant for them. He could only say that they were baptized,
   not on account of what they then needed, but of what they might need
   hereafter. The fact of infant baptism and its divine sanction were
   admitted. These facts are here referred to only as a collateral proof
   that the practice of the New Testament Church did not in this matter
   differ from that of the Church as constituted before the advent of
   Christ.

   The conduct of our Lord in relation to children, in its bearing on this
   subject must not be overlooked. So far from excluding them from the
   Church in whose bosom they had always been cherished, He called them
   the lambs of his flock, took them into his arms, and blessed them, and
   said, of such is the kingdom of heaven. If members of his kingdom in
   heaven, why should they be excluded from his kingdom on earth? Whenever
   a father or mother seeks admission to the Christian Church, their heart
   prompts them to say: Here Lord am I and the children whom thou hast
   given me. And his gracious answer has always been: Suffer little
   children to come unto me and forbid them not.

   Eighth Proposition. Children need, and are capable of receiving the
   Benefits of Redemption.

   On this point all Christians are agreed. All churches -- the Greek, the
   Latin, the Lutheran, and the Reformed -- unite in the belief that
   infants need "the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ" and the
   renewing of the Holy Ghost in order to their salvation. The Reformed,
   at least, do not believe that those blessings are tied to the ordinance
   of baptism, so that the reception of baptism is necessary to a
   participation of the spiritual benefits which it symbolizes; but all
   agree that infants are saved by Christ, that they are the purchase of
   his blood, and that they need expiation and regeneration. They are
   united, also, in believing that all who seek the benefits of the work
   of Christ, are bound to be baptized in acknowledgment of its necessity
   and of their faith, and that those who need, but cannot seek, are, by
   the ordinance of God, entitled to receive the appointed sign and seal
   of redemption, whenever and wherever they are presented by those who
   have the right to represent them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 11. Whose Children are entitled to Baptism.

   This is a very delicate, difficult, and important question. No answer
   which can be given to it can be expected to give general satisfaction.
   The answers will be determined by the views taken of the nature of the
   Church and the design of the sacraments. Probably the answer which
   would include most of the views entertained on the subject, is, that
   the children of the members of the visible Church, and those for whose
   religious training such members are willing to become responsible,
   should be baptized. But this leaves many questions undecided, and
   allows room for great diversity of practice.

   Difference between the Jewish and Christian Usage.

   We have already seen under the old dispensation, (1.) That God made a
   nation his Church and his Church a nation. (2.) Consequently that
   membership in the one involved membership in the other, and exclusion
   from the one, exclusion from the other. (3.) That the conditions of
   admission to the Church were, therefore, the same as the conditions of
   admission into the commonwealth. (4.) That those conditions were
   profession of faith in the true religion, and a promise of obedience to
   the will of God as revealed in his word. (5.) That the State exacted
   this profession and enforced this obedience so far as the external
   conduct was concerned. All the people were required to be circumcised,
   to offer sacrifices, to observe the festivals, and to frequent the
   temple services. And, (6.) That this was God's way of preserving the
   knowledge of the true religion in that age of the world. And it
   succeeded. When Christ came, the uncorrupted Scriptures were read in
   the synagogues; the sacrifices as divinely appointed were offered in
   the temple; the high priest in his offices and work still stood before
   the people, as the type of Him who was to come. Under this system there
   could be no question as to whose children were to be circumcised.

   When Christ came and broke down the wall of partition between the Jews
   and Gentiles, and announced his Gospel as designed and adapted for all
   men, all this was changed. It followed from the fact that the Church
   was to embrace all nations. (1.) That the Church and State could no
   longer be united or identified as they had been under the theocracy.
   The Christian Church at the first was established in an enemy's
   country. For three centuries it was not only independent and separate
   from the State, but it was in every way opposed and persecuted by the
   civil power. It is still the fact that the Christian Church exists in
   Pagan and Mohammedan countries. (2.) From the necessity of the case it
   is a body independent of the State. It has its own organization, its
   own laws, its own officers, and its own conditions of membership. It
   has the right to administer its own discipline agreeably to the laws of
   Christ its king and head. (3.) As it was intended by Christ that his
   Church should be thus catholic or universal, existing under all forms
   of human government, civilized or savage, it was clearly his intention
   that it should be thus independent and distinct from the State. He
   declared that his kingdom was not of this world. It is not of the same
   kind with worldly kingdoms; it has different ends to accomplish, and
   different means for the attainment of those ends. It is spiritual, that
   is, concerned with the religious or spiritual, as distinguished from
   the secular interests of men. It moves, therefore, in a different
   sphere from the State, and the two need never come into collision. (4.)
   As the Church, since the advent is identical with the Church which
   existed before the advent, although so different in its organization,
   in its officers, and in its mode of worship, the conditions of
   church-membership are now what they were then. Those conditions still
   are credible profession of faith, and obedience to the divine law. But
   it is no longer the duty of the State to require such profession or to
   enforce such obedience, so that every citizen of the State should be
   "ipso facto" a member of the Church. The two bodies are now distinct. A
   man may be a member of the one, and not a member of the other. The
   Church has the right to exercise its own discretion, within the limits
   prescribed by Christ, as to the admission or exclusion of members.

   Doctrine of the Church of Rome on the Baptism of Children.

   It has already been remarked that the Romish theory of the Church is
   founded on that of the ancient theocracy. That theory, however, is
   necessarily modified by the catholicity of the Church. Being designed
   for all nations, it could not be identified with any one nation.
   National citizenship is no longer the condition of church-membership.
   Rome, however, teaches, --

   1. That the Church is, in its essential character, an external,
   organized society, so that no man can be a member of Christ's body and
   a partaker of his life, who is not a member of that society.

   2. The Church is an institute of salvation. Its sacraments are
   exclusively the channels for conveying to men the benefits of the
   redemption of Christ.

   3. As the sacraments are the only channels of grace, no gracious
   affections or fruits of the Spirit can be required of those who receive
   them. Being designed to make men good, goodness cannot be the condition
   of their reception or efficacy.

   4. The sacraments, and especially baptism, being thus necessary to
   salvation, it is the duty of all men to apply that they should be
   administered to them and to their children.

   5. With regard to those children whose parents, through ignorance or
   indifference, neglect to bring them to the Church for baptism, they may
   be presented by any one who takes an interest in their salvation, that
   they may be baptized on the faith of the Church, or on that of those
   who are willing to act as their sponsors. It is no matter, therefore,
   whether the parents of such children are Christians, Jews, Mohammedans,
   or Pagans, as they all need, so they are all entitled to the sacrament
   of baptism. To exclude them from baptism, is to exclude them from
   heaven.

   The Roman Catechism [562] declares that the people must be taught that
   our Lord has enjoined baptism on all men, so that they will all perish
   eternally unless they be renewed by the grace of baptism, whether their
   parents be believers or unbelievers. In the answer to the next question
   the Scriptural authority for the baptism of infants is given; and in
   answer to the following question it is taught that infants, when
   baptized, receive the grace signified, not because they believe by the
   assent of their own mind, but because of the faith of their parents if
   believers, and if not, then by the faith of the Church universal; and
   they may be properly offered for baptism by any one who is willing to
   present them, by whose charity they are brought into the communion of
   the Holy Spirit.

   6. Although not identified with the State, the Church theoretically
   absorbs the State, and does so in fact wherever it has the ascendancy.
   The Church is a body which has two arms -- a spiritual and a secular.
   It demands that the State require all its subjects to profess its
   faith, to receive its sacraments, and to submit to its discipline; and
   where it has not the power thus to render the State its tool, it openly
   asserts its right to do so. One of the encyclical letters of the
   present pope so openly denied the liberty of conscience, the liberty of
   the press, and the lawfulness of tolerating any other religion than
   that of the Church of Rome, that the late Emperor of the French forbade
   its publication in France; yet the Archbishop of New York read it in
   his cathedral to an immense and approving audience.

   The Roman Church, therefore, believing that baptism is essential to
   salvation, baptizes all children presented for that ordinance without
   regard to their immediate parentage or remote descent.

   Theories on which many Protestants contend for the propriety of the
   baptism of children other than those of believing parents.

   There are two principles on which the baptism of children whose parents
   are not members of the visible Church, is defended. The first is, that
   the promise is to parents and their children, and their children's
   children even to the thousandth generation. Children, therefore, whose
   immediate parents may have no connection with the Church, have not
   forfeited their privileges as children of the covenant. If the promise
   be to them, its sign and seal belongs to them. The second principle is,
   that of spiritual adoption. Children who are orphans, or whose parents
   are unfit or unwilling to bring them up in a Christian manner, may be
   so far adopted by those willing and qualified to assume the
   responsibility of their religious education as to become proper
   subjects of baptism. This principle is sanctioned in the Scriptures. In
   Genesis xvii. 12, God said to Abraham, "He that is eight days old shall
   be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations; he that
   is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is
   not thy seed." Our Church on the same principle in 1787 enjoined with
   regard to apprentices that "Christian masters and mistresses, whose
   religious professions and conduct are such as to give them a right to
   the ordinance of baptism for their own children, may and ought to
   dedicate the children of their household to God, in that ordinance,
   when they have no scruple of conscience to the contrary." In 18l6, it
   was decided, "(1.) It is the duty of masters who are members of the
   Church to present the children of parents in servitude to the ordinance
   of baptism, provided they are in a situation to train them up in the
   nurture and admonition of the Lord, thus securing to them the rich
   advantages which the Gospel provides. (2.) It is the duty of Christ's
   ministers to inculcate this doctrine, and to baptize all children of
   this description when presented by their masters." On the baptism of
   heathen children the Church in 1843 decided that such children are to
   be baptized, "who are so committed to the missions, or other Christian
   tuition, as to secure effectually their entire religious education."
   [563]

   It was on the authority of the two principles above mentioned that many
   of the most distinguished theologians of Holland contend that
   foundlings, whose parents were unknown, illegitimate children, and the
   children of excommunicated persons, should be admitted to baptism. The
   question whether heathen children, committed to the care of Christian
   missionaries, should be baptized was submitted to the Synod of Dort.
   There was a diversity of opinion on the subject among the members, but
   the majority decided against it; not, as would appear, from the
   language employed, because of either of the above principles being
   denied, but because of the uncertain tenure by which such children were
   held. It was feared that they might return to heathenism, and thus the
   scandal of baptized persons practising heathen rites be afforded. [564]

   A second theory advanced on this subject was that of a twofold
   covenant; one external, the other internal; answering to the
   distinction between the Church visible and invisible. God, under the
   old dispensation, entered into a covenant with the Hebrew nation
   constituting them his visible Church, which covenant was distinct from
   that in which eternal life was promised to those that truly believe in
   the Redeemer who was to come. The conditions of admission into this
   external, visible society, were outward profession of the true
   religion, and external obedience. The condition of admission into the
   invisible Church, was true and saving faith. The sacraments were
   attached to the external covenant. All who made this external
   profession and yielded this outward obedience to the Mosaic law, were
   of right entitled to circumcision, to the passover, and to all the
   privileges of the theocracy. So it is now according to the theory in
   hand. Christ designed to form an external, visible Church, furnished
   with a constitution, laws, and proper officers for their
   administration. The conditions of admission into this visible society,
   were the profession of speculative, or historical faith in his
   religion, and external conformity to its laws and the laws of his
   Church. To this external body all the ordinances of his religion are
   attached. Those, therefore, who apply for baptism or the Lord's Supper,
   do not profess to be the regenerated children of God. They simply
   profess to be believers as distinguished from infidels or scorners, and
   to be desirous to avail themselves of Church privileges for their own
   benefit and for the good of their children. From this body Christ
   gathers the great majority of his own people, making them members of
   his mystical body.

   De Moor gives a long account of the controversy. Vitringa, it appears,
   strenuously opposed this theory of a twofold covenant in its
   application to the New Testament economy. Marck as strenuously defended
   it. [565]

   This seems substantially the ground taken by the Rev. Mr. Stoddard,
   grandfather of President Edwards. Mr. Stoddard published, in 1707, a
   sermon on the Lord's Supper, in which he maintained, "That
   sanctification is not a necessary qualification to partaking of the
   Lord's Supper," and "That the Lord' s Supper is a converting
   ordinance." This was answered in a "Dissertation" by Dr. Increase
   Mather. To this Mr. Stoddard replied in "An Appeal to the Learned;
   being a Vindication of the right of visible saints to the Lord's
   Supper, though they be destitute of a saving work of God's Spirit on
   their hearts; against the exceptions of Mr. Increase Mather." President
   Edwards succeeded his grandfather as pastor of the Church in
   Northampton, Mass., in 1727, and for twenty years continued to act on
   the same principle on this subject as his grandfather. Having become
   convinced that that principle was unscriptural, he published, in 1749,
   "An humble Inquiry into the Rules of the Word of God, concerning the
   qualifications requisite to a complete standing and full communion in
   the visible Christian Church." His design was to prove that no one
   should be admitted to the Lord's table who is not in the judgment of
   the Church truly regenerate. This doctrine was very obnoxious to the
   people of his charge, and opposed to the sentiment and practice of the
   majority of the neighbouring churches. [566] The difficulty arising
   from this controversy was one of the principal causes which led to the
   dismission of President Edwards from his pastoral charge at
   Northampton. The views of Edwards soon gained the ascendancy in the
   Evangelical churches of New England, and to a great extent also among
   Presbyterians.

   The Rev. John Blair, a prominent minister of our Church, took
   substantially the ground of a twofold covenant. Mr. Blair, as well as
   his more distinguished brother, Rev. Samuel Blair, took an active part
   with Whitefield and the Tennents in the great revival which occurred
   about the middle of the last century, and belonged to what were called
   the New Lights in the controversy which issued in the schism of 1741.
   He does not, indeed, admit of a twofold covenant, but he teaches the
   same doctrine which that expression was intended to assert. The Church
   of Christ, he says, is very properly distinguished as visible and
   invisible. By the former is meant "the whole number of true believers
   wherever they are." "The visible Church consists of all those who by an
   external profession of the doctrines of the Gospel, and subjection to
   the laws and ordinances of Christ, appear as a society separated from
   the world, and dedicated to God and his service. In this view, in the
   present imperfect state, the Church comprehends branches that are
   withered, as well as those that bear fruit. Now the covenant of grace
   subsists between the blessed God and the Church, as such a visible
   Society, [567] and is rendered visible by a visible transaction and
   external administration in various ordinances; and comprehends sundry
   external privileges for the advantage and spiritual edification of the
   Church. Here are not two covenants, one for the invisible Church and
   another for the visible." Gomarus, a leader in the Synod of Dort, says
   two covenants should be distinguished. That with the visible Church he
   calls hypothetical, that with the invisible Church absolute. In the
   main point, however, they agree, for Mr. Blair goes on to say: "It is
   [to] the covenant of grace in this view, namely, as visibly subsisting
   between God and his Church, considered as a visible society, a public
   body separated and distinguished from the world, and dedicated to God,
   that the sacraments are annexed as visible signs and seals thereof."
   [568] A man, therefore, in coming to the Lord's table, or in presenting
   himself or his children for baptism, does not profess to be a member of
   the invisible, but only of the visible Church. God has commanded men
   not to steal, and not to neglect their religious duties; He commands
   them to pray; to hear his word; to attend the assemblies of his saints
   gathered for his worship; to be baptized; and to commemorate the
   Redeemer's death in the way of his appointment. All these duties are
   obligatory; and they are all to be performed in a right spirit. But a
   man, argues Mr. Blair, is not to wait until he thinks himself
   regenerate and is so regarded by the Church, before he attempts to obey
   them. The sacraments, he says, [569] "are not instituted to be visible
   signs of persons opinion or judgment concerning the exercises of their
   own hearts." He no more professes to be regenerated when he comes to be
   baptized than when he prays. His prayer is from its nature a profession
   of faith in the divine existence and perfections, in the power of God
   to hear and answer his requests; it is a confession of his necessities
   and of his dependence. And this profession and confession are sincere;
   so sincere that it is not only his duty, but his right to pray a right
   which no man may take from him. In like manner a man may be, in the
   same sense, sincere in his belief of the truth of the Gospel; sincere
   in his desire to obey the command of Christ, and secure the benefits of
   his salvation. "When the sons of the stranger," says Mr. Blair, "are
   instructed in the doctrines of the Gospel, are convinced in their
   judgment and conscience, they are true and exhibit the true religion;
   that they are bound by the authority of God to embrace it, and yield
   obedience to the divine laws; It is their immediate duty to embrace it,
   and that publicly and avowedly by joining themselves to the Lord, and
   his Church, in the sacrament of baptism; and thus make a public
   profession of the true religion, come under solemn obligations to walk
   in the ways of God's commandments, and under the care and discipline of
   the Church." [570] Such persons "are brought under the bond of the
   covenant. This should be early laid before them, to let them see that
   by this dedication to God, they are bound to perform all duties of
   religion for which they have capacity, to receive instruction and
   appear for religion as the professors thereof. As soon as they have a
   competency of knowledge, and are capable of the discipline of the
   Church, they are bound to commemorate the death of Christ, and renew
   their engagements to Him at his table, unless debarred by discipline
   for unchristian conduct. When they shall become parents, they are bound
   to dedicate their children to God in baptism." [571]

   Such were the views on this subject entertained by some of the most
   evangelical ministers of our Church during the last century and long
   afterwards. The same views prevailed, to some extent, also in New
   England.

   A third theory on which the baptism of children, whose parents are not
   communicants, is contended for, makes a distinction between baptism and
   the Lord's Supper. More is required for the latter than for the former;
   and, therefore, adults who are entitled to baptism for themselves and
   for their children, may not be entitled to admission to the Lord's
   table. This is one of the views on this general subject referred to by
   Vitringa and De Moor in the works above mentioned. The advocates of
   this theory appeal to the fact that the Apostles, who were no more able
   than other men to read the heart, baptized thousands on the on a simple
   external profession of faith. So Paul baptized the jailer at Philippi
   and his family "straightway," that is, as would appear, at midnight in
   the prison. Philip baptized the eunuch of Ethiopia as soon as he
   confessed that Jesus is the Son of God, although he knew nothing, so
   far as appears in the narrative, of his conduct either before or after.
   On the other hand, it is urged that these same Apostles required all
   who came to the Lord's Supper to examine themselves, and see whether
   they were in the faith, or whether Christ dwelt in them. This seems to
   have been the ground taken by Mr. Blair in the earlier part of his
   ministry; for he says in his preface [572] to his Essays: "Many of my
   friends will, probably, be surprised, to find I have changed may
   sentiments with respect to some subjects of one of the sacraments; for
   they know it was formerly my opinion, that the unregenerate ought not,
   by any means, to adventure to the Lord's table; though they ought to
   dedicate their children to God in baptism."

   This is also the theory which was known in New England as the "Half-Way
   Covenant." Many were recognized as entitled to present their children
   for baptism, who were not prepared for admission to the Lord's Supper.
   The controversy on this subject began in Hartford, Connecticut, in
   1654, 1655. Several councils were called, which failed to produce
   unanimity. The question was referred to a Synod of divines to meet in
   Boston. The Synod met and sat two or three weeks. "As to the case of
   such baptized persons as, without being prepared to come to the Lord's
   Supper, were of blameless character, and would own for themselves their
   baptismal obligations, it decided that they ought to be allowed to
   present their children for baptism. This assuming of baptismal
   obligations was called by opponents, taking the Half-way Covenant."
   [573]

   The Synod decided in favour of the following propositions: --

   "1. They that, according to Scripture, are members of the visible
   Church, are the subjects of baptism.

   "2. The members of the visible Church, according to Scripture, are
   confederate visible believers, in particular churches, and their infant
   seed, i.e., children in minority, whose next parents, one or both, are
   in covenant.

   "3. The infant seed of confederate visible believers, are members of
   the same Church with their parents, and when grown up are personally
   under the watch, discipline, and government of that church.

   "4. These adult persons are not, therefore, to be admitted to full
   communion, merely because they are, and continue members, without such
   further qualifications as the Word of God requireth thereunto.

   "5. Church-members who were admitted in minority, understanding the
   doctrine of faith, and publicly professing their assent thereto, not
   scandalous in life, and solemnly owning the covenant before the Church,
   wherein they give up themselves and their children to the Lord, and
   subject themselves to the government of Christ in the Church, their
   children are to be baptized.

   "6. Such church-members, who either by death, or some other
   extraordinary providence, have been inevitably hindered from publicly
   acting as aforesaid, yet have given the Church cause, in judgment of
   charity, to look at them as so qualified, and such as, had they been
   called thereunto, would have so acted, their children are to be
   baptized.

   "7. The members of orthodox churches, being sound in the faith and not
   scandalous in life, and presenting due testimony thereof; these
   occasionally coming from one church to another may have their children
   baptized in the church, whither they come, by virtue of communion of
   churches. But if they remove their habitation they ought orderly to
   covenant and subject themselves to the government of Christ in the
   church where they settle their abode, and so their children to be
   baptized. It being the church s duty to receive such into communion, so
   far as they are regularly fit for the same." [574]

   These propositions are founded on the following principles: --

   1. That as under the old economy the Temple was one, it had its outer
   and inner courts, and those who had access to the former were not
   thereby entitled to enter the latter; so under the new dispensation the
   visible Church is one, but it includes two classes of members; baptized
   professors of the true religion, and those who, giving evidence of
   regeneration, are admitted to the Lord's Supper.

   2. That the qualifications for baptism and for full communion are not
   identical. Many may properly be admitted to the former, who are not
   prepared for the latter.

   3. That baptism being a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, all who
   are baptized, whether adults or infants, are properly designated
   "foederati," members of the visible Church, believers, saints,
   Christians.

   4. That those baptized in infancy remain members of the visible Church
   until they are "discovenanted," as the Congregationalists express it;
   or, separated from it by a regular act of discipline.

   5. That being members of the Church, if free from scandal and
   continuing their profession, they are entitled to present their
   children for baptism.

   The decision of this Synod did not put an end to the controversy. It
   was, however, in accordance with the views of the majority of the New
   England churches. Its chief opponents were found among "the more
   conservative class of laymen. Its advocates among the clergy were from
   the first a majority, which went on increasing from generation to
   generation; and the Half-way Covenant, as it was opprobriously called,
   came to be approved by the general practice of the Congregational
   churches of New England." [575] Such, also, it is believed, although on
   somewhat different principles, was the general practice of the
   Presbyterian Church in this country until within a comparatively recent
   period of its history.

   The Puritan Doctrine on this Subject.

   The Puritans, in the restricted sense of that word, held, (1.) That the
   Church consists of the regenerate. (2.) That a particular church
   consists of a number of true believers united together by mutual
   covenant. (3.) That no one should be admitted to church-membership who
   did not give credible evidence of being a true child of God. (4.) They
   understood by credible evidence, not such as may be believed, but such
   as constrains belief. (5.) All such persons, and no others, were
   admitted to the Lord's Supper. They, therefore, constituted the Church,
   and to them exclusively belonged the privileges of church-membership,
   and consequently to them was confined the right of presenting their
   children for baptism. All other professors of the true religion,
   however correct in their deportment, were denied that privilege.

   These principles, when introduced by the Brownists in England, were
   opposed by the great body of Protestants in Great Britain and upon the
   Continent. They were brought to this country by the disciples of
   Robinson, and controlled the New England churches for many years. They
   were gradually relaxed when the theory above stated gained the
   ascendancy, which it retained until President Edwards published his
   "Essay," to which we have referred, which gradually changed the
   opinions and practice of the Congregational churches throughout the
   land, and to a great extent those of Presbyterians also.

   President Edwards, however, lays down one proposition, and devotes his
   whole treatise to proving another. The proposition which he undertakes
   to establish is, that none "ought to be admitted to the communion and
   privileges of members of the visible Church of Christ in complete
   standing, but such as are in profession, and in the eye of the Church's
   Christian judgment, godly or gracious persons." [576] What he proposes
   to prove, therefore, is that those only who, in the judgment of the
   Church, are godly or gracious persons are to be admitted to the
   sacraments. All his arguments, however, ten in number, are directed to
   prove that those who come to the Christian sacraments profess to be
   Christians. These propositions are very different. Many who assent to
   the latter, reject the former. The one has reference to the
   qualifications for church-membership in the sight of God; ths other
   concerns the legitimate power of the Church in receiving or rejecting
   those who apply for access to the ordinances which Christ has appointed
   as means of grace for the people. Edwards had far higher notions of
   Church power in this matter, than those entertained by the great body
   of Protestants. The reason why President Edwards confounded the
   propositions above mentioned, was, that those against whom he wrote did
   not deny the prerogative of the Church to sit in judgment on those who
   applied for Church privileges; that, with them, was not the matter in
   dispute. The question concerned the divinely appointed qualifications
   for membership in the Christian Church. Did Christ intend and ordain
   that those only whom the Church judged to be truly regenerated should
   be admitted; or did He design the sacraments, as Stoddard contended,
   for the unconverted; they is well as preaching, being appointed as
   means of conversion. This being, then, the only matter of debate, to it
   Edwards naturally confined his attention.

   Edwards is very explicit in his statement of the prerogative and duty
   of the Church in acting as a judge of the real character of those who
   profess to be Christians. He says: "By Christian judgment I intend
   something further than a kind of mere negative charity, implying that
   we forbear to censure and condemn a man, because we do not know but
   that he may be godly, and therefore forbear to proceed on the foot of
   such a censure or judgment in our treatment of him: as we would kindly
   entertain a stranger, not knowing but in so doing we entertain an angel
   or precious saint of God. But I mean a positive judgment, founded on
   some positive appearance, or visibility, some outward manifestations
   that ordinarily render the thing probable. There is a difference
   between suspending our judgment, or forbearing to condemn, or having
   some hope that possibly the thing may be so, and so hoping the best;
   and a positive judgment in favour of a person." [577]

   Edwards is careful not to make any detail of religious experience the
   ground upon which the Church was to rest its judgment. This was one of
   the charges brought against his scheme which he earnestly resists. In
   reply to this objection [578] he quotes the following passage from his
   work on "Religious Affections:" "In order to persons' making a proper
   profession of Christianity, such as the Scripture directs to, and such
   as the followers of Christ should require in order to the acceptance of
   the professors with full charity, as of their society, it is not
   necessary they should give an account of the particular steps and
   method, by which the Holy Spirit, sensibly to them, wrought and brought
   about those great essential things of Christianity in their hearts.
   There is no footstep in Scripture of any such way of the Apostles, or
   primitive ministers and Christians requiring any such relation in order
   to their receiving and treating others as their Christian brethren, to
   all intents and purposes; or of their first examining them concerning
   the particular method and order of their experiences. They required of
   them a profession of the things wrought; but no account of the manner
   of working was required of them. Nor is there the least shadow in the
   Scripture of any such custom in the Church of God, from Adam to the
   death of the Apostle John."

   According to this theory, therefore, the Church consists of those who
   are "judged" to be regenerate. None but those thus declared to be true
   believers are to be received as members of the Church. They alone are
   entitled to the sacraments either for themselves or for their children,
   and consequently only the children of communicants are to be admitted
   to baptism. It may be remarked on this theory, --

   1. That it is a novelty. It had never been adopted or acted upon by any
   church on earth, until the rise of the Independents.

   2. It has no warrant from Scripture either by precept or example. Under
   the old economy those who professed the true religion were admitted to
   the theocracy; but no body of men sat in judgment on the question of
   their regeneration. Those thus admitted, unless excluded judicially,
   had a right to the sacraments of the Church for themselves and for
   their children. The Apostles acted upon precisely the same principle.
   It is impossible that they should have examined and decided favourably
   as to the regeneration of each of the five thousand persons added to
   the Church in one day in Jerusalem. The whole Church, for more than a
   thousand years, followed the example of the Apostles in this matter.

   3. The attempt to make the visible Church consist exclusively of true
   believers must not only inevitably fail of success, but it must also be
   productive of evil. Dr. Cotton Mather, in defending the decision of the
   Synod of Boston, which allowed baptism to the children of
   non-communicants, quotes Paræus as saying, "In church reformation, 'tis
   an observable truth that those that are for too much strictness, do
   more hurt than profit the Church." And he, himself, says, "Baptism is a
   seal of the whole covenant of grace; but it is by way of initiation.
   Hence it belongs to all that are within the covenant or have the first
   entrance thereinto. And is there no danger of corruption by
   overstraining the subject of baptism? Certainly, it is a corruption to
   take from the rule, as well as add to it. Moses found danger in not
   applying the initiating seal, to such for whom it was appointed. Is
   there no danger of putting those out of the visible Church, whom our
   Lord would have kept in? . . . . . If we do not keep in the way of a
   converting, grace-giving covenant, and keep persons under those church
   dispensations, wherein grace is given, the Church will die of a
   lingering, though not violent, death. The Lord hath not set up churches
   only that a few old Christians may keep one another warm while they
   live, and then carry away the Church into the cold grave with them when
   they die; no, but that they might with all care, and with all the
   obligations and advantages to that care that may be, nurse up still
   successively another generation of subjects to our Lord, that may stand
   up in his kingdom when they are gone." [579]

   4. Experience proves that it is a great evil to make the Church consist
   only of communicants and to cast out into the world, without any of
   that watch and care which God intended for them, all those together
   with their children, who do not see their way clear to come to the
   Lord's table. Admitting with gratitude all that can be said of the
   great advance made by the Church in this country within the last fifty
   or sixty years, there are loud and almost universal complaints made of
   the decay of family religion, of family training, and especially of the
   ecclesiastical instruction of the young. It is within the memory of
   many now living that in almost every Presbyterian and every
   Congregationalist family in the land, as a matter of course, the
   children were regularly taught the "Westminster Catechism." It is not
   so now. [580]

   Doctrine and Usage of the Reformed Churches.

   The language of the Reformed Churches as the proper subjects of infant
   baptism is perfectly uniform. In the "Second Helvetic Confession" it is
   said, [581] "Damnamus Anabaptistas, qui negant baptisandos esse
   infantulos recens natos a fidelibus. Nam juxta doctrinam evangelicam,
   horum est regnum Dei, et sunt in foedere Dei, cur itaque non daretur
   eis signum foederis Dei?"

   The "Gallic Confession" says: [582] "Quamvis baptismus sit fidei et
   resipiscentiæ sacramentum, tamen cum una cum parentibus posteritatem
   etiam illorum in ecclesia Deus recenseat, affirmamus, infantes sanctis
   parentibus natos, esse ex Christi authoritate baptizandos."

   The "Belgic Confession" says: [583] "(Infantes e fidelibus parentibus
   natos) baptizandos et signo foederis obsignandos esse credimus."

   The "Westminster Confession" says: [584] "Now only those that do
   actually profess faith in, and obedience unto Christ, but also the
   infants of one or both believing parents are to be baptized."

   The "Larger Catechism" says: [585] "Infants descending from parents,
   either both or but one of them, professing faith in Christ, and
   obedience to Him, are, in that respect, within the covenant, and are to
   be baptized."

   The "Shorter Catechism" says: [586] "Baptism is not to be administered
   to any that are out of the visible Church, till they profess their
   faith in Christ and their obedience to Him; but the children of such as
   are members of the visible Church, are to be baptized."

   The "Directory for Worship" says: [587] "The seed of the faithful have
   no less right to this ordinance, under the Gospel, than the seed of
   Abraham to circumcision."

   It is, therefore, plain that according to the standards of the Reformed
   Church, it is the children of the members of the visible Church who are
   to be baptized. Agreeably to Scriptural usage such members are called
   "foederati," saints, believers, faithful, holy brethren, partakers of
   the heavenly calling. The Apostles in addressing professing Christians
   in the use of such terms did not express any judgment of their state in
   the sight of God. They designated them according to their profession.
   If they professed to be believers, they were called believers, and were
   treated as such; unless they gave tangible evidence to the contrary,
   and in that case they were excommunicated. The Reformed, as well as the
   Lutheran theologians, therefore, speak of the members of the visible
   Church as believers, and of their children as born of believing
   parents. All that is intended, therefore, by the language above cited
   is, that the sacraments of the Church are to be confined to members of
   the Church and to their children. It never entered the minds of the
   authors of those symbols that the visible Church consists exclusively
   of the regenerate, or of those who gave such evidence of their
   regeneration as to constrain a judgment in their favour.

   It has already been stated that the common doctrine of Protestants on
   this whole subject is, --

   1. That the visible Church has always consisted of those who professed
   the true religion, together with their children.

   2. That the terms of church-membership under all dispensations have
   been the same, namely, profession of faith and promise of obedience.

   3. The requirements for participation in the sacraments were the same.
   That is, any one entitled to the rite of circumcision, was entitled to
   partake of the passover; those, under the Christian dispensation,
   entitled to baptism, are entitled to the Lord's Supper. Those who,
   unbaptized, would be entitled to baptism for themselves, are entitled,
   and they only, to present their children for baptism. This is only
   saying that the privileges of the Church are confined to members of the
   Church.

   4. The profession of faith required for admission to the Church or its
   ordinances is a profession of true faith; and the promise of obedience
   is a promise of the obedience of the heart as well as of the outward
   life. When a man professed to be a Jew he professed to be truly a Jew.
   It is inconceivable that God required of him only an insincere,
   hypocritical, or formal faith. This point is strenuously urged by
   President Edwards. He argues that those who enter the Christian Church
   enter into covenant with God, because under the Mosaic economy all the
   people thus pledged themselves to be the sincere worshippers of God. He
   appeals to such passages as Deuteronomy vi. 13, x. 20, Thou shalt fear
   the Lord thy God; Him shalt thou serve, and to Him shalt thou cleave,
   and swear by his name." "This institution, in Deuteronomy, of swearing
   into the name of the Lord, or visibly and explicitly uniting themselves
   to Him in covenant, was not prescribed as an extraordinary duty, or a
   duty to be performed on a return from a general apostasy, and some
   other extraordinary occasions: but is evidently mentioned in the
   institution as a part of the public worship of God to be performed by
   all God's people." [588] This was an institution, he adds, belonging
   not only to Israel under the Old Testament, but also to Gentile
   converts, and to Christians under the New Testament. This explicit open
   covenanting with God, he argues, [589] ought to be required of persons
   before they are admitted to the privileges of adult members of the
   Church. Circumcision and the passover were not designed for the
   conversion of the Gentiles. Those only were admitted to these
   ordinances who professed to be converted. In like manner baptism and
   the Lord's Supper are not converting ordinances. They are to be
   administered only to those who profess to be Christians. It is plain,
   from the nature of the case, that those who partake of the Christian
   sacraments profess to be Christians. This is not so much asserted as
   assumed as self-evident by the Apostle, when he dissuades the
   Corinthians from frequenting the feasts given in the temples of idols.
   As, he says, those who partake of the bread and wine in the Lord's
   Supper thereby profess to be in communion with Christ; and as those who
   partake of the Jewish altar, thereby profess to be the worshippers of
   Jehovah; so those who partake of feasts given in honour of idols,
   thereby profess to be idolators. (1 Cor. x. 14-21.) In baptism the
   recipient of that ordinance publicly dedares that he takes God the
   Father to be his father; God the Son to be his Saviour; and God the
   Holy Ghost to be his sanctifier. More than this no Christian can
   profess. That this profession shou1d not be insincere or hypocritical,
   or merely a matter of form, need not be argued. When a parent presents
   his child for baptism, he makes precisely these professions and
   engagements; and he can do no more when he comes to the Lord's Supper.

   5. The prerogative of the Church is limited to the demand of a credible
   profession of faith and promise of obedience. And by a credible
   profession is to be understood, such as may be believed; that is, one
   against which no decisive, tangible evidence can be adduced. If a man
   professes faith who is an avowed heretic, or avows a purpose of
   obedience while leading an ungodly life, the Church is authorized and
   bound to refuse to receive him. Nothing, however, can consistently be
   made a ground of such refusal, which would not be regarded as a
   sufficient ground for the discipline of one already in the communion of
   the Church. Two things are to be considered, the one concerns the
   applicants for Church privileges. They are bound to obey the command of
   Christ to be baptized and to present their children for baptism, and
   they are bound to commemorate his death in the way of his appointment.
   They assume a grave responsibility who refuse to allow them to comply
   with those commands. It is moreover not only a duty, but a right, a
   privilege, and a blessing to receive the sacraments of the Church. They
   are divinely appointed means of grace. We must have good reasons if we
   venture to refuse any of our fellow sinners the use of the means of
   salvation which Christ has appointed. It is to be feared that many have
   come short of eternal life, who, had they been received into the bosom
   of the Church and enjoyed its guardian and fostering care, might have
   been saved. (This is not inconsistent with the doctrine of election, as
   that doctrine is taught in Scripture.)

   Besides the duties and rights of the people, the other thing to be
   considered in this matter, is the proper office of the Church. The
   Church has a solemn duty to perform. That duty is clearly laid down in
   the Word of God. It is bound to refuse to recognize as Christian
   brethren those who deny the faith, and those whose manner of life is
   inconsistent with the law of Christ. The Bible gives a list of offences
   which exclude those who commit them from the kingdom of heaven, and for
   which the Church is commanded to exclude men from her communion, In
   doing this it secures all the purity it is possible, in the present
   state of existence, to attain. Beyond this the Church has neither the
   right nor the power to go. It cannot legitimately assume the
   prerogative of sitting in judgment on the hearts of men. It has no
   right to decide the question whether those who apply for the privileges
   of Christ's house are regenerate or unregenerate. The responsibility as
   to their inward spiritual state rests upon those who seek to become
   members of the Church. They should be taught what it is they profess
   and promise.

   That the Church is not called upon to pronounce a judgment as to the
   real piety of applicants for membership is plain, --

   1. Because no such prerogative was assumed under the Old Testament. The
   terms of membership were then what they are now. The same inward
   sincerity was required then as now. This Edwards insists upon, yet he
   does not venture to assert that all Jews admitted to circumcision and
   the passover, were, in the judgment of charity, truly regenerate
   persons.

   2. The New Testament contains no command to the Church to assume the
   prerogative in question. There is the command often repeated to
   recognize as brethren all who profess their faith in Christ. There are
   explicit directions given as to those who, although calling themselves
   brethren, are to be rejected. (1 Cor. v. 9, 10; Rom. xvi. 17; 2 Thess.
   iii. 6; Tit. iii. 10; Matt. vii. 15-17.) But there is no command to
   exclude those whom the Church or its officers do not in their hearts
   believe to be the true children of God. The gates of the kingdom of God
   are not to be opened or shut at the discretion of weak, fallible men.
   Every man has a right and is bound to enter those gates, except those
   whom Christ has commanded his Church to reject.

   3. The Apostles, it is plain, never acted on the principle in question.
   This is clear, as remarked above, from their baptizing converts
   immediately after the profession of their faith. It is obviously
   impossible that there should have been any protracted examination of
   the religious experience of the three thousand converted on the day of
   Pentecost, or of the five thousand brought in by the sermon of Peter,
   recorded in the third chapter of Acts. The Acts of the Apostles and the
   Epistles of the New Testament afford abundant evidence that the early
   churches did not consist exclusively of those whom the Apostles
   "judged" to be regenerated persons. The Church of Jerusalem was filled
   with men who were so "zealous of the law," that Paul feared that they
   would not receive him even when he came to bring alms to the people.
   Paul charges the churches of Galatia with having turned aside to
   another gospel. He reproves the Corinthians with the grossest
   irregularities; and the Epistles of John are no less objurgatory.

   4. Experience proves that all attempts to preserve the purity of the
   Church by being more strict than the Bible, are utterly futile. The
   tares cannot be separated from the wheat.

   5. Such attempts are not only futile, they are seriously injurious.
   They contravene the plan of God. They exclude from the watch and care
   of the Church multitudes whom He commands his people to look after and
   cherish. In confining the visible Church to communicants, it unchurches
   the great majority even of the seed of the faithful.

   6. There is an obvious inconsistency in having one rule for admission
   into the Church, and another for continued membership. If Christ
   requires us to reject all whom in the judgment of charity we are not
   constrained to believe to be regenerate, then He requires us to
   excommunicate all those of whom this belief is not entertained. But no
   Church acts, or can act on that principle. No man once admitted to
   Church privileges can be debarred from them, except after a trial and
   conviction on the charge of some "scandal" or "offence."

   The sacraments as all admit are to be confined to members of the
   Church. But the Church does not consist exclusively of communicants. It
   includes also all who having been baptized have not forfeited their
   membership by scandalous living, or by any act of Church discipline.
   All members of the Church are professors of religion. They profess
   faith in Christ and are under a solemn vow to obey his laws. If they
   are insincere or heartless in this profession, the guilt is their own.
   The Church is, and can be responsible only for their external conduct;
   so long as that is not incompatible with the Christian character, and
   so long as the faith is held fast, the privileges of member ship
   continue.

   This seems clearly the doctrine of the standards of our own Church.
   Those standards teach, (1.) That the sacraments are signs and seals of
   the covenant of grace. (2.) That consequently all who partake of them
   do thereby profess to accept of that covenant for their own salvation;
   they profess to receive the Lord Jesus Christ as He is offered to them
   in the gospel. (3.) That although a man may doubt of his being in
   Christ he may be a worthy partaker of the sacraments, if he
   "unfeignedly desires to be found in Christ, and to depart from
   iniquity." [590] (4.) That the Church has no authority to exclude from
   the sacraments any except those who, although they may profess faith,
   are ignorant or scandalous. In answer to the question, "May any who
   profess the faith, and desire to come to the Lord's Supper, be kept
   from it?" it is answered, "Such as are found to be ignorant or
   scandalous, notwithstanding their profession of the faith, and desire
   to come to the Lord's Supper, may and ought to be kept from that
   sacrament by the power which Christ hath left in his Church, until they
   receive instruction, and manifest their reformation." This, according
   to Presbyterians, is the extent of the power of the Church, in the
   matter of shutting the doors of the kingdom of God.

   Those, therefore, who, having been themselves baptized, and still
   professing their faith in the true religion, having competent
   knowledge, and being free from scandal, should not only be permitted
   but urged and enjoined to present their children for baptism, that they
   may belong to the Church, and be brought up under its watch and care.
   To be unbaptized is a grievous injury and reproach; one which no parent
   can innocently entail upon his children. The neglect of baptism, which
   implies a want of appreciation of the ordinance, is one of the crying
   sins of this generation.

   § 12. Efficacy of Baptism.

   Doctrine of the Reformed Churches.

   In the section which treats of the efficacy of the sacraments in
   general, it was shown that according to the Reformed Church the
   sacraments (1.) Are ordinances of divine appointment. (2.) That they
   are means of grace, and therefore are not to be undervalued or
   neglected. (3.) That their efficacy does not depend upon any virtue in
   them or in him by whom they are administered, but upon the attending
   influence of the Holy Spirit. (4.) That their efficacy is not tied to
   the time of their administration; and that they are not the exclusive
   channels of the spiritual benefits which they signify, so that such
   benefits can be received only through and in the use of the sacraments.
   We have by faith alone, and by the free gift of God, all that the
   sacraments are made the means of communicating. The same may be said of
   reading and hearing the Word of God: neither is to be neglected,
   because either, or one without the other, may be made effectual. The
   sacraments are not to be neglected or undervalued, because men can be
   saved without them. (5.) That, so far as adults are concerned, true,
   living faith in those who receive the sacraments is the indispensable
   condition of their saving or sanctifying influence.

   All these positions are affirmed to be true of baptism as well as of
   the Lord's Supper. Of the former the principal Reformed symbols use
   such language as the following: "Obsignantur hæc omnia baptismo. Nam
   intus regeneramur, purificamaur, et renovamur a Deo per Spiritum
   Sanctum: foris autem accipimus obsignationem maximorum donorum, in
   aqua, qua etiam maxima illa beneficia representantur, et veluti oculis
   nostris conspicienda proponuntur." [591]

   "Baptismus nobis testificandæ nostræ adoptioni datus, quoniam in eo
   inserimur Christi corpori, ut ejus sanguine abluti simul etiam ipsius
   Spiritu ad vitæ sanctimoniam renovemur." [592]

   "(Baptismi significatio) duas partes habet. Nam ibi remissio
   peccatorum, deinde spiritualis renovatio figuratur. . . . . Annon aliud
   aquæ tribuis nisi ut ablutionis tantum sit figura? Sic figuram esse
   sentio ut simul annexa sit veritas. Neque enim sua nobis dona
   pollicendo nos, Deus frustratur. Proinde et peccatorum veniam et vitæ
   novitatem offeri nobis in baptismo et recipi a nobis, certum est."
   [593]

   "Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference,
   whereby Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened;
   but it is also a sign of regeneration or new birth, whereby as by an
   instrument they who receive baptism rightly are grafted into the
   Church. The promises of the forgiveness of sins, of our adoption to be
   the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; faith
   is confirmed and grace increased by virtue of prayer to God." [594]

   The Heidelberg Catechism says: "Is then the external baptism of water,
   the washing away of sins? It is not: For the blood of Jesus Christ
   alone cleanses us from all sin. Why then does the Holy Spirit call
   baptism the washing of regeneration, and the washing away of sins? God
   speaks thus not without sufficient cause, not only that He may teach
   us, that just as pollution of the body is purged by water, so our sins
   are expiated by the blood and Spirit of Christ; but much more that He
   may assure us by this divine symbol and pledge, that we not less truly
   are cleansed from our sins by inward washing, than that we are purified
   by external and visible water." [595]

   The Consensus Tigurinus is the most carefully prepared and guarded
   statement of the doctrine of the Reformed Church which has come down
   from the age of the Reformation. It was drawn up to adjust the
   difficulties arising from the diverging views on this subject between
   Calvin and the clergy of Geneva on the one hand, and the Zwinglian
   clergy of Zurich on the other. In the ninth article it is said, "that
   although we distinguish, as is proper, between the sign and the things
   signified; yet we do not disjoin the truth from the signs: moreover all
   who embrace by faith the promises therein offered, spiritually receive
   Christ together with his spiritual gifts; and so those who before had
   been made partakers of Christ, continue and renew that participation."
   In articles immediately following it is taught that regard is to be
   had, not to the naked signs, but to the promises annexed to them; that
   the signs without Christ are "inanes larvæ" that if any good be
   conferred by the sacraments, it is not from their proper inherent
   virtue; for it is God alone who acts through his Spirit Article
   sixteenth is in these words, "Præterea sedulo docemus, Deum non
   promiscue vim suam exerere in omnibus qui sacramenta recipiunt, sed
   tantum in electis. Nam quemadmodum non alios in fidem illuminat, quam
   quos preordinavit ad vitam: ita arcana Spiritus sui virtute efficit, ut
   percipiant electi quæ offerunt sacramenta." Article nineteenth teaches
   that the benefits signified by the sacraments may be obtained without
   their use. Paul's sins were remitted before he was baptized. Cornelius
   received the Spirit before he received the external sign of
   regeneration. In the twentieth article it is taught that the benefit of
   the sacraments is not confined to the time of their administration. God
   sometimes regenerates in their old age those who were baptized in
   infancy or youth. [596]

   In the Westminster Confession it is said: "Although it be a great sin
   to contemn or neglect this ordinance [baptism], yet grace and salvation
   are not so inseparably annexed unto it, as that no person can be
   regenerated or saved without it, or that all that are baptized, are
   undoubtedly regenerated. The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that
   moment of time wherein it is administered; yet, notwithstanding, by the
   right use of this ordinance the grace promised is not only offered, but
   really exhibited and conferred by the Holy Ghost, to such (whether of
   age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel
   of God's own will, in his appointed time." [597]

   Calvin controverts the Romish doctrine that the Sacraments of the New
   Testament have greater efficacy than those of the Old. "Nihilo
   splendidius de illis Apostolus quam de his loquitur, quum docet patres
   eandem nobiscum spiritualem escam manducasse; et escam illam Christum
   interpretatur." (1 Cor. x. 3.) And again, in the same paragraph, "Nec
   vero baptismo nostro plus tribuere fas est, quam ipse alibi
   circumcisioni tribuit, quum vocat sigillum justitiæ fidei.' (Rom. iv.
   11.) Quicquid ergo nobis hodie in sacramentis exhibetur, id in suis
   olim recipiebant Judæi, Christum scilicet cum spiritualibus suis
   divitiis. Quam habent nostra virtutem, eam quoque in suis sentiebant:
   ut scilicet essent illis divinæ erga se benevolentiæ sigilla in spem
   salutis æternæ." [598]

   The doctrine of the Reformed Church, therefore, on the efficacy of
   baptism includes in the first place the rejection or denial of certain
   false doctrines on the subject. (1.) That baptism conveys grace "ex
   opere operato" in the sense which Romanists attach to those words, by
   any objective supernatural power belonging to the ordinance itself; or
   in virtue of the divine efficiency inherent in the word or promise of
   God connected with the sacrament. (2.) That the coöperation of the
   Spirit, to which the efficacy of the ordinance is due, always attends
   its administration, so that those who are baptized, in all cases, if
   unresisting, experience the remission of sins and the renewing of the
   Holy Ghost. (3.) That baptism was appointed to be the ordinary means or
   channel of conveying, in the first instance, the merits of Christ's
   death and the saving influences of the Spirit, so that those benefits
   may not, except in extraordinary cases, be obtained before or without
   baptism.

   In the second place the Reformed doctrine on this subject affirms, (1.)
   That baptism is a divine ordinance. (2.) That it is a means of grace to
   believers. (3.) That it is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace.
   (4.) That the ordinance was intended to be of perpetual obligation, in
   the sense that all, not baptized in infancy, are required to submit to
   baptism as the divinely appointed way of publicly professing their
   faith in Christ and their allegiance to Him as their God and Saviour;
   and that all such professors of the true religion are bound to present
   their children for baptism as the divinely appointed way of
   consecrating them to God. (5.) That God, on his part, promises to grant
   the benefits signified in baptism to all adults who receive that
   sacrament in the exercise of faith, and to all infants who, when they
   arrive at maturity, remain faithful to the vows made in their name when
   they were baptized.

   Proof of the Reformed Doctrine.

   As to the affirmations included in the doctrine of the Reformed
   churches concerning baptism, little need be said, as they are generally
   conceded. In all ages, since the apostolic, the tendency in the Church
   has been not to detract from the importance of the Christian
   sacraments, but unduly to exalt them. Nothing is plainer from the whole
   tenor of the New Testament than that the sacraments hold a place much
   below that of the truth. Whereas in all churches in a state of decay
   the reverse is the fact. The Jewish Church in the time of Christ, had
   become completely ritualistic. Rites and ceremonies had usurped the
   place of truth and holy living. A man might be proud, avaricious,
   unjust, and as our Lord expresses it, in every way a "child of the
   devil," yet if punctilious in the observance of church rites and church
   festivals, he esteemed himself and was esteemed by others, a saint so
   holy as to be contaminated by fellowship or contact with those who were
   the true children of God. This was the form in which corruption entered
   the Christian Church soon after the age of the Apostles. This "mystery
   of iniquity" even in that age had begun to work, and when he that "did
   let" was taken out of the way, the evil was fully revealed, and the
   Christian Church became as thoroughly ritualistic as the Jewish Church
   had been when Christ came. The Reformation was in its essential
   character a protest against ritualism. It proclaimed salvation by a
   living faith which purified the heart, in opposition to the doctrine of
   salvation by rites and ceremonies. It insisted that religion was a
   matter of the heart, and therefore denounced as apostasy the Church
   returning to "weak and beggarly elements," to observing "days, and
   months, and times, and years," subjecting the people to "ordinances,
   touch not; taste not; handle not; which are all to perish with the
   using; after the commandments and doctrines of men." Ritualism is a
   broad, smooth, and easy road to heaven, and is always crowded. It was
   much easier in Paul's time to be a Jew outwardly than to be one
   inwardly; and circumcision of the flesh was a slight matter when
   compared to the circumcision of the heart. A theory which allows a man
   to be religious, without being holy; to serve both God and mammon; to
   gain heaven without renouncing the world, will never fail to find
   numerous supporters. That there is such a theory: that it has prevailed
   extensively and influentially in the Church; and that it is prevalent
   over a large part of Christendom, cannot be disputed. It does not
   follow, however, that all who are called ritualists, or who in fact
   attribute undue importance to external rites, are mere formalists. Many
   of them are, no doubt, not only sincere, but spiritual Christian men.
   This is no proof that the system is not false and evil, All Protestants
   cheerfully admit that many Romanists are holy men; but they no less
   strenuously denounce Romanism as an apostasy from the pure Gospel.

   As the corruption of the Church of Rome consisted largely in making
   Christianity to consist in the punctual attendance on church rites; in
   teaching that the merits of Christ and the renewing of the Holy Ghost
   were conveyed in baptism even to unbelievers (i.e., to those destitute
   of saving faith); that when those blessings had been forfeited by sin,
   they could be restored by confession and absolution; that the eucharist
   is a true propitiatory sacrifice for the living and the dead; and that,
   in short, the religion of Christ is purely ritualistic, its benefits
   being conferred through external rites, and in no other way, so that
   those rites were indispensably necessary to salvation; it would have
   been natural had the Reformers gone to the opposite extreme, and unduly
   depreciated the importance of the sacraments which Christ himself had
   appointed. From this extreme, however, they were mercifully preserved.
   They taught, first, that in one sense, --

   Baptism is a Condition of Salvation.

   This is included in the commission which Christ gave to the Apostles,
   "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He
   that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." (Matt. xvi. 15, 16.)
   Baptism, therefore, has the necessity of precept, not that of a means.
   Our Lord does not say that he that is unbaptized shall be damned. That
   denunciation falls only on those who believe not. In this respect
   baptism is analogous to confession. Christ attributes the same
   necessity to the latter as to the former. In Matthew x. 32, it is
   written, "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess
   also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me
   before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven."
   And St. Paul says (Rom. x. 9, 10), "If thou shalt confess with thy
   mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath
   raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man
   believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made
   unto salvation." Confession does not make a man a Christian. It is the
   public avowal that he is a Christian; that he is a believer in Christ,
   in his divinity, in his incarnation, and in his being and doing all
   that He claimed to be, and that the Scriptures declare He did for us
   and our salvation. Such confession is a duty, a privilege, and a
   dictate of gratitude and loyalty, which cannot be repressed. His people
   will glory in confessing Him. While there is this desire and purpose to
   acknowledge Christ before men, due occasion for this confession may not
   he afforded, or it may be hindered by self-diffidence or ignorance. As
   our Lord intended not only to save men by the renewing of the Holy
   Ghost, and thus to bring them into membership in his mystical body, but
   also to constitute a visible church to consist of all those who
   confessed Him to be their God and Saviour, He appointed an outward
   visible sign by which they should be known and enrolled among his
   people. This was in accordance with the example set in the Old
   Testament. When God determined to organize Abraham and his descendants
   into a visible church, to be the depository of the truth and the
   treasure-house of his gifts, he appointed circumcision to be the sign
   of the covenant and the badge of membership in the commonwealth of
   Israel. This also is according to the common usage in human society.
   When a foreigner wishes to become a citizen of another state, he is
   called upon to take an oath of allegiance to his adopted country. When
   a man is elected or appointed to an important office, he must be duly
   inaugurated, and take the oath of fidelity. The oath taken by the
   President of the United States does not make him President; it neither
   confers the right to the office, nor does it confer the qualifications
   for the proper discharge of its duties. Circumcision did not make a man
   a Jew. It gave him neither the knowledge nor the grace necessary to his
   being one of the true children of Israel. It was the appointed means of
   avowing that he was a Jew; it was the sign of his being included among
   the worshippers of the true God; and it secured for him the privileges
   of the theocracy. In like manner, baptism does not make a man a
   Christian. It is the appointed means of avowing that he is a Christian;
   it is the badge of his Christian profession before men, it secures for
   him the privileges of membership in the visible Church, and it is a
   pledge on the part of God that, if sincere and faithful, he shall
   partake of all the benefits of the redemption of Christ. It is only in
   this sense that the Reformed Church teaches the necessity of baptism.
   It has the necessity of a divine precept. It is the condition of
   salvation, in the same sense in which confession is, and in which
   circumcision was. The uncircumcised child was cut off from among the
   people. He forfeitcd his birthright. But he did not forfeit his
   salvation. The Apostle teaches us that if an uncircumcised man kept the
   law, his uncircumcision was counted for circumcision. To this the Jews
   objected by asking, What profit then is there in circumcision? Paul
   answered, Much every way. It is not useless, because not essential. The
   same is true of baptism. Although not the means of salvation or
   necessary to its attainment, its benefits are great and manifold.

   Baptism as a Duty.

   The Reformed Church teaches that baptism is a duty. If a man wishes to
   be and to be regarded as a disciple of Christ, he is bound to be
   baptized. If he wishes to consecrate his children to God, he is bound
   to do it in the way of his appointment. This is plain, --

   1. From the command of Christ. If He directed the Apostles to make
   disciples by baptizing them, He thereby commanded those who claimed to
   be disciples to submit to baptism. After such a command, the refusal to
   be baptized, unless that refusal arises from mistake of the nature of
   the command or through ignorance, is tantamount to refusing to be a
   disciple at all.

   2. This is further plain from the conduct of the Apostles Under the
   first sermon preached by the Apostle Peter after the effusion of the
   Spirit, multitudes were "pricked in their heart," and Peter "said unto
   them, Repent and be baptized." "Then they that gladly received the Word
   were baptized." When Philip preached the Word in Samaria, those who
   believed were baptized, both men and women; and when he was sent to
   join the "man of Ethiopia," and "preached unto him," in that short
   discourse, probably less than an hour long, he must have insisted on
   the duty of baptism, for the man said, "Here is water; what doth hinder
   me to be baptized." It is not probable that a minister of our day in
   his first brief discourse with an inquirer would urge upon him the duty
   of being baptized. As soon as Cornelius received the Spirit, Peter
   ordered water to be brought that he might be baptized. When Ananias
   came to Paul who was blind from his vision of the glory of Christ, he
   at once baptized him. And Paul himself, as soon as the jailer in
   Philippi professed his faith, baptized him and his straightway. It is
   obvious, therefore, that the Apostles regarded baptism as an imperative
   duty binding on all those who professed to be the disciples of Christ.

   3. This is still further plain from the uniform practice of the
   Christian Church in all ages and in all parts of the world. All
   Christians have felt themselves bound by the authority of Christ to
   confess Him before men in the ordinance of baptism. It is incredible
   that they should be mistaken in such a matter as this; that they should
   regard an external rite as universally obligatory, if it had not in
   fact been enjoined by their divine Master. Those, therefore, who look
   upon baptism as an unimportant ceremony which may be neglected with
   impunity, are acting in opposition to the convictions of the Apostles
   as manifested by their conduct, and to the faith of the Church
   universal. It is not good for a man to have the people of God of all
   ages against him.

   4. The duty of baptism may be argued from its manifold advantages. In
   the first place, it is a great honour and distinction. If among men it
   is a coveted distinction to wear the badge of the Legion of Honour, it
   is a far more desirable distinction to wear the badge of disciples of
   Christ, to be enrolled among his professed followers, and to be marked
   as belonging to Him and not to the world. In the second place, those
   who are baptized, unless they renounce their privilege, are members of
   the visible Church. The visible Church is an institution of God; it is
   his treasure-house. The Church under the new dispensation has great
   advantage over the ancient theocracy, and yet the Apostle speaks in
   glowing terms of the privileges of the Jews. "Who are Israelites; to
   whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the
   giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises." (Rom. ix.
   4.) Notwithstanding, when in 2 Corinthians iii. 6-11, he compares the
   two dispensations, he says, "If the ministration of death, written and
   encrraven in stones, was glorious, . . . . how shall not the
   ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? . . . . For even that
   which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the
   glory that excelleth." This contrast between the Old and New Economies
   is presented in still stronger terms throughout the Epistle to the
   Galatians, and in that to the Hebrews. In Galatians he makes Hagar the
   slave the symbol of the one, and Sarah the free woman the symbol of the
   other. And in Hebrews the Mosaic economy, with its temples, sacrifices,
   priesthood, and ritual, is declared to be the unsubstantial shadow, of
   which the gospel dispensation is the substance. If, then, it was such a
   distinction to belong to the old theocracy, what, in the view of Paul,
   must be the honour and blessedness of membership in the Christian
   Church.

   Membership in the visible Church is not only a great honour, it is a
   great advantage. To the Church are committed the oracles of God. It is
   the depository of that truth which is able to make men wise unto
   salvation. It is the divinely appointed instrumentality for preserving
   and communicating that truth. Every one admits that it is a blessing to
   be born in a Christian, instead of in a heathen land. It is no less
   obviously true that it is a blessing to be within the pale of the
   Church and not cast out into the world. It is good to have the vows of
   God upon us. It is good to be under the watch and care of the people of
   God. It is good to have a special claim upon their prayers and upon
   their efforts to bring us into, or keep us in the paths of salvation.
   And above all, it is good to be of the number of those to whom God has
   made a special promise of grace and salvation. For the promise is unto
   us and to our children. It is a great evil to be "aliens from the
   commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise."
   They, therefore, sin against God and their own souls who neglect the
   command to be baptized in the name of the Lord and those parents sin
   grievously against the souls of their children who neglect to
   consecrate them to God in the ordinance of baptism. Do let the little
   ones have their names written in the Lamb's book of life, even if they
   afterwards choose to erase them. Being thus enrolled may be the means
   of their salvation.

   Baptism as a Means of Grace.

   The Reformed Church teaches that baptism is a means of grace.

   1. It is a sign. It signifies the great truths that the soul is
   cleansed from the guilt of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of
   Christ, and purified from its pollution by the renewing of the Holy
   Ghost. The Bible teaches that God sanctifies and saves men through the
   truth; that the Spirit works with and by the truth in conveying to men
   the benefits of redemption. It matters not whether that truth be
   brought before the mind by hearing or reading it, or in the use of
   significant divinely appointed emblems. The fact and the method of the
   deliverance of the children of Israel from their bondage in Egypt, were
   as clearly taught in the sacrament of the Passover, as in the written
   words of Moses. So the fundamental truths just mentioned are as clearly
   and impressively taught in the sacrament of baptism, as in the
   discourses of our blessed Lord himself. It is, therefore, just as
   intelligible how the Spirit makes the truth signified in baptism the
   means of sanctification, as how he makes that same truth, as read or
   heard, an effectual means of salvation. The Spirit does not always
   coöperate with the truth as heard, to make it a means of grace; neither
   does He always attend the administration of baptism, with his
   sanctifying and saving power.

   2. Baptism is a seal or pledge. When God promised to Noah that He would
   never again drown the world in a deluge, He set the rainbow in the
   heavens as a pledge of the promise which He had made. When he promised
   to Abraham to be a God to him and to his seed after him, He appointed
   circumcision as the seal and pledge of that promise. So when He
   promised to save men by the blood of Christ and by the renewing of the
   Holy Ghost, he appointed baptism to be, not only the sign, but also the
   seal and pledge of those exceeding great and precious promises. No
   believer in the Bible can look on the rainbow without having his faith
   strengthened in the promise that a deluge shall never again destroy the
   earth. No pious Jew could witness the rite of circumcision
   administered, or advert to that sign in his own person, without an
   increased confidence that Jehovah was his God. And no Christian can
   recall his own baptism, or witness the baptism of others, without
   having his faith strengthened in the great promises of redemption.
   Every time the ordinance of baptism is administered in our presence, we
   hear anew the voice from heaven proclaiming, "The blood of Jesus Christ
   his Son cleanseth us from all sin;" "He saved us, by the washing of
   regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost."

   3. Baptism, however, is not only a sign and seal; it is also a means of
   grace, because in it the blessings which it signifies are conveyed, and
   the promises of which it is the seal, are assured or fulfilled to those
   who are baptized, provided they believe. The Word of God is declared to
   be the wisdom and power of God to salvation; it is the means used by
   the Holy Spirit in conferring on men the benefits of redemption. Of
   course all who merely hear or read the Word of God are not saved;
   neither do all who receive the baptism of water experience the baptism
   of the Holy Ghost; but this is not inconsistent with the Word's being
   the means of salvation, or with baptism's being the washing of
   regeneration. Our Lord says we are sanctified by the truth. Paul says
   we put on Christ in baptism (Gal. iii. 27). When a man receives the
   Gospel with a true faith, he receives the blessings which the Gospel
   promises; when he receives baptism in the exercise of faith, he
   receives the benefits of which baptism is the sign and seal. Unless the
   recipient of this sacrament be insincere, baptism is an act of faith,
   it is an act in which and by which he receives and appropriates the
   offered benefits of the redemption of Christ. And, therefore, to
   baptism may be properly attributed all that in the Scriptures is
   attributed to faith. Baptism washes away sin (Acts xxii. 16); it unites
   to Christ and makes us the sons of God (Gal. iii. 26, 27); we arc
   therein buried with Christ (Rom. vi. 3); it is (according to one
   interpretation of Titus iii. 5) the washing of regeneration. But all
   this is said on the assumption that it is what it purports to be, an
   act of faith. The gospel of our salvation is, to those who believe not,
   a savour of death unto death. Circumcision to the unbelieving Jew was
   uncircumcision. Baptism, without faith, is without effect. Such being
   the case, it is plain that baptism is as truly a means of grace as the
   Word. It conveys truth to the mind; it confirms the promise of God; and
   it is the means in the hands of the Spirit of conveying to believers
   the benefits of redemption. Hence it is a grievous mistake and a great
   sin to neglect or undervalue it.

   All this is plain so far as adults are concerned. But if the saving
   benefits of baptism are suspended on the condition of faith in the
   recipient, what benefit can there be in the baptism of infants? To this
   it may be answered, --

   1. That it is the commandment of God. This should be enough. It might
   as well be asked what benefit could there be in the circumcision of
   infants under the law. Paul tells us that the benefit to them as well
   as to others was much every way. It secured their membership in the
   commonwealth of Israel, which was a greater honour and privilege than
   the highest peerage on earth. So baptism secures the membership of
   infants in the visible Church of God, which is a still greater
   distinction and blessing.

   2. Infants are the objects of Christ's redemption. They are capable of
   receiving all its benefits. Those benefits are promised to them on the
   same conditions on which they are promised to their parents. It is not
   every one who says Lord, Lord, who shall enter into the kingdom of God.
   It is not every baptized adult who is saved; nor are all those who are
   baptized in infancy made partakers of salvation. But baptism signs,
   seals, and actually conveys its benefits to all its subjects, whether
   infants or adults, who keep the covenant of which it is the sign. As a
   believer who recalls some promise of the Scriptures which he has read
   or heard, receives the full benefit of that promise; so the infant when
   arrived at maturity receives the full benefit of baptism, if he
   believes in the promises signified and sealed to him in that ordinance.
   Baptism, therefore, benefits infants just as it does adults, and on the
   same condition.

   It does not follow from this that the benefits of redemption may not be
   conferred on infants at the time of their baptism. That is in the hands
   of God. What is to hinder the imputation to them of the righteousness
   of Christ, or their receiving the renewing of the Holy Ghost, so that
   their whole nature may be developed in a state of reconciliation with
   God? Doubtless this often occurs but whether it does or not, their
   baptism stands good; it assures them of salvation if they do not
   renounce their baptismal covenant.

   Baptismal Regeneration.

   Different meanings are attached to the words baptismal regeneration. It
   has been already stated, in a preceding chapter, that by regeneration
   is sometimes meant an external change, -- translation from the world,
   as the kingdom of darkness, into the Church, as the kingdom of light.
   In this sense it implies no subjective change. Sometimes it means the
   life-long process by which a soul is more and more transformed into the
   image of God. Sometimes it means the whole process which takes place in
   the consciousness when a sinner turns from sin through Christ unto God.
   It is then synonymous with conversion. In our day, in ordinary
   theological language, it means that supernatural change effected by the
   Spirit of God by which a soul is made spiritually alive. "You hath He
   quickened ezoopoiese)," (see Eph. ii. 1, 5), says the Apostle to the
   Ephesians. In their former state they were dead in trespasses and sins.
   Their regeneration consisted in their being made spiritually alive; or,
   in their having the principle of a new spiritual life imparted to them.
   Such being the diversity of meaning attached to the word in question,
   the phrase baptismal regeneration may be understood in very different
   senses. The sense in which it is to be here taken is that in which, as
   is believed, it is generally understood. According to the faith of the
   Church universal, Greek, Latin, and Protestant, all men since the fall
   are born in a state of sin and condemnation -- spiritually dead. It is
   a wide-spread belief that when baptism is administered to new-born
   infants, they are regenerated inwardly by the Holy Spirit; they are so
   born again as to become the children of God and heirs of his kingdom.
   The word, however, includes more than simply the renewing of the soul.
   Prior to baptism, according to the Catechism of the Church of England,
   infants are in a state of sin and the children of wrath; by baptism
   they are said to be made members of Christ, children of God, and
   inheritors of the kingdom of heaven. In other words, in baptism the
   blessings signified in that ordinance are conveyed to the soul of the
   infant. Those blessings are the cleansing from guilt by the blood of
   Christ, and purification from pollution by the renewing of the Holy
   Ghost.

   The doctrine of baptismal regeneration, in this sense of the term, has
   been very extensively held in the Church. The passages of Scripture
   relied upon for its support, are principally the following: John iii.
   5, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter
   into the kingdom of God." Our Lord is understood in these words to
   teach the necessity of baptism to salvation. But none of the fallen
   family of man can be saved without "the sprinkling of the blood of
   Jesus Christ," and "sanctification of the Spirit;" if baptism saves the
   soul, it must be by communicating to it those blessings; or, in other
   words, those blessings must attend its administration. The principal
   support of this interpretation is tradition. It has been handed down
   from age to age in the Church, until its authority seems firmly
   established. It may be remarked in reference to this passage, --

   1. That if it be admitted that the words "born of water" are to be
   understood of baptism, the passage docs not prove the doctrine of
   baptismal regeneration. It asserts the necessity of baptism to
   admission into the kingdom of God, just as our Lord insists on the
   necessity of the public confession of his name. Confession is not a
   means of salvation. It does not convey the benefits of Christ's
   redemption. It is a duty which Christ imposes on all who desire to be
   confessed by Him in the last day. The Reformed acknowledge that baptism
   has this necessity of precept.

   2. The phrase "kingdom of God" sometimes means heaven, the future state
   of blessedness; sometimes the external or visible Church, as consisting
   of those who profess to acknowledge Christ as their king; and sometimes
   the invisible Church, consisting of those in and over whom Christ
   actually reigns. At other times the phrase is used comprehensively as
   including, without discriminating, these several ideas. In this last
   sense the conditions of admission into the kingdom of God are the
   conditions of discipleship, and the conditions of discipleship are
   baptism and inward regeneration; precisely as under the old
   dispensation, for a man to become truly a Jew it was necessary that he
   should be circumcised and believe the true religion as then revealed.
   But this does not imply that circumcision of the flesh was circumcision
   of the heart; or that the latter uniformly attended the former. Neither
   does our Lord's language in John iii. 5, even, if understood of
   baptism, imply that the inward grace uniformly attends the outward
   ordinance. John the Baptist (Matt. iii. 11, 12) made a marked
   distinction, not only between his baptism and Christian baptism, but
   between baptism with water and baptism of the Holy Ghost. He could
   administer the former, Christ only could impart the latter. The two
   were not necessarily connected. A man might receive the one and not the
   other. Thousands did then, and do now, receive baptism with water who
   did not, and do not experience the renewing of the Holy Ghost.

   3. There is no necessity for assuming that there is any reference in
   John iii. 5, to external baptism. The passage may be explained after
   the analogy suggested by what is said in Matthew iii. 11. There it is
   said that Christ would baptize with the Holy Ghost and with fire. No
   one understands this of literal fire. Fire was one of the familiar
   Scriptural emblems of purification. (Is. iv. 4; Jer. v. 14; Mal. iii.
   2; Acts ii. 3.) To baptize with fire, was to effect a real, and not
   merely an outward purification. According to this analogy, to be born
   of water and of the Spirit, is to experience a cleansing of the soul
   analogous to that effected for the body by water. This is the
   interpretation generally adopted by the Reformed theologians. It is in
   accordance, not only with the passage in Matthew iii. 11, but with the
   general usage of Scripture. In that usage the sign and the thing
   signified are often united, often interchanged, the one being used for
   the other. Water, essential to the existence of all living creatures on
   the face of the earth, not only the means of cleansing and refreshment,
   but also one of the elements of life, is familiarly used for the divine
   blessing, and especially for the saving, sanctifying, refreshing, and
   sustaining influences of the Holy Spirit. Thus in the gracious
   invitation of the prophet, "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to
   the waters." (Is. lv. 1.) Before in chapter xii. 3, he had said, "With
   joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation." Isaiah xxxv. 6,
   "In the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert."
   Isaiah xliv. 3, "I will pour water upon him that is thirsty." Ezekiel
   xxxvi. 25, "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
   clean." Jeremiah ii. 13, God says, My people "have forsaken me, the
   fountain of living waters." Zechariah xiv. 8, "Living waters shall go
   out from Jerusalem." (Compare Ezekiel xlvii. 1-5.) Our Lord said to the
   woman of Samaria, "If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that
   saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and
   he would have given thee living water." (John iv. 10.) On another
   occasion, he said, "If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
   He that believeth on me as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly
   shall flow rivers of living waters. But this he spake of the Spirit."
   (John vii. 37, 38.) Revelation xxi. 6, "I will give unto him that is
   athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely." xxii. 17,
   "Whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." It would be a
   sad mistake to understand by water in all these passages, the physical
   element, or even sacramental water. When God promises to sprinkle clean
   water upon us, He promises the renewing of the Holy Ghost; and when
   Christ says, we must be born of water, He explains it by saying, we
   must be born of the Spirit.

   That our Lord, in John iii. 5, does not make baptism essential to
   admission into the kingdom of God, but regeneration by the Spirit, is
   the more probable, because Christian baptism was not instituted when
   the words there recorded were uttered. It is impossible that Nicodemus,
   or any who heard those words, could understand them of that sacrament.
   Christ, however, intended to be understood. He intended that Nicodemus
   should understand what was necessary to his salvation. He was
   accustomed to hear the sanctifying influence of God's grace called
   water; he knew what the Scriptures meant by being washed with clean
   water; and it was easy for him to understand that being "born of water"
   meant to be purified; but he could not know that it meant baptism. To
   make the passage refer to the baptism of John is out of the question,
   although sustained by the authority of Grotius, Episcopius, Bengel,
   Neander, Baumgarten-Crusius, Hofman, and others. The baptism of John
   was confined to the Jews. It admitted no man to the kingdom of Christ.
   Our Lord is laying down the conditions of salvation for all men, and
   therefore cannot be understood to refer to a baptism of which the
   Gentiles were not partakers, and of which, in the vast majority of
   cases, they had never heard. [599]

   Another argument on this subject is derived from the fact that in the
   sixth and eighth verses of this chapter, where our Lord insists on the
   necessity of regeneration, he says nothing of being born of water. It
   is simply regeneration by the Spirit that He declares to be necessary.
   It cannot be supposed that one doctrine is taught in the fifth verse
   and another in the sixth and eighth verses; the former teaching that
   baptism and the renewing of the Holy Ghost are both necessary, and the
   latter insisting only on a new birth by the Spirit. If the two passages
   teach the same doctrine, then the fifth verse must teach that being
   born of water and being born of the Spirit are one and the same thing;
   the one expression being figurative, and the other literal, precisely
   as in Matthew iii. 11, where the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire
   are spoken of.

   Again, if "born of water" means baptism, and "born of the Spirit,"
   spiritual regeneration, then the two things are distinct. Accordingly
   Lücke says that being "born of water" is a figurative expression for
   repentance, which must precede regeneration by the Spirit. "The spirit
   of wisdom flees the sinful soul," as is said in the Book of Wisdom.
   Only the pure in heart can see God, our Lord himself teaches, and
   therefore Lücke argues only those who truly repent are susceptible of
   regeneration. [600] This disjoining the two things as distinct is
   natural, if the one refers to baptism and the other to inward
   regeneration, and therefore would indicate that regeneration is not by
   baptism, contrary to the doctrine of the advocates of baptismal
   regeneration. Hengstenberg also makes the two things distinct. Water,
   he says, signifies the remission of sins; this is effected in baptism;
   the new-birth by the Spirit follows after, which, in his view, is a
   slow process. [601]

   All the arguments against the doctrine in question drawn from the
   general teachings of the Bible are, of course, arguments against the
   traditionary interpretation of this particular passage.

   Another passage on which special reliance is placed as a support of the
   doctrine of baptismal regeneration is Titus, iii. 5. The Apostle there
   says, God saves us "by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the
   Holy Ghost." By "the washing of regeneration" is understood baptism;
   and the Apostle is understood to assert two things, first, that baptism
   is necessary to salvation; and second, that baptism is, or is the means
   of, regeneration. It is, as the commentators say, the causa medians of
   an inward change of heart; or, as Bishop Ellicott says: "The genitive
   palingenesias apparently marks the attribute or inseparable
   accompaniments of the loutron, thus falling under the general head of
   the possessive genitive." [602] On this interpretation it may he
   remarked, --

   I. That, taking the words loutron palingenesias by themselves, they may
   have the meaning attached to them. They may mean that baptism is the
   cause or means of regeneration; or, that regeneration is its
   inseparable accompaniment. But this is very far from proving that they
   either have or can have that sense in this connection.

   2. Admitting that these words are to be understood of baptismal
   regeneration, they do not teach that regeneration is inseparably
   connected with baptism. When Paul speaks of the "gospel of your
   salvation," he does not mean to say that salvation is inseparable from
   the mere hearing of the Gospel. When he says, "Faith cometh by
   hearing," he does not mean that all who hear believe. When our Lord
   says, We are sanctified by the truth, He does not teach that the truth
   always has this sanctifying efficacy. The Bible teaches that the Word
   does not profit unless "mixed with faith in them that" hear it. So St.
   Paul teaches that baptism does not effect our union with Christ, or
   secure the remission of sins, or the gift of the Spirit, unless it be,
   and because it is an act of faith. This Bishop Ellicott admits. He says
   we must remember "that St. Paul speaks of baptism on the supposition
   that it was no mere observance, but that it was a sacrament in which
   all that was inward properly and completely accompanied all that was
   outward."

   3. Still, admitting that the words refer to baptism, they may just as
   fairly be explained Baptism which is the sign and seal of
   regeneration,' as Baptism which is the means or invariable antecedent
   of regeneration.' The construction indicates the intimate relation
   between the two nouns, without determining what that relation is,
   whether it be that of cause and effect, or of a sign and the thing
   signified. Calvin's comment, "partam a Christo salutem baptismus nobis
   obsignat," [603] is therefore fully justified.

   4. There are, however, strong reasons for denying that there is any
   reference to baptism as an external rite in this passage.

   First, the genitive palingenesias may be the simple genitive of
   apposition; the washing which is regeneration.' There are two kinds of
   washing, the outward and the inward. We are saved by that washing which
   is regeneration, namely, the renewing of the Holy Ghost. The latter
   clause being exegetical of the former. This interpretation is simple
   and natural. It does no violence to the meaning of the words or to the
   construction of the passage.

   Secondly, if the latter clause be not exegetical, it must be accessary.
   It must express something new, something not expressed by the former
   clause. The Apostle would then be made to say, We are saved by the
   washing of regeneration, and also by the renewing of the Holy Ghost.
   Which amounts to saying, We are saved by regeneration and by
   regeneration. This argument can only be met by making regeneration mean
   the commencement, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, the progress and
   development of the new life. But this is contrary to the analogy
   between this passage and that in John iii. 5. [604]

   Thirdly, if the doctrine of baptismal regeneration can be shown to be
   thoroughly anti-scriptural, then it cannot be taught in Titus iii. 5.
   If any passage admit of two interpretations, one opposed to the analogy
   of Scripture, and the other in harmony with it, we are bound to adopt
   the latter.

   The same remark applies to Acts xxii. 16, where it is recorded that
   Ananias said to Paul, "Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins,
   calling on the name of the Lord." If it were the clear doctrine of the
   Bible that baptism does wash away sin, that such ablution can be
   effected in no other way, then we should be forced to admit that Paul's
   sins had not been remitted until he was baptized. But as this would
   contradict the plainest teachings of Scripture; as Paul himself says
   that God called him by his grace, and made him a true Christian by
   revealing his Son in him, by opening his eyes to see the glory of God
   in the face of Jesus Christ, which revelation attended the vision he
   had on his way to Damascus; and as the effect of that spiritual
   revelation was to transform his whole nature and lead him to fall to
   the ground, and say, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" no one can
   believe that he was under the wrath and curse of God, during the three
   days which intervened between his conversion and his baptism. He did
   not receive baptism in order that his sins should be washed away; but
   as the sign and pledge of their forgiveness on the part of God. He was
   to be assured of his forgiveness in the ordinance of baptism; just as a
   Gentile proselyte to Judaism was assured of his acceptance as one of
   the people of God, by the rite of circumcision; but circumcision did
   not make him a child of God. This passage is perfectly parallel to Acts
   ii. 38, where it is said, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in
   the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, eis aphesin
   hamartion." The remission of sins was that to which baptism was
   related; that of which it was the sign and seal. John's baptism was eis
   metanoian unto repentance. This does not mean that his baptism made men
   penitent. But it was a confession on the part of those who received it,
   that they needed repentance, and it bound them to turn from their sins
   unto God. In Luke iii. 3, it is said, John came "preaching the baptism
   of repentance for the remission of sins." No man understands this to
   mean that his baptism secured the remission, or the washing away, of
   sin in the experience of all the multitude who flocked to his baptism.
   Neither does the Bible anywhere teach that Christian baptism effects
   either pardon or regeneration in those still out of Christ.

   Direct Arguments against the Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration.

   It has been shown in the note on the preceding page that the word
   regeneration in the phrase "baptismal regeneration," is used in very
   different senses. The sense usually attached to it, in our day, is that
   inward change in the state of the soul wrought by the Holy Spirit, by
   which it passes from death unto life; by which it is born again so as
   to become a child of God and an heir of eternal life. The doctrine of
   baptismal regeneration is the doctrine that this inward saving change
   is effected in baptism, so that those who are baptized are the subjects
   of that new birth which Christ declares to be necessary to salvation;
   and those who are not baptized have not experienced that new birth and
   are not in a state of salvation.

   1. The first, the most obvious, and the most decisive argument against
   this doctrine is, that, so far as any work or act of the sinner is
   concerned, the Bible everywhere teaches that the only indispensable
   condition of salvation is faith in Jesus Christ. "As Moses lifted up
   the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted
   up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal
   life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life." (John iii. 14-16.) "He that believeth on the Son hath
   everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life;
   but the wrath of God abideth on him" (ver. 36). "I am the bread of
   life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on
   me shall never thirst." (John vi. 35.) "This is the will of him that
   sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may
   have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day" (ver.
   40). "He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
   and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die." (John xi.
   25, 26.) These are the words of Jesus. This is the gospel which the
   Apostles preached, going everywhere and saying to every sinner whom
   they met, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."
   (Acts xvi. 31.) "Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born
   of God." (1 John v. 1.) "Who is he that overcometh the world, but he
   that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?" (ver. 5.) Heaven and
   earth shall pass away, but these words can never pass away. No man may
   add to them, or detract from them. Whosoever believes on the Son hath
   everlasting life. This stands firm. It matters not to what Church he
   may belong; it matters not whether he be Jew or Gentile, bond or free,
   learned or unlearned, good or bad, baptized or unbaptized whosoever
   believes shall be saved.

   Not every one, however, who says he believes is a true believer; not
   every one who believes as the devils believe; but he who has that faith
   which works by love and purifies the heart, the precious faith of God's
   elect, every such believer is sure of eternal life. It does not follow
   from this that faith stands alone, that obedience is not necessary. But
   obedience is the fruit of faith. He that does not obey, does not
   believe. For any one, therefore, to say that although a man truly
   believes the record God has given of his Son, yet that he is not a
   Christian, unless he belongs to some particular church organization,
   unless he is baptized with water, unless he comes to the Lord's table,
   contradicts not the general teaching of the Bible only, but the
   fundamental principle of the gospel method of salvation. Even Gabriel
   would not dare to shut the gates of paradise on the thief converted on
   the cross, because he had not been baptized.

   2. It is plain that baptism cannot be the ordinary means of
   regeneration, or the channel of conveying in the first instance the
   benefits of redemption to the souls of men, because, in the case of
   adults, faith and repentance are the conditions of baptism. But faith
   and repentance, according to the Scriptures, are the fruits of
   regeneration. He who exercises repentance towards God and faith in our
   Lord Jesus Christ is in a state of salvation before baptism and
   therefore in a state of regeneration. Regeneration consequently
   precedes baptism, and cannot be its effect, according to the ordinance
   of God. That the Apostles did require the profession of faith and
   repentance before baptism, cannot be denied. This is plain, not only
   from their recorded practice but also from the nature of the ordinance.
   Baptism is a profession of faith in the Father, and the Son, and the
   Holy Spirit; not of a faith to be obtained through the ordinance, but
   of a faith already entertained. When the Eunuch applied to Philip for
   baptism, he said: "If thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest."
   Of those who heard Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost it is said,
   "they that gladly received his word were baptized." (Acts ii. 41.) On
   this point, however, there can be no dispute. The only way in which
   Romanists and Romanizers evade this argument, is by denying that faith
   and repentance are the fruits of the Spirit, or of regeneration. They
   are in their view not gracious, but natural works, works done before
   regeneration; works which leave the soul in a state of perdition. But
   in this they contradict the express words of Christ, who says,
   whosoever believes shall be saved. And, in contradicting Christ, they
   contradict the whole Bible.

   3. The doctrine of baptismal regeneration, in the sense above
   explained, is opposed to the whole nature of true religion as set forth
   in the Scriptures. The two great errors against which the Gospel, as
   taught by Christ and unfolded by his Apostles, was directed; were first
   the doctrine of human merit; the merit of good works, the doctrine that
   men are to be saved on the ground of their own character or conduct;
   and the second was ritualism, the doctrine of the necessity and
   inherent supernatural virtue of external rites and ceremonies. Our Lord
   taught that men were saved by looking to Him as the dying Hebrews in
   the wilderness were saved by looking to the brazen serpent. He further
   taught that unless a man, no matter how punctilious in observing the
   ceremonial law, was born of the Spirit, he could not enter into the
   kingdom of God. And the great burden of apostolic teaching was first,
   that we are saved, not by works but by faith, not for our own
   righteousness, but on the ground of the righteousness of Christ; and
   secondly, that religion is a matter of the heart, not of ritual or
   ceremonial observances. The Jews of that day taught that no
   uncircumcised man could be saved. Romanists and Romanizers teach that
   no unbaptized person, whether infant or adult, is saved. The Jews
   taught that "no circumcised person ever entered hell," provided he
   remained within the pale of the theocracy. Romanists and Romanizers say
   that no baptized person is ever lost, provided he remains within the
   pale of the Roman Church. The Jews believed that circumcision secured
   its benefits, not only as a seal of the covenant, but from its own
   sanctifying power. This was only one aspect of the doctrine of
   salvation by works, against which the sacred writers so earnestly
   protested. "He is not a Jew," says St. Paul, "which is one outwardly;
   neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: but he is
   a Jew, which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart, in
   the spirit and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of
   God." (Rom. ii. 28, 29.) The doctrine of the Bible, therefore, is that
   he is not a Christian who is one outwardly, but that he is a Christian
   who is one inwardly; and the baptism which saves the soul is not
   baptism with water, but the baptism of the heart by the Holy Ghost.
   This doctrine of salvation by rites was, in the view of the Apostles, a
   much lower form of doctrine, more thoroughly Judaic, than the doctrine
   of salvation by works of righteousness.

   It is evident that the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, as held by
   Romanists and their followers, changes the whole nature of religion. It
   makes mere external observances the conditions of salvation, assuming
   that outward rites are exclusively the channels through which the
   benefits of redemption are conveyed to the souls of men. It excludes
   from the hope of heaven men who truly believe, repent, and lead a holy
   life; and it assures those of their title to eternal life, who are
   unrenewed and unsanctified.

   1. A fourth argument against the doctrine under consideration, is
   derived from the analogy between the Word and sacraments everywhere
   presented in the Bible. God, it is said, saves men by preaching; the
   gospel is declared to be the power of God unto salvation; faith is said
   to come by hearing: we are begotten by the Word: we are sanctified by
   the truth. No Christian, whether Romanist or Protestant, believes that
   all who hear the Gospel are saved; that it is always the vehicle of
   conveying the saving and sanctifying influences of the Spirit. Why then
   should it be assumed, because we are said to be united to Christ by
   baptism, or to wash away our sins in that ordinance, either that
   baptism "ex opere operato" produces these effects, or that the Spirit
   always attends its administration with his saving influences.

   5. Again, all Christians admit that multitudes of the baptized come
   short of eternal life, but no regenerated soul is ever lost. Our Lord
   in teaching that none but those who are born of the Spirit, enter into
   the kingdom of heaven, thereby teaches that those who are thus new-born
   are certainly saved. This is included also in his repeated
   declarations, that those who believe in Him have eternal life; being
   partakers of his life, if He lives they shall live also. And the
   Apostle, in Romans viii. 30, expressly declares that all the regenerate
   are saved. Whom God predestinates, he says, them He also calls
   (regenerates), and whom He calls, them he also justifies; and whom He
   justifies, them he also glorifies. If baptism, therefore, is, in all
   ordinary cases, attended by the regeneration of the soul, then all the
   baptized will be saved. If they are not made the heirs of salvation,
   they are not made the subjects of regeneration.

   6. The doctrine of baptismal regeneration is contradicted by the facts
   of experience. Regeneration is no slight matter. It is a new birth; a
   new creation; a resurrection front spiritual death to spiritual life.
   It is a change, wrought by the exceeding greatness of God's power,
   analogous to that which was wrought in Christ, when He was raised from
   the dead, and exalted to the right hand of the majesty on high. It
   cannot therefore remain without visible effect. It controls the whole
   inward and outward life of its subject, so that he becomes a new man in
   Christ Jesus. The mass of those baptized, however, exhibit no evidence
   of any such change. There is no apparent difference between them and
   the unbaptized. The whole population of Europe, speaking in general
   terms, are baptized. Are they all regenerated? Then regeneration
   amounts to nothing. This doctrine, therefore, utterly degrades
   regeneration, the precious life-giving gift of the Holy Spirit. To say
   that those who receive regeneration by baptism in infancy fall away;
   that the principle of life imparted to them, being uncherished, remains
   undeveloped, is no satisfactory answer to this argument. Life,
   especially the life of God in the soul, is not thus powerless. To say
   that a dead body is restored to life, when it exhibits no evidence of
   vitality; or, that a dead tree is made alive which puts forth no
   foliage and bears no fruit, is to say that it is alive and yet dead. It
   is true that a seed may have a principle of life in it which remains
   long undeveloped, but unfolds itself when placed under the normal
   conditions of growth. But the normal conditions of growth of the
   principle of spiritual life in an infant, are the development of the
   intelligence and the presence of the truth. If these conditions occur,
   the growth of the germ of spiritual life is certain. It is to be
   remembered that that germ is the Holy Spirit, who has life in Himself,
   and gives life to all in whom He dwells. The doctrine of baptismal
   regeneration is contradicted by facts. The baptized as a body remain
   unchanged in heart and life.

   [599] That the baptism of John was not Christian baptism would seem
   plain, (1.) Because it belonged to the old dispensation. The Christian
   Church was not yet established. (2.) It bound no man to faith in Jesus
   Christ as the Son of God and Saviour of the world. (3.) He baptized all
   Judea, but all the people in Judea, pharisees and others, were not
   thereby made professing Christians. (4.) It was a baptism simply unto
   repentance, as a preparation for the coming of Christ. (5.) Those who
   were baptized by John were rebaptized when they professed to become
   Christians. Of the multitudes converted on the day of Pentecost and
   immediately after, many no doubt have been baptized by John, and yet
   they were baptized anew. And according to the interpretation, almost
   universally received in our day, of Acts xix. 1-6, Paul baptized in
   Ephesus "certain disciples" in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who
   had already been baptized by John.

   [604] Bishop Ellicott refers to "the able treatise on this text by
   Waterland, a tract which, though extending only to thirty pages, will
   be found to include and to supersede much that has been written on this
   subject." The treatise thus commended furnishes an excellent
   illustration of the difficulty of those understanding each other, who
   differ seriously in their modes of thinking and in their use of terms.
   To Waterland himself, and to those who agree with him in his theory of
   religion and in his use of words, this tract doubtless appears well
   ordered and consistent; by the majority of evangelical Christians of
   our day it can hardly fail to be regarded as full of confusion and
   contradictions. (This treatise may be found in Waterland; Works, edit.
   Oxford, 1843, vol. iv. pp. 425-458.) Waterland begins by saying, (1.)
   That Titus iii. 5, teaches that under the Christian dispensation, God
   saves men "by the sacrament of Christian baptism, considered in both
   its parts, the outward visible sign, which is water, and the inward
   things signified and exhibited, namely, a death unto sin, and a new
   birth unto righteousness, therein wrought by the Holy Spirit of God."
   (Page 427.) (2.) The passage distinctly speaks both of a regeneration,
   and of a renovation, as two things, and both of them wrought ordinarily
   in one and the same baptism, here called the layer of regeneration and
   of renewing. (3.) "Regeneration," he says, "passively considered, is
   but another name for the new birth of a Christian: and that new birth,
   in general, means a spiritual change wrought upon any person, by the
   Holy Spirit in the use of baptism; whereby he is translated from his
   natural state in Adam, to a spiritual state in Christ." (Page 429.)
   Most persons in our day would understand this to mean that regeneration
   is a subjective change in the state of the soul; a change from
   spiritual death to spiritual life. This, however, is afterwards denied.
   Regeneration is not a change of mind. It is a change of state. It is a
   change in the relation which the sinner bears to God. "A translation
   from the curse of Adam into the grace of Christ. This change,
   translation, or adoption, carries in it many Christian blessings and
   privileges, but all reducible to two, namely, remission of sins
   (absolute or conditional), and a covenant claim, for the time being, to
   eternal happiness." (Page 433.) "Regeneration on the part of the
   grantor, God Almighty, means admission or adoption into sonship or
   spiritual citizenship: and on the part of the grantee, namely, man, it
   means his birth, or entrance into that state of sonship, or
   citizenship." (Page 432.) In this sense regeneration implies no
   subjective change. The soul remains precisely in the same inward state
   in which it was before. Adoption does not change a man's inward state.
   Waterland, therefore, maintains that Simon Magus was regenerated
   although it did him no good, leaving him in "the gall of bitterness and
   in the bond of iniquity." Sonship was granted him, but he did not
   accept it. He did not, however, need a second regeneration, but only to
   repent, then his regeneration or adoption in baptism would take effect.
   (Pages 442-444.) In this sense also he teaches that renovation or "the
   renewing of the Holy Ghost," must precede baptism, as well as attend
   and follow it. It must precede it to produce faith and repentance,
   without which regeneration or adoption does no good. (Page 434.) In
   infants, "their innocence and incapacity are to them instead of
   repentance, which they do not need, and of actual faith which they
   cannot have." (Page 439.) Infant baptism, however, effects no inward or
   subjective change. It leaves the soul in the same condition, not in the
   same state or relative position in which it was before. On page 433, in
   stating the difference between regeneration and renovation, the
   renewing of the Holy Ghost, he says, "Regeneration is itself a kind of
   renewal; but then it is of the spiritual state considered at large;
   whereas renovation is a "renewal of heart or mind," a "renewal, namely,
   of the inward frame, or disposition of the man." In proof of this
   difference between regeneration and renovation he says: Regeneration
   may be granted and received (as in infants) where that renovation has
   no place at all, for the time being: and therefore, most certainly, the
   notions are very distinct." Baptismal regeneration, therefore, involves
   no change "of heart or mind," no change "of the inward frame or
   disposition." On page 443, in justifying the assumption that Simon
   Magus was regenerated by his baptism, he makes the benefits of baptism
   merely outward. He says that "As the Holy Spirit consecrates and
   sanctifies the waters of baptism, giving them an outward and relative
   holiness: so He consecrates the persons also in an outward and relative
   sense, whether good or bad, by a sacred dedication of them to the
   worship and service of the whole Trinity: which consecration is forever
   binding, and has its effect; either to the salvation of the parties, if
   they repent and amend, or to their greater damnation if they do not."
   Thus we have three, if not four different definitions of regeneration
   mixed up together in this treatise, and interchanged one for the other
   to suit emergencies. First, the word is taken in the sense which it now
   usually bears. It is the new birth, a change of heart, the commencement
   of spiritual life in the soul; a change from a state of spiritual death
   to that of spiritual life. The Christian is said to be the subject of
   three births. "Once he is born into the natural life, born of Adam;
   once he is born into the spiritual life, born of water and the Spirit;
   and once also into a life of glory, born of the resurrection at the
   last day." (Page 432.) In this sense regeneration and renovation differ
   as the commencement and the development of life differ; or, as in
   ordinary language, regeneration and the life-long process of
   sanctification differ. Secondly, regeneration is made to mean "the
   death unto sin." Romanists teach that in baptism there is the removal
   of sin both as to its guilt and power, and an infusion of new habits of
   grace. Waterland, on page 427, appears to confine it to the death of
   sin, which on page 439 he explains by the words "plenary remission." In
   words already quoted, God saves us "by the sacrament of Christian
   baptism considered in both its parts, the outward visible sign, which
   is water, and the inward things signified and exhibited, namely, a
   death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness." It will be
   observed he says "inward things," a death and a new birth, which he
   after distinguishes as regeneration and renovation. In baptism,
   therefore, we have simply "remission of sin," renovation precedes and
   follows it. Thirdly, he makes baptism to confer a covenant claim to the
   privileges or blessings all included under the heads of remission of
   sins and a title to eternal happiness. These are granted to adults
   conditionally, i.e., provided they have faith and repentance; and to
   infants absolutely, because in their case innocence supplies the place
   of faith and repentance. This implies no subjective change. It is
   simply adoption, such as Paul says, in Romans ix. 4, pertained to the
   Jews as a nation. And fourthly, be teaches that baptism confers on the
   recipient, whether good or bad, an outward and relative holiness, by
   consecrating him to the worship and service of God. (Page 443.) It
   would thus appear that every theory of baptism, whether Romanist or
   Protestant, High Church or Low Church, Evangelical or Ritual, can find
   support in this treatise. If the clear headed Bishop Ellicott has a
   clew through this labyrinth, he would do well to impart it to the
   public. The great characteristic of a large and representative class of
   the earned theologians of the Church of England during the seventeenth
   and eighteenth centuries, was that they derived their theology from the
   Bible through the medium of the Fathers. Whereas the theologians of the
   Continent drew their doctrines immediately from the Bible; and this
   makes the difference between biblical and patristical Christianity the
   difference, to common eyes, between twilight and noon.

   § 13. Lutheran Doctrine of Baptism.

   Its Necessity.

   On this point the Lutheran standards hold the following language. In
   the Augsburg Confession those who adopt that symbol say: "De baptismo
   docent, quod sit necessarius ad salutem, quodque per baptismum
   offeratur gratia Dei; et quod pueri sint baptizandi, qui per baptismum
   oblati Deo recipiantur in gratiam Dei. Damnant Anabaptistas, qui
   improbant baptismum puerorum et affirmant pueros sine baptismo salvos
   fieri." The Apology for that Confession repeats that declaration, and
   affirms "that the baptism of infants is not in vain but necessary and
   effectual to salvation." [605] The same doctrine is taught in the two
   catechisms of Luther, the larger and smaller.

   This doctrine the Lutheran divines have softened down. They affirm that
   baptism is ordinarily necessary; yet that the necessity is not
   absolute, so that if its administration be prevented by unavoidable
   circumstances, the want of baptism is not fatal. Thus Gerhard, [606]
   says Docemus, "baptismum esse quidem ordinarium initiationis
   sacramentum et regenerationis medium omnibus omnino etiam fidelium
   liberis ad regenerationem et salutem necessarium; interim tamen in casu
   privationis sive impossibilitatis salvari liberos Christianorum per
   extraordinariam et peculiarem dispensationem divinam." Again [607] he
   says: "Infantes illos, qui vel in utero materno [608] vel repentino
   quodam casu ante baptismi susceptionem exstinguuntur, temere damnare
   nec possumus nec debemus, quin potius statuimus, preces piorum
   parentum, vel si parentes hac in parte negligentes fuerunt, preces
   Ecclesiæ ad Deum pro his infantibus fusas clementer exaudiri, eosdemque
   in gratiam et vitam a Deo recipi." In this view the great body of
   Lutheran divines concur. Dr. Krauth says: "On God's part it is not so
   necessary that He may not, in an extraordinary case, reach, in an
   extraordinary way, what baptism is his ordinary mode of accomplishing.
   Food is ordinarily necessary to human life; so that the father who
   voluntarily withholds food from his child is at heart its murderer. Yet
   food is not so absolutely necessary to human life that God may not
   sustain life without it." [609]

   Its Effects.

   As Lutherans regard baptism as ordinarily the necessary means of
   salvation, they must hold that it communicates all that is essential to
   that end. It must be the ordinary means of conveying the merits of
   Christ for the remission of sin and the inward renovation or
   regeneration of the soul. Such is, therefore, the doctrine taught in
   the standards of the Lutheran Church. In Luther's Larger Catechism it
   is said, "Quare rei summam ita simplicissime complectere, hanc
   videlicet baptismi virtutem, opus, fructum et finem esse, ut homines
   salvos faciat. Nemo enim in hoc baptizatur, ut princeps evadat, verum
   sicut verba sonant, ut salvus fiat. Cæterum salvum fieri scimus nihil
   aliud esse, quam a peccati, mortis et diaboli tyrannide liberari, in
   Christi regnum deferri, ac cum eo immortalem vitam agere." [610]
   Gerhard says all the effects of baptism may be included under the two
   heads mentioned in Titus iii. 5, regeneration and renovation. The
   former he says includes, (1.) The gift of faith. (2.) The remission of
   sins. (3.) Reception into the covenant of grace. (4.) Putting on
   Christ. (5.) Adoption into the number of the sons of God. (6.)
   Deliverance from the power of Satan, and, (7.) The possession of
   eternal life. Under the head of renovation he includes: the gift of the
   Holy Spirit, who begins to renew the intellect, the will, and all the
   powers of the soul; so that the lost image of God begins to be
   restored; the inward man is renewed, the old man put off, and the new
   man put on; the Spirit resists and gains dominion over the flesh, that
   sin may not reign in the body. The same doctrine, in different words,
   is taught by all the leading Lutheran theologians. [611]

   To what is this Efficacy of Baptism to be referred?

   The effects attributed to baptism are not to be referred to any power
   inherent in the water; nor to the power of the Holy Spirit "extrinsecus
   accidens;" but to the power of the Spirit inherent in the Word. It has
   been repeatedly mentioned that Lutherans teach that there is a divine,
   supernatural power in the Word of God, which always produces a saving
   effect upon those who hear it, unless it is voluntarily resisted. In
   the case of infants there is no such voluntary resistance; and
   therefore to them baptism is always efficacious in conveying to them
   all the benefits of redemption, which, however, may be forfeited by
   neglect, unbelief, or bad conduct in after life. The word connected
   with baptism includes the command to baptize; the formula, the
   ordinance being administered in the name of the Holy Trinity; and
   especially the promise, "He that believeth and is baptized, shall be
   saved." In Luther's Shorter Catechism, in answer to the question, "Qui
   potest aqua tam magnas res efficere?" it is said, "Aqua certe tantas
   res non efficit, sed verbum Dei, quod in et cum aqua est, et fides, quæ
   verbo Dei aquæ addito credit. Quia aqua sine verbo Dei est simpliciter
   aqua, et non est baptismus: sed addito verbo Dei est baptismus, hoc
   est, salutaris aqua gratiæ et vitæ, et lavacrum regenerationis in
   Spiritu Sancto, sicut Paulus ait ad Tit. iii. 5." [612] These ideas are
   expanded in the Larger Catechism. Among other things it is there said,
   "Ad hunc modum ita discerne, longe aliam rem esse baptismum, atque
   omnes alias aquas: non naturalis essentiæ gratia, sed quod huic aliquid
   præstantioris rei adjungitur. Ipse enim Deus baptismum suo honestat
   nomine, suaque virtute confirmat. Eam ob rem non tantum naturalis aqua,
   sed etiam divina, coelestis, sancta et salutifera aqua, quocunque alio
   laudis titulo nobilitari potest, habenda et dicenda est; hocque non
   nisi verbi gratia, quod coeleste ac sanctum verbum est, neque a quoquam
   satis ampliter, digne et cumulate laudari potest, siquidem omnem Dei
   virtutem et potentiam in se habet comprehensam. Inde quoque baptismus
   suam accipit essentiam, ut sacramenti appellationem mereatur,
   quemadmodum sanctus etiam docet Augustinus: Accedit, inquit, verbum ad
   elementum, et fit sacramentum, hoc est, res sancta et divina." [613] If
   the Word comprehends in itself, "all the virtue and power of God," and
   if that Word is united with the water of baptism, it is easy to
   understand how the ordinance has all the potency attributed to it.

   The Condition on which the Efficacy of Baptism is suspended.

   That condition is faith. It is the clearly pronounced doctrine of the
   Lutheran Church that baptism is altogether useless or void of any
   saving effect, unless the recipient be a believer. And by faith is not
   meant mere speculative assent, such as Simon Magus bad, but true,
   living, and saving faith. On these points the Lutheran standards are
   explicit. In the Larger Catechism, it is said: "Qui crediderit et
   baptizatus fuerit, salvus erit. Hoc est: sola fides personam dignam
   facit, ut hanc salutarem et divinam aquam utiliter suscipiat. Cum enim
   hoc in verbis una cum aqua nobis offeratur et proponatur, non alia
   ratione potest suscipi, quam ut hoc ex animo credamus. Citra fidem
   nihil prodest baptismus, tametsi per sese coelestis et inæstimabilis
   thesaurus esse negari non possit." And again it is said, "Absente fide,
   nudum et inefficax signum tantummodo permanet." [614]

   From this it follows that in the case of adults, faith and therefore
   regeneration, must precede baptism. And consequently in their case the
   design and effect of baptism cannot be to convey the remission of sin
   and renovation of the heart, but simply to confirm and strengthen a
   faith already possessed. Thus Gerhard and Baier as quoted above, say:
   [615] "Adultis credentibus principaliter præstat usum obsignationis ac
   testificationis de gratia Dei," and "Infantibus quidem æque omnibus per
   baptismum primum confertur et obsignatur fides, per quam meritum
   Christi applicatur. Adultis vero illis tantum, qui fidem ex verbo
   conceperunt ante baptismi susceptionem, baptismus eam obsignat et
   confirmat."

   With regard to infants Lutherans teach that they have true faith.
   Gerhard says: "Nos non de modo fidei sumus solliciti, sed in illa
   simplicitate acquiescimus, quod infantes vere credant." [616] Chemnitz
   says: "Nequaquam concedendum est, infantes, qui baptizantur, vel sine
   fide esse, vel in aliena fide baptizari. . . . . Aliena quidem vel
   parentum vel offerentium fides, parvulos ad Christum in baptismo
   adducit Marc. x. 13, et orat, ut propria fide donentur. Sed per
   lavacrum aquæ in verbo, Christum Spiritu suo infantibus qui
   baptizantur, operari et efficacem esse, ut regnum Dei accipiant, non
   est dubium: licet, quomodo illud fiat, non intelligamus." Again, "Sicut
   enim circumcisio etiam parvulorum in V. T. fuit signaculum justitiæ
   fidei, ita, quia in N. T. infantes baptizati Deo placent, et salvi
   sunt, non possunt, nec debent inter infideles rejici, sed recte
   annumerantur fidelibus." [617]

   As the word produces faith in those who hear it, provided they do not
   resist its influence, so baptism in which the word is embodied (so that
   it is verbum visibile), produces faith in infants who are incapable of
   resistance. On this subject Dr. Krauth says: "That this grace is
   offered whenever baptism is administered, and is actually conferred by
   the Holy Spirit, whenever the individual receiving it does not present
   in himself a conscious voluntary barrier to its efficacy. This barrier,
   in the case of an individual personally responsible, is unbelief. In
   the case of an infant, there is no conscious voluntary barrier, and
   there is a divinely wrought receptivity of grace. The objector says,
   the infant cannot voluntarily receive the grace, therefore grace is not
   given. We reverse the proposition and reply, the infant cannot
   voluntarily reject grace, therefore the grace is given. When we speak
   of a divinely wrought receptivity of grace, we imply that whatever God
   offers in the Word or element bears with the offer the power of being
   received. When He says to the man with a withered arm, Reach forth
   thine arm!' that which was impossible by nature is made possible by the
   very word of command. The Word and Sacraments per se break up the
   absoluteness of the natural bondage; they bring an instant possibility
   of salvation. Grace is in them so far prevenient that he who has them
   may be saved, and if he be lost, is lost by his own fault alone." [618]

   § 14. Doctrine of the Church of Rome.

   The Canons of the Council of Trent on the subject of baptism are brief
   and comprehensive. The Canons anathematize those who teach that
   Christian baptism has no superior efficacy to that of John; that true,
   natural water is not essential in the administration of this sacrament,
   or that the language of our Lord in John iii. 5, "Except a man be born
   of water," etc., is to be understood metaphorically; that heretical
   baptism if performed in the right way and with the intention of doing
   what the Church does is not valid; that baptism is a matter of
   indifference, and not necessary to salvation; and also those who deny
   the propriety, necessity, or efficacy of infant baptism, etc. The Roman
   Catechism enters much more fully on the subject. It defines baptism as
   the "sacramentum regenerationis per aquam in verbo." Its material is
   "omne naturalis aquæ genus, sive ea maris sit, sive fluvii, sive
   paludis, sive putei, aut fontis, quæ sine ulla adjunctione aqua dici
   solet." [619] The form prescribed by Christ in Matthew xxviii. 19, is
   to be observed. As baptism is an ablution it may be performed by
   immersion, affusion, or sprinkling. There should be sponsors to assume
   the responsibility of the religious education of the newly baptized.
   Sponsorship is such an impediment to marriage that if a sponsor should
   marry his or her godchild, the marriage would be null and void. Baptism
   by laymen or by women, in cases of necessity, is allowable. Infants
   receive in baptism spiritual grace; "non quia mentis suæ assensione
   credant, sed quia parentum fide, si parentes fideles fuerint, sin
   minus, fide (ut D. Augustini verbis loquamur) universæ societatis
   sanctorum muniuntur.'" Those who are admitted to baptism must desire to
   be baptized. Hence the unwilling, the insane, the unconscious (nisi
   vitæ periculum immineat), are not the proper subjects of baptism. In
   the case of infants, the will of the Church answers for their will.
   Faith also is necessary; for our Lord says, "He that believeth and is
   baptized shall be saved." So also is repentance. "Cum baptismus ob eam
   rem expetendus sit, ut Christum induamus, et cum eo conjungamur, plane
   constat, merito a sacra ablutione rejiciendum esse, cui in vitiis et
   peccatis perseverare propositum est; præsertim vero, quia nihil eorum,
   quæ ad Christum, et Ecclesiam pertinent, frustra suscipiendum est:
   inanemque baptismum, si justitiæ, et salutis gratiam spectemus, in eo
   futurum esse, satis intelligimus, qui secundum carnem ambulare, non
   secundum Spiritum cogitat: etsi, quod ad sacramentum pertinet,
   perfectam ejus rationem sine ulla dubitatione consequitur, si modo, cum
   rite baptizatur, in animo habeat id accipere, quod a sancta Ecclesia
   administratur." [620]

   The first effect of baptism is the remission of sin. And by remission
   is meant not only pardon, but the removal of sin. The soul is so
   cleansed that nothing of the nature of sin remains in it. "Hoc primum
   tradere oportet, peccatum sive a primis parentibus origine contractum,
   sive a nobis commissum, quamvis etiam adeo nefarium sit, ut ne cogitari
   quidem posse videatur, admirabili hujus sacramenti virtute remitti, et
   condonari." The Catechism quotes the anathema pronounced by the Council
   of Trent on those who teach, "Quamvis peccata in baptismo remittantur,
   es tamen prorsus non tolli, aut radicitus evelli, sed quodam modo
   abradi, ita ut peccatorum radices animo infixæ adhuc remaneant." [621]
   The language of the Council is, "In renatis nihil odit Deus, quia nihil
   est damnationis iis, qui vere consepulti sunt cum Christo per baptisma
   in mortem: qui non secundum carnem ambulant, sed veterem hominem
   exuentes, et novum, qui secundum Deum creatus est, induentes,
   innocentes, immaculati, puri, innoxii, ac Deo dilecti effecti sunt."
   [622] "Concupiscentia, quæ ex peccato est, nihil aliud est, nisi animi
   appetitio, natura sua rationi repugnans: qui tamen motus si voluntatis
   consensum, aut negligentiam conjunctam non habeat, a vera peccati
   natura longe abest." [623]

   One of the propositions which Perrone lays down on this subject, is,
   that "Per D. N. J. C. gratiam, quæ in baptismo confertur, reatus
   originalis peccati remittitur, ac tollitur totum id, quod veram et
   propriam peccati rationem habet." [624]

   Baptism, according to Romanists, avails not only for the remission and
   removal of all sin, but also for the inward sanctification of the soul.
   "Exponendum erit, hujus sacramenti virtute nos non solum a malis, quæ
   vere maxima dicenda sunt, liberari, verum etiam eximiis bonis augeri.
   Animus enim noster divina gratia repletur, qua justi, et filii Dei
   effecti, æternæ quoque salutis heredes instituimur." [625] It thus
   appears, that, according to the Church of Rome, all the benefits of the
   redemption of Christ are conveyed to the soul by baptism; and that
   there is no other divinely appointed channel of their communication.

   The Council of Trent declared, "Si quis dixerit, in tribus sacramentis,
   baptismo scilicet, confirmatione, et ordine, non imprimi characterem in
   anima, hoc est signum quoddam spirituale, et indelebile, unde ea
   iterari non possunt; anathema sit." [626] What this internal spiritual
   something is, does not admit of explanation. It neither reveals itself
   in the consciousness nor manifests itself in the life. It is assumed to
   be something analogous in the spiritual sphere, to the insignia of
   merit or decorations of nobility in the sphere of civil or social life.

   § 15. The Lord's Supper.

   The passages of Scripture directly referring to the sacrament of the
   Lord's Supper are the following: Matthew xxvi. 26-28, "And as they were
   eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it (eulogesas), and brake it, and
   gave it to the disciples, and. said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he
   took the cup and gave thanks (eucharistesas), and gave it to them,
   saying, Drink ye all of it: for this is my blood of the new testament,
   which is shed for many for the remission of sins."

   Mark xiv. 22-24, "And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed,
   and brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
   And he took the cup; and when he had given thanks, He gave it to them:
   and they all drank of it. And he said unto them, This is my blood of
   the new testament, which is shed for many."

   Luke xxii. 19, 20, "And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it,
   and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you:
   this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper,
   saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for
   you."

   1 Corinthians x. 15-17, "I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
   The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the
   blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of
   the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body; for
   we are all partakers of that one bread."

   1 Corinthians xi. 23-29, "For I have received of the Lord that which
   also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus, the same night in which
   he was betrayed, took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it,
   and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you: this do
   in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when
   he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this
   do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye
   eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he
   come. Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of
   the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the
   Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread,
   and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily,
   eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's
   body."

   Apart from matters of doubtful interpretation, these passages plainly
   teach, First, that the Lord's Supper is a divine institution of
   perpetual obligation. Second, that the material elements to be used in
   the celebration, are bread and wine. Third, that the important
   constituent parts of the service are, (1.) The consecration of the
   elements. (2.) The breaking of the bread and pouring out of the wine.
   (3.) The distribution and the reception by the communicants of the
   bread and wine. Fourth, that the design of the ordinance is, (1.) To
   commemorate the death of Christ. (2.) To represent, to effect, and to
   avow our participation in the body and blood of Christ. (3.) To
   represent, effect, and avow the union of believers with Christ and with
   each other. And (4.) To signify and seal our acceptance of the new
   covenant as ratified by the blood of Christ. Fifth, the conditions for
   profitable communion are, (1.) Knowledge to discern the Lord's body.
   (2.) Faith to feed upon Him. (3.) Love to Christ and to his people.

   The main points of controversy concerning this ordinance are: (1.) The
   sense in which the bread and wine are the body and blood of Christ.
   (2.) The sense in which the communicant receives the body and blood of
   Christ in this ordinance. (3.) The benefits which the sacrament
   confers, and the manner in which those benefits are conveyed. (4.) The
   conditions on which the efficacy of the ordinance is suspended.

   The Lord's Supper is a divine Ordinance of perpetual Obligation.

   This has never been doubted in the Christian Church. That Christ
   intended that the ordinance should continue to be observed in his
   Church until his second advent is plain, (1) From his express command
   given in Luke xxii. 19, and repeated by the Apostle in 1 Corinthians
   xi. 24. (2.) The design of the ordinance which is declared to be the
   commemoration of Christ; the constantly repeated proclamation of his
   expiatory death in the eats of men; and the communication of the
   benefits of that death to his people, necessarily assumes that it is to
   be observed so long as Christ, in the visible manifestation of his
   person, is absent from his Church. (3.) That the Apostles so understood
   the command of Christ is plain from their continuing to observe this
   ordinance to which such frequent reference is made in their writings,
   under the designations, "breaking of bread," "the Lord's Supper," and
   "The Lord's table." (4.) The uniform practice of the Church on this
   subject admits of no other solution, than the appointment of Christ and
   the authority of the Apostles.

   The names given to this sacrament in the early Church were very
   various. It was called, (1.) Eucharistia, not only by the Greeks but
   also by the Latins, because as Chrysostom says, pollon estin
   euergetematon anamnesis. [627] It is a solemn thanksgiving for the
   blessings of redemption. This designation being so appropriate, all
   English speaking Christians are fond of calling it the eucharist. (2.)
   Eulogia, for the same reason. The words eucharisteo and eulogeo are
   interchanged. Sometimes the one and sometimes the other is used for the
   same act, and hence eucharistia and eulogia are used in the same sense.
   In 1 Corinthians x. 16, St. Paul calls the sacramental cup to poterion
   tes eulogias, "the cup of blessing," in allusion to the kvs hbdkh drunk
   at the paschal supper. (3.) Prosphora, "offering," because of the gifts
   or offerings for the poor and for the service of the Church made when
   the Lord's Supper was celebrated. (4.) Thusia, "sacrifice." Properly,
   the act of sacrificing; metonymically, the thing sacrificed or the
   victim; tropically of anything offered to God, as obedience or praise.
   In Philippians ii. 17, Paul speaks of "the sacrifice and service of
   faith;" and in iv. 18, he says that the contributions of the saints
   were "an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing
   to God. And in Hebrews xiii. 15 we read of a thusia aineseos, "a
   sacrifice of praise." The praise was the sacrifice or offering made to
   God. The Lord's Supper in this sense was at first called a sacrifice,
   both because it was itself a thank-offering to God and because attended
   by alms which were regarded as tokens of gratitude to Christ for the
   benefits of his redemption. Afterwards, it was so called, because it
   was a commemoration of the sacrifice of Christ upon the cross; and
   finally because it came to be regarded by Romanists as itself an
   expiatory sacrifice. For this reason the consecrated wafer is by them
   called "hostia," the host, or victim, because it was assumed to be the
   true body of Christ offered to God in expiation of the sins of the
   faithful. (5.) Musterion, something secret, or having a sacred or
   secret import. As the Lord's Supper was a significant memorial of the
   greatest of all mysteries, the death of the Son of God upon the cross,
   it was appropriately designated musterion. This word, however, is
   applied in its general sense to both sacraments and even to other
   sacred rites. Another reason may be assigned for this designation. The
   Lord's Supper was celebrated in secret; in so far that the promiscuous
   body of attendants on Christian worship was dismissed before the
   sacrament was administered. (6.) Sunaxis, "the assembly," because from
   the nature of the service it implied the coming together of believers.
   (7.) "Sacramentum," in the general sense of musterion, by way of
   eminence applied to the Lord's Supper as "the" sacrament. It was also
   after the idea of the sacrificial character of the eucharist became
   prevalent, called "sacramentum altaris," the sacrament of the altar.
   This designation survived the doctrine on which it was founded, as it
   was retained by Luther, who earnestly repudiated the idea that the
   Lord's Supper is a sacrifice. (8.) "Missa," or mass. This word has been
   variously explained; but it is almost universally, at the present time,
   assumed to come from the words used in dismission of the congregation.
   "Ite, missa est," "Go, the congregation is dismissed." First the
   unconverted hearers were dismissed, and then the catechumens, the
   baptized faithful only remaining for the communion service. Hence there
   was in the early Church a "missa infidelium," a "missa catechumenorum,"
   and finally a "missa fidelium." There seems to have been a different
   service adapted to these several classes of hearers. Hence the word
   "missa" came to be used in the sense of the Greek word leitourgia or
   service. As under the Old Testament the offering of sacrifices was the
   main part of the temple service, so in the Christian Church, when the
   Lord's Supper was regarded as an expiatory offering, it became the
   middle point in public worship and was called emphatically the service,
   or mass. Since the Reformation this has become universal as the
   designation of the eucharist as celebrated in the Church of Rome.

   The Elements to be used in the Lord's Supper.

   The word element, in this connection, is used in the same sense as the
   Latin word "elementum," and the Greek word stoicheia, for the component
   parts of anything; the simple materials or rudiments. Bread and wine
   are the elements employed in the celebration of the Lord's Supper,
   because they are the simple corporeal materials employed as the symbols
   of the body and blood of Christ.

   As the Lord's Supper was originally instituted in connection with the
   Passover, there is no doubt that unleavened bread was used on that
   occasion. It is evident, however, from the apostolic history, that the
   Apostles used whatever kind of bread was at hand. There is no
   significancy either in the kind of bread or in the form of the loaf. It
   is enough that it is bread. This makes it the proper emblem of Him who
   declared Himself to be the true bread which came down from heaven.

   Although it seems so obvious that it is a matter of indifference what
   kind of bread is used in the Lord's Supper, a serious controversy arose
   on this subject in the eleventh century between the Greek and Latin
   churches: the former condemning the use of unleavened bread as a
   remnant of Judaism, and the latter insisting not only on its propriety,
   but on its being the only kind allowable, because used by Christ
   himself when He instituted the sacrament. The two churches adhere to
   their ancient convictions and practice to the present day. The
   Lutherans in this matter side, in their practice, with the Romanists.
   The Reformed regard it as a matter of indifference; although they
   object to the "placentulæ orbiculares," or round wafers, used by
   Romanists in this ordinance; because flour and water or flour and some
   glutinous substance is not bread in the ordinary sense of the word. It
   is not used for nourishment. The use, therefore, is inconsistent with
   the analogy between the sign and the thing signified. The eucharist is
   a supper; it represents our feeding upon Christ for our spiritual
   nourishment and growth in grace. Besides, the use of the wafer was
   introduced with the rise of the doctrine of transubstantiation. The
   consecrated bread being regarded as the real body of Christ, it was
   natural that it should be made in a form which precluded the danger of
   any particle of it being profaned. [628]

   Some of the Reformed theologians raise the question whether in places
   where bread and wine cannot be obtained, it is lawful to use in their
   stead other articles of nourishment, the most allied to them in nature?
   This question they answer affirmatively; while they insist that the
   command of Christ and the practice of the Apostles should be strictly
   adhered to where such adherence is possible.

   By wine as prescribed to be used in this ordinance, is to be understood
   "the juice of the grape;" and "the juice of the grape" in that state
   which was, and is, in common use, and in the state in which it was
   known as wine. The wine of the Bible was a manufactured article. It was
   not the juice of the grape as it exists in the fruit, but that juice
   submitted to such a process of fermentation as secured its preservation
   and gave it the qualities ascribed to it in Scripture. That oinos in
   the Bible, when unqualified by such terms as new, or sweet, means the
   fermented juice of the grape, is hardly an open question. It has never
   been questioned in the Church, if we except a few Christians of the
   present day. And it may safely be said that there is not a scholar on
   the continent of Europe, who has the least doubt on the subject. Those
   in the early Church, whose zeal for temperance led them to exclude wine
   from the Lord's table, were consistent enough to substitute water. They
   were called Tatiani, from the name of their leader, or Encratitæ,
   Hydroparastatæ, or Aquarii, from their principles. They not only
   abstained from the use of wine and denounced as "improbos atque impios"
   those who drank it, but they also repudiated animal food and marriage,
   regarding the devil as their author. [629] They soon disappeared from
   history. The plain meaning of the Bible on this subject has controlled
   the mind of the Church, and it is to be hoped will continue to control
   it till the end of time. [630]

   In most churches, the wine used in the Lord's Supper is mixed with
   water. The reasons assigned for this custom, are, (1.) That the
   eucharist having been instituted at the table of the Paschal supper,
   and the wine used in the Passover being mixed with water, it is morally
   certain that the wine used by Christ when instituting this sacrament,
   was also thus mixed. Hence it was inferred that his disciples in all
   ages should follow his example. That the Paschal cup contained wine
   mixed with water rests on the authority of Jewish writers. "It was the
   general practice of the Jews to dilute their wine with water. Their
   wine was very strong,' says an ancient Jewish writer, [631] and not fit
   for drinking unless water was mixed with it.'" [632] It is certain,
   from the writings of the fathers, that this custom prevailed
   extensively in the primitive Church. As the Greeks and Romans were in
   the habit of mixing water with their wine on all ordinary occasions, it
   is the more natural that the same usage should prevail in the Church.
   It is still retained, both by Romanists and by the Oriental Church.
   (2.) Besides this historical reason for the usage in question, it was
   urged that it adds to the appropriate significance of the ordinance. As
   water and blood flowed from the side of our Lord on the cross, it is
   proper, it is said, that water should be mixed with the wine in the
   service intended to be commemorative of his death. This being the case,
   the quantity of the water used was declared to be a matter of
   indifference. In the First Book of Edward VI. prepared for the Church
   of England, the minister was ordered to put into the cup "a little pure
   and clean water." This order was omitted from the rubric, and has never
   been restored. Merati, of the Church of Rome, says: "A little water
   ought to be mixed by the priest with the wine on the altar, not
   . . . . . for necessity of the sacrament or divine precept, . . . . but
   only of ecclesiastical precept obliging under mortal sin." [633]

   The Sacramental Actions.

   The first of these is the introductory and consecrating prayer. The
   object of this prayer is threefold: --

   1. To give thanks to God for the gift of his Son, whose death we are
   about to commemorate.

   2. To prepare the hearts of the communicants for the solemn service on
   which they are attending. To this end the prayer must be appropriate.
   And to be appropriate, it should be well considered. This is a matter
   of great importance. It often happens that the prayers offered on such
   occasions are long and rambling. Petitions are offered for all classes
   of men, for the young and old; for the sick and afflicted; for
   Sunday-schools; for missions, and all the other objects usually
   embraced in the long prayer before the sermon. The consequence is, that
   the minds of the people are distracted. Their attention is turned away
   from the service before them; and they are much less prepared to
   celebrate the Lord's death when the prayer is ended, than they were
   before it began. This is as inappropriate and as hurtful as it would be
   for a minister to spend his strength in praying for the conversion of
   the heathen or the Jews, when kneeling at the bedside of a dying
   sinner. The officiating clergyman little thinks of the pain he inflicts
   by such desultory prayers. He not only puts himself out of sympathy
   with the people, Out there is a constant antagonism between him and
   them during the progress of the prayer, and when it is over there is a
   painful effort to collect their scattered thoughts, and to suppress the
   feelings of disapprobation, displeasure, and sense of injury awakened
   by the want of thought or want of tact on the part of the pastor.

   3. The third object of this introductory prayer, is the consecration of
   the elements. Bread and wine in themselves, or as found in common use,
   are not the symbols of the body and blood of Christ. They become such
   only by being set apart for that purpose. This is an important part of
   the service; and therefore, is made prominent in the liturgies of all
   Churches, and especially enjoined not only in our Directory for
   Worship, but also in the Confession of Faith and in our Larger
   Catechism. [634]

   In all these points there is an analogy between this prayer and "the
   grace before meat," used at an ordinary meal. In that service we
   recognize the goodness of God in providing food for our bodies; we
   prepare our minds for the thankful reception of his gifts; and we pray
   that the portion received may be set apart or rendered effectual for
   the renewal of our strength. When, therefore, it is said that our Lord
   gave thanks or blessed the cup and the bread, it is to be understood
   that He not only thanked God for his mercies, but that He also invoked
   his blessing, or, in other words, prayed that the bread and wine might
   be, what He intended them to be, the symbols of his body and blood, and
   the means of spiritual nourishment to his disciples. This is also
   taught by the Apostle in 1 Corinthians x. 16 where he speaks of "the
   cup of blessing," i.e., the cup which has been blessed, or consecrated
   by prayer to a sacred use; as is explained by the following words,
   "which we bless."

   Breaking the Bread.

   This is the second of the prescribed sacramental actions. It is an
   important, because it is a significant, part of the service. Christ
   broke the bread which He gave to his disciples. The bread is the symbol
   not merely of Christ's body, but of his body as broken for us. "The
   bread which we break," says the Apostle, thereby showing that the
   breaking was a constituent part of the service. So significant is this
   act that it was used as a designation of the sacrament itself, which
   was called the "breaking of bread," Acts ii. 42. The breaking of the
   bread enters into the significancy of the ordinance not only as
   referring to the broken body of Christ, but also as the participation
   of one bread is the symbol of the unity of believers. There is one
   bread, and one body. This significance is lost, when separate wafers
   are distributed to the communicants. Above all it is expressly
   commanded. It is recorded that Christ blessed, broke, and gave the
   bread; and then added: "This do." The command includes the blessing,
   the breaking, and the giving.

   This important part of the service continued to be observed in the
   Church until the doctrine that the bread after consecration is the real
   body of Christ began to prevail. Then the use of the wafer was
   introduced, which is placed unbroken in the mouth of the communicant.
   This is clearly a departure from apostolic usage, and evinces a
   departure from apostolic doctrine.

   The Distribution and Reception of the Elements.

   It is recorded that Christ after having blessed the bread and broken
   the bread, gave it to his disciples, saying: "Take, eat." And in like
   manner after having blessed the cup. he gave it to them, saying: "Drink
   ye all of it." All this is significant. Christ gives; the disciples,
   each one for himself, receive and partake of the offered gifts.

   From all this it is clear, (1.) That it is contrary to the rule
   prescribed in Scripture when the communicant does not for himself,
   receive with his own hand the elements of bread and wine. (2.) That it
   is utterly inconsistent with the nature of the sacrament, when, as in
   the private masses of the Romanists, the officiating priest alone
   partakes of the consecrated bread or wine. (3.) That it is against the
   nature of the sacrament, when instead of the two elements being
   distributed separately, the bread is dipped into the wine, and both are
   received together. This mode of administering the Lord's Supper, was,
   it is said, introduced at first, only in reference to the sick; then it
   was practised in some of the monasteries; and was partially introduced
   into the parishes. It never, however, received the sanction of the
   Roman Church. In the Greek and the other oriental churches it became
   the ordinary method, so far as the laity are concerned. The bread and
   wine are mixed together in the cup, and, by a spoon, placed in the
   mouth of the recipient. Among the Syrians the usual custom was for the
   priest to take a morsel of bread, dip it in the wine and place it in
   the mouth of the communicant. From the East this passed for a time over
   to the West, but was soon superseded by a still greater departure from
   the Scriptural rule. [635] (4.) The most flagrant violation of the
   integrity of this sacrament is that of which the Church of Rome for the
   last seven hundred years has been guilty, in withholding the cup from
   the laity. This is inconsistent not only with the command of Christ,
   and the example of the Apostles, but also with the practice of the
   Universal Church for eleven hundred years. This is not denied by
   Romanists themselves. They do not pretend to claim the authority of
   antiquity for this custom. They fall back on the authority of :the
   Church. They deny, indeed, that the words of Christ include a command
   that the wine as well as the bread should be distributed in the Lord's
   Supper; but they affirm that after consecration, the whole substance of
   the bread is transmuted into the substance of Christ's body; and that
   as his body and blood are inseparable, they who receive the bread do
   thereby receive his blood; and, therefore, that the whole benefit of
   the sacrament is experienced by the laity although the cup be withheld
   from them. This being the case, they maintain that it is wise in the
   Church, for prudential reasons, especially to avoid the danger of the
   blood of Christ being spilled and profaned, to confine the
   administration of the cup to the clergy. On the principle that the
   whole Christ is in the bread, the language of the Council of Trent is:
   [636] "Si quis negaverit, in venerabili sacramento eucharistiæ sub
   unaquaque specie, et sub singulis cujusque speciei partibus,
   separatione facta, totum Christum contineri; anathema sit." The comment
   of Perrone on these words is as follows: "Hæc porro veritas est
   corollarium dogmatis de transubstantione; panis enim et vinum per
   consecrationem convertuntur in illud Christi corpus et sanguinem, qui
   in coelis est, et in eodem statu glorioso; jam vero corpus illud
   inseparabile est a sanguine, anima et divinitate, et e converso pariter
   sanguis separari nequit a corpore, anima, et divinitate, ergo sub
   quavis specie totus Christus præsens fiat necesse est." [637]
   Withholding the cup from the laity is therefore founded on the doctrine
   of transubstantiation, and must fall with it. The custom was introduced
   gradually, and it was not until the Council of Constance, A.D. 1415,
   that it was made a law in the Latin Church. And that Council admits
   that its action was contrary to the primitive practice, for it says:
   "Although in the primitive Church this sacrament was received under
   both kinds, yet has this custom been introduced, that it should be
   taken by the celebrants under both kinds, and by the laity under the
   kind of bread only. Wherefore since this custom has been introduced by
   the Church and the holy fathers on reasonable grounds, and has been
   very long observed, it is to be accounted for a law, etc." [638]

   The Design of the Lord's Supper.

   As the death of the incarnate Son of God for us men and for our
   salvation is of all events the most important, it should be held in
   perpetual remembrance. It was to this end that our blessed Lord
   instituted this sacrament, and accompanied the institution with the
   command, "This do in remembrance of me." And the Apostle in 1
   Corinthians xi. 26, tells his readers, "As often as ye eat this bread,
   and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come." This
   itself is of great importance. The fact that the Lord's Supper has been
   celebrated without interruption in the Church, from the day of the
   crucifixion to the present time, is an irresistible proof of the actual
   occurrence of the event which it is intended to commemorate. It is,
   therefore, just as certain that Christ died upon the cross as that
   Christians everywhere celebrate the Lord's Supper. It is not only,
   however, the fact of Christ's death, which this sacrament thus
   authenticates; but also its design. Our Lord declared that He died as a
   substitute and sacrifice. "This is my body which is given for you;" or,
   as the Apostle reports it, "broken for you." "This is my blood of the
   New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins."
   Redemption, therefore, is not by power, or by teaching, or by moral
   influence, but by expiation. It is this truth which the Lord's Supper
   exhibits and authenticates. Still further, as Christ affirms that his
   body was to be broken and his blood shed for the remission of sin, this
   from the nature of the case involves on his part the promise and
   pledge, that the sins of those who receive and trust Him, shall
   certainly be forgiven. The sacrament thus becomes not only a sign but
   also a seal It is the handwriting and signet of the Son of God attached
   to the promise of redemption. As, therefore, the truth revealed in the
   Word has the highest power that can belong to truth in its normal
   influence on the human mind; so even the natural effect of the truths
   symbolized and authenticated in the Lord's Supper, is to confirm the
   faith of the believer. But as the natural or objective power of the
   truth as revealed in the Word is insufficient for conversion or
   sanctification without the supernatural influences of the Spirit, so
   the truths set forth in the eucharist avail nothing towards our
   salvation unless the Spirit of all grace gives them effect. On the
   other hand, as the Word when attended by the demonstration of the
   Spirit, becomes the wisdom and power of God unto salvation; so does the
   sacrament of the Lord's Supper, when thus attended, become a real means
   of grace, not only signifying and sealing, but really conveying to the
   believing recipient, Christ and all the benefits of his redemption.

   In the Lord's Supper, therefore, the believer receives Christ. He
   receives his body and blood. The Apostle asserts that the bread which
   we break is a participation (koinonia) of the body of Christ, and that
   the cup which we bless is a participation of the blood of Christ. (1
   Cor. x. 16.) Our Lord in John vi. 53 says, "Except ye eat the flesh of
   the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." There
   must be a sense therefore, in which believers receive the body and
   blood of Christ. The effect of this reception of Christ is two fold.
   First, lie and his people become one; and secondly, all true believers
   in virtue of this union with Christ become one body "and every one
   members one of another." Christ and his people are one in such a sense
   that it is not they that live, but Christ that liveth in them. (Gal.
   ii. 20.) He dwells in them; his life is their life; because He lives
   they shall live also. (John xiv. 19.) They are one in a sense analogous
   to that in which the head and members of the human body are one. The
   Holy Spirit given to Him without measure is communicated to his people
   so that they become one body fitly joined together. (Eph. iv. 16.) By
   one Spirit they are all baptized into one body. (1 Cor. xii. 13.) This
   union between Christ and his pecple is also illustrated by the union
   between the vine and its branches. The life of the vine and of its
   branches is one. (John xv.) Again, Christ and his people are one, as
   husband and wife are one flesh. "We are members of his body, of his
   flesh, and of his bones." (Eph. v. 30.)

   In being thus united to Christ as their common head, believers become
   one body, in a mystical sense. The Holy Spirit dwelling in each and in
   all constitutes them one. They have one principle of life. The Spirit
   works in all alike "both to will and to do." They have, consequently,
   one faith, and one religious experience, as well as one Lord, and one
   God and Father. They are so bound together that if one member suffer,
   all the members suffer with it; or if one member be honoured, all the
   members rejoice with it. (1 Cor. xii. 26.) So far as this all churches
   seem to agree. They all admit that in the Lord's Supper believers are
   thus united to Christ and to one another.

   Qualifications for the Lord's Supper.

   It is plain from the preceding account of the nature and design of this
   sacrament, that it is intended for believers; and that those who come
   to the table of the Lord do thereby profess to be his disciples. If
   sincere in this profession, they receive the inestimable gifts which it
   is intended to convey. If insincere, they eat and drink judgment to
   themselves. The Apostle, therefore, argues that as those who partook of
   the Jewish altars did thereby profess to be Jews; and as those who
   participated in the heathen sacrifices, did thereby profess to be
   heathen; so those who partake in the Lord's Supper, do thereby profess
   to be Christians. But to be a Christian a man must have competent
   knowledge of Christ and of his gospel. He must believe the record which
   God has given of his Son. He must believe that Christ died for our
   sins; that his body was broken for us. He must accept of Christ is He
   is thus offered to him as a propitiation for sin. All this, or, the
   profession of all this is involved in the very nature of the service.
   The faith, however, of those who would acceptably partake of the Lord's
   Supper, is faith not only in Christ, but also in the sacrament itself.
   That is, faith in its divine appointment, and in its being what in the
   New Testament it is declared to be. We must not look upon it as a mere
   human device, as a mere ritual observance or ceremony; but as a means
   ordained by God of signifying, sealing, and conveying to believers
   Christ and the benefits of his redemption. The reason why believers
   receive so little by their attendance on this ordinance is, that they
   expect so little. They expect to have their affections somewhat
   stirred, and their faith somewhat strengthened; but they perhaps rarely
   expect so to receive Christ as to be filled with all the fulness of
   God. Yet Christ in offering Himself to us in this ordinance, offers us
   all of God we are capable of receiving. For we are complete
   (pepleromenoi) filled, i.e., filled with the fulness of God in Him.
   (Col. ii. 10.)

   It is impossible that the faith which this sacrament demands should
   exist in the heart, without producing supreme love and gratitude to
   Christ, and the fixed purpose to forsake all sin and to live devoted to
   his service. Our Church, therefore, teaches that it is required of them
   who would worthily partake of the Lord's Supper, that they examine
   themselves, of their knowledge to discern the Lord's body, of their
   faith to feed upon Him, of their repentance, love, and new obedience.

   It is, however, not to be inferred from this that a man must be assured
   that he is a true believer before he can properly approach the Lord's
   table. It often happens that those who are most confident that they are
   Christians, have the least of Christ's Spirit. And therefore we are
   taught in the Larger Catechism, [639] that "One who doubteth of his
   being in Christ, or of his due preparation to the sacrament of the
   Lord's Supper, may have true interest in Christ, though he be not
   assured thereof; and in God's account hath it, if he be duly affected
   with the apprehension of the want of it, and unfeignedly desires to be
   found in Christ, and to depart from iniquity; in which case (because
   promises are made, and this sacrament is appointed, for the relief even
   of weak and doubting Christians) he is to bewail his unbelief, and
   labour to have his doubts resolved; and so doing, he may and ought to
   come to the Lord's Supper, that he may be further strengthened."

   It is no valid objection to the doctrine that faith, love, and new
   obedience are the qualifications for an acceptable approach to the
   Lord's table, that under the Old Testament all the people were allowed
   to partake of the Passover. This only shows the difference between what
   God demands, and what fallible men are authorized to enforce. It cannot
   be doubted that it was required of the Jews in coming to the paschal
   supper that they should believe the fact of their miraculous
   deliverance out of Egypt that they should be duly grateful to God for
   that great mercy and that they should have faith in the promise of that
   still greater redemption through Him of whom their paschal lamb was the
   divinely appointed type. All this was implied in an intelligent and
   sincere attendance on the Jewish Passover. The priests, however, were
   not authorized to sit in judgment on the sincerity of the worshippers,
   and to exclude all whom they deemed insincere. So while faith, love,
   and the purpose of new obedience are clearly required of all who come
   to the table of the Lord, all that the Church can demand is a credible
   profession; that is, a profession against which no tangible evidence
   can be adduced. Even to acceptable prayer, faith and love and the
   purpose of obedience are demanded, and yet we cannot exclude from
   access to God all whom we do not deem true believers. Confounding the
   Church and the world is a great evil, but the Church cannot be kept
   pure by any human devices. Men must be so instructed that they will be
   kept back from making profession of a faith they do not possess, by
   their own consciences; and those who act unworthily of their Christian
   profession should be subjected to the discipline of the Church. Further
   than this the Bible does not authorize us to go, and all attempts to
   improve upon the Bible must be productive of evil. According to our
   Directory for Worship, the minister "is to warn the profane, the
   ignorant, and scandalous, and those that secretly indulge themselves in
   any known sin, not to approach the holy table." To these classes his
   power of exclusion is confined. "On the other hand, he shall invite to
   this holy table, such as, sensible of their lost and helpless state of
   sin, depend upon the atonement of Christ for pardon and acceptance with
   God; such as, being instructed in the Gospel doctrine, have a competent
   knowledge to discern the Lord's body, and such as desire to renounce
   their sins, and are determined to lead a holy and godly life." [640]

   Although all churches substantially agree as to the natare and design
   of the Lord's Supper, so far as the general statements above given are
   concerned, they differ essentially in their explanations of those
   statements; just as all profess to receive what the Scriptures say of
   this ordinance, while they differ so widely as to what the Bible really
   teaches. So far as these differences of views concern the
   qualifications for participating in the Lord's Supper; the benefits the
   ordinance is intended to convey; and the nature of the efficacy
   attributed to it, they have been already sufficiently considered when
   teaching of the sacraments in general. There are, however, certain
   points in reference to this sacrament in particular, which are so
   important that they have determined the course of ecclesiastical
   history. Those points are all intimately related. (1.) In what sense
   are the bread and wine in the eucharist the body and blood of Christ.
   (2.) In what sense are his body and blood received in that ordinance by
   the communicant. (3.) In what sense is Christ in the Lord's Supper.
   These points are so related that they cannot well be considered
   separately. These are the points as to which the Reformed, the
   Lutheran, and the Roman Churches are opposed to each other.

   § 16. Doctrine of the Reformed Church on the Lord's Supper.

   It is a very difficult matter to give an account of the Reformed
   doctrine concerning the Lord's Supper satisfactory to all parties. This
   difficulty arises partly from the fact that words have changed their
   meaning since the days of the Reformation. The Reformed as well as
   Lutherans asserted that there is "a real presence" of Christ in the
   Lord's Supper; and that the believer receives the true body and blood,
   or the substance of the body and blood of Christ. Such expressions
   would be understood in our day very differently from what they were
   then. Another source of difficulty on this subject is that the
   statements of the Reformed had for one great object the prevention of a
   schism in the ranks of the Protestants. They did all they could to
   conciliate Luther. They adopted forms of expression which could be
   understood in a Lutheran sense. So far was this irenical spirit carried
   that even Romanists asked nothing more than what the Reformed conceded.
   Still another difficulty is that the Reformed were not agreed among
   themselves. There were three distinct types of doctrine among them, the
   Zwinglian, the Calvinistic, and an intermediate form, which ultimately
   became symbolical, being adopted in the authoritative standards of the
   Church.

   Zwinglian Statements.

   It was the tendency of the Zwinglian element of the Reformed Church, to
   make less of the supernatural aspect of the sacraments than their
   associates did. There was, however, no essential difference, as
   afterwards appeared between the Churches of Zurich and those of Geneva.
   Zwingle taught that "The Lord's Supper is nothing else than the food of
   the soul, and Christ instituted the ordinance as a memorial of Himself.
   When a man commits himself to the sufferings and redemption of Christ
   he is saved. Of this He has left us a certain visible sign of his flesh
   and blood, both of which He has commanded us to eat and drink in
   remembrance of Him." This is said in a document presented to the
   council of Zurich in 1523.

   In his "Expositio Christianæ Fidei," written just before his death, and
   published by Bullinger in 1536, he says: "The natural substantial body
   of Christ in which He suffered, and in which He is now seated in heaven
   at the right hand of God, is not in the Lord's Supper eaten
   corporeally, or as to its essence, but spiritually only. . . . .
   Spiritually to eat Christ's body is nothing else than with the spirit
   and mind to rely on the goodness and mercy of God through
   Christ. . . . . Sacramentally to eat his body, is, the sacrament being
   added, with the mind and spirit to feed upon Him." [641]

   The Confessions most nearly conformed to the views of Zwingle are the
   "Confessio Tetrapolitana," the "First Basil," and the "First Helvetic."
   These are all apologetic. The last mentioned protests against the
   representation that the Reformed regard the sacraments as mere badges
   of profession, and asserts that they are signs and means. The Lord's
   Supper is called "coena mystica" "in which Christ truly offers his body
   and blood, and hence Himself, to his people; not as though the body and
   blood of Christ were naturally united with the bread and wine, locally
   included in them, or sensibly there present, but in so far as the bread
   and wine are symbols, through which we have communion in his body and
   blood, not to the nourishment of the body, but of the spiritual or
   eternal life." [642]

   In "The Sincere Confession of the Ministers of the Church of Zurich,"
   dated 1545, we find the following precise statement of their doctrine:
   "We teach that the great design and end of the Lord's Supper, that to
   which the whole service is directed, is the remembrance of Christ's
   body devoted, and of his blood shed for the remission of our sins. This
   remembrance, however, cannot take place without true faith. And
   although the things of which the service is a memorial, are not visible
   or present after a visible or corporal manner, nevertheless believing
   apprehension and the assurance of faith renders them present in one
   sense to the soul of the believer. He has truly eaten the bread of
   Christ . . . . who believes on Christ, very God and very man, crucified
   for us, on whom to believe is to eat, and to eat is to believe. . . . .
   Believers have in the Lord's Supper no other life-giving food than that
   which they receive elsewhere than in that ordinance. The believer,
   therefore, receives both in and out of the Lord's Supper, in one and
   the same way, and by the same means of faith, one and the same food,
   Christ, except that in the supper the reception is connected with the
   actions and signs appointed by Christ, and accompanied with a
   testifying, thanksgiving, and binding service. . . . . Christ's flesh
   has done its work on earth, having been offered for our salvation; now
   it no longer benefits on earth and is no longer here."

   Calvin's Doctrine.

   While Calvin denied the real presence of the body and blood of Christ
   in the eucharist, in the sense in which that presence was asserted by
   Romanists and Lutherans, yet he affirmed that they were dynamically
   present. The sun is in the heavens, but his light and heat are present
   on earth. So the body of Christ is in heaven, but from that glorified
   body there radiates an influence, other than the influence of the
   Spirit (although through his agency), of which believers in the Lord's
   Supper are the recipients. In this way they receive the body and blood
   of Christ, or, their substance, or life-giving power. He held,
   therefore, that there was something not only supernatural, but truly
   miraculous, in this divine ordinance.

   He says: [643] "We conclude that our souls are fed by the flesh and
   blood of Christ, just as our corporal life is preserved by bread and
   wine. For the analogy of the signs would not hold, if our souls did not
   find their aliment in Christ, which, however, cannot be the case,
   unless Christ truly coalesce into one with us, and support us through
   the use of his flesh and blood. It may seem incredible indeed that the
   flesh of Christ should reach us from such an immense local distance, so
   as to become our food. But we must remember how far the power of the
   Holy Spirit transcends all our senses, and what folly it must be even
   to think of reducing his immensity to our measure. Let faith then
   embrace what the understanding cannot grasp, namely, that the spirit
   truly unites things which are totally separated. Now this sacred
   communication of his flesh and blood, by which Christ transfuses his
   life into us, just as if He penetrated our bones and marrow, He
   testifies and seals in the holy supper; not by the exhibition of a vain
   and empty sign, but by putting forth such an energy of his Spirit as
   fulfils what He promises."

   In 1561 Calvin wrote in answer to the Lutheran Hesshuss, and with an
   irenical purpose, his tract "De participatione carnis et sanguinis
   Christi in sacra coena." In an appendix to that Tract, he says, "The
   same body then which the Son of God once offered in sacrifice to the
   Father, he daily offers to us in the supper, that it may be our
   spiritual aliment. Only that must be held which was intimated as to the
   mode, that it is not necessary that the essence of the flesh should
   descend from heaven in order that we may feed upon it; but that the
   power of the Spirit is sufficient to penetrate through all impediments
   and to surmount all local distance. At the same time we do not deny
   that the mode here is incomprehensible to human thought; for flesh
   naturally could neither be the life of the soul, nor exert its power
   upon us from heaven; and not without reason is the communication, which
   makes us flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bones, denominated by Paul
   a great mystery. In the sacred supper we acknowledge it a miracle,
   transcending both nature and our understanding, that Christ's life is
   made common to us with Himself, and his flesh given to us as aliment."
   [644]

   Again, "These things being disposed of, a doubt still appears with
   respect to the word substance'; which is readily allayed if we put away
   the gross imagination of a manducation of the flesh, as though it were
   corporal food, that, being taken into the mouth, is received into the
   stomach. For if this absurdity be removed, there no reason why we
   should deny that we are fed with Christ's flesh substantially, since we
   truly coalesce with Him in one body by faith, and are made one with
   Him. Whence it follows that we are joined with Him in substantial
   connection, just as substantial vigour flows down from the head into
   the members. The definition there must stand that we are made to
   partake of Christ's flesh substantially; not in the way of carnal
   mixture, or as if the flesh of Christ drawn down from heaven entered
   into us, or were swallowed by the mouth; but because the flesh of
   Christ, as to its power and efficacy, vivifies our souls, not otherwise
   than the body is nourished by the substance of bread and wine." [645]

   The Reformed symbols which most nearly conform to the peculiar views of
   Calvin are the Gallican, the Belgian, and the early Scottish. The first
   mentioned teaches [646] "Quamvis [Christus] nunc sit in coelis, ibidem
   etiam mansurus donec veniat mundum judicaturus: credimus tamen, eum
   arcana et incomprehensibili Spiritus sui virtute per fidem apprehensa,
   nos nutrire et vivificare sui corporis et sanguinis substantia. Dicimur
   autem hoc spiritualiter fieri, non ut efficaciæ et veritatis loco
   imaginationem aut cogitationem supponamus, sed potius, quoniam hoc
   mysterium nostræ cum Christo coalitionis tam sublime est, ut omnes
   nostros sensus totumque adeo ordinem naturæ superet: denique quoniam
   sit divinum ac coeleste, non nisi fide percipi ac apprehendi potest."

   "Credimus, sicut antea dictum est, tam in coena quam in baptismo, Deum
   nobis reipsa, id est, vere et efficaciter donare quicquid ibi
   sacramentaliter figurat, ac proinde cum signis conjungimus veram
   possessionem ac fruitionem ejus rei, quæ ita nobis offertur. Itaque
   affirmamus eos qui ad sacram mensam Domini puram fidem tanquam vas
   quoddam afferunt, vere recipere quod ibi signa testificantur, nempe
   corpus et sanguinem Jesu Christi, non minus esse cibum ac potum animæ,
   quam panis et vinum sunt corporis cibus."

   In the Scotch Confession of 1560, it is said, "We confess that
   believers in the right use of the Lord's Supper thus eat the body and
   drink the blood of Jesus Christ, and we firmly believe that He dwells
   in them, and they in Him, nay, that they thus become flesh of his flesh
   and bone of his bones. For as the eternal Deity gives life and
   immortality to the flesh of Christ, so also his flesh and blood, when
   eaten and drunk by us, confer on us the same prerogatives." [647]

   ln the Belgic Confession adopted in 1563, it is said, "Ut iis nobis
   [Christus] testificatur, quam vere accipimus et tenemus manibus nostris
   hoc sacramentum, illudque ore comedimus (unde et postmodum vita hæc
   nostra sustentatur), tam vere etiam nos fide (quæ animæ nostræ est
   instar et manus et oris) recipere verum corpus et verum sanguinem
   Christi, in animis nostris, ad vitam spiritualem in nobis
   fovendam. . . . . Dicimus itaque id quod comeditur esse ipsissimum
   Christi corpus naturale, et id quod bibitur verum ipsius sanguinem: at
   instrumentum seu medium quo hæc comedimus et bibimus non est os
   corporeum, sed spiritus ipse noster, idque per fidem." [648]

   Confessions in which Zwinglians and Calvinists agree.

   The most important of these, as already mentioned, is the "Consensus
   Tigurinus," because drawn up for the express purpose of settling the
   disputes between the two parties, and because it was adopted by both.
   It was written by Calvin and published under the title "Consensio mutua
   in re Sacramentaria Ministrorum Tigurinæ Ecclesiæ, et D. Joannis
   Calvini Ministri Genevensis Ecclesiæ, jam nunc ab ipsis authoribus
   edita." This "Consensus" was vehemently attacked by the Lutherans; and
   Calvin, four years after its publication, felt called upon to publish
   an explanation and defence of it. In his letter prefixed to that
   defence and addressed to the ministers of Zurich and other Swiss
   churches, he says: The Lutherans now see that those whom they denounced
   as Sacramentarians agree, and then adds: "Nec vero si superstites hodie
   essent optimi et eximii Christi servi Zwinglius et Oecolampadius,
   verbulum in ea sententia mutarent." [649] No document, therefore, can
   have a higher claim to represent the true doctrine of the Reformed
   Church than this "Consensus." This document has already been quoted on
   a previous page to prove that its authors, (1.) Did not regard the
   sacraments as mere signs, or as simply badges of a Christian
   profession. (2.) But as means of grace, appointed, not only to signify
   and seal, but also to convey the benefits of redemption. (3.) That
   their saving and sanctifying efficacy is not due to any virtue in them
   or in him that doth administer them, but solely to the blessing of God
   and the working of his Spirit. (4.) That the sacraments are not means
   of grace to all indiscriminately, or to all who are their passive
   recipients, but only to believers or the chosen people of God. (5.)
   That their efficacy is not tied to the time of their administration.
   (6.) That the grace or saving gifts which the sacraments, when God so
   wills, are made the channels of communicating, may be, and in fact are,
   received before and without their use.

   The last seven articles of the "Consensus" concern the Lord's Supper.
   In the twenty-first the local presence of Christ in that sacrament is
   denied. "Præsertim vero tollenda est quælibet localis præsentiæ
   imaginatio. Nam quum signa hic in mundo sint, oculis cernuntur,
   palpentur manibus: Christus quatenus homo est, non alibi quam in coelo,
   nec aliter quam mente et fidei intelligentia quærendus est. Quare
   perversa et impia superstitio est, ipsum sub elementis hujus mundi
   includere."

   The twenty-second article teaches that the words, "This is my body," in
   the form of institution, are to be understood figuratively. "Proinde,
   qui in solennibus Coenæ verbis, Hoc est corpus meum, Hic est sanguis
   meus: præcise literalem, ut loquuntur, sensum urgent, eos tanquam
   præposteros interpretes repudiamus. Nam extra controversiam ponimus,
   figurate accipienda esse, ut esse panis et vinum dicantur id quod
   significant. Neque vero novum hoc aut insolens videri debet, ut per
   metonymiam ad signum transferatur rei figuratæ nomen, quum passim in
   Scripturis ejusmodi locutiones occurrant: et nos sic loquendo nihil
   asserimus, quod non apud vetustissimos quosque et probatissimos
   Ecclesiæ scriptores extet."

   Article twenty-third relates to spiritual manducation. "Quod autem
   carnis suæ esu et sanguinis potione, quæ hic figurantur, Christus
   animas nostras per fidem Spiritus sancti virtute pascit, id non perinde
   accipiendum, quasi fiat aliqua substantiæ vel commixtio vel transfusio:
   sed quoniam ex carne semel in sacrificium oblata et sanguine in
   expiatione effuso vitam hauriamus."

   Article twenty-fourth is directed against transubstantiation and other
   errors. "Hoc modo non tantum refutatur Papistarum commentum de
   transubstantione, sed crassa omnia figmenta atque futiles argutiæ, quæ
   vel coelesti ejus gloriæ detrahunt vel veritati humanæ naturæ minus
   sunt consentaneæ. Neque enim minus absurdum judicamus, Christus sub
   pane locare vel cum pane copulare, quam panem transubstantiare in
   corpus ejus."

   Article twenty-fifth teaches that Christ's body is locally in heaven.
   "Ac ne qua ambiguitas restet, quum in coelo quarendum Christum dicimus,
   hæc locutio locorum distantiam nobis sonat et exprimit. Tametsi enim
   philosophice loquendo supra coelos locus non est; quia tamen corpus
   Christi, ut fert humani corporis natura et modus, finitum est et coelo,
   ut loco, continetur, necesse est a nobis tanto locorum intervallo
   distare, quanto coelum abest a terra."

   Article twenty-sixth, the last of the series, is directed against the
   adoration of the host, or consecrated wafer. [650]

   The Heidelberg Catechism was prepared at the command of Frederick III.,
   Elector of the Palatinate, by Caspar Olevian, a disciple of Calvin, and
   by Ursinus, a friend of Melancthon, and adopted by a General Synod held
   at Heidelberg in 1563. This Catechism, having symbolical authority both
   in the German and in the Dutch Reformed Churches, is entitled to
   special respect as a witness to the faith of the Reformed Church.

   The sacraments are declared to be "Sacred, visible signs, and seals,
   instituted by God, that through them He may more clearly present and
   seal the promise of the gospel, namely, that He, for the sake of the
   one offering of Christ accomplished on the cross, grants not to all
   only but even to separate believers the forgiveness of sin and eternal
   life."

   "How art thou reminded and assured, in the Holy Supper, that thou art a
   partaker of the one offering of Christ on the cross, and of all his
   benefits?"

   "Thus, that Christ has commanded me and all believers, to eat this
   broken bread, and to drink this cup in remembrance of Him; adding these
   promises: that his body was offered and broken on the cross for me, and
   his blood shed for me, as certainly as I see with my eyes the bread of
   the Lord broken for me, and the cup communicated to me: and further,
   that He feeds and nourishes my soul to everlasting life, with his
   crucified body and shed blood, as assuredly as I receive from the hands
   of the minister, and take with my mouth, the bread and cup, as certain
   signs of the body and blood of Christ."

   "What is it then to eat the crucified body, and drink the shed blood of
   Christ?"

   "It is not only to embrace with a believing heart all the sufferings
   and death of Christ, and thereby to obtain the pardon of sin and
   eternal life; but also, besides that, to become more and more united to
   his sacred body by the Holy Ghost, who dwells at once both in Christ
   and in us; so that we, though Christ is in heaven, and we on earth, are
   notwithstanding, flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone; and we live
   and are governed forever by one Spirit, as the members of the same body
   are by one soul."

   "Do then the bread and wine become the very body and blood of Christ?"

   "Not at all: but as the water in baptism is not changed into the blood
   of Christ, neither is the washing away of sin itself, being only the
   sign and pledge of the things sealed to us in baptism; so the bread in
   the Lord's Supper is not changed into the very body of Christ; though
   agreeably to the nature and properties of sacraments, it is called the
   body of Christ Jesus." [651]

   The Confession of Faith of the Reformed Dutch Church was revised by the
   Synod of Dort in 1618 and 1619. In the thirty-fifth article of that
   Confession, it is said that as man has a natural life common to all
   men, so believers have besides, a spiritual life given in their
   regeneration; and as God has provided food for our natural life, He has
   in like manner provided food for our spiritual life. That food is
   Christ, who is the true bread which came down from heaven; "who
   nourishes and strengthens the spiritual life of believers, when they
   eat Him, that is to say, when they apply and receive him by faith in
   the Spirit." As we receive the bread and wine by the mouth "we also do
   as certainty receive by faith (which is the hand and mouth of our
   soul.) the true body and blood of Christ our only Saviour in our souls
   for the support of our spiritual life." The manner of this reception is
   hidden and incomprehensible. "In the mean time we err not, when we say,
   that what is eaten and drunk by us is the proper and natural body, and
   the proper blood of Christ. But the manner of our partaking of the
   same, is not by the mouth, but by the Spirit through faith."

   The Second Helvetic Confession is, on some accounts, to be regarded as
   the most authoritative symbol of the Reformed Church, as it was more
   generally received than any other, and was sanctioned by different
   parties. It was drawn up by Bullinger in 1562. In 1565, the Elector
   Frederick, distressed at the contentions respecting the sacraments
   which agitated the Church, wrote to Bullinger to send him a confession
   which might if possible unite the conflicting parties, or, at least
   meet the objections of the Lutherans. Bullinger sent him this
   Confession which he had prepared some years before; with which the
   Elector was perfectly satisfied. To give it the greater authority it
   was adopted by the Helvetic churches. As it was drawn up by Bullinger
   the successor of Zwingle at Zurich, it cannot be supposed to contain
   anything to which a Zwinglian could object. The nineteenth chapter
   treats of the sacraments in general, and teaches, (1.) That they are
   mystic symbols, or holy rites, or sacred actions, including the word,
   signs, and thing signified. (2.) That there were sacraments under the
   old, as well as under the new economy. (3.) That God is their author,
   and operates through them. (4.) That Christ is the great object
   presented in them, the substance and matter of them, the lamb slain
   from the foundation of the world, the rock from which all the fathers
   drank, etc. (5.) Therefore, as far as the substance is concerned, the
   sacraments of the two dispensations are equal; they have the same
   author, the same significancy, and the same effects. (6.) The old have
   been abolished, and baptism and the Lord's Supper introduced in their
   place. (7.) Then follows an exposition of the constituent parts of a
   sacrament. First, the word, by which the elements are constituted
   sacred signs. Water, bread, and wine, are not in themselves, apart from
   the divine appointment, sacred symbols; it is the word of God added to
   them, consecrating, or setting them apart, which gives them their
   sacramental character. Secondly, the signs, being thus consecrated,
   receive the names of the things signified. Water is called
   regeneration; the bread and wine are called the body and blood of
   Christ. They are not changed in their own nature. They are called by
   the names of the things signified, because the two are sacramentally
   united, that is, united by mystical significance and divine
   appointment. (8.) In the next paragraph, this Confession rejects, on
   the one hand the Romish doctrine of consecration, and on the other, the
   idea that the sacraments are mere empty signs. (9.) The benefits
   signified are not so included in the sacraments or bound to them, that
   all who receive the signs receive the things which they signify; nor
   does their efficacy depend on the administrator; nor their integrity
   upon the receiver. As the Word of God continues his Word whether men
   believe or not; so is it with the sacraments.

   The twenty-first chapter is devoted to the Lord's Supper. It contains
   the following passages: "Ut autem rectius et perspicacius intelligatur,
   quomodo caro et sanguis Christi sint cibus et potus fidelium,
   percipianturque a fidelibus ad vitam æternam, paucula hæc adjiciemus.
   Manducatio non est unius generis. Est enim manducatio corporalis, qua
   cibus in os percipitur ab homine, dentibus atteritur, et in ventrem
   deglutitur. . . . . Est et spiritualis manducatio corporis Christi, non
   ea quidem, qua existimemus cibum ipsum mutari in spiritum, sed qua,
   manente in sua essentia et proprietate corpore et sanguine Domini, ea
   nobis communicantur spiritualiter, utique non corporali modo, sed
   spirituali, per Spiritum Sanctum, qui videlicet ea, quæ per carnem et
   sanguinem Domini pro nobis in mortem tradita, parata sunt, ipsam inquam
   remissionem peccatorum, liberationem, et vitam æternam, applicat et
   confert nobis, ita ut Christus in nobis vivat, et nos in ipso vivamus,
   efficitque ut ipsum, quo talis sit cibus et potus spiritualis noster,
   id est, vita nostra, vera fide percipiamus. . . . . Et sicut oportet
   cibum in nosmetipsos edendo recipere, ut operetur in nobis, suamque in
   nobis efficaciam exerat, cum extra nos positus, nihil nobis prosit: ita
   necesse est nos fide Christum recipere, ut noster fiat, vivatque in
   nobis, et nos in ipso. . . . . Ex quibus omnibus claret nos, per
   spiritualem cibum, minime intelligere imaginarium, nescio quem, cibum,
   sed ipsum Domini corpus pro nobis traditum, quod tamen percipiatur a
   fidelibus, non corporaliter, sed spiritualiter per fidem. . . . . Fit
   autem hic esus et potus spiritualis, etiam extra Domini coenam,
   quoties, aut ubicunque homo in Christum crediderit. Quo fortassis illud
   Augustini pertinet, Quid paras dentem et ventrem? crede, et
   manducasti."

   "Præter superiorem manducationem spiritualem, est et sacramentalis
   manducatio corporis Domini, qua fidelis non tantum spiritualiter et
   interne participat vero corpore et sanguine Domini, sed, foris etiam
   accedendo ad mensam Domini, accipit visibile corporis et sanguinis
   Domini sacramentum." [652]

   It is a remarkable fact that the confessions of the Church of England
   conform more nearly to the Zwinglian than to the Calvinistic ideas and
   phraseology in respect to the Lord's Supper. This may be accounted for
   by the fact that it was less important for the English than for the
   German churches to conciliate the Lutherans. In the articles adopted by
   the Synod of London in 1552, and approved by Edward VI., the first
   clause of the statement of the doctrine of the Lord's Supper is in the
   language of Scripture: "To those who receive it worthily and with
   faith, the bread which we break is the communion of the body of
   Christ." The second clause rejects transubstantiation. The third is
   directed against the Lutheran doctrine, and asserts that as Christ is
   in heaven; "non debet quisquam fidelium carnis ejus et sanguinis realem
   et corporalem (ut loquuntur) præsentiam in eucharistia vel credere vel
   profiteri."

   Article twenty-eight of the Thirty-nine Articles adopted in 1562,
   contains the first three clauses substantially as they appeared in the
   article of Edward VI., and then adds: "The body of Christ is given,
   taken, and eaten in the supper only after a heavenly and spiritual
   manner; and the mean whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten
   in the supper, is faith. The sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by
   Christ's ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, and worshipped."
   In the early edition of these articles, the clause against
   transubstantiation was amplified as follows: "Forasmuch as the truth of
   man's nature requireth, that the body of one and the selfsame man
   cannot be at one time in divers places, but must needs be in one
   certain place; therefore the body of Christ cannot be present at one
   time in many and divers places: and because as Holy Scripture doth
   teach, Christ was taken up into heaven, and there shall continue unto
   the end of the world; a faithful man ought not either to believe, or
   openly confess the real and bodily presence, as they term it, of
   Christ's flesh and blood in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper." [653]
   All this is implied in the form in which the article now stands. It
   affords clear evidence what were the sentiments of the English
   Reformers on this subject. It is principally interesting as it
   repudiates the idea of the "real presence" of the flesh and blood of
   Christ in the sacrament; which even Zwingle was willing to allow. He,
   however, used the word "real" in a very different sense from that in
   which it is used by either Romanists or Lutherans.

   The Sense in which Christ is present in the Lord's Supper.

   The extracts from the symbols of the Reformed Church enable us to
   answer, First, the question in what sense according to that Church,
   Christ is present in the Lord's Supper. The Reformed theologians are
   careful to explain what they mean by the word presence. Anything is
   said to be present when it operates duly on our perceiving faculties. A
   sensible object is present (præ sensibus) when it affects the senses. A
   spiritual object is present when it is intellectually apprehended and
   when it acts upon the mind. It is said of the wicked, "God is not in
   all their thoughts." They are without God. They are "far off." On the
   other hand, God is present with his people when He controls their
   thoughts, operates on their hearts, and fills them with the sense of
   his nearness and love. This presence is not imaginary, it is in the
   highest sense real and effective. In like manner Christ is present when
   He thus fills the mind, sheds abroad his love in our hearts by the Holy
   Ghost given unto us; and not only communicates to us the benefits of
   his sufferings and death, that is, the remission of our sins and
   reconciliation with God, but also infuses his life into us. Nothing is
   plainer from Scripture than that there is this communication of life
   from Christ to his people. It is not only directly asserted as when
   Paul says, "I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me" (Gal. ii. 20);
   and, He "is our life" (Col. iii. 4); but it is also illustrated in
   every way. As the body derives life from this head (Col. ii. 19) and
   the branches from the vine, so do believers derive their life from Him:
   on this point there is no dispute among Christians. This, again, is a
   presence to us and in us which. is not imaginary, but in the highest
   sense real and effective.

   But what is meant by the word Christ when He is said to be thus present
   with us? It does not mean merely that the Logos, the eternal Son of
   God, who fills heaven and earth, is present with us as He is with all
   his creatures; or, simply that He operates in us as He operates
   throughout the universe. Nor does it mean merely that his Spirit dwells
   in believers and works in them both to will and to do of his good
   pleasure. Something more than all this is meant. Christ is a person; a
   divine person with a human nature; that is with a true body and a
   reasonable soul. It is that person who is present with us. This again
   does not mean, that Christ's human nature, his body and soul are
   ubiquitous; but it does mean that a divine person with human affections
   and sympathies is near us and within us. We have now a high-priest who
   can be touched with a sense of our infirmities. (Heb. iv. 15.) He and
   we are one in such a sense that He is not ashamed to call us brethren.
   (Heb. ii. 11.) In all things He was made like unto his brethren that He
   might be what He still is, a merciful and faithful high priest. (Heb.
   ii. 17.) Of this every Christian is assured. [654] The prayers and
   hymns of the Church addressed to Christ all assume that He has human
   sympathies and affections which make his relation to us entirely
   different from what it is to any other order of beings in the universe.
   If any one asks, How the humanity of Christ, his body and soul in
   heaven, can sympathize with his people on earth? the answer is, that it
   is in personal union with the Logos. If this answer be deemed
   insufficient, then the questioner may be asked, How the dust of which
   the human body is formed can sympathize with the immortal spirit with
   which it is united? Whether the mystery of this human sympathy of
   Christ can be explained or not, it remains a fact both of Scripture and
   of experience. In this sense, and not in a sense which implies any
   relation to space, it may be said that wherever the divinity of Christ
   is, there is his humanity, and as, by common consent, He is present at
   his table, He is there in the fulness of his human sympathy and love.

   But this presence of Christ in the eucharist is predicated, not of his
   person only, but also of his body and blood. This presence the
   Reformed, as Zwingle said, "if they must have words," were willing to
   call real. But then they explained the word "real" as the opposite of
   "imaginary." The negative statements concerning this presence of the
   body and blood of Christ in the Lord's Supper are, --

   1. That it is not local or corporeal. It is not material or of the
   matter.

   2. It is not to the senses.

   3. It is not peculiar to this sacrament. Christ and his benefits, his
   body and blood, and all their influences on the believer, are said to
   be accessible to him, and as truly received by him out of the supper as
   in it.

   On this point the Confessions, even those signed by Calvin, are
   perfectly explicit. In the Zurich Confession, A.D. 1545, it is said,
   "Believers have in the Lord's Supper no other life-giving food than
   that which they receive elsewhere than in that ordinance." In the
   Second Helvetic Confession this is taught at length, and the doctrine
   vindicated from the objection that it renders the sacrament useless,
   that if we can receive without it what we receive in it, the importance
   of the sacrament is gone. The answer is, that as we continually need
   food for the body, so we continually need food for the soul; and that
   the sacraments as well as the Word are divinely appointed means for
   conveying that spiritual nourishment. That the sacraments are means of
   grace, does not render the Word unnecessary; neither does the Word's
   being effectual and sufficient unto salvation, render the sacraments
   useless. Calvin teaches the same doctrine: [655] "The verity which is
   figured in the sacraments believers receive our side of the use of
   them. Thus in baptism, Paul's sins were washed away, which had already
   been blotted out. Baptism was to Cornelius the layer cf regeneration,
   although he had before received the Spirit. And so in the Lord's
   Supper, Christ communicates Himself to us, although He had already
   imparted Himself to us and dwells within us." The office of the
   sacraments, he teaches, is to confirm and increase our faith. In his
   defence of this "Consensus," he expresses surprise that a doctrine so
   plainly proved by Scripture and experience should be called into
   question. [656] In the decree of the French National Synod of 1572, it
   is said, "The same Lord Jesus both as to his substance and gifts, is
   offered to us in baptism and the ministry of the word, and received by
   believers."

   The Church of England teaches the same doctrine, for in the office for
   the communion of the sick, the minister is directed to instruct a
   parishioner who is prevented from receiving the sacrament "that if he
   do truly repent him of his sins, and steadfastly believe that Jesus
   Christ hath suffered death upon the cross for him, and shed his blood
   for his redemption, earnestly remembering the benefits he hath thereby,
   and giving Him hearty thanks therefor, he doth eat and drink the body
   and blood of our Saviour Christ profitably to his soul's health,
   although he do not receive the sacrament with his mouth." On this point
   there was no diversity of opinion in the Reformed Church. There is no
   communion with Christ, no participation of his body and blood in the
   Lord's Supper, which is not elsewhere offered to believers and
   experienced by them.

   4. There is still another position maintained by the Reformed which is
   especially important as determining their doctrine on this subject.
   They not only deny that believers receive the body and blood of Christ
   in the Lord's Supper otherwise than these are received through the
   Word, but they deny that believers receive anything in the eucharist
   that was not granted and communicated to the saints under the Old
   Testament. This of course is decisive. Under the old dispensation it
   was only the sacrificial efficacy of his broken body and shed blood
   that could be enjoyed. He died for the remission of sins "under the
   first testament." (Heb. ix. 15.) Therefore the fathers as well as we,
   and they as fully as we, are cleansed by the sprinkling of his blood;
   to them, as well as to us, He was the true bread which came down from
   heaven; they all drank of that Spiritual Rock which was Christ. Calvin
   devotes several pages to the refutation of the doctrine of the
   Romanists that the sacraments of the Old Testament only signified
   grace, while those of the New actually convey it. He maintains that,
   though different in form, they are the same in nature, object, and
   effect. "Scholasticum autem illud dogma, quo tam longum discrimen inter
   veteris ac novæ Legis sacramenta notatur, perinde acsi illa non aliud
   quam Dei gratiam adumbrarint, hæc vero præsentem conferant, penitus
   explodendum est. Siquidem nihilo splendidius de illis Apostolus quam de
   his loquitur, quum docet patres eandem nobiscum spiritualem escam
   manducasse: et escam illam Christum interpretatur (1 Cor. x.
   3). . . . . Quicquid ergo nobis hodie in sacramentis exhibetur, id in
   suis olim recipiebant Judæi, Christum scilicet cum spiritualibus suis
   divitiis. Quam habent nostra virtutem, eam quoque in suis sentiebant;
   ut scilicet essent illis divinæ erga se benevolentiæ sigilla in spem
   æternæ salutis." He quotes freely from Augustine to prove that that
   eminent father taught "Sacramenta Judæorum in signis fuere diversa: in
   re quæ significatur, paria, diversa specie visibili, paria virtute
   spirituali." [657]

   With these negative statements agree all the affirmations concerning
   the presence of the body and blood in the Lord's Supper. What is
   affirmed to be present is not the body and blood of Christ absolutely,
   but his body as broken, and his blood as shed. It is he sacrifice which
   He offered that is present and of which the believer partakes. It is
   present to the mind, not to our bodies. It is perceived and received by
   faith and not otherwise. He is not present to unbelievers. By presence
   is meant not local nearness, but intellectual cognition and
   apprehension, believing appropriation, and spiritual operation. The
   body and blood are present to us when they fill our thoughts, are
   apprehended by faith as broken and shed for our salvation, and exert
   upon us their proper effect. [658] "The body of Christ is in heaven at
   the right hand of God," says the Helvetic Confession. "Yet the Lord is
   not absent from his Church when celebrating his supper. The sun is
   absent from us in heaven, nevertheless it is efficaciously present with
   us; how much more is Christ, the sun of righteousness, though absent as
   to the body, present with us, not corporally in deed, but spiritually,
   by his vivifying influence." Calvin says, "Every imagination of local
   presence is to be entirely removed. For while the signs are upon earth
   seen by the eyes and handled by the hands, Christ, so far as He is a
   man, is nowhere else than in heaven; and is to be sought only by the
   mind and by faith. It is, therefore, an irrational and impious
   superstition to include Him in the earthly elements." He likewise
   teaches that Christ is present in the promise and not in the signs.
   [659] Ursinus, one of the principal authors of the Heidelberg
   Catechism, in his Exposition of that formulary, says: "These two, I
   mean the sign and the thing signified, are united in this sacrament,
   not by any natural copulation, or corporal and local existence one in
   the other; much less by transubstantiation, or changing one into the
   other; but by signifying, sealing, and exhibiting the one by the other;
   that is, by a sacramental union, whose bond is the promise added to the
   bread, requiring the faith of the receivers. Whence it is clear, that
   these things, in their lawful use, are always jointly exhibited and
   received, but not without faith of the promise, viewing and
   apprehending the thing promised, now present in the sacrament; yet not
   present or included in the sign as in a vessel containing it; but
   present in the promise, which is the better part, life, and soul of the
   sacrament. For they want judgment who affirm that Christ's body cannot
   be present in the sacrament except it be in or under the bread; as if,
   forsooth, the bread alone, without the promise, were either a
   sacrament, or the principal part of a sacrament." [660]

   There is, therefore, a presence of Christ's body in the Lord's Supper;
   not local, but spiritual; not to the senses, but to the mind and to
   faith; and not of nearness, but of efficacy. If the presence is in the
   promise, then the body of Christ is present, offered to and received by
   the believer whenever and wherever he embraces and appropriates the
   promise. So far the doctrine of the Reformed Church is clear.

   Manducation.

   Our Lord in John vi. 53-58, expressly and solemnly declares that except
   a man eat of his flesh, and drink his blood, he has no life in him; and
   that whoso eateth his flesh and drinketh his blood, hath eternal life.
   It is here taught that the eating spoken of is necessary to salvation.
   He who does not eat of the flesh of the Son of Man, has no life in him.
   He who does thus eat, shall live forever. Now as no Christian Church,
   not even the Roman, maintains that a participation of the Lord's Supper
   is essential to salvation, it is plain that no such Church can
   consistently believe that the eating spoken of is that which is
   peculiar to that ordinance. Again, the Scriptures so clearly and
   variously teach that those who believe in Christ; who receive the
   record God has given of his Son; who receive Him; who flee to Him for
   refuge; who lay hold of Him as their God and Saviour, shall never
   perish but have eternal life; it is plain that what is expressed in
   John vi. by eating the flesh of Christ and drinking his blood, must be
   the same thing that is elsewhere expressed in the various ways just
   referred to. When we eat our food we receive and appropriate it to the
   nourishment of our bodies; so to eat the flesh of Christ, is to receive
   and appropriate him and his sacrificial work for the life of our souls.
   Without this appropriation of Christ to ourselves we have no life; with
   it, we have life eternal, for He is our life. As this appropriation is
   an act of faith, it is by believing that we eat his flesh and drink his
   blood. We accordingly find that this is recognized in all the leading
   Confessions of the Reformed Church. Thus in the Zurich Confession it is
   said, "Eating is believing, and believing is eating." The Helvetic
   Confession, as quoted above, [661] says, that this eating takes place
   as often as and wherever a man believes in Christ. The Belgic
   Confession says, [662] "God sent Christ as the true bread from heaven
   which nourishes and sustains the spiritual life of believers, if it be
   eaten, that is, if it be applied and received by the Spirit through
   faith." Faith, as shown above, is, in all these Confessions, declared
   to be the hand and the mouth by which this reception and appropriation
   are effected. A distinction may be, and often is, made between
   spiritual and sacramental manducation. But the difference between them
   is merely circumstantial. In the former the believer feeds on Christ to
   his spiritual nourishment, without the intervention and use of the
   elements of bread and wine; in the latter, he does the same thing in
   the use of those elements as the divinely appointed sign and seal of
   the truth and promise of God.

   Although the Confessions are thus uniform and clear in their assertion,
   "that eating is believing," the theologians, in some instances, make a
   distinction between them. Thus Calvin says: [663] "There are some who
   define in a word, that to eat the flesh of Christ, and to drink his
   blood, is no other than to believe on Christ Himself. But I conceive
   that in that remarkable discourse, in which He recommends us to feed
   upon his body, He intended to teach us something more striking and
   sublime; namely, that we are quickened by a real participation of Him,
   which he designates by the terms eating and drinking, that no person
   might suppose the life which we receive from Him to consist in simple
   knowledge. . . . . At the same time, we confess there is no eating but
   by faith, and it is impossible to imagine any other; but the difference
   between me and those whose opinion I now oppose is this, . . . . they
   consider eating to be faith itself, but I apprehend it to be rather a
   consequence of faith." Among the moderns Dean Alford makes much the
   same distinction. "What is this eating and drinking? Clearly, not
   merely faith: for faith answers to the hand reached forth for the food,
   -- but not the act of eating. Faith is a necessary condition of the
   act: so that we can hardly say, with Augustine, Crede, et manducasti;'
   but crede et manucabis.'" [664] Eating, he says, implies the act of
   appropriation. This is a distinction without a difference. It concerns
   simply the extent given to the meaning of the word faith. If faith be
   merely knowledge and assent, then there is a difference between
   believing and eating, or appropriating. But if by faith we not merely
   receive as with the hand, but appropriate and apply what is thus
   received, the difference between believing and eating disappears. When
   we are commanded to eat the flesh and to drink the blood of Christ, we
   are commanded to act; and the act required is an act of faith; the act
   of receiving and appropriating Christ and the benefits of his
   redemption. The language of Calvin above quoted is to be taken in
   connection with his explicit declaration already cited, that the
   Christian receives and feeds on Christ whenever he truly believes; and
   with the fact that he admits that the believer eats Christ as fully
   elsewhere as in the Lord's Supper; and especially with the fact that
   the saints under the old dispensation ate of the same spiritual meat
   and drank of the same spiritual drink as fully and as really as
   believers now do. The Reformed understood that "eating and drinking,"
   as used in John vi. 51-58, must be understood "figuratively of the
   spiritual appropriation of Christ by faith," because our Lord makes
   such eating and drinking essential to salvation. On this point the
   Lutherans are of one mind with the Reformed, in so far as their leading
   theologians understand all that is said in John vi. of eating his flesh
   and drinking his blood, of the appropriation of his sacrificial death
   by the act of believing.

   What is received in the Lord's Supper.

   The question, What is the act we perform in eating? and, What it is we
   eat? are distinct, though the answer to one may determine the answer to
   the other. If the manducation is not with the mouth but by faith, then
   the thing eaten must be spiritual and not material. Nevertheless our
   Lord says we must eat his flesh and drink his blood; and all the
   Reformed Confessions teach that we receive the body and blood of
   Christ, although not "after a corporal or carnal manner." In answer to
   the question, What is here meant by the body and blood of Christ? the
   almost uniform answer is, (1.) That it is not the matter of his body
   and blood. (2.) That it is not his body and blood as such. (3.) That it
   is not his glorified body now in heaven. His body and blood were
   received by the disciples before his death, and consequently before his
   ascension and glorification, and it is not disputed that believers
   since the apostolic age receive what the Apostles received when this
   sacrament was instituted. (4.) That we receive Christ's body as broken,
   or as given unto death for us. and his blood as shed for the remission
   of sins. (5.) That therefore to receive the body and blood as offered
   in the sacrament, or in the Word, is to receive and appropriate the
   sacrificial virtue or effects of the death of Christ on the cross. And,
   (6.) That as Christ and his benefits are inseparable, they who receive
   the one receive also the other; as by faith through the indwelling of
   the Holy Ghost we are united to Christ so as to be members of that body
   of which He is the head and the perpetual source of life. By faith,
   therefore, we become one with Him, so as to be flesh of his flesh, in a
   sense analogous to that in which husband and wife are no more two, but
   one flesh.

   Although Calvin admitted all these propositions, he nevertheless, at
   times, teaches that what the believers receive is specifically an
   influence from the glorified body of Christ in heaven. Thus he says:
   "We admit without circumlocution that the flesh of Christ is
   life-giving, not only because in it once our salvation was obtained,
   but because now, we being united to Him in sacred union, it breathes
   life into us. Or, to use fewer words, because, being by the secret
   power of the Spirit engrafted into the body of Christ, we have a common
   life with Him; for from the hidden fountain of divinity, life is, in a
   wonderful manner, infused into the flesh of Christ, and thence flows
   out to us." [665] Again, "Christ is absent from us as to the body; by
   his Spirit, however, dwelling in us, He so lifts us to Himself in
   heaven, that he transfuses the life-giving vigour of his life into us,
   as we grow by the vital heat of the sun." [666] If by the word "flesh,"
   in this connection, we understand the humanity of Christ, there is a
   sense in which the passages above quoted may be understood in
   accordance with the common doctrine not only of the Reformed, but of
   all Christian churches. When Paul said "I live; yet not I, but Christ
   liveth in me," he no doubt meant by Christ the incarnate Son of God
   clothed in our nature at the right hand of God. It is a divine-human
   Saviour, He who is both God and man in two distinct natures and one
   person forever, in whom and by whom we live, and who dwells in us by
   his Spirit. Unless we are willing to accuse the illustrious Calvin of
   inconsistency, his meaning must be made to harmonize with what he says
   elsewhere. In the "Consensus Tigurinus," he says: "Christus quatenus
   homo est, non alibi quam in coelo, nec aliter quam mente et fidei
   intelligentia quæ rendus est;" and again, "Quod autem carnis suæ esu et
   sanguinis potione, quæ hic figurantur, Christus animas nostras per
   fidem Spiritus sancti virtute pascit, id non perinde accipiendum, quasi
   fiat aliqua substantiæ vel commixtio vel transfusio: sed quoniam ex
   carne semel in sacrificium oblata et sanguine in expiationem effuso
   vitam hauriamus." [667] It is here expressly said that what the
   believer receives in the Lord's Supper is not any supernatural
   influence flowing from the glorified body of Christ in heaven; but the
   benefits of his death as an expiation for sin. It is to be remarked
   that Calvin uses the very words of the twenty-third article of the
   Consensus in explanation of what he meant by saying, "ex abscondito
   Deitatis fonte in Christi carnem mirabiliter infusa est vita, ut inde
   ad nos flueret." [668] To preserve the consistency of the great
   Reformer his language must be interpreted so as to harmonize with the
   two crucial facts for which he so earnestly contends; first, that
   believers receive elsewhere by faith all they receive at the Lord's
   table; and secondly, that we Christians receive nothing above or beyond
   that which was received by the saints under the Old Testament, before
   the glorified body of Christ had any existence. It is also to be
   remembered that Calvin avowed his agreement with Zwingle and
   Oecolampadius on all questions relating to the sacraments. [669]

   The Efficacy of the Lord's Supper as a Sacrament.

   This includes two points, first, The effect produced; and second, The
   agency or influence to which the effect is due. In the Lord's Supper we
   are said to receive Christ and the benefits of his redemption to our
   spiritual nourishment and growth in grace. As our natural food imparts
   life and strength to our bodies, so this sacrament is one of the
   divinely appointed means to strengthen the principle of life in the
   soul of the believer, and to confirm his faith in the promises of the
   gospel. The Apostle teaches that by partaking of the bread and wine,
   the symbols of Christ's body and blood given for us, we are thereby
   united to him as our head, and with all our fellow believers as joint
   members of his mystical body. The union between the head and members of
   the human body and between the vine and its branches, is a continuous
   union. There is a constant flow of vital influence from the one to the
   other. In like manner the union between Christ and his people is
   continuous. He constantly imparts his life-giving influence to all
   united to Him by faith and by the indwelling of his Spirit. It has
   often been stated already that the Bible teaches, (1.) That Christ and
   his people are one; that this union is not merely a union of
   congeniality or feeling, but such as constitutes them one in a real but
   mysterious sense. (2.) That the bond of union is faith and the
   indwelling of the Holy Spirit, who dwelling in Him without measure is
   communicated from Him to all his members. As God is everywhere present
   and everywhere operative by his Spirit, so Christ dwells in our hearts
   by faith through or in virtue of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. (3.)
   He is thus our life. He works in us to will and to do according to his
   own good pleasure. As God works everywhere throughout nature
   continually controlling all natural causes each after its kind, to
   produce the effects intended; so does Christ work in us according to
   the laws of our nature in the production of everything that is good; so
   that it is from Him that "all holy desires, all good counsels, and all
   just works do proceed." It is not, therefore, we that live, but Christ
   that liveth in us.

   As our Lord in addressing the Apostles and through them all his
   disciples, said this is my body and blood given for you, He says the
   same in the most impressive manner in this ordinance to every believing
   communicant: "This is my body broken for you." "This is my blood shed
   for you." These words when received by faith fill the heart with joy,
   confidence, gratitude, love, and devotion; so that such a believer
   rises from the Lord's table refreshed by the infusion of a new life.

   The efficacy of this sacrament, according to the Reformed doctrine, is
   not to be referred to any virtue in the ordinance itself, whether in
   its elements or actions; much less to any virtue in the administrator;
   nor to the mere power of the truths which it signifies; nor to the
   inherent, divine power in the word or promise by which it is attended;
   nor to the real presence of the material body and blood of Christ
   (i.e., of the body born of the Virgin), whether by the way of
   transubstantiation, consubstantiation, or impanation; [670] nor to a
   supernatural life-giving influence emanating from the glorified body of
   Christ in heaven, nor to the communication of the theanthropic nature
   of Christ, but only to "the blessing of Christ, and the working of his
   Spirit in them that receive" the sacrament of his body and blood.

   By some of the early fathers the resurrection of the body was regarded
   as a specific effect of the Lord's Supper, which was therefore called,
   as by Ignatius, [671] pharmakon athanasias, antidotos tou apothanein.
   This idea was connected in their minds with the doctrine of impanation
   referred to in the foregoing foot-note. Of this there is little trace
   in the theology of either the Reformed or Lutheran Church. In the
   Scotch Confession of 1560, it is indeed said: "As the eternal deity
   gives life and immortality to the flesh of Christ, so also his flesh
   and blood, when eaten and drunk by us, confer on us the same
   prerogatives;" and in the confession adopted by the Lutherans in 1592
   it is said, the body of Christ is received by the mouth "in pignus et
   certificationem resurrectionis nostrorum corporum ex mortuis;" on which
   Philippi remarks that those words do not imply any "immediate corporeal
   operation or any implanting in us of a germ of a resurrection body.
   They only teach that this sacrament is a pledge of our resurrection;
   and as this idea is introduced only in one place in the acknowledged
   standards of the Church, and there only incidentally, it is to be
   considered as a subordinate matter. The main point is the pledge of the
   pardon of sin and of eternal life which includes an assurance of the
   resurrection of the body." [672]

   According to the standards of the Reformed Church, therefore: The
   Lord's Supper is a holy ordinance instituted by Christ; as a memorial
   of his death, wherein, under the symbols of bread and wine, his body as
   broken and his blood as shed for the remission of sins, are signified,
   and, by the power of the Holy Ghost, sealed and applied to believers;
   whereby their union with Christ and their mutual fellowship are set
   forth and confirmed, their faith strengthened, and their souls
   nourished unto eternal life.

   Christ is really present to his people in this sacrament, not bodily,
   but in spirit; not in the sense of local nearness, but of efficacious
   operation. They receive Him, not with the mouth but by faith; they
   receive his flesh and blood, not as flesh, not as material particles,
   not its human life, not the supernatural influence of his glorified
   body in heaven; but his body as broken and his blood as shed. The union
   thus signified and effected is not a corporeal union, not a mixture of
   substances, but a spiritual and mystical union due to the indwelling of
   the Holy Spirit. The efficacy of this sacrament, as a means of grace,
   is not in the signs, nor in the service, nor in the minister, nor in
   the word, but in the attending influence of the Holy Ghost.

   [645] At the meeting of the national Synod of France in 1571, Beza
   being president, an application was made by certain deputies to have
   the clause in Article 37 of the Confession altered, which asserts that
   we are nourished with "the substance of Christ's body and blood." The
   Synod refused to make the alteration, and explained the expression by
   saying they did not understand by it, "any confusion, commixture, or
   conjunction, . . . . but this only, that by this virtue all that is in
   Him that is needful to our salvation, is hereby most freely given and
   communicated to us. Nor do we agree with those who say we communicate
   in his merits and gifts and Spirit, without his being made ours; but
   with the Apostle (Eph. v. 23), admiring this supernatural, and to us,
   incomprehensible, mystery, we believe we are partakers of his body
   delivered to death for us, and of his blood shed for us, so that we are
   flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones, and that we receive Him
   together with his gifts by faith, wrought in us by the incomprehensible
   virtue and efficacy of the Holy Spirit." This decision offended the
   Zurich ministers.

   [670] One of the numerous theories concerning the eucharist prevalent
   more or less in the early church, was that which is known in the
   history of doctrine as impanation. As in man the soul is united to the
   body imparting to it life and efficiency without itself becoming
   material, or rendering the body spirit; and as the Eternal Logos became
   flesh by taking to Himself a true body and a reasonable soul, without
   receiving anything human into his divine nature, or imparting divinity
   to his humanity; so the same Logos becomes united with the consecrated
   bread, without any substantial change in it or in Him. His relation to
   the bread, however, is analogous to that of the soul to the body in man
   and of the Logos to humanity in the person of our Lord. As the
   assumption of our nature by the Son of God is expressed by the word
   "incarnation," so his assumption and union with the bread in the Lord's
   Supper is called "impanation." The only distinguished modern theologian
   (as far as known to the writer), who advocated this doctrine, was the
   late Dr. August Hahn of the University if Leipzig. "Bread and wine," he
   says, "in the Lord's Supper, are what the human body formerly was when
   the Son of God (the divine Logos) was here on earth; that is, the means
   of his perceptible presence and efficiency on those who receive Him in
   a penitent and believing heart; they are therefore = the body and blood
   of Christ; since in them the Lord, who is the Light, the Life, and the
   Resurrection, communicates Himself actually, truly, and essentially
   (wirklich und wahrhaftig und wesentlich) to his people, and makes this
   bread, the bread of eternal life." See Lehrbuch des Christlichen
   Glaubens, von August Hahn, Leipzig, 1828, p. 602. On page 603, he says,
   Luther was right in rejecting the doctrine of transubstantiation, and
   "he would have been right had he taught that with in, with, and under
   the bread and wine in the Holy Supper, we actually and essentially or
   really (wirklich und wesentlich) receive the present person of Jesus
   Christ or the Logos, and hence this bread and this wine are the body
   and blood of Christ, wherein He now communicates the bread which is
   from heaven to believers, as formerly when He came in literal flesh and
   blood He gave Himself to them. But Luther erred when he asserted that
   with, in, and under the bread and wine, the real body which suffered
   for us, and the blood of Jesus Christ which was shed for us, are
   communicated, because according to the Scriptures (1 Cor. xv. 45-50),
   the spiritual, heavenly body of our glorified Lord, is not flesh and
   blood; and a body, whatever be its nature, cannot as body be
   ubiquitous."

   § 17. Modern Views concerning the Lord's Supper.

   The modern philosophy has introduced certain principles as to the
   nature of God and his relation to the world, and as to the nature of
   man and his relation to God, which when applied to Christian doctrines
   have produced a revolution in theology. It has already been shown that
   the principles of this philosophy in their application to the origin
   and present state of man, to the person and work of Christ, and to the
   way in which men are made partakers of his salvation, have introduced a
   method of presenting the gospel utterly unintelligible to those
   unacquainted with the modern speculations. The word philosophy is to be
   understood in a sense wide enough to include a great diversity of
   systems, which although they have certain principles in common, differ
   widely from each other. They belong to two general classes, the
   pantheistic and theistic, which merge off into each other in every
   variety of form, and in different degrees of approximation towards
   identity.

   According to the pantheistic theory, the world is the ever varying and
   unfolding existence form of God; and man is the form in which He comes
   to consciousness on this earth. According to the theistic theory, the
   world owes its existence to the will of God, in which He is immanent
   and of which He is the life. Man is the form in which generic humanity
   is manifested in connection with a given corporeal organization. On
   neither view is there any real dualism between God and the world, or
   God and man except as occasioned by sin. The oneness of God and man is
   affirmed by both classes, by Cousin and Ullman for example, with equal
   earnestness. This is a oneness which admits of diversity; it is a unity
   in plurality; but it is a oneness of life; and such a unity of nature
   that God may become man, and man God.

   The individuality or personality of man depends on the body. Generic
   humanity is not in itself a person. It becomes personal only by its
   union with an organized body. It loses its personality when it has
   nobody; and therefore the immortality of the soul, as distinct from the
   body, is pronounced by Olshausen an anti-Christian or pagan idea.
   Whatever of conscious existence the soul has between death and the
   resurrection must be connection with its body, which is not the prison,
   or garment, or shell, or hull of the soul; it is not in any way one
   form of existence and the soul another; both form one life. The soul to
   be complete to develop itself, as a soul, must externalize itself,
   throw itself out in space; and this externalization is the body. All is
   one process, one and the same organic principle, dividing itself only
   that its unity may become the more free and intensely complete. The
   soul and body are one; one and the same organic principle. [673]

   The same principles are applied to the explanation of the doctrine of
   the person of Christ. According to the decisions of the ecumenical
   councils of Chalcedon and Constantinople, which have been accepted by
   all Christendom, the Eternal Son of God became man by taking to Himself
   a true body and a reasonable soul, and so was, and continues to be,
   both God and man in two distinct natures and one person forever. By
   nature (phusis) is meant substance (ousia), as these words are used
   interchangeably. By the one nature He is consubstantial with us men;
   and by the other He is consubstantial with the Father.

   This dualism, this hypostatic union of two distinct substances in the
   person of Christ, involves, as taught by those councils and believed by
   all Christendom, two energeiai, two operations, two wills. There is no
   mixture or confusion of these two natures; no transfer of the
   properties of the one to the other, but each retains its own peculiar
   attributes.

   On the other hand, the modern German theology rejects this distinction
   of natures in Christ. It denies all dualism in the constitution of his
   person. It teaches that Christ did not assume, "a reasonable soul" into
   personal union with Himself, but either that He himself became, by a
   process of self-limitation, such a soul, or that He assumed generic
   humanity, so that He did not become a man, but the man. His assumption
   of humanity was something general, and not merely particular. The Word
   became flesh; not a single man only as one of many; but flesh of
   humanity in its universal conception; otherwise He could not be the
   principle of a new order of existence for the human world as such. By
   this assumption of humanity, the divine and human, God and man, become
   one in such a sense as to exclude all dualism. There are not a divine
   and a human, but there is a theanthropic, or divine-human nature or
   life. As in man there is not one life of the body and another of the
   soul, but the two are one and the same organic principle, so in the
   case of Christ the divine and human are one and the same. The divine
   nature of Christ is at the same time human in the fullest sense.
   Humanity is never complete till it reaches his person. It includes in
   its very constitution a struggle towards the form in which it is here
   exhibited, and can never rest until this end is attained. Our nature
   reaches after a true and real union with the nature of God, as the
   necessary complement and consummation of its own life. The idea which
   it embodied can never be fully actualized under any other form. The
   incarnation, then, is the proper completion of humanity. Christ is the
   true ideal man. Here is reached ultimately the highest summit of human
   life, which is of course the crowning sense of the word, or that in
   which it finds its last and full significance.

   The first man, Adam, is to be viewed under a twofold character. In one
   respect he was simply a man; in another, he was the man, in whose
   person was included the whole human race. His individual personality
   was limited wholly to himself; but a whole world of like separate
   personalities lay involved in his life, at the same time, as a generic
   principle or root. All these in a deep sense, form at last but one and
   the same life. Adam lives in his posterity as truly as he ever lived in
   his own person. They participate in his whole nature, soul and body,
   and are truly bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh. So the life of
   Christ is to be viewed under the same twofold aspect. He, as was Adam,
   is an individual person. But as Adam included in himself the race, he
   included all other human persons in his life; so Christ, having assumed
   generic humanity into personal union with Himself, includes in a still
   higher sense a world of other personalities. "He was Himself the race."
   He has assumed generic humanity into personal union with Himself and
   thereby rendered it divine; it is indeed a true human life, but it is
   nevertheless divine. It is one life; not the life of the Logos
   separately considered, but the life of the Word made flesh. He was man
   more perfectly than Adam Himself, before the fall; humanity stood
   revealed in Him under its most perfect form. The humanity which He
   assumed was not new, but the humanity of Adam raised to a higher
   character, and filled with new meaning and power, by its union with the
   divine nature, The identity of Adam and his race is not material. Not a
   particle of Adam's body has come into ours. The identity resolves
   itself into an invisible law; and it is not one law for the body and
   another law for the soul; but one and the same law involves the
   presence of both, as the power of a common life. Where the law works,
   there Adam's life is reproduced, body and soul together. And still the
   individual Adam is not blended with his posterity in any such way as to
   lose his own personality or to swallow up theirs. His identity with his
   posterity is generic; but none the less real or close on that account.
   The case in regard to Christ and his people is analogous. His life,
   generic humanity as united in one life with the divine in his person
   passes over to his people. And as the race of individual men is
   developed by a regular, natural, organic process from the generic
   humanity in the person of Adam, so the life of Christ rests not in his
   separate person, but passes over to his people; this takes place in the
   way of history, growth, or regular living development. In regeneration
   we become partakers of this new principle of life, that is, of generic
   humanity as united with the divine nature, which involves a
   participation of the entire humanity of Christ. We are not joined in a
   real life unity with the everlasting Logos, apart from Christ's
   manhood, in the way of direct personal in-being. This would make us
   equal with Christ. The mystical union would then be the hypostatical
   union itself repeated in the person of every believer. It is not the
   divine life of the Logos as such, but the theanthropic life of Christ
   which passes over to his people. "The personality of the Son," says
   Olshausen [674] "as comprehensive, includes in itself all the
   personalities of his people and pervades them with his own life, as the
   living centre of an organism, from which life flows forth and to which
   it returns."

   The life which is thus conveyed to us is a true human life, controlling
   not only the soul but also the body. It is corporeal as well as
   incorporeal. It must put on an outward form and project itself in
   space. It is to be remembered that human life is not to be split into
   two lives, one of the body and another of the soul, thus constituting a
   dualism in our nature, instead of the absolute unity which belongs to
   it in fact. Soul and body, are, in their ground, but one life;
   identical in their origin; bound together by interpenetration
   subsequently at every point, and holding together in the presence and
   power of the same organic law. The life of Christ, lodged in us, works
   in us according to the law which it includes in its own constitution.
   That is, it works as a human life; and as such becomes the law of
   regeneration in the body as truly as in the soul. This does not suppose
   any actual approach of Christ's body to the persons of his people; nor
   any ubiquity or idealistic dissipation of that body; nor any fusion of
   this personality with ours. We must distinguish between the simple man
   and the universal man, here joined in the same person. Adam was an
   individual and the whole race. There is no dissipation of Christ's
   personality into the general consciousness of the Church involved in
   the affirmation that his person forms the ground, out of which and in
   the power of which only, the whole life of the Church continually
   subsists. In this view Christ is personally present always in the
   Church, that is, of course, in the power of his divine nature. But his
   divine nature is at the same time human, in the fullest sense, and
   wherever his presence is revealed in a real way, it includes the person
   necessarily under the one aspect as well as under the other; with all
   this, however, which is something very different from the conception of
   a proper ubiquity in the case of Christ's body, we do not relinquish
   the thought of his separate human individuality. We distinguish between
   his universal humanity in the Church, and his humanity as a particular
   man, whom the heavens have received till the time of the restitution of
   all things. His glorified body, we doubt not, is possessed of
   qualities, attributes, and powers, that transcend immeasurably all we
   know or can think of a human body here. Still it is a body, a
   particular human body, having organized parts and an outward form. As
   such of course it must be defined and circumscribed by local limits,
   and cannot be supposed to be present in different places at the same
   time.

   The life of Christ as communicated to his people is a true human life;
   and all life, in the case of man, is actualized, and can be actualized,
   only in the way of process or gradual historical development. All that
   belongs, then, to the new life of the Christian, conceived as complete
   at the last day, must be allowed to be involved in it as principle and
   process from the beginning. In every stage of its progress it is a true
   human life answerable to the nature of its organic root, and to the
   nature also of the subject in which it is lodged. The bodies of the
   saints in glory will be only the last result, in organic continuity, of
   the divine life of Christ implanted in their souls at their
   regeneration. There is nothing abrupt in Christianity. It is a
   supernatural constitution indeed; but as such it is clothed in a
   natural form, and involves in itself as regular a law of historical
   development, as the old creation itself. The resurrection body will be
   simply the ultimate outburst of the life that had been ripening for
   immortality under cover of the old Adamic nature before. The winged
   psyche has its elemental organization in the worm, and does not lose it
   in the tomb-like chrysalis. The resurrection of the body is, therefore,
   as much a natural process as the development of the butterfly from the
   grub, or the flower from the seed. [675]

   Applications of these Principles to the Lord's Supper.

   It is obvious that as the principles above stated must modify the whole
   method, and, so to speak, theory of salvation, se they must also
   determine the view taken of the Lord's Supper. They necessarily exclude
   the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation; and the Lutheran doctrine
   that the real natural body and blood of Christ are present in, with,
   and under the bread and wine in this sacrament, and received after a
   corporal manner ("corporaliter") by the mouth. No less obviously do
   they exclude the doctrine of Calvin that what is received by the
   believer in the Lord's Supper is a supernatural influence emanating
   from the glorified body of Christ in heaven. In like manner they
   exclude the Reformed doctrine that what is received are the sacrificial
   benefits of the broken body of Christ, which benefits are not only the
   forgiveness of sins and reconciliation with God, but the indwelling of
   the Holy Spirit by which we are united to Christ and made partakers of
   his salvation. As our redemption, according to this theory, is effected
   by introducing into the centre of our being a new principle of life, a
   new organic law, which by its operation and gradual development works
   out our salvation; and as this new life is generic humanity united with
   the divine nature of Christ so as to become truly divine while it is
   still truly human, and yet only one and the same life, it follows that
   it is not the body and blood of Christ, but his theanthropic nature
   that we receive in the Holy Communion.

   We are therefore told that the real communication which believers have
   with Christ in the Holy Supper, extends to his whole person. To be real
   and not simply moral, it must be thus comprehensive. We may divide
   Christ in our thoughts, abstracting his divinity from his humanity, or
   his soul from his body. But no such dualism has place in his actual
   person -- that is, no dualism between his divinity and humanity, or,
   between his soul and body If therefore He be received by us at all, He
   must be received in a whole way. We partake not of certain rights and
   privileges only, which have been secured for us by the breaking of his
   body and the shedding of his blood, but of the veritable substantial
   life of the beloved Immanuel Himself, as the fountain and channel by
   which alone all these benefits can be conveyed into our souls. We
   partake not of his divinity only, nor yet of his Spirit as separate
   from Himself, but also of his true and proper humanity. Not of his
   humanity in a separate form, his flesh and blood disjoined from his
   Spirit; but of the one life which is the union of both -- Spirit in
   such connections seems to stand not for the Holy Spirit, but for the
   divine nature of Christ, for the life of Christ is not the union of the
   Holy Spirit with his humanity -- and in virtue of which the presence of
   the one must ever involve in the same form, and to the same extent, the
   presence of the other. What we receive is therefore his whole life, as
   a single undivided form of his existence, by one and the same process.
   The participation of Christ's life in the sacrament is in no sense
   corporeal, but altogether spiritual, as the necessary condition of its
   being real. It is the soul or spirit of the believer that is
   immediately fed with the grace which is conveyed to it mystically in
   the holy ordinance. But this is in fact a fruition which belongs to the
   entire man, for the life made over to him under such central form,
   becomes at once in virtue of its own human character, and of the human
   character of the believer himself, a renovating force which reaches out
   into his person on all sides, and fills with its presence the totality
   of his nature.

   The same system substantially is unfolded by Ebrard in his "Christliche
   Dogmatik." What is taught concerning the Lord's Supper presupposes what
   is taught of the nature of man and of the person of Christ. In the
   sacrament of the supper we are united to Christ; but the nature of our
   union with Christ depends upon the nature of the parties to that union.
   Humanity as a generic life developed from Adam as its root and centre,
   being corrupted by sin, is healed by its union with the divine nature
   in the person of Christ, or according to Ebrard's mode of
   representation, by the Logos becoming a man by a process of
   self-limitation. Every man from the first moment of his existence
   possesses "ein substantielles Centrum seines mikrokosmischen Lebens,
   . . . . . ein Centrum, welches da war, ehe der Mensch bewusste Gedanken
   hatte, und welches bleiben wird, wenn der Leib dem Tode verfällt,
   welches also an sich weder Gedanke (mens) noch materieller Stoff ist."
   [676] That is, every man has from the commencement of his being "a
   substantial centre of life, which precedes conscious mental activity,
   and which will remain when the body dies, and therefore in itself is
   neither mind (mens) nor matter." This life-centre is instinct with a
   force which develops itself as mind and body, physically and
   psychologically. It is the Ego, the personality. It is the seat of
   regeneration which consists in introducing into this substantial centre
   of our being a new organic law which gives rise to a new development.
   This new law, or principle of life is the substance of Christ. Herein
   consists the mystical union. "This union is a central, that is, an
   organic union between the soul-centre, (seelischen Centrum) of the
   exalted incarnate one and our soul-centre, so that Christ from our
   centre pervades, controls, and sanctifies, both our physical-somatic,
   and our noetic life." [677] A few lines further on it is said, "This
   communication is real, not imaginary in that before all our thought,
   the substantial centre of our physical and noetic life is organically
   united with Christ's centre, [so that in the Lord's Supper] we receive
   a new communication of the substance (Substanzmittheilung) of the
   glorified Son of man." [678] What is communicated is sometimes said to
   be "the person of Christ," sometimes "the whole Christ," sometimes "his
   life," sometimes "his whole human life," and sometimes the "organic law
   of Christ's human life." The Lord's Supper, therefore, is by Ebrard
   declared to be an ordinance "wherein Christ renews the mystical union,
   the real life-bond, with his people, in that He renewedly implants
   Himself, his person, and glorified humanity in them, objectively,
   really, and centrally, and thus confirms and renews their participation
   in the benefits of his death." [679]

   This theory repudiates the doctrine of transubstantiation, the Lutheran
   doctrine of oral manducation of the true, natural body and blood of
   Christ; the Calvinistic idea of an emanation from the glorified body of
   Christ, the Reformed doctrine of the reception of the benefits of
   Christ's sacrificial death, and of Christ Himself by the indwelling of
   his Spirit, and insists on the communication of the divine humanity of
   Christ to the soul of the believer as a new organic law, somewhat in
   the same way as magnetism is added to iron as a new controlling law.
   Philippi [680] reviews the exhibitions of the doctrine of the eucharist
   given by the leading German theologians from Schleiermacher to Lange.
   The epithet of "mystic-theosophical," which he applies to the doctrine
   of Lange, applies with more or less propriety to all the modern German
   theories. They are unintelligible to the majority of educated men, and
   as to the poor, for whom the gospel is especially designed, they are
   absolutely meaningless.

   Remarks.

   As the theory above referred to, in its main features has been
   repeatedly brought under review in these pages, there is the less need
   for any remarks in its application to the doctrine of the Lord's
   Supper. It may be sufficient to call attention to the following points:
   --

   1. If there be no such thing as generic humanity, no such objective
   reality; if Adam were not the human race; if he and his posterity are
   not identical in such a sense that his acts were their acts as truly as
   they were his own; in other words, if the scholastic doctrine of
   realism, which until of late, has been regarded as utterly exploded, be
   not true, then this whole theory collapses. Its foundation is gone.

   2. If it be not true that in man the soul and body are one, one living
   substance developing itself under two aspects, so that there can be no
   soul without a body; if in the person of Christ there are two
   substances or natures hypostatically united, and not only one nature
   and life, so that his divine nature is in the fullest sense human, and
   his human, divine, then again the whole foundation of the theory is
   gone; then there can be no communication of his divine humanity or
   theanthropic life to his people to be in them the germ of a new life,
   noetic and somatic, to be historically developed as was the nature
   derived from Adam, until it issues in the resurrection and final
   consummation.

   3. It is to be remembered that it is said that this generic humanity
   which constitutes the identity between Adam and his race which is the
   analogue of the mystical union between Christ and his people, resolves
   itself into "an invisible law." Now what does that mean? What is a law?
   In the lips of philosophers and scientists the word law often means
   nothing more than a fact. What are the laws of Kepler but facts? By the
   laws of nature is often meant nothing more than generalizations
   concerning the orderly sequence of events. At other times a law means a
   uniformly acting force. An organic law is a force uniformly acting to
   produce a given organic result. The germ of a bird and of a fish are
   undistinguishable by the microscope or by chemical agents; yet by an
   organic law, a uniformly acting force, the one develops into a bird,
   the other into a fish. What then is meant by saying that generic
   humanity resolves itself in a law? Can it mean anything more than a
   uniformly acting force? Then when it is said that generic humanity as
   united with the divine nature, so as to become itself divine while it
   continues human, is communicated to us, does it mean anything more than
   that a new uniformly acting force is implanted in our nature, as when
   the magnetic force is introduced into a piece of iron -- an
   illustration, obviously imperfect indeed, used by the advocates of the
   theory? Then what becomes of a personally present Christ? All Christ
   does for us is to implant a new law in our nature, which by its
   natural, historical development works out our salvation. It is this
   aspect of the case that made the German opposers of Schleiermacher, say
   that after all he had a Christ that was, but is not now. Christ
   appeared in the world, and produced a certain effect, and then passed
   away, leaving nothing but his memory. It is not said that the advocates
   of the theory in question view the matter in this light; but it is said
   that some of the first minds among his countrymen regarded this as the
   logical consequence of Schleiermacher's system. That system passed in
   Germany for what it was worth, an ingenious philosophical theory. In
   this country it is propounded as the truth of God.

   4. It is a part of the theory under consideration that we become
   partakers of Christ's redemption only in virtue of our participation of
   his life. His life brings with it his merit and his power. He is our
   wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption only so far as,
   and only because, we become subjectively wise, righteous, holy, and
   free from the consequences of our sins. It is the Christ within us and
   not the Christ without us and above us, that is our confidence and
   glory. It is hard to see on this theory what meaning there is in
   praying to Christ for his intercession, his guidance, his protection,
   or his love. He has implanted a new law within us which works out our
   salvation by just as natural a process of development, as that by which
   a seed expands into plant and flower. It is not for other men to say
   how a theory lies in the minds of its advocates, or to sit in judgment
   on their religious experience; but they have the right to protest
   against any theory which, in their apprehension of it, takes away their
   personal Saviour and gives them nothing but a new invisible law in
   their members; which substitutes for the Incarnate Son of God "the
   organic law of Christ's human life."

   5. This new doctrine is a philosophy; and philosophy we know from an
   infallible authority, is a vain deceit. It is vain (kene) empty; void
   of truth, weightless and worthless. It is moreover, a deceit; it
   disappoints and misleads. This is not said of natural philosophy, which
   concerns itself with the facts and laws of nature; nor of moral
   philosophy, which treats of the phenomena and laws of our moral nature;
   nor of intellectual philosophy, which deals with the operations and
   laws of mind as revealed in consciousness. But it is said of
   speculative philosophy; of every system which undertakes to determine
   on à priori speculative principles, the nature of God, the origin and
   constitution of the universe, the nature of man and of his relation to
   God, or to use common language, of the finite to the infinite. It was
   the oriental philosophy which the Spirit of God by the pen of St. Paul,
   in his Epistle to the Colossians, pronounced "a vain deceit." He says
   the same thing in the Epistle to the Corinthians of the Greek
   philosophy, whether Eleatic or Platonic. This judgment of inspiration
   is confirmed by experience. Who now cares a straw for the speculations
   of the ancients, of the schoolmen, or of their modern successors. Who
   is now a Hegelian? Forty years ago, who was not? We were told then, as
   we are told now, that certain scientific principles have a right to be
   respected and employed in the exposition of the doctrine of the Bible.
   But what is called science -- in the sphere of speculation -- in one
   age, is repudiated as nonsense in another. No philosophy has the right
   to control or modify the exposition of the doctrines of the Bible,
   except the philosophy of the Bible itself; that is, the principles
   which are therein asserted or assumed.

   [675] To avoid the danger of misrepresentation the exhibition of the
   principles of this modern aspect of theology has been given in great
   measure in the language of its advocates. No reference to names is
   given, so that no one is made responsible for the views expressed.
   Experience teaches that quoting a man's words is no security against
   the charge of misrepresentation. The writer was grieved to learn that
   his friend of more than forty years standing, Dr. John W. Nevin,
   considers himself to be unjustly charged by us with holding doctrines
   which he earnestly repudiates. On page 429 of the second volume of this
   work he is quoted as saying that Hegel's Christological ideas, "are
   very significant and full of instruction." This has been construed as
   charging him with being a thorough Hegelian. As to this construction,
   we would say, first, that nothing was further from this writer's mind
   than the intention of making such an imputation; and secondly, that the
   language used gives no fair ground for such an interpretation. On the
   preceding pages (428) Dorner is quoted as saying that "the foundations
   of the new Christology were laid by Schelling, Hegel and
   Schleiermacher." Dorner certainly did not mean to intimate that all the
   modern Christologists, himself included, were Hegelians. Neither did we
   intend to intimate that Dr. Nevin adopted Hegel's philosophy as a
   system, which we know, from his own authority, he abhors. Again, it is
   said that Dr. Nevin is represented as denying the divinity of Christ,
   because he is quoted as saying that our lord was the ideal, or perfect
   man, that "his divine nature is at the same time human in the fullest
   sense." (Mystical Presence, Philadelphia, 1846, p. 174.) Those who
   understand this language as necessarily involving the denial of the
   divinity of Christ are forgetful of the fact that the oneness of God
   and man is the primary principle of the New Theology. Even Lutherans
   hold that the humanity of Christ is capable of receiving the attributes
   of divinity, that as a man He is omniscient, omnipresent, and almighty.
   Schleiermacher, as we understand him, had no other personal God, than
   Christ. We doubt not, and have never intimated anything to the
   contrary, that Dr. Nevin, although he makes Christ the ideal or perfect
   man, attributes to Him in his theory and in his heart, all the
   perfections with which the most devout believer in his divinity invests
   the adorable Redeemer. How he reconciles this with his representing Him
   as the Ideal man; and with the assertion that He has but one life in
   the fullest sense human, it is not for us to say. The same thing,
   however, is done by many others beside Dr. Nevin.

   § 18. The Lutheran Doctrine concerning the Lord's Supper.

   Protestants at the time of the Reformation agreed on all the great
   doctrines of the Gospel. Luther was as thorough an Augustinian as
   Calvin. There would have been no schism had it not been for the
   difference of views which gradually arose on the true nature of the
   sacrament of the Lord's Supper. And even on this point, such was the
   desire to avoid division, and such the spirit of concession manifested
   by the Reformed, that a schism would have been avoided, had it not been
   that Luther insisted on the adoption of the very words in which he
   stated his doctrine on the subject. That there was a real difference
   between the parties must be admitted, but that difference was not such
   as to justify a division in the ranks of Protestants; and the Reformed
   were willing to adopt a mode of stating the doctrine which both parties
   could receive without a violation of conscience. One attempt after
   another designed to effect a compromise failed, and the Lutherans and
   Reformed separated into two ecclesiastical denominations, and so remain
   at the present time. In the Evangelical Church of Prussia under the
   pressure of the government, the two parties have been brought into one
   Church which comprehends the greater part of the people. But beyond the
   limits of Prussia the two Churches remain distinct, though no longer in
   a state of mutual alienation.

   Luther took his stand on the words of Christ, "This is my body," which
   he insisted must be understood literally. He would admit of no figure
   in the subject, copula, or predicate. Christ affirmed that "This," that
   which I hold in my hand, and which I give you to eat, is my body. [681]
   This position having been assumed it necessarily led to a statement of
   what is meant by the body and blood of Christ; in what sense the bread
   is his body and the wine his blood; how they are given and received;
   and what are the effects of such reception. On all these points the
   surest sources of information on the real doctrine of the Lutheran
   Church is to be found in its authorized symbols.

   Statement of the Doctrine in the Symbolical Books.

   The tenth article of the first part of the Augsburg Confession is very
   short, and is couched in language which Calvin would not, and did not,
   hesitate to adopt. "De Coena Domini docent, quod corpus et sanguis
   Christi vere adsint et distribuantur vescentibus in Coena Domini, et
   improbant secus docentes." [682]

   The language of the Apology is more explicit: "Decimus articulus
   approbatus est, in quo confitemur, nos sentire, quod in Coena Domini
   vere et substantialiter adsint corpus et sanguis Christi, et vere
   exhibeantur cum illis rebus, quæ videntur, pane et vino, his, qui
   sacramentum accipiunt." "Non negamus recta nos fide caritateque sincera
   Christo spiritualiter conjungi; sed nullam nobis conjunctionis rationem
   secundum carnem cum illo esse, id profecto pernegamus, idque a divinis
   Scripturis omnino alienam dicimus." [683]

   In the Smalcald Articles [684] it is said: "De sacramento altaris
   sentimus, panem et vinum in Coena esse verum corpus et sanguinem
   Christi, et non tantum dari et sumi a piis, sed etiam impiis
   christianis."

   "De transubstantione subtilitatem sophisticam nihil curamus, qua
   fingunt, panem et vinum relinquere et amittere naturalem suam
   substantiam, et tantum speciem et colorem panis, et non verum panem
   remanere. Optime enim cum sacra Scriptura congruit, quod panis adsit et
   maneat, sicut Paulus ipse nominat Panis quem frangimus. Et: Ita edat de
   pane."

   In the Smaller Catechism it is asked: "Quid est sacramentum altaris?
   Responsio. Sacramentum altaris est verum corpus et verus sanguis Domini
   nostri Jesu Christi, sub pane et vino, nobis Christianis ad manducandum
   ac bibendum ab ipso Christo institutum. Quid vero prodest, sic
   comedisse et bibisse? Responsio. Id indicant nobis hæc verba: Pro vobis
   datur; et: Effunditur in remissionem peccatorum. Nempe quod nobis per
   verba illa in sacramento remissio peccatorum, vita, justitia et salus
   donentur. Ubi enim remissio peccatorum est, ibi est et vita et salus.
   Qui potest corporalis illa manducatio tantas res efficere? Responsio.
   Manducare et bibere ista certe non efficiunt, sed illa verba, quæ hic
   ponuntur: Pro vobis datur, et: Effunditur in remissionem peccatorum;
   quæ verba sunt una cum corporali manducatione caput et summa hujus
   sacramenti. Et qui credit his verbis, ille habet, quod dicunt, et sicut
   sonant, nempe remissionem peccatorum." [685]

   Luther in his Larger Catechism enlarges on all these points; answers
   various objections to his doctrine; insists upon the necessity of faith
   in order to the profitable reception of the ordinance; and exhorts to
   frequent attendance on the ordinance.

   The Form of Concord gives the affirmative statement of the doctrine;
   and then the negation of all the opposing views. It affirms: First, the
   true and substantial presence of the body and blood of Christ in this
   sacrament. Second, that the words of institution are to be understood
   literally, so that the bread does not signify the absent body, nor the
   wine the absent blood of Christ, but on account of the sacramental
   union "panis et vinum vere sint corpus et sanguis Christi." Third, that
   the cause of this presence is not the consecration by man, but is due
   solely to the omnipotent power of our Lord Jesus Christ. Fourth, the
   prescribed words of institution are on no account to be omitted. Fifth,
   the fundamental principles on which the doctrine rests are, (1.) That
   Jesus Christ is inseparably true, essential, natural, perfect God and
   man in one person. (2.) That the right hand of God is everywhere, and,
   therefore, Christ, "ratione humanitatis suæ," being truly and actually
   at the right hand of God is, as to his humanity, everywhere present.
   (3.) "Quod verbum Dei non est falsum, aut mendax." (4.) That God knows,
   and has in his power various modes of presence, and is not bound to
   that particular mode which philosophers are accustomed to call local or
   circumscriptive. Sixth, that the body and blood of Christ are received
   not only spiritually by faith, but also by the mouth, yet not
   "capernaitice," but in a supernatural and celestial way, as
   sacramentally united with the bread and wine. Seventh, that not only
   the worthy and believing, but also the unworthy and unbelieving
   communicants received the body and blood of Christ in this sacrament.
   [686] Such are the most important affirmations concerning the Lord's
   Supper.

   The Form of Concord, on the other hand, denies or rejects, (1.) The
   papal doctrine of transubstantiation. (2.) The doctrine of the
   sacrifice of the Mass. (3.) The withholding the cup from the laity.
   (4.) The figurative interpretation of the words of institution. (5.)
   The doctrine that the body of Christ is not received by the mouth. (6.)
   That the bread and wine are only symbols or signs of a Christian
   profession. (7.) That the bread and wine are only symbols, signs, or
   types of the absent body of Christ. (8.) That they are merely signs and
   seals by which our faith is confirmed, by being directed heavenward,
   and there made partaker of the body and blood of Christ. (9.) That our
   faith is strengthened by receiving the bread and wine and not by the
   true body and blood really present in the supper. (10.) That in the
   sacrament only the virtue, efficacy, and merit of the absent body and
   blood are dispensed. (11.) That the body of Christ is so shut up in
   heaven, that "nullo prorsus modo" can it be present at one and the same
   time in many or all places where the Lord's Supper is celebrated. (12.)
   That Christ could not have promised or offered the presence of his body
   in the eucharist, because such presence is inconsistent with the nature
   of a body. (13.) That God cannot by his omnipotence make the body of
   Christ to be present in more than one place at the same time. (14.)
   That faith and not the omnipotent word of Christ, is the cause of the
   presence of the body and blood of Christ in the supper. (15.) That
   believers are to seek the Lord's body in heaven and not in the
   sacrament. (16.) That the impenitent and unbelievers do not receive the
   body and blood of Christ, but only the bread and wine. (17.) That the
   dignity of the communicants in this ordinance is not alone from true
   faith in Christ, but from some human source. (18.) That true believers
   may eat the Lord's Supper to condemnation if imperfect in their
   conversation. (19.) That the visible elements of bread and wine in this
   sacrament should be adored. (20.) Præter hæc justo Dei judicio
   relinquimus omnes curiosas, sannis virulentis tinctas, et blasphemas
   quæstiones, quæ honeste, pie et sine gravi offensione recitari
   nequeunt, aliosque sermones, quando de supernaturali et coelesti
   mysterio hujus sacramenti crasse, carnaliter, capernaitice, et plane
   abominandis modis, blaspheme, et maximo cum ecclesiæ offendiculo,
   Sacramentarii loquuntur. (21.) Finally any corporal manducation of the
   body of Christ is denied, as though it was masticated by the teeth or
   digested as ordinary food. A supernatural manducation is again
   affirmed; a manducation which no one by his senses or reason can
   comprehend. [687]

   Although the Lutheran doctrine on this subject may be regarded as
   stated with sufficient clearness in the Epitome of the Form of Concord,
   it becomes still plainer by the more expanded and controversial
   exposition in the second, and much more extended portion of that
   document, called the "Solida Declaratio." the seventh chapter of that
   Declaration, in giving the "Status Controversiæ" between the Lutherans
   and the Reformed, says that although the Sacramentarians (as the
   Reformed were called) laboured to come as near as possible to the
   language of the Lutherans and used the same forms of expression, yet
   when pressed, it became apparent that their true meaning was very
   different. They admitted the presence of the body and blood of Christ
   in the supper, but it was a presence to faith. The real body of Christ
   is in heaven and not on earth; therefore they denied that his body and
   blood, "in terra adesse," and taught that nothing in the sacrament is
   received by the mouth but the bread and wine. This is one point of
   difference between the Lutherans and the Reformed. The former teaching
   that the literal, natural body of Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, is
   actually present in, with, and under the bread, and his blood shed upon
   the cross and which was the life of his body while on earth, is present
   in, with, and under the consecrated wine. The latter teach that the
   natural body of Christ is in heaven, and is not on earth, and therefore
   is not present in the elements of bread and in the supper of the Lord.
   What is present, according to Calvin, is not the natural body and blood
   of Christ, but a supernatural, life-giving influence emanating from his
   glorified body in heaven, and conveyed to the believer by the power of
   the Holy Ghost. According to the Reformed generally, it is not this
   supernatural power of the glorified body of Christ that is present and
   received, but the sacrificial efficacy of his body broken and his blood
   shed for the remission of sins.

   Secondly, as the thing received, according to the two doctrines, is
   different, so are the mode and organ and condition of reception.
   According to the Lutherans the body and blood are received
   "corporaliter;" the organ is the mouth; the only condition is the
   actual reception of the bread and wine. The body and blood of Christ
   are received equally by believers and unbelievers; although to their
   spiritual good only by the former. According to the Reformed, the mode
   of reception is not corporeal, but spiritual; the organ is not the
   mouth, but faith; and the condition of reception is the presence and
   exercise of faith on the part of the communicant. This point of
   difference is clearly recognized in the Form of Concord, when it says
   that the Reformed think that the body and blood of Christ, "tantum in
   coelis, et præterea nullibi esse, ideoque Christum nobis cum pane et
   vino verum corpus et verum sanguinem manducandum et bibendum dare,
   spiritualiter, per fidem, sed non corporaliter ore sumendum." [688]

   Manducation.

   Thirdly? another point of difference, which the Form of Concord points
   out between the two Churches, concerns the manducation or eating which
   takes place in the Lord's Supper. Our Lord in the sixth chapter of St.
   John's Gospel, although not there treating of the Eucharist, says, that
   He is the true bread which came down from heaven, and that whosoever
   eateth of that bread shall live forever. And in the same chapter, with
   a change of language but not of meaning, He says, "The bread that I
   will give is my flesh." "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and
   drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and
   drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the
   last day." Such being the language of Christ, every Christian must
   admit that there is a sense in which the believer may properly be said
   to eat the flesh and to drink the blood of the Son of man. The only
   question is, What does such language mean? According to the Reformed
   the meaning is that it is the indispensable condition of eternal life,
   that we should receive Christ as He is offered to us in the gospel; and
   as He is there offered to us as a sacrifice for our sins, his body
   broken and his blood shed for us, we must receive and appropriate Him
   in that character. To receive Him as the true bread, and to eat of that
   bread, is to receive and appropriate Him as being to us the source of
   eternal life; and to eat his flesh and drink his blood is to receive
   and appropriate Him as the broken and bleeding sacrifice for our sins.
   In other words, to eat is to believe. The Form of Concord correctly
   recognizes this as the doctrine of the Reformed Church. It says, [689]
   that the Reformed in rejecting the literal sense of the words "eat,
   this is my body," teach "ut edere corpus Christi nihil aliud ipsis
   significet, quam credere in Christum, et vocabulum corporis illis nil
   nisi symbolum, hoc est, signum seu figuram corporis Christi denotet,
   quod tamen non in terris in sacra coena præsens, sed tantum in coelis
   sit." That the Reformed are right in this matter may, in passing, be
   argued, (1.) From the fact that our Lord in John vi. interchanges as
   equivalent the words "eating" and "believing." He says, "if any man eat
   of this bread, he shall live forever;" and, "he that believeth on me
   hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life." The same specific
   effect is ascribed to eating and believing, and therefore the two words
   express the same act. (2.) The eating spoken of is declared to be the
   indispensable condition of eternal life. "Except ye eat the flesh of
   the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." But it is
   the clear doctrine of the Bible, and the common doctrine of the
   Lutheran and Reformed Churches, that the only eating which is necessary
   to eternal life is that which consists in believing. Lutherans are as
   far as the Reformed from making the sacramental eating of the body and
   blood of Christ in the supper essential to salvation. (3.) Nothing is
   essential to salvation under the new dispensation that was not
   essential under the old. This also is a part of the common faith of
   both Churches. But under the Old Testament there could be no other
   eating of the flesh of Christ, than believing on Him as the passover,
   or, lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. (4.) Any
   corporal eating of the flesh of Christ's body and drinking of his
   blood, as He sat at table with his disciples, would seem to be
   inconceivable. (5.) Our Lord Himself, in opposition to the sense put
   upon his words by the people of Capernaum, said: "It is the Spirit that
   quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing; the words that I speak unto
   you, they are spirit, and they are life." It was not his literal flesh
   that He was to give us to eat, for that would profit nothing. His
   words, on that subject, were to be understood in a spiritual sense.
   [690]

   But although the Lutherans reject the doctrine of the Reformed who
   teach that the eating of the body of Christ in the sacrament is
   spiritual and by faith, and assert that it is corporal (corporaliter)
   and by the mouth, yet they strenuously resist the idea that it is after
   the manner of ordinary food. They maintain that the manner is
   supernatural and incomprehensible. The Lutherans distinguish between a
   spiritual manducation, of which says the Form of Concord, Christ treats
   especially in the sixth chapter of St. John, and which is by faith, and
   a sacramental manducation which is by the mouth, when in the Lord's
   Supper, "verum et substantiale corpus et sanguis Christi ore
   accipiuntur atque participantur ab omnibus, qui panem illum benedictum
   et vinum in coena Dominica edunt et bibunt." The words of Christ, it is
   said, "non potest nisi orali, non autem de crassa, carnali,
   capernaitica, sed de supernaturali et incomprehensibili manducatione
   corporis Christi intelligi." [691] Being incomprehensible, it is of
   course inexplicable.

   However, although the Lutherans reject the idea that the body of Christ
   in the Lord's Supper is eaten after the manner of ordinary food, yet
   the language of Luther on this subject, adopted or defended by his
   followers, can hardly be understood in any other sense. In his
   instruction to Melancthon, [692] he says, "Of our doctrine this is the
   sum, that the body of Christ is truly eaten in and with the bread, so
   that what the bread does and suffers, the body of Christ does and
   suffers; it is distributed, eaten, and masticated (zerbissen) by the
   teeth." On this passage Philippi [693] remarks that as Luther says that
   this is propter unionem sacramentalem, it is not inconsistent with the
   language of the Form of Concord which denies that the body of Christ is
   lacerated by the teeth and digested as ordinary food. He says it is
   analogous to the proposition, God died, not as to his divine nature but
   as to his assumed human nature. The language of Luther on this subject
   is seldom now heard from the lips of Lutherans.

   Mode of Presence.

   A thing is present where it is perceived and where it acts. The nature
   of that presence varies with the nature of the object of which it is
   affirmed. A body is present where it is perceived by the senses or acts
   upon them. The soul is present where it perceives and acts. It is
   somewhere, and not everywhere. God is present everywhere, as He fills
   immensity. There is no portion of space from which He is absent as to
   his essence, knowledge, or power. [694] As the Lutherans affirm the
   presence of the substance of Christ's natural body and blood in the
   Lord's Supper, of that body which was born of the Virgin and suffered
   on the cross; and as that body was and is material, it would seem to
   follow that the presence affirmed is local. It is a presence in a
   definite place. The Reformed, therefore, always understood the
   Lutherans to assert the local presence of the body of Christ in the
   Lord's Supper. The Lutherans, however, deny that they teach any such
   presence. This after all may be a dispute about words. [695] The
   parties may take the word "local" in different senses. The Lutherans
   say that the body and blood of Christ are with, in, and under the bread
   and wine. They are held in the hand and taken into the mouth. This is
   all the Reformed mean when they speak of a local presence; a presence
   in a definite portion of space. Magnetism is locally present in the
   magnet; electricity in the Leyden jar. The soul is locally present in
   the body. The man is locally present in mind and body where he
   perceives and acts and where he is perceived and acted upon. Lutherans
   appear to take the word "local" in a sense in which it characterizes
   the presence of a body which is present exclusively, i.e., both in the
   sense of excluding all other bodies from the same portion of space,
   being bounded by it, and of being nowhere else. The Reformed say that
   it is contrary to the nature of such a body as that which belongs to
   man, that it should be in many places at the same time, much less that
   it should fill all space. The idea that the flesh and blood of Christ
   are omnipresent, seems to involve a contradiction. It is in vain to
   appeal to the omnipotence of God. Contradictions are not the objects of
   power. It is no more a limitation of the power of God to say that He
   cannot do the impossible, that He cannot make right wrong, or the
   finite infinite, than it is a limitation of his wisdom that He cannot
   teach the untrue or the unwise. All such assumptions destroy the idea
   of God as a rational Being. If the body and blood of Christ be
   everywhere present, then they are received in every ordinary meal as
   well as in the Lord's Supper. The answer which Lutherans give to this
   objection, namely, that it is one thing for the body of Christ to be
   omnipresent, and another for it to be accessible, or everywhere given,
   is unsatisfactory; because the virtue resides in the body and blood,
   and if they are everywhere present and received they are everywhere
   operative, at least to believers. If this omnipresence of the body of
   Christ was actual only after his ascension, then, as Müller [696]
   argues, the Apostles must, at the institution of the Lord's Supper,
   have partaken of his body and blood in a manner peculiar to that one
   occasion, and Christ, so far as other Christians are concerned, only
   foretold that his body would be ubiquitous and therefore present in the
   eucharist. Luther, therefore, says, "If Christ at the Last Supper had
   not uttered the words this is my body,' yet the words, Christ sits at
   the right hand of God, prove that his body and blood may be in the
   Lord's Supper as well as everywhere else." [697] As Christ in his human
   nature and therefore in his human body sits at the right hand of God;
   and as the right hand of God is everywhere, his body must be
   everywhere, and therefore in the bread as used in the sacrament. The
   current representations, however, of the Lutheran theologians on this
   point are, that the presence of the body of Christ in the Lord's Supper
   is peculiar, something which occurs there and nowhere else. This
   presence is due, not to the words of consecration as uttered by the
   minister, but to the almighty power which attended the original
   utterance of the words, This is my body, and continues to operate
   whenever and wherever this sacrament is administered.

   This presence of the body and blood of Christ in, with, and under the
   bread and wine has been generally expressed by non-Lutherans by the
   word consubstantiation, as distinguished from the Romish doctrine of
   transubstantiation. The propriety of this word to express the doctrine
   of Luther is admitted by Philippi, if it be understood to mean, what in
   fact is meant by it when used by the Reformed, "das reale Zusammensein
   beider Substanzen," i.e., the real coexistence of the two substances,
   the earthly and the heavenly. But Lutherans generally object to the
   word because it is often used to express the idea of the mixing two
   substances so as to form a third; or the local inclusion of the one
   substance by the other. [698]

   The Lutheran doctrine of the mode of the presence of the body and blood
   of Christ in the eucharist, is thus carefully stated by Gerhard: [699]
   "Quam vere in sacra coena præsens est res terrena, panis et vinum: tam
   vere etiam præsens res coelestis, corpus et sanguis Christi: proinde
   credimus, docemus et confitemur in eucharistiæ sacramento veram, realem
   et substantialem corporis et sanguinis Christi præsentiam,
   exhibitionem, manducationem et bibitionem, quæ præsentia non est
   essentialis conversio panis in corpus et vini in sanguinem Christi,
   quam transubstantionem vocant, neque est corporis ad panem, ac
   sanguinis ad vinum extra usum coenæ localis aut durabilis, neque est
   panis et corporis Christi personalis unio, qualis est divinæ et humanæ
   naturæ in Christo unio, neque est localis inclusio corporis in panem,
   neque est impanatio, neque est incorporatio in panem, neque est
   consubstantio, qua panis cum corpore Christi, et vinum cum ipsius
   sanguine in unam massam physicam coalescat: neque est naturalis
   inexistentia, neque delitescentia corpusculi sub pane, neque quidquam
   hujusmodi carnale aut physicum; sed est præsentia et unio
   sacramentalis, quæ ita comparata est, ut juxta ipsius salvaroris
   nostri, veracis, sapientis, et omnipotentis institutionem, pani
   benedicto tanquam medio divinitus ordinato corpus: et vino benedicto
   tanquam medio itidem divinitus ordinato, sanguis Christi modo nobis
   incomprehensibili uniatur, ut cum illo pane corpus Christi una
   manducatione sacramentali et cum illo vino sanguinem Christi una
   bibitione sacramentali in sublimi mysterio sumamus, manducemus ac
   bibamus. Breviter non apousian absentiam, non enousian inexistentiam,
   non sunousian consubstantionem, non metousian transubstantionem, sed
   parousian corporis et sanguinis Christi in sacra coena statuimus."

   The whole doctrine of the Lutheran Church on the Lord's Supper is
   briefly and authoritatively stated in the "Articuli Visitatorii" issued
   in 1592 for the Electorate and northern provinces of of Saxony, which
   all church officers and teachers were required to adopt. The first
   Article is as follows: "Pura et vera doctrina nostrarum Ecclesiarum de
   Sacra Coena. (1.) Quod verba Christi: Accipite et comedite, hoc est
   corpus meum: Bibite, hic est sanguis meus simpliciter, et secundum
   literam, sicut sonant, intelligenda sint. (2.) Quod in sacramento duæ
   res sint, quæ exhibentur et simul accipiuntur: una terrena, quæ est
   panis et vinum; et una coelestis, quæ est corpus et sanguis Christi.
   (3.) Quod hæc unio, exhibitio et sumptio fiat hic inferius in terris,
   non superius in coelis. (4.) Quod exhibeatur et accipiatur verum et
   naturale corpus Christi, quod in cruce pependit, et verus ac naturalis
   sanguis, qui ex Christi latere fluxit. (5.) Quod corpus et sanguis
   Christi non fide tantum spiritualiter, quod etiam extra coenam fieri
   potest, sed cum pane et vino oraliter, modo tamen imperscrutabill, et
   supernaturali, illic in coena accipiantur, idque in pignus et
   certificationem resurrectionis nostrorum corporum ex mortuis. (6.) Quod
   oralis perceptio corporis et sanguinis Christi non solum fiat a dignis,
   verum etiam ab indignis, qui sine poenitentia et vera fide accedunt;
   eventu tamen diverso. A dignis enim percipitur ad salutem, ab indignis
   autem ad judicium." [700]

   The Benefit received at the Lord's Supper.

   In the Augsburg Confession, in the Apology, in the Shorter and Larger
   Catechism, and in the Form of Concord, the benefits conferred upon
   believers in this sacrament are declared to be forgiveness of sin and
   confirmation of faith. These are said to be its special and intended
   effects. Thus in the Shorter Catechism the question is asked, "Quid
   vero prodest, sic comedisse et bibisse?" The answer is "Id indicant hæc
   verba: Pro vobis datur; et: effunditur in remissionem peccatorum. Nempe
   nobis per verba illa in sacramento remissio peccatorum, vita, justitia
   et salus donentur. Ubi enim remissio peccatorum est, ibi est et vita et
   salus." The next question is, "Qui potest corporalis illa manducatio
   tantas res efficere?" To which the following answer is given:
   "Manducare et bibere ista certe non efficiunt, sed illa verba, quæ hic
   ponuntur: Pro vobis datur, et: Effunditur in remissionem peccatorum;
   quæ verba sunt una cum corporali manducatione caput et summa hujus
   sacramenti. Et qui credit his verbis, ille habet, quod dicunt, et sicut
   sonant, nempe remissionem peccatorum." [701] To the same effect in the
   Larger Catechism, after referring to the words of institution it is
   said that in coming to the Lord's Supper we receive the remission of
   sins. "Quare hoc? Ideo, quod verba illic extant et hæc dant nobis.
   Siquidem propterea a Christo jubeor edere et bibere, ut meum sit,
   mihique utilitatem afferat, veluti certum pignus et arrhabo, imo potius
   res ipsa, quam pro peccatis meis, morte et omnibus malis ille opposuit
   et oppignoravit. Inde jure optimo cibus animæ dicitur, novum hominem
   alens atque fortificans." [702]

   All that is here said is in perfect accord with the Reformed doctrine
   both as to the benefits to be derived from this sacrament and as to the
   source from which those benefits are to be received. The believing
   communicant receives at the Lord's table the benefits of his redeeming
   death, and his faith is confirmed by the divinely appointed seals and
   pledge of the promises of God. And the sacrament has these effects,
   because through the grace of the Holy Spirit the worthy communicant
   embraces by faith the offer of pardon and acceptance made in the
   ordinance. This implies the ignoring or repudiation of the idea that
   the benefits conferred are to be attributed to any magical or
   supernatural influence from the actual, natural body and blood of
   Christ, which, according to the Lutheran doctrine, are orally received
   in this ordinance; or to a divine influence emanating from the
   glorified body of Christ in heaven; or to the theanthropic life of
   Christ conveyed into the believer as a new organic law. Nevertheless
   there is another mode of representation occurring in the writings of
   Luther and of Lutherans. According to this representation there is a
   divine, supernatural power inherent in the body and blood of Christ,
   which being received in the Lord's Supper conveys to the believer, as
   to his soul and body, a new spiritual and immortal life. Thus, in his
   Larger Catechism, in answer to the question how bread and wine can have
   the power attributed to the Lord's Supper, he says it is not bread as
   such which produces the effect, "but such bread and wine which are the
   body and blood of Christ, and which have the words [of institution]
   connected with them." To this he adds: "Quin etiam illud pro certo
   constat, Christi corpus et sanguinem nequaquam rem otiosam et
   infrugiferam esse posse, quæ nihil fructus aut utilitatis afferat."
   [703] Luther's Catechisms have symbolical authority, having been
   adopted by the whole Lutheran Church. The same authority does not
   belong to his private writings, in which the idea advanced of the
   life-giving power of the body and blood of Christ as received in the
   sacrament is (at least as often understood) more fully expanded. In his
   work entitled "Das diese Worte Christi, das ist mein Leib u. s. w.,'
   noch fest stehen wider die Schwarmgeister," published in 1521, [704] he
   says Christ gives us his own body and blood as food "in order that with
   such a pledge he may assure and comfort us, that our body shall live
   forever, because it here on earth enjoys eternal living food." [705]
   "The mouth, which corporeally eats Christ's flesh, knows not, it is
   true, what it eats, but the heart knows: by itself it would gain
   nothing, for it cannot comprehend the word [of promise]. But the heart
   knows well what the mouth eats. For it comprehends the word and eats
   spiritually, what the mouth eats corporeally." But since the mouth is a
   member of the heart, it must live forever, on account of the heart,
   which through the word lives forever, because the body corporeally eats
   the same everlasting food, which the soul with it spiritually eats.
   Again: [706] "The heart cannot eat corporeally, and the mouth cannot
   eat spiritually. God, however, has arranged it, that the mouth eats for
   the heart corporeally, and the heart eats for the body spiritually, so
   both are satisfied with the same food and are saved. For the body
   having no understanding, knows not that it eats such food whereby it
   shall live forever. Because it feels it not, but dies and moulders
   away, as though it had eaten other food, as an irrational brute. But
   the soul sees and understands, that the body must live forever, because
   it is a partaker of an everlasting food; which will not allow it to
   decay and waste away in the grave." [707] Still more strongly is this
   idea expressed in such passages as the following. When a man eats this
   food [708] "it changes (verdäut) and transmutes his flesh, so that it
   becomes spiritual, that is, endued with immortal life and blessed, as
   Paul, 1 Corinthians xv. 44, says: It is raised a spiritual body."
   Luther gives what he calls a gross illustration. He supposes a wolf to
   devour a sheep and the flesh of the sheep to have power enough to
   transmute the wolf into a sheep. "So we, when we eat Christ's flesh
   corporeally and spiritually, the food is so strong that it changes us
   into itself, so that out of carnal, sinful, mortal men, we are made
   spiritual, holy, and living men; such we already are, but hidden in
   faith and hope, and not yet revealed; at the last day we shall see it."
   Again: [709] "God is in this flesh. It is divine and spiritual (a weak
   translation of ein Gottesfleisch, ein Geistfleisch), it is in God, and
   God is in it, therefore it is living and gives life both as to soul and
   body to all who eat it." Again: [710] "If we eat Him corporeally, so He
   is in us corporeally, and we in Him. He is not digested and
   assimilated, but He continually transmutes us, the soul into
   righteousness, the body into immortality." After quoting these and
   similar passages, Philippi admits that they teach that "the body of
   Christ is not only the pledge of our resurrection, but also that it is
   the life-giving, operative power through which our bodies are prepared
   for our final resurrection." [711]

   There were two views of the benefit of the Lord's Supper in the mind of
   Luther. He commonly represents its special benefit to be the
   forgiveness of sins, which is received whenever faith in the gospel is
   exercised. This effect is due, not to what is in the sacrament received
   by the mouth, but to the Word as received by faith. According to this
   view, as Dorner [712] says, the Lord's supper is a sign and pledge of
   the forgiveness of sin. To this view, he adds, the Lutheran Church has
   adhered. Therefore, the Apology says: "Idem effectus est verbi et
   ritus, sicut præclare dictum est ab Augustino, sacramentum esse verbum
   visibile, quia ritus oculis accipitur, et est quasi pictura verbi, idem
   significans, quod verbum. Quare idem est utriusque effectus." [713]

   At other times, however, Luther, as appears from the passages above
   quoted, attributes to the Lord's Supper a peculiar effect due to the
   real, natural body of Christ therein received, which, in virtue of its
   union with his divine nature, is imbued with a supernatural,
   life-giving power. To this power he refers the glorious future
   resurrection of the believer. In this he made some approximation to the
   modern doctrine that the redemptive work of Christ consists in the
   infusion into our nature of a new force, or organic law which, by a
   process of natural, historical development, works out the salvation of
   soul and body. Julius Müller rejoices that this view did not take root
   in the Lutheran Church, as it is, as he says, plainly contrary to
   Scripture. If the resurrection of believers be due to the body of
   Christ as received in the Lord's Supper, what is to become of children,
   of confessors and martyrs, and of all the Old Testament saints, who
   never partook of the Lord's Supper. [714]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [681] Lutherans lay great stress on the fact that in Matthew xxvi. 26,
   touto (this) is neuter, and artos (bread) is masculine, and therefore
   that the meaning cannot be This bread is my body,' but This that I give
   you to eat is my body.' It must be admitted that the neuter pronoun
   cannot be referred to the masculine noun grammatically, but it
   evidently does refer to it ad sensum. This thing which I hold in my
   hand and which I give you to eat is my body.' But the thing which
   Christ gave his disciples was the bread which he had taken and broken;
   and therefore it was the bread which He affirmed was, either literally
   or figuratively, his body. Lutherans themselves cannot avoid saying and
   admitting that the bread in the Lord's Supper is the body of Christ.
   Thus Luther (Larger Catechism, v. 12, 13; Hase, Libri Symbolici, p.
   554) tells his catechumen to say, "Though infinite myriads of devils
   and all fanatics should impudently demand, How bread and wine can be
   the body and blood of Christ? I know that all spirits and all learned
   men put together have not as much intelligence as Almighty God has in
   his little finger." The bread therefore he teaches is the body of
   Christ. And Dr. Krauth (p. 609) says, "Just as it would be blasphemy to
   say, Man is God,' and is yet literally true of Christ, This man is
   God,' so would it be blasphemy to say, Bread is Christ's body,' and yet
   it is literally true, This bread is Christ's body.'" It is conceded,
   therefore, that after all, the pronoun "This" (touto), in the words of
   institution, does refer to the noun "bread," and that if the language
   of Christ is to be understood literally, He affirms that the bread in
   the Lord's Supper is his body. On this concession it may be remarked,
   (1.) That it seems to yield everything to the Romanists. If the bread
   is literally the body of Christ, it is no longer bread; for no one
   asserts that the same thing can be bread and flesh at the same time.
   If, therefore, the words of Christ are to be taken literally, they
   teach the doctrine of transubstantiation. (2.) It will not do to say
   that the bread remains bread and that the body of Christ is in, with,
   and under it, for that makes the language figurative, and the literal
   interpretation, the main, if not the only, prop of the Lutheran
   doctrine, is given up. When Christ says, "This cup is the New
   Testament," it is admitted that the cup is used metonymically for the
   wine in the cup. And if the language of our Lord, This bread is my
   body,' means, This bread is the vehicle of my body, then He spoke
   figuratively and not literally; and whether the figure used be metonymy
   or metaphor is a question to be determined by the nature of the
   proposition, the context, and the analogy of Scripture. But the
   advocates of the metonymical sense are not entitled to charge those who
   adopt the metaphorical meaning, with giving up the literal sense. That
   is done by the one party as well as by the other. A great deal of
   discussion has been expended on the meaning of the substantive verb
   "is," in the proposition, "This is my body." The Reformed are wont to
   say that it means, "signifies," "represents," or "symbolizes" my body.
   The Lutherans maintain that it is the mere copula between the subject
   and predicate, and never has, or can have the meaning assigned to it by
   the Reformed; and in this they are right. Yet it seems to be a dispute
   about words. There is no real difference between the parties. When the
   Reformed say that "is" means or may mean "signifies," all they intend
   is that the one word, in the case in question, may be properly
   substituted for the other. The idea intended to be expressed by the
   words, "The seven ears are seven years," may be expressed by saying,
   The seven ears signify seven years.' This does not imply that "are"
   means "signify." Dr. Krauth tells us that Luther in his version of the
   Bible employs forty-six different substitutes for the substantive verb
   as used in the Hebrew and Greek. It would hardly be fair to say that
   Luther gives forty-six different lexicographical meanings to the Hebrew
   word hyh, or the Greek eimi. Whether the proposition "This is my body"
   is to be understood literally or figuratively is an open question; but
   there can be no question as to the lexicographical meaning of the word
   "is." No one doubts that such propositions as "I am the living bread,"
   That rock was Christ," "The seven candlesticks . . . are the seven
   churches," and hundreds of others of like kind occurring in the Bible
   and in ordinary language, are to be understood figuratively. The fact
   that they have been understood literally by so large a part of
   Christendom, is to be accounted for by other reasons than any ambiguity
   in the words themselves.

   [690] There are two modes of interpreting the passage John vi. 50-58.
   According to the one, it is to be understood as referring to a
   participation of the benefit of Christ's sacrificial death, according
   to the other of the reception of his body and blood in the Supper. A
   large portion of the Lutheran theologians adopt the former.

   [694] Luther and Lutherans speak of three modes of Christ's presence:
   First, that in which He was present when here on earth; "raumerfüllende
   und vom Raum umschollene," space-filling and by space circumscribed;
   Second, that which is in space, but does not fill any portion of it,
   and is not circumscribed by it. In this state of Christ's body rose
   from the grave and passed through closed doors. This kind of presence
   belongs to angels. Third, the divine and celestial mode of presence,
   according to which Christ, in virtue of the union of the two natures in
   his person, is present in his humanity, in his soul and body, wherever
   God is present. It is specially in the second and third modes (the
   definitive and the repletive) that Luther asserted the presence of
   Christ's body in the eucharist; although he asserted that the first was
   possible, "Denn er wolle in keiner Weise, läugnen, dass Gottes Gewalt
   nicht scllte so viel vermögen, dass ein Leib zugleich an vielen Orten
   sein möge, auch leiblicher, begreiflicher Weise." Philippi, ut supra,
   vol. v. p. 346.

   [695] On this word Gerhard remarks: "Terminum localis præsentiæ esse
   ambiguum. Corpus Christi præsens esse dicimus in illo loco, in quo
   celebratur coena, sed modo locali et circumscriptivo præsens esse
   negamus. Si præsentiam localem sensu posteriori intelligunt habent nos

   them as teaching that the Lord's Supper is pledge of the believer's
   resurrection. On p. 268, however, he admits that there are other
   passages which cannot be thus explained.

   teach that our bodies "suscipiant ex contactu carnis Christi vim
   quandam ad gloriosam resurrectionem et vitam æternam;" an opinion to
   which Gerhard accedes. Calvin (Institutio, IV. xvii. 32, edit. Berlin,
   1834, part ii. p. 426) uses language of similar import: "De carnis
   etiam nostræ immortalitate securos nos reddat, siquidem ab immortali
   ejus carne jam vivificatur et quodammodo ejus immortalitate
   communicat." There is, however, an essential difference, as to this
   point between Luther and Calvin. Luther held that what is received in
   the Supper is the true, natural body of Christ; that it is received
   corporeally, by the mouth, that it is received by unbelievers as well
   as by the believers; and that it is to the natural body thus received
   that the believer owes the glorious resurrection that awaits him. All
   these points Calvin denies. It is not the natural body of Christ, which
   hung upon the cross, that is received. It is not received corporeally
   by the mouth, but only by the soul through faith. It is received out of
   the Lord's Supper as well as in that ordinance. The resurrection of
   believers therefore, according to Calvin, is due to our union with
   Christ, effected by faith and not to eating his true, natural body.

     __________________________________________________________________

   § 19. Doctrine of the Church of Rome on the Lord's Supper.

   Romanists regard the eucharist under two distinct aspects as a
   sacrament and as a sacrifice. The latter in their system is by far the
   more important. Möhler in his "Symbolik" almost entirely overlooks its
   sacramental character. And in the worship of the Romish Church the
   sacrifice of the mass is the central point. In the symbolical books,
   however, the two views are kept distinct. It is a sacrament inasmuch as
   it signifies, contains, and conveys grace. It includes an external sign
   and things signified. The external signs are bread and wine, which
   retain their form after consecration and after the change in their
   substance thereby affected. The things signified are, (1.) The passion
   of Christ. (2) The grace of God given in the sacrament. (3.) Eternal
   life. [715] It has virtue to produce grace. "On voit," says Cardinal
   Gousset in the place referred to, "que le signe eucharistique est un
   signe qui a la vertu de produire la grace; mais il n'a cette vertu que
   par l'institution de Jesus Christ."

   The grace bestowed is not spiritual life, for that is communicated in
   baptism, and is presupposed in those who receive the eucharist as a
   sacrament. On this point the language of the Roman Catechism and other
   Roman authorities is explicit, and in tone evangelical and Protestant.
   Thus the Catechism says, "Constat quemadmodum mortuis corporibus
   naturale alimentum nihil prodest, ita etiam animæ, quæ spiritu non
   vivit, sacra mysteria non prodesse, ac propterea panis, et vini speciem
   habent, ut significetur, non quidem revocandæ ad vitam animæ, sed in
   vita conservandæ causa instituta esse." [716] The benefits received are
   analogous to those which the body receives from its natural food. Bread
   and wine strengthen and refresh the body; so the eucharist strengthens
   and refreshes the soul. And more than this, the food of the body is
   transmuted into the body; whereas the divine food received in this
   sacrament transmutes the soul into its own nature. "Neque enim hoc
   sacramentum in substantiam nostram, ut panis, et vinum, mutatur; sed
   nos quodam modo in ejus naturam convertimur: ut recte illud D.
   Augustini ad hunc locum transferri possit: [717] Cibus sum grandium;
   cresce, et manducabis me. Nec tu me in te mutabis, sicut cibum carnis
   tuæ; sed tu mutaberis in me.'" [718]

   Lutherans make the forgiveness of sins, a blessing which the believer
   constantly needs, the great benefit of this ordinance. This is not its
   design in the view of Romanists, for they teach that for a man to
   approach the altar in a state of mortal sin, is a dreadful profanation.
   They enjoin, therefore, confession and absolution in the sacrament of
   penance, as a necessary preparation for this ordinance. Only venial
   sins are remitted by receiving the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.
   Nevertheless, as according to Romanists, Christ is really in both
   natures present in the eucharist, they say "necessario fons omnium
   gratiarum dicenda est, cum fontem ipsum coelestium charismatum, et
   donorum, omniumque sacramentorum auctorem Christum dominum admirabili
   modo in se contineat." [719] The virtue of the eucharist, both as a
   sacrament and as a sacrifice, rests, according to Romanists, in the
   doctrine of

   Transubstantiation.

   Christ is present in this ordinance, not spiritually as taught by the
   Reformed, nor by the real presence of his body and blood in, with, and
   under the bread and wine, but by the bread and wine being by the
   almighty power of God changed into his body and blood. As at the feast
   in Cana of Galilee, the water was changed into wine, so in the
   eucharist, the bread and wine are changed into, and remain the body and
   blood of Christ. This doctrine is thus set forth in the Canons of the
   Council of Trent: --

   "1. Si quis negaverit, in sanctissimæ eucharistiæ sacramento contineri
   vere, realiter, et substantialiter corpus et sanguinem una cum anima,
   et divinitate Domini nostri, Jesu Christi, ac proinde totum Christum,
   sed dixerit tantummodo esse in eo, ut in signo, vel figura aut virtute;
   anathema sit.

   "2. Si quis dixerit in sacrosancto eucharistiæ sacramento remanere
   substantiam panis, et vini, una cum corpore et sanguine Domini nostri,
   Jesu Christi, negaveritque mirabilem illam et singularem conversionem
   totius substantiæ panis in corpus, et totius substantiæ vini in
   sanguinem, manentibus duntaxat speciebus panis, et vini, quam quidem
   conversionem catholica ecclesia aptissime transubstantionem appellat;
   anathema sit.

   "3. Si quis negaverit, in venerabili sacramento eucharistiæ sub
   unaquaque specie, et sub singulis cujusque speciei partibus,
   separatione facta, totum Christum contineri; anathema sit.

   "4. Si quis dixerit, peracta consecratione, in admirabili eucharistiæ
   sacramento non esse corpus, et sanguinem Domini nostri Jesu Christi,
   sed tantum in usu dum sumitur, non autem ante, vel post; et in hostiis,
   seu particulis consecratis, quæ post communionem reservantur, vel
   supersunt, non remanere verum corpus Domini; anathema sit.

   "5. Si quis dixerit, vel præcipuum fructum sanctissimæ eucharistiæ esse
   remissionem peccatorum, vel ex ea non alios effectus provenire;
   anathema sit.

   "6. Si quis dixerit, in sancto eucharistiæ sacramento Christum,
   unigenitum Dei filium, non esse cultu latriæ, etiam externo, adorandum;
   atque ideo nec festiva peculiari celebritate venerandum; neque in
   processionibus, secundum laudabilem, et universalem ecclesiæ ritum, et
   consuetudinem, solemniter circumgestandum, vel non publice, ut
   adoretur, populo proponendum, et ejus adoratores esse idololatras;
   anathema sit.

   "7. Si quis dixerit, non licere sacram eucharistiam in sacrario
   reservari, sed statim post consecrationem adstantibus necessario
   distribuendam, aut non licere, ut illa ad infirmos honorifice
   deferatur; anathema sit.

   "8. Si quis dixerit, Christum, in eucharistia exhibitum, spiritualiter
   tantum manducari, et non etiam sacramentaliter, et realiter; anathema
   sit.

   "9. Si quis negaverit, omnes, et singulos Christi fideles utriusque
   sexus, cum ad annos discretionis pervenerint, teneri singulis annis,
   saltem in paschate, ad communicandum, juxta præceptum sanctæ matris
   ecclesiæ; anathema sit.

   "10. Si quis dixerit, non licere sacerdoti celebranti seipsum
   communicare; anathema sit.

   "11. Si quis dixerit, solam fidem esse sufficientem præparationem ad
   sumendum sanctissimæ eucharistiæ sacramentum, anathema sit. Et ne
   tantum sacramentum indigne atque ideo in mortem, condemnationem
   sumatur, statuit, atque declaret ipsa sancta synodus, illis, quos
   conscientia peccati mortalis gravat, quantumcunque etiam se contritos
   existiment, habita copia confessoris, necessario præmittendam esse
   confessionem sacramentalem. Si quis autem contrarium docere, prædicare,
   vel pertinaciter asserere, seu etiam publice disputando defendere
   præsumpserit eo ipso excommunicatus existat." [720]

   From this statement it appears, first, as concerns the elements of
   bread and wine, that in and by the act of consecration, their whole
   substance is changed. Nothing of the substance or essence of either
   remains. The accidents, or sensible properties, however, continue as
   they were. The form, colour, taste, odour, the specific gravity, their
   chemical affinities, and their nutritive qualities remain the same. So
   far as the senses, chemical analysis, and physics are concerned or are
   to be trusted, no change has taken place. As the sensible properties of
   the bread and wine do not and cannot inhere in the substance of
   Christ's body and blood, and as their own substance no longer exists,
   those properties do not inhere in any substance. "Cum antea
   demonstratum sit, corpus Domini, et sanguinem vere in sacramento esse,
   ita nulla amplius subsit panis, et vini substantia; quoniam ea
   accidentia Christi corpori, et sanguini inhærere non possunt:
   relinquitur, ut supra omnem naturæ ordinem ipsa se, nulla alia re nisa,
   sustentent, hæc perpetua, et constans fuit catholicæ Ecclesiæ
   doctrina." [721]

   Secondly, as to what is said to be present under the species of bread
   and wine, it is the body and blood of Christ; the body which hung upon
   the cross; the blood which flowed from his side; with the nerves,
   bones, and whatever pertains to the completeness of man. ("Ossa, nervi,
   et quæcumque ad hominis perfectionem pertinent." ) [722] As, however,
   the body of Christ is inseparably connected with his soul, so that
   where the one is, the other must be and as his soul is in like manner
   connected with his divinity, it follows that the whole Christ, body,
   soul, and divinity, is presents and is received orally, i.e., by the
   mouth, by the communicant. "Docere autem oportet, Christum nomen esse
   Dei, et hominis, unius scilicet personæ, in qua divina, et humana
   natura conjuncta sit, quare utramque substantiam, et quæ utriusque
   substantiæ consequentia sunt, divinitatem, et totam humanam naturam,
   quæ exanima, et omnibus corporis partibus, et sanguine etiam constat,
   complectitur: quæ omnia in sacramento esse credendum est, nam cum in
   coelo tota humanitas divinitati, in una persona, et hypostasi conjuncta
   sit, nefas est suspicari, corpus, quod in sacramento inest, ab eadem
   divinitate sejunctum esse." [723]

   Thirdly, the whole Christ is in the bread and the whole Christ as in
   the wine: [724] and not only so, but in each and every particle of both
   species. Thus the Catechism, says "non solum in utraque specie, sed in
   quavis utriusque speciei particula totum Christum contineri."

   Fourthly, Lutherans teach that the presence of the body and blood of
   Christ in, with, and under the bread and wine, is confined to the time
   of the administration of the sacrament. Romanists, on the other hand,
   teach that as there is an entire change of the substance of the
   elements into the substance of the body and blood of Christ, that
   change is permanent. From this it is inferred, (1.) That the
   consecrated wafer as containing the whole Christ, may be preserved.
   (2.) That it may be carried to the sick. (3.) That it may be borne
   about in processions. (4.) That it should be adored.

   It is well known that Romanists distinguish between the "cultus
   civilis," or worship (i.e., respect) due to our superiors among men;
   douleia, due to saints and angels; huperdouleia, due to the Virgin
   Mary, and latreia, due to God alone. The ground of this worship is the
   real or supposed possession of divine perfections in its object. When
   our Lord was upon the earth He was the proper object of this divine
   worship, because He was God manifested in the flesh. The worship
   terminated on the person; and that person is and was divine. If
   Christians err in believing that the person known in history as Jesus
   of Nazareth, was, and is the Eternal Son of God clothed in our nature,
   then their worship of Him is idolatry. They ascribe divine perfections
   and render divine honours to a creature, and therein consists the
   essence of idolatry. In like manner Romanists teach that latreia, the
   worship due to God alone, is to be rendered to the host, or consecrated
   wafer. This worship, of course, is not rendered to the wafer as such,
   any more than the worship of Christians was rendered to the body and
   blood of Christ, when He was here on earth. But Romanists worship the
   host on the assumption that it is the body of Christ, with which his
   soul and divinity are inseparably connected. If their doctrine of
   transubstantiation be false; if the host be no more the body of Christ
   than any other piece of bread; if his soul and divinity be no more
   present in it than in other bread, then they must admit that the
   worship of the host is as pure and simple idolatry as the world has
   ever seen. As all Protestants believe the doctrine of
   transubstantiation to be utterly unscriptural and false, they are
   unanimous in pronouncing the worship of the consecrated elements to be
   idolatry.

   Proof of the Doctrine.

   The arguments urged by Romanists in support of the fearful dogma of
   transubstantiation, are derived partly from Scripture and partly from
   tradition. Without the latter, the former, to all appearance, even in
   the estimation of Romanists themselves, would be of little account. The
   Scriptural passage principally relied upon, is John vi. 48-65. As to
   this discourse of our Lord, Cardinal Gousset lays down two
   propositions: first, that it is to be understood of the Lord's Supper;
   and second, that the eating of which it speaks is oral, by the mouth,
   and not merely spiritual, by faith. If these points be granted, then it
   follows that our Lord does speak of a literal eating of his flesh, and
   therefore that his flesh must be in the literal sense of the words
   eaten at the Lord's Supper. Such eating it must be conceded
   necessitates the admission of the doctrine of transubstantiation. It is
   enough, in this place, to say of this argument, that it proves too
   much. Our Lord expressly declares that the eating of which He speaks is
   essential to salvation. If, therefore, his words are to be understood
   of the Lord's Supper, then a participation in that sacrament is
   essential to salvation. But this the Church of Rome explicitly denies,
   and must in consistency with its whole system, insist on denying.
   Romanists teach that spiritual life is as necessary to an experience of
   the benefits of this sacrament, as natural life is to the body's being
   nourished by food. [725]

   They further teach that baptism, which precedes the eucharist, conveys
   all the saving benefits of Christ's redemption; they therefore cannot
   make the eucharist essential, and consequently they cannot, without
   contradicting Christ or themselves, interpret John vi. 48-65 as
   referring to the Lord's Supper. [726]

   Appeal, of course, is also made to the words of institution, "This is
   my body." In this argument enough has already been said. There is no
   more necessity for understanding those words literally than the
   declaration of Christ, "I am the true bread," or, "I am the door." The
   elements are declared to be bread and wine both by Christ and by the
   Apostles, after as well as before consecration.

   Romanists, however, teach that there are many doctrines which Christ
   and his Apostles taught, which are either not revealed at all, or but
   very imperfectly in Scripture, and which are to be received on the
   authority of tradition. On that authority they rely for the support of
   all their peculiar doctrines. As to that argument, as urged in behalf
   of the doctrine of transubstantiation, Protestants say, first, that the
   Scriptures are the only infallible rule of faith and practice, and,
   therefore, that no doctrine, which cannot be proved from the Bible, can
   be received as an article of faith. And as the doctrine of
   transubstantiation cannot be so proved, it is to be rejected as a mere
   human theory. And, secondly, that even admitting the authority of
   tradition, it can be demonstrated that the doctrine in question has no
   claim to support from the rule, "quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab
   omnibus." The rise and gradual development of this doctrine can be
   historically traced. The conflicts attending its introduction as an
   article of faith are matters of record, and it can no more be proved,
   even by tradition, than the doctrine of purgatory and extreme unction.
   This is the conclusion reached after years of controversy, and it is
   not likely ever to be shaken. It was on this point that the leading
   divines of the Church of England laid out their strength in their
   controversy with the Church of Rome. [727]

   It is a valid objection to this doctrine that it involves an
   impossibility. The impossible cannot be true, and, therefore, cannot,
   rationally, be an object of faith. It is impossible that the accidents
   or sensible properties of the bread and wine should remain if the
   substance be changed. Such a proposition has no more meaning in it than
   the assertion that an act can be without an agent. Accidents or
   properties are the phenomena of substance; and it is self-evident that
   there can be no manifestations where there is not something to be
   manifested. In other words nothing, a "non-ens" cannot manifest itself.
   Romanists cannot turn to the theory that matter is not a substance; for
   that is not their doctrine. On the contrary, they assert that the
   substance of the bread is transmuted into the substance of Christ's
   body. Nor can they help themselves by resorting to the pantheistic
   doctrine that all accidents are phenomena of God, for that would upset
   their whole system.

   It is moreover impossible that the well-attested testimony of our
   senses should be deceptive. If it once be assumed that we cannot trust
   to the laws of belief impressed on our nature, of which faith in our
   sense perceptions is one of the most important, then the foundation of
   all knowledge, faith, and religion is overturned. What has Catholicism
   to say for itself, if the people cannot trust their ears when they hear
   the teachings of the Church, or their eyes when they read its decrees?
   It has nothing to stand upon. It is engulfed with all things else in
   the abyss of nihilism. To believe in transubstantiation we must
   disbelieve our senses, and this God requires of no man. It involves
   disbelief in Him who is the author of our nature and of the laws which
   are impressed upon it. There is no more complete and destructive
   infidelity than the want of faith in the veracity of consciousness,
   whether it be consciousness of our sense perceptions, or of the truths
   involved in our rational, moral, or religious nature.

   It is another objection to this doctrine that it logically leads, and
   in fact has led, to the greatest practical evils. It has led to
   superstitious, in the place of rational and Scriptural reverence for
   the sacrament; to the idolatrous worship of the consecrated wake; to
   attributing to it magical, or supernatural virtue contrary to
   Scripture; to perverting a simple sacrament into a propitiatory
   sacrifice, and to investing the ministers of Christ with the character
   of sacrificing priests, empowered to offer, for money, a propitiatory
   oblation securing forgiveness even for the aims of the departed. It has
   been made a mine of wealth to the priesthood and the Church. It was
   principally the popular belief in this great error, that secured the
   transfer of the greater part of the land and wealth of Europe into the
   hands of the clergy and gave them almost unlimited power over the
   people.

   Withholding the Cup from the Laity.

   The Romish Church admits that this is contrary to the original
   institution of the ordinance, and to the usage of the primitive Church.
   It is defended, (1.) On the ground that the cup is unnecessary to the
   completeness of the sacrament. The blood is in the body; he therefore
   who receives the latter receives the former. And as the whole Christ,
   as to his body, soul, and divinity is not only in each species, but in
   every particle of both, he who receives the consecrated bread receives
   the whole Christ, and derives all the benefit from communing, the
   sacrament is capable of affording. (2.) That there is great danger in
   passing the cup from one communicant to another that a portion of its
   contents should be spilt; and as the cup after consecration contains
   the real blood of Christ, its falling to the ground and being trodden
   under foot, is a profanation, by every means to be avoided. (3.) The
   Church did not of its own motion introduce this innovation. It was
   introduced and had become general, before the Church saw fit, for
   sufficient reasons, to interfere and change a custom into a law.

   The Lord's Supper as a Sacrifice.

   On this subject the Church of Rome teaches, according to the Council of
   Trent, --

   "1. Si quis dixerit, in missa non offerri Deo verum, et proprium
   sacrificium; aut quod offerri non sit aliud, quam nobis Christum ad
   manducandum dari; anathema sit.

   "2. Si quis dixerit, illis verbis, Hoc facite in meam commemorationem;'
   Christum non instituisse Apostolos sacerdotes; aut non ordinasse, ut
   ipsi, aliique sacerdotes offerent corpus, et sanguinem suum; anathema
   sit.

   "3. Si quis dixerit, missæ sacrificium tantum esse laudis, et gratiarum
   actionis, aut nudum commemorationem sacrificii in cruce peracti, non
   autem propitiatorium; vel soli prodesse sumenti; neque pro vivis, et
   defunctis, pro peccatis, poenis, satisfactionibus, et aliis
   necessitatibus offerri debere; anathema sit.

   "4. Si quis dixerit, blasphemiam irrogari sanctissimo Christi
   sacrificio, in cruce peracto, per missæ sacrificium; aut illi per hoc
   derogari; anathema sit.

   "5. Si quis dixerit, imposturam esse, missas celebrare in honorem
   sanctorum, et pro illorum intercessione, apud Deum obtinenda, sicut
   ecclesia intendit; anathema sit.

   "6. Si quis dixerit, canones missæ errores continere, ideoque
   abrogandum; anathema sit.

   "7. Si quis dixerit, cæremonias, vestes, et externa signa, quibus in
   missarum celebratione ecclesia catholica utitur, irritabula impietatis
   esse, magis quam officia pietatis; anathema sit.

   "8. Si quis dixerit, missas, in quibus solus sacerdos sacramentaliter
   communicat, illicitas esse, ideoque abrogandas; anathema sit.

   "9. Si quis dixerit, ecclesiæ Romanæ ritum, quo summissa voce pars
   canonis, et verba consecrationis proferuntur, damnandum esse; aut
   lingua tantum vulgari missam celebrari debere; aut aquam non miscendam
   esse vino in calice offerendo, eo quod sit contra Christi
   institutionem; anathema sit." [728]

   From this it appears, --

   1. That, according to the Church of Rome, the eucharist is a real,
   propitiatory sacrifice, for the expiation of sin, for reconciliation
   with God, and for securing providential and gracious blessings from his
   hands.

   2. That what is offered is Christ, his body, soul, and divinity, all
   which are present under the form of bread and wine. The sacrifice of
   the mass is the same, therefore, as the sacrifice of the cross; the
   former being a constant repetition of the latter. "Unum itaque et idem
   sacrificium esse fatemur, et haberi debet, quod in missa peragitur, et
   quod in cruce oblatum est: quemadmodum una est et eadem hostia
   Christus, videlicet Dominus noster, qui se ipsum in ara crucis semel
   tantummodo cruentum immolavit. Neque enim cruenta, et incruenta hostia,
   duæ sunt hostiæ, sed una tantum, cujus sacrificium, postquam Dominus
   ita præcepit, Hoc facite in meam commemorationem,' in eucharistia
   quotidie instauratur." [729]

   3. As the sacrifice is the same, so also is the priest. Christ offered
   Himself once on the cross, and He offers Himself daily in the mass.
   "Sed unus etiam atque idem sacerdos est Christus dominus, nam ministri,
   qui sacrificium faciunt, non suam, sed Christi personam suscipiunt, cum
   ejus corpus et sanguinem conficiunt, id quod et ipsius consecrationis
   verbis ostenditur, neque enim sacerdos inquit, Hoc est corpus Christi,
   sed, Hoc est corpus meum:' personam videlicet Christi domini gerens,
   panis, et vini substantiam, in veram ejus corporis, et sanguinis
   substantiam convertit." [730] On this statement it may be remarked in
   passing, that if the ministers are not the real offerers, they are not
   real priests. A priest is one appointed to offer sacrifices. But
   according to the theory, the officiating minister in the service of the
   mass, does not offer the sacrifice. He is a supernumerary. He has no
   function. There is no reason why without his intervention, Christ
   should not when his people meet to commemorate his death, offer Himself
   anew to God. The Roman theory in this, as in many other points, is not
   self-consistent. Romanists represent ministers as true priests;
   mediators between God and the people, without whose intervention, no
   sinner can have access to God or obtain pardon or acceptance. They are
   not only invested with priestly authority and prerogatives, but imbued
   with supernatural power. The words of consecration pronounced by other
   than sacerdotal lips, are inoperative. The mass unless performed by a
   priest is no sacrifice. All this supposes that their office is a
   reality, that ministers are really priests; but according to the
   passage just quoted, they are not priests at all. According to the
   common mode of representation, however, the minister in the mass as
   truly offers the body and blood of Christ, as the priests under the Old
   Testament offered the blood of lambs or of goats. Cardinal Gousset, for
   example, says: "According to the faith of the Catholic Church, the mass
   is a sacrifice of the new law, in which the priest offers to God the
   body and blood of Jesus Christ under the form of bread and wine. The
   mass is a true sacrifice instituted by Jesus Christ." "A sacrifice,
   from its nature, is an act of supreme worship, due to God alone. Hence
   when a mass is celebrated in the name of a saint, it is not to be
   believed that the sacrifice is offered to the saint; but simply in his
   memory, to implore his protection, and to secure his intercession. It
   is a sacrifice in which is offered the body and blood of Christ Jesus
   Christ, whose body and blood are present under the forms of bread and
   wine, is Himself the victim. Finally, the eucharistic sacrifice is made
   by the hands of the priest, but Jesus Christ is the principal minister;
   He is at once priest and victim, offering himself to God the Father by
   the ministry of his priests." [731]

   4. As under the Old Testament some of the sin offerings availed for
   those who brought the victims, and for whose benefit hey were offered;
   and others, as the morning and evening sacrifices, and those offered on
   the feast days, and especially that on the great day of atonement, were
   intended for the whole nation, so according to Romanists, the
   propitiatory sacrifice, in the ordinary public service, is offered for
   the sins of the faithful in general, while at other times it is offered
   for particular individual. And as it matters not whether such
   individuals be living or dead, it is obvious that such masses may be
   indefinitely multiplied. As according to the Church of Rome the great
   majority of those dying within the pale of the Church, pass into
   purgatory, where they remain in a state of suffering for a period to
   which there is no certainly known termination before the day of
   judgment; for their benefit, to alleviate or shorten their sufferings,
   masses may be, and should be offered by their surviving friends. It has
   ever been found that men at the approach of death, or the affectionate
   relatives of the departed, are willing to appropriate money at their
   command, to pay for masses for their benefit. This, as just remarked,
   has proved an inexhaustible mine of wealth to the Church. "Hujus
   sacrificii eam vim esse, parochi docebunt, ut non solum immolanti, et
   sumenti prosit, sed omnibus etiam fidelibus, sive illi nobiscum in
   terris vivant, sive jam in Domino mortui, nondum plane expiati sint.
   Neque enim minus ex Apostolorum certissima traditione, pro his utiliter
   offertur, quam pro vivorum peccatis, poenis, satisfactionibus, ac
   quibusvis calamitatibus, et angustiis." [732]

   Remarks.

   No doctrine of the Church of Rome is more portentous or more fruitful
   of evil consequences than this doctrine of the mass; and no doctrine of
   that Church is more entirely destitute of even a semblance of
   Scriptural support. The words of Christ, "This do in remembrance of
   me," are made to mean, "Offer the sacrifice which I myself have just
   offered" (Offrez le sacrifice que je vien d'offrir moi-meme). [733]
   These words constituted the Apostles and all their successors priests.
   The Council of Trent even anathematizes all who do not put that
   preposterous interpretation on those simple words. [734] Romanists also
   appeal to the fact that Christ is said to be a priest forever after the
   order of Melchizedek, from which they infer that He continually repeats
   the sacrifice once offered on the cross. They even argue from such
   passages as Malachi i. 11, in which the universal spread of the true
   religion is predicted by saying that from the rising of the sun to the
   going down of the same, "in every place incense shall be offered unto
   my name, and a pure offering." [735]

   Protestants reject the doctrine that the eucharist is a true
   propitiatory sacrifice, --

   1. Because it is not only destitute of all support from tue Scriptures,
   but is directly contrary to the whole nature of the ordinance, as
   exhibited in its original institution and in the practice of the
   apostolic church. There it is set forth as a sacred feast commemorative
   of the death of Christ.

   2. Because it is founded on the monstrous doctrine of
   transubstantiation. If the whole substance of the bread be not changed
   into the substance of Christ's body, and the whole substance of the
   wine into the substance of his blood, and if the whole Christ, body,
   soul, and divinity be not really and truly present under the form (or
   species) or appearance of the bread and wine, then the priest in the
   mass has nothing to offer. He in fact offers nothing, and the whole
   service is a deceit. Just so certainly, therefore, as the impossible
   and the unscriptural cannot be true, just so certain is it, that the
   mass is not a propitiatory sacrifice.

   3. The Romish doctrine is that the Apostles were priests, and were
   invested with authority and power to continue and perpetuate in the
   Church the priestly office by ordination and the imposition of hands by
   which the supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit are conveyed. All this
   is unscriptural and false. First, because a priest is a man appointed
   to be a mediator between God and other men, drawing near to Him in
   behalf of those who have not liberty of access for themselves, and
   whose function it is to offer gifts and sacrifices for sin. But there
   is no such office under the Christian dispensation, save in the person
   of Jesus Christ. He is our only, and all sufficient priest; everywhere
   present and everywhere accessible, who has opened for us a new and
   living way of access to God, available to all sinners of the human race
   without the intervention of any of their fellow sinners. Every believer
   is as much a priest under the Gospel, as any other believer, for
   through Christ they all have equal freedom of access unto God. It
   subverts the whole nature of the gospel, to make the intervention of
   any human priest necessary to our reconciliation with God. Secondly,
   Christian ministers are never called priests in the New Testament.
   Every title of dignity, every term expressive of the nature of their
   office, is bestowed on them, but the title priest, so familiar to
   Jewish and Gentile ears, is never given to them. Nor is any priestly
   function ascribed to them. They are not mediators. They are not
   appointed to offer sacrifices for sin. Every priest is a mediator, but
   it is expressly declared that Christians have but one mediator, the man
   Christ Jesus. There is but one sacrifice for sin, the all sufficient
   sacrifice of Christ upon the cross, who died once for all to bring us
   near to God. Thirdly, Christ Himself and the Apostles after Him in all
   their addresses to the people, instead of directing them to go to
   ministers as priests to obtain the benefits of redemption, uniformly
   assume that the way is open for the return of every sinner to God
   without human intervention. "Come unto me" is the invitation of Christ
   to every heavily laden sinner. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
   thou shalt be saved," is the gospel preached by the Apostles both to
   Jews and Gentiles. The emancipation of the Christian world effected by
   the Reformation, consisted in large measure in freeing man from the
   belief that Christian ministers are priests through whom alone sinners
   can draw near to God. It was preaching deliverance to captives, and the
   opening of the prison to those who were bound, to announce that
   believers through Christ are all made kings and priests unto God;
   subject to no authority but the authority of God (and of course to such
   as He has ordained), and all having access by one Spirit unto the
   Father. If then ministers are not priests, the eucharist is not a
   sacrifice.

   4. The Romish doctrine is derogatory to the sacrifice of the cross. It
   supposes that the work of Christ in making satisfaction for the sins of
   men, needs to be constantly repeated. This is directly contrary to
   Scripture, which teaches that by the one offering of Himself, He has
   forever perfected them that believe. His one sacrifice has done all
   that need be done, and all that a sacrifice can do. Romanists say that
   the same sacrifice which was made or the cross, is made in the mass.
   The only difference between the two is modal. It concerns only the
   manner of oblation. Then why is the latter needed? Why does not the one
   offering of Christ suffice? Certain it is the Bible refers us to
   nothing else: and the believer craves nothing else.

   5. The doctrine of the sacrificial character of the eucharist, is an
   integral part of the great system of error, which must stand or fall as
   a whole. Romanism is another gospel. It proposes a different method of
   salvation from that presented in the word of God. It teaches that no
   one can be saved who is out of the pale of that visible society of
   which the pope of Rome is the head; and that all are saved who die
   within that pale. It teaches that no one can be regenerated who is not
   baptized; and that there is no forgiveness for post-baptismal sins,
   except by the sacrament of penance and absolution at the hands of a
   priest. It teaches that no one can have the benefit of the Lord's
   Supper, who does not receive it at the hands of a properly ordained
   officer of the Church of Rome. It teaches that there is no valid
   ministry, and that there are no valid ordinances except in the line of
   the apostolic succession as recognized by the pope. It follows men
   beyond the grave. It teaches that the souls in purgatory are still
   under the power of the keys; that their stay in that place or state of
   torment, can be prolonged or shortened at the will of the Church. The
   pope assumes, and has often pretended to exercise, the power of
   granting indulgences for even a thousand years. This whole theory hangs
   together. If one assumption be false, the whole is false. And if the
   theory in its primary principle of a perpetual apostleship, infallible
   in teaching and of plenary power in government and discipline, be
   false, then every particular doctrine involving that principle must be
   false.

   Moehler, whose philosophical and mitigated Romanism, has called down
   upon him no little censure from his stricter brethren, represents the
   doctrine of the eucharist as the point in which all the differences
   between Romanists and Protestants converge. On the view taken of this
   doctrine depends the question whether the Christian Church has a true
   living "cultus" or not. With him the Church, of course, is the body,
   which, professing the true religion, is united in the reception of the
   same sacraments, in subjection to bishops canonically consecrated, and
   especially to the pope of Rome. For him, and all Romanists, this Church
   is Christ. He dwells in it; animates it; operates through it
   exclusively in the salvation of men. The teaching of the Church is his
   teaching; its commands are his commands; He regenerates only through
   its sacrament of baptism; He remits sin only through the sacrament of
   penance; He strengthens in confirmation; He nourishes his people with
   his body and blood in the eucharist; and in the ordination of priests.
   He appoints the organs through which all this is done by his ceaseless
   activity. "The Church," says Moehler, "is vicariously (auf eine
   abbildlich-lebendige Weise) Christ manifested and working through all
   time. The Redeemer did not merely live eighteen hundred years ago, and
   then disappear, to be remembered only as a historical person as any
   other of the departed; on the contrary He is ever living in the
   Church." [736] Romanists, therefore, practically take away Christ, and
   give us the Church in his stead. It is to be remembered that by the
   Church they do not mean the body consisting of true believers, but the
   external, organized body of which the pope is the head. It is this body
   represented in history by the Hildebrands, the Borgias, and the Leos,
   which Romanism puts in the place of Christ, clothing it with his
   prerogatives, and claiming for it the obedience, the reverence, and the
   confidence due to God alone. It is against this theory, which
   practically puts man in the place of God, that the most fearful
   denunciations of the Scriptures are pronounced.

   § 20. Prayer.

   Prayer is the converse of the soul with God. Therein we manifest or
   express to Him our reverence, and love for his divine perfection, our
   gratitude for all his mercies, our penitence for our sins, our hope in
   his forgiving love, our submission to his authority, our confidence in
   his care, our desires for his favour, and for the providential and
   spiritual blessings needed for ourselves and others. As religion, in
   the subjective sense of the word, is the state of mind induced by the
   due apprehension of the character of God and of our relation to Him as
   our Creator, Preserver, and Redeemer; so prayer is the expression,
   uttered or unuttered, of all the feelings and desires which that state
   of mind produces or excites. A prayerless man is of necessity, and
   thoroughly irreligious. There can be no life without activity. As the
   body is dead when it ceases to act, so the soul that goes not forth in
   its actions towards God, that lives as though there were no God, is
   spiritually dead.

   Prayer takes a great deal for granted. It assumes, in the first place,
   the personality of God. Only a person can say I, or be addressed as
   Thou; only a person can be the subject and object of intelligent
   action, can apprehend and answer, can love and be loved, or hold
   converse with other persons. If God, therefore, be only a name for an
   unknown force, or for the moral order of the universe, prayer becomes
   irrational and impossible. [737] Secondly, God, however, although a
   person, may dwell far off in immensity, and have no intercourse with
   his creatures on earth. Prayer, therefore, assumes not only the
   personality of God, but also that He is near us; that He is not only
   able, but also willing to hold intercourse with us, to hear and answer;
   that He knows our thoughts afar off; and that unuttered aspirations are
   intelligible to Him. Thirdly, it assumes that He has the personal
   control of all nature, i.e., of all things out of Himself; that He
   governs all his creatures and all their actions. It assumes that He has
   not only created all things and endowed matter and mind with forces and
   powers, but that He is everywhere present, controlling the operation of
   such forces and powers, so that nothing occurs without his direction or
   permission. When it rains, it is because He wills it, and controls the
   laws of nature to produce that effect. When the earth produces fruit in
   abundance, or when the hopes of the husbandman are disappointed, these
   effects are not to be referred to the blind operation of natural laws,
   but to God's intelligent and personal control. There is no such reign
   of law as makes God a subject. It is He who reigns, and orders all the
   operations of nature so as to accomplish his own purposes.

   This does not suppose that the laws of nature are mutable, or that they
   are set aside. There is scarcely any effect, either in nature or in the
   acts of men, due to the operation of any one natural force. We produce
   effects by combining such forces, so that the result is due to this
   intelligent and voluntary combination. In like manner, in the ordinary
   operations of nature, God accomplishes his purpose by a similar
   intelligent and voluntary combination of natural causes. When He wills
   that it should rain, He wills that all the secondary causes, productive
   of that effect, should be brought into operation. The doctrine of
   providence only supposes that God does, on the scale of the universe,
   what we do within the limited sphere of our efficiency. We, indeed, so
   far as effects out of ourselves are concerned, are tied to the use of
   secondary causes. We can act neither against them, nor without them.
   God is not thus limited. He can operate without second causes as well
   as with them, or against them. There seems to be no little confusion in
   the minds of many writers on this subject. They insist on the
   immutability of the laws of nature, and some times speak of God as
   constantly controlling their operation by combining and directing their
   forces, and yet they resolve all second causes into the divine
   efficiency; that is, an efficiency directed by intelligence and will.
   "It is but reasonable," says Sir John Herschel, "to regard the force of
   gravitation as the direct or indirect result of a consciousness or will
   existing somewhere." [738] "It may be that all natural forces are
   resolvable in some one force, and indeed in the modern doctrine of the
   correlation of forces, an idea which is a near approach to this, has
   already entered the domain of science. It may also be that this one
   force, into which all others return again, is itself but a mode of
   action of the Divine Will." [739] It is a common remark that the only
   force of which we have any direct knowledge is mind-force, and hence
   that it is unphilosophical to assume any other. From this it is
   inferred that all the forces operating in nature are the energy of the
   one Supreme Intelligence. This doctrine, as shown when treating of the
   doctrine of Providence, almost inevitably leads to pantheism. But it is
   difficult to see how those who take this view can consistently speak of
   the immutability of law, or of God's being free only within its limits.
   It is essential to the idea of mind-power, that it should be free; that
   it should act when, where, and how it pleases. In the case of God,
   indeed, it cannot act unwisely or unjustly. But if all the forces of
   nature are only manifestations of the divine efficiency, what meaning
   can be attached to the proposition that He operates with, and through,
   and never independently of natural law?

   The Scriptural doctrine is that God is an extra-mundane, personal
   Being, independent of the world, who has created it, and endowed all
   things material with their several properties or powers, which He in
   his omnipresent, and infinitely wise omnipotence, constantly controls.
   This doctrine is presupposed in prayer; for "prayer and the answer of
   prayer, are simply . . . . the preferring of a request upon the one
   side, and compliance with that request upon the other. Man applies, God
   complies. Man asks a favour, God bestows it. These are conceived to be
   the two terms of a real interchange that takes place between the
   parties -- the two terms of a sequence, in fact, whereof the antecedent
   is a prayer lifted up from earth, and the consequent is the fulfilment
   of that prayer in virtue of a mandate from heaven." [740]

   Prayer also supposes that the government of God extends over the minds
   of men, over their thoughts, feelings, and volitions, that the heart is
   in his hands, and that He can turn it even as the rivers of water are
   turned.

   It is evident, therefore, that not only atheism, pantheism,
   materialism, and every other system of philosophy which involves the
   denial of the existence or the personality of God, but also all other
   theories, whether scientific or philosophical, which do not admit of
   the control of God over the operations of nature and the character and
   conduct of men, are inconsistent with prayer. According to all these
   systems there is either no one to pray to, or nothing to pray for. If
   there be no personal God, there is no one to pray to; and if God,
   supposing such a Being to exist, has no control over nature or man,
   then there is no rational motive for prayer; there is nothing to be
   accomplished by it. The idea that the service would still be of value
   for its subjective effect is irrational, because its subjective effect
   is due to faith in its objective efficiency. If a man believes that
   there is no God, he cannot make himself a better man by acting
   hypocritically, and pouring forth his prayers and praises to a
   nonentity. Or, if a believer in the existence of God, if he has such a
   theory of his nature or of his relation to the world, as precludes the
   possibility of his hearing, or if He hears, of his answering our
   prayers, then prayer becomes irrational. Candid men, therefore, who in
   their philosophy hold any of the theories referred to, do not hesitate
   to pronounce prayer superstitious or fanatical. Kant, although a
   theist, regards all as unphilosophical enthusiasts who assume that God
   hears or answers prayer. [741]

   Professor Tyndall, one of the representative scientific men of the age,
   says, "One by one natural phenomena have been associated with their
   proximate causes; and the idea of direct personal volition, mixing
   itself in the economy of nature, is retreating more and more." Science,
   he tells us "does assert, for example, that without a disturbance of
   natural law, quite as serious as the stoppage of an eclipse, or the
   rolling the St. Lawrence up the Falls of Niagara, no act of
   humiliation, individual or national, could call one shower from heaven,
   or deflect towards us a single beam of the sun." [Man may deflect the
   beams of the sun at pleasure, but God cannot. Man, according to
   Professor Espy, can make it rain, but God cannot.] "Those, therefore,
   who believe that the miraculous is still active in nature, may with
   perfect consistency join in our periodic prayers for fair weather and
   for rain: while those who hold that the age of miracles is past, will
   refuse to join in such petitions." [742] With Professor Tyndall and the
   large class of scientists to which he belongs, there never has been an
   event in the external world due to the exercise of any other force than
   the undirected operation of physical causes. "Nothing has occurred to
   indicate that the operation of the law [of gravity] has for a moment
   been suspended; nothing has ever intimated that nature has been crossed
   by spontaneous action, or that a state of things at any time existed
   which could not be rigorously deduced from the preceding state. Given
   the distribution of matter and the forces in operation in the time of
   Galileo, the competent mathematician of that day could predict what is
   now occurring in our own." [743] What is meant by "spontaneous action"?
   Spontaneous is antithetical to necessary. Spontaneous action,
   therefore, is free action; the action of intelligence and will; such
   action as Professor Tyndall displays in writing or delivering his
   lectures. His assertion, therefore, is that there has never occurred in
   nature any effect which may not be referred to necessary, i.e., to
   blind, unintelligent causes. This of course precludes the possibility
   of miracles. For a miracle is an event in the external world which
   cannot be referred to any natural cause, but which must from its nature
   be ascribed to the immediate efficiency, or the "spontaneous action" of
   God. When Christ said, "I will; be thou clean," and the leper was
   cleansed, the only cause, or efficient antecedent of the cure, was his
   will a volition. So when He said," Lazarus come forth," or when He
   "said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased and there was
   a great calm." The scientific man has no idea how small he looks, when,
   in the presence of Christ, he ventures to say that nature has never
   been crossed by "spontaneous action," that Christ's will was not a
   cause, when he healed the sick, or opened the eyes of the blind, or
   raised the dead, by a word; or when He himself rose by his own power
   from the grave. To say that these facts never occurred, simply because,
   according to the ephemeral theory of the hour, they could not occur, is
   the infinite of folly. It is a thousand fold more certain that they
   occurred than that the best authenticated facts of history are true.
   For such facts we have only ordinary historical evidence; for the truth
   of Christ's miracles, and especially of his resurrection, we have the
   evidence of all the facts of history from his day to the present. The
   actual state of the world, and the existence of the Church, necessitate
   the admission of those facts, to which God himself bore witness of old
   in signs, and wonders, and divers miracles, as He does still in a
   manner absolutely irresistible, in the gift of the Holy Ghost. To hear
   the whole gospel, even constructively, pronounced a lie, is a sore
   trial to those who have even a glimmer of the faith of Paul, and who
   can only say with quivering lips, what he said with the fulness of
   assurance, "I know whom I have believed." [744] Scientific men are
   prone to think that there is no other evidence of truth, than the
   testimony of the senses. But the reason has its intuitions, the moral
   nature its à priori judgments, the religious consciousness its
   immediate apprehensions, which are absolutely infallible and of
   paramount authority. A man might as easily emancipate himself from the
   operation of the laws of nature, as from the authority of the moral
   law, or his responsibility to God. When, therefore, men of science
   advance theories opposed to these fundamental convictions, they are
   like bats impinging against the everlasting rocks.

   But apart from the case of miracles, it may be safely said, that so far
   from its being true that nature has never been "crossed by spontaneous
   action," such action in nature is familiar, constant, and almost
   universal. What is an organism, but the product of spontaneous action?
   that is, of the intelligent (and therefore voluntary) selection and
   application of appropriate means for the accomplishment of a foreseen
   and intended end? If the world is full of the evidences of spontaneous
   action on the part of man, nature is full of evidence of such action on
   the part of God. The evidence is of the same kind, and just as palpable
   and irresistible in the one case as in the other. It is admitted of
   necessity by those who deny it. Darwin's books, for example, are full
   of such expressions as "wonderful contrivance," "ingenious device,"
   "marvellous arrangements." These expressions reveal the perception of
   spontaneous action. They have no meaning except on the assumption of
   such action. "Contrivance," "device," imply design, and would not be
   used if the perception of intention did not suggest and necessitate
   them. Some twenty times already, in the course of this work, it has
   been shown that in many cases, those who begin with denying any
   spontaneous action in nature, end with asserting that there is no other
   kind of action anywhere; that all force is mind-force, and therefore
   spontaneous as well as intelligent.

   Spontaneous action cannot be got rid of. If denied in the present, it
   must be admitted in the past. If, as even Professor Huxley teaches,
   "Organization is not the cause of life; but life is the cause of
   organization," [745] the question is, Whence comes life? Not out of
   nothing, surely. It must have its origin in the spontaneous, voluntary
   act of the ever, and the necessarily Living One.

   The theory of the universe which underlies the Bible, which is
   everywhere assumed or asserted in the sacred volume, which accords with
   our moral and religious nature, and which, therefore, is the foundation
   of natural, as well as of revealed religion, is that God created all
   things by the word of his power, that He endowed his creatures with
   their properties or forces; that He is everywhere present in the
   universe, coöperating with and controlling the operation of second
   causes on a scale commensurate with his omnipresence and omnipotence,
   as we, in our measure coöperate with, and control them within the
   narrow range of our efficiency. According to this theory, it is not
   irrational that we should pray for rain or fair weather, for prosperous
   voyages or healthful seasons; or that we should feel gratitude for the
   innumerable blessings which we receive from this ever present, ever
   operating, and ever watchful benefactor and Father. Any theory of the
   universe which makes religion, or prayer, irrational, is self-evidently
   false, because it contradicts the nature, the consciousness, and the
   irrepressible convictions of men. As this control of God extends over
   the minds of men, it is no less rational that we should pray, as all
   men instinctively do pray, that He would influence our own hearts, and
   the hearts of others, for good, than that we should pray for health.

   It is also involved in the assumptions already referred to that the
   sequence of events in the physical and moral world is not determined by
   any inexorable fate. A fatalist cannot consistently pray. It is only on
   the assumption that there is a God, who does his pleasure in the army
   of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth, that we can
   rationally address Him as the hearer of prayer.

   In like manner it is assumed that there is no such foreordination of
   events as is inconsistent with God's acting according to the good
   pleasure of his will. When a man enters upon any great enterprise, he
   lays down beforehand the plan of his operations; selects and determines
   his means, and assigns to each subordinate the part he is to act; he
   may require each to apply continually for guidance and directions; and
   may assure him that his requests for assistance and guidance shall be
   answered. Were it possible that every instance of such application or
   request could be foreseen and the answer predetermined, this would not
   be inconsistent with the duty or propriety of such requests being made,
   or with the liberty of action on the part of the controller. This
   illustration may amount to little; but it is certain that the
   Scriptures teach both foreordination and the efficacy of prayer. The
   two, therefore, cannot be inconsistent. God has not determined to
   accomplish his purposes without the use of means; and among those
   means, the prayers of his people have their appropriate place. If the
   objection to prayer, founded on the foreordination of events, be valid,
   it is valid against the use of means in any case. If it be unreasonable
   to say, If it be foreordained that I should live, it is not necessary
   for me to eat,' it is no less unreasonable for me to say, If it be
   foreordained that I should receive any good, it is not necessary for me
   to ask for it.' If God has foreordained to bless us, He has
   foreordained that we should seek his blessing. Prayer has the same
   causal relation to the good bestowed, as any other means has to the end
   with which it is connected.

   The God of the Bible, who has revealed himself as the hearer of prayer,
   is not mere intelligence and power. He is love. He feels as well as
   thinks. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
   that fear Him. He is full of tenderness, compassion, long-suffering,
   and benevolence. This is not anthropomorphism. These declarations of
   Scripture are not mere "regulative truths." They reveal what God really
   is. If man was made in his image, God is like man. All the excellences
   of our nature as spirits belong to Him without limitation, and to an
   infinite degree. There is mystery here, as there is everywhere. But we
   are all used to mysteries, the naturalist as well as the theologian.
   Both have been taught the folly of denying that a thing is, because we
   cannot tell how it is. It is enough for us to know that God loves us
   and cares for us; that a sparrow does not fall to the ground without
   his notice, and that we are, in his sight, of more value than many
   sparrows. All this for the believer is literal truth, having in its
   support the highest kind of evidence. The "how" he is content to leave
   unexplained.

   It is an objection often urged against the propriety of addressing
   prayer to God, that it is inconsistent with his dignity as an infinite
   Being to suppose that He concerns Himself with the trifling affairs of
   men. This objection arises from a forgetfulness that God is infinite.
   It assumes that his knowledge, power, or presence, is limited; that He
   would be distracted if his attention were directed to all the minute
   changes constantly occurring throughout the universe. This supposes
   that God is a creature like ourselves; that bounds can be set to his
   intelligence or efficiency. When a man looks out on an extended
   landscape, the objects to which his attention is simultaneously
   directed are too numerous to be counted. What is man to God? The
   absolute intelligence must know all things; absolute power must be able
   to direct all things. In the sight of God, the distinction between few
   and many, great and small, disappears. In Him all creatures live, and
   move, and have their being.

   The Object of Prayer.

   As prayer involves the ascription of divine attributes to its object,
   it can be properly addressed to God alone. The heathen prayed to
   imaginary beings, or to idols, who had eyes that saw not, and hands
   that could not save. Equally unscriptural and irrational are prayers
   addressed to any creature of whose presence we have no knowledge, and
   of whose ability either to hear or answer our petitions we have no
   evidence.

   In the Old Testament, the prayers therein recorded are urnformly
   addressed to God, as such; to the one Divine Being, because the
   distinction of the persons in the Godhead was then but imperfectly
   revealed. In the New Testament, prayer is addressed either to God, as
   the Triune God, or to the Father, to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit,
   as distinct persons. In the Christian doxology, used wherever the Bible
   is known, the several persons of the Trinity are separately addressed.
   The examples of prayer addressed to Christ, recorded in the New
   Testament, are very numerous. As prayer, in the Scriptural sense of the
   term, includes all converse with God either in the form of praise,
   thanksgiving, confession, or petition; all the ascriptions of glory to
   Him, as well as all direct supplications addressed to Him, come under
   the head. The Apostles prayed to Him while He was yet with them on
   earth, asking of Him blessings which God only could bestow, as when
   they said, "Lord, increase our faith." The dying thief, taught by the
   Spirit of God, said, "Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
   kingdom." The last words of the first martyr, Stephen, were, "Lord
   Jesus, receive my spirit." Paul besought the Lord thrice that the thorn
   in his flesh might depart from him. So in 1 Timothy i. 12, he says, "I
   thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that He counted
   me faithful, putting me into the ministry." In Revelation i. 5, 6, it
   is said, "Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his
   own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father;
   to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen." Revelation v.
   13, "Every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the
   earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I
   saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto Him that
   sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.'" As the
   Bible so clearly teaches that Christ is God manifest in the flesh; that
   all power in heaven and earth is committed to his hands; that He is
   exalted to give repentance and the remission of sins; as He gives the
   Holy Ghost; and as He is said to dwell in us, and to be our life; it
   does thereby teach us that He is the proper object of prayer.
   Accordingly, as all Christians are the worshippers of Christ, so He has
   ever been the object of their adoration, thanksgivings, praises,
   confessions, and supplications.

   Requisites of Acceptable Prayer.

   1. The first and most obviously necessary requisite of acceptable
   prayer, is sincerity. God is a Spirit. He searches the heart. He is not
   satisfied with words, or with external homage. He cannot be deceived
   and will not be mocked. It is a great offence, therefore, in his sight,
   when we utter words before Him in which our hearts do not join. We sin
   against Him when we use terms, in the utterance of which the angels
   veil their faces, with no corresponding feelings of reverence; or use
   the formulas of thanksgiving without gratitude; or those of humility
   and confession without any due sense of our unworthiness; or those of
   petition without desire for the blessings we ask. Every one must
   acknowledge that this is an evil often attending the prayers of sincere
   Christians; and with regard to the multitudes who, in places of public
   worship, repeat the solemn forms of devotion or profess to unite with
   those who utter them, without any corresponding emotions, the service
   is little more than mockery.

   2. Reverence. God is an infinitely exalted Being: infinite in his
   holiness as well as in knowledge and power. He is to be had in
   reverence by all who are round about Hun. This holy fear is declared to
   be the first element of all true religion. His people are designated as
   those who fear his name. We are required to serve Him with reverence
   and godly fear. And whenever heaven is opened to our view, its
   inhabitants are seen prostrate before the throne. We offend God,
   therefore, when we address Him as we would a fellow creature, or use
   forms of expression of undue familiarity. Nothing is more
   characteristic of the prayers recorded in the Bible, than the spirit of
   reverence by which they are pervaded. The Psalms especially may be
   regarded as a prayer-book. Every Psalm is a prayer, whether of worship,
   of thanksgiving, of confession, or of supplication. In many cases all
   these elements are intermingled. They relate to all circumstances in
   the inward and outward life of those by whom they were indited. They
   recognize the control of God over all events, and over the hearts of
   men. They assume that He is ever near and ever watchful, sustaining to
   his people the relation of a loving Father. But with all this, there is
   never any forgetfulness of his infinite majesty. There is a tendency
   sometimes in the best of men, to address God as though He were one of
   ourselves. Luther's familiar formula was, Lieber Herr, or Lieber Herr
   Gott (dear Lord, dear Lord God). As Lieber Herr is the usual mode of
   address among friends (equivalent to our Dear Sir), it sounds strangely
   when God is thus addressed. In Luther it was the expression of faith
   and love; in many who imitate him it is the manifestation of an
   irreverent spirit.

   3. Humility. This includes, first, a due sense of our insignificance as
   creatures; and secondly, a proper apprehension of our ill-desert and
   uncleanness in the sight of God as sinners. It is the opposite of
   self-righteousness, of self-complacency and self-confidence. It is the
   spirit manifested by Job, when he placed his hand upon his mouth, and
   his mouth in the dust, and said, I abhor myself, and repent in dust and
   ashes; by Isaiah when he said, Woe is me! because I am a man of unclean
   lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; and by the
   publican, who was afraid to lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven,
   but smote upon his breast, and said, God be merciful to me a sinner.
   Such language is often regarded as exaggerated or hypocritical. It is,
   however, appropriate. It expresses the state of mind which cannot fail
   to be produced by a proper apprehension of our character as sinners in
   the sight of a just and holy God. Indeed there is no language which can
   give adequate expression to that rational sense of sin which the people
   of God often experience.

   4. Importunity. This is so important that on three different occasions
   our Lord impressed its necessity upon his disciples. This was one
   evident design of the history of the Syrophenician woman, who could not
   be prevented from crying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of
   David." (Matt. xv. 22.) Thus also in the parable of the unjust judge,
   who said, "Because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by
   her continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what the
   unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry
   day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them? I tell you that
   He will avenge them speedily." (Luke xviii. 5-8.) Again in Luke xi.
   5-8, we read of the man who refused to give his friend bread, of whom
   Christ said, "Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his
   friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as
   many as he needeth." God deals with us as a wise benefactor. He
   requires that we should appreciate the value of the blessings for which
   we ask, and that we should manifest a proper earnestness of desire. If
   a man begs for his own life or for the life of one dear to him, there
   is no repressing his importunity. He will not be refused. If the life
   of the body is to be thus earnestly sought, can we expect that the life
   of the soul will be granted to those who do not seek it with
   importunate earnestness.

   5. Submission. Every man who duly appreciates his relation to God,
   will, no matter what his request be disposed to say, "Lord, not my will
   but thine be done." Even a child feels the propriety of subjecting his
   will in all his requests to his earthly father. How much more should we
   submit to the will of our Father in heaven. He alone knows what is
   best; granting our request might, in many cases, be our destruction.
   Our Lord in the garden of Gethsemane set us an example in this matter,
   that should never be forgotten.

   6. Faith. We must believe. (a.) That God is. (b.) That He is able to
   hear and answer our prayers. (c.) That He is disposed to answer them.
   (d.) That He certainly will answer them, if consistent with his own
   wise purposes and with our best good. For this faith we have the most
   express assurances in the Bible. It is not only said, "Ask, and ye
   shall receive; seek and ye shall find," but our Lord says explicitly,
   "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do." (John xiv. 13.)
   And again, "If two of you shall agree on earth, as touching anything
   that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in
   heaven." (Matt. xviii. 19.) All the promises of God are conditional.
   The condition, if not expressed; is implied. It cannot be supposed that
   God has subjected Himself in the government of the world, or in the
   dispensation of his gifts, to the shortsighted wisdom of men, by
   promising, without condition, to do whatever they ask. No rational man
   could wish this to be the case. He would of his own accord supply the
   condition, which, from the nature of the case and from the Scriptures
   themselves, must be understood. In 1 John v. 14, the condition
   elsewhere implied is expressed. "This is the confidence that we have in
   Him, that if we ask anything according to his will, He heareth us." The
   promise, however, gives the assurance that all prayers offered in
   faith, for things according to the will of God, will be answered. The
   answer, indeed, may be given, as in the case of Paul when he prayed to
   be delivered from the thorn in the flesh, in a way we do not expect.
   But the answer will be such as we, if duly enlightened, would ourselves
   desire. More than this we need not wish. Want of confidence in these
   precious promises of God; want of faith in his disposition and
   readiness to hear us, is one of the greatest and most common defects in
   the prayers of Christians. Every father desires the confidence of his
   children, and is grieved by any evidence of distrust; and God is our
   Father; He demands from us the feelings which children ought to have
   towards their earthly parents.

   7. The prayers of Christians must be offered in the name of Christ. Our
   Lord said to his disciples: "Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name:
   ask, and ye shall receive." (John xvi. 24.) "I have chosen you . . . .
   that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, He may give it
   you." (xv. 16.) "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do."
   (xiv. 13.) By "the name of God" is meant God himself, and God as
   manifested in his relation to us. Both ideas are usually united. Thus
   to believe "in the name of the only begotten Son of God" is to believe
   that Christ is the Son of God, and that as such He is manifested as the
   only Saviour of men. To act in the name of anyone is often to act by
   his authority, and in the exercise of his power. Thus our Lord speaks
   of the works which He did "in his Father's name;" that is, by the
   Father's authority and in the exercise of his efficiency. And of the
   Apostles it is frequently said that they wrought miracles in the name
   of Christ, meaning that the miracles were wrought by his authority and
   power. But when one asks a favour in the name of another, the simple
   meaning is, for his sake. Regard for the person in whose name the
   favour is requested, is relied on as the ground on which it is to be
   granted. Therefore, when we are told to pray in the name of Christ, we
   are required to urge what Christ is and what He has done, as the reason
   why we should be heard. We are not to trust to our own merits, or our
   own character, nor even simply to God's mercy; we are to plead the
   merits and worth of Christ. It is only in Him, in virtue of his
   mediation and worth, that, according to the Gospel, any blessing is
   conferred on the apostate children of men.

   Different Kinds of Prayer.

   As prayer is converse with God, it includes those spiritual exercises,
   those goings forth of the soul towards God in thought and feeling,
   which reveal themselves in the forms of reverence, gratitude, sorrow
   for sin, sense of dependence, and obligation. In this sense, the man
   who lives and walks with God, prays always. He fulfils to the letter
   the injunction "Pray without ceasing." It is our duty and high
   privilege to have this constant converse with God. The heart should be
   like the altar of incense, on which the fire never went out.

   It is, however, a law of our nature that we should clothe our thoughts
   and feelings in words. And therefore, prayer is in one form speech.
   Even when no audible utterance is given, words as the clothing or
   expression of inward states are present to the mind. There is power,
   however, in articulate words. The thought or feeling is more distinct
   and vivid even to ourselves, when audibly expressed. Prayer, in this
   sense, is usually distinguished as secret, social, and public. It would
   be a great mistake, if a Christian should act on the assumption that
   the life of God in his soul could be adequately preserved by that form
   of prayer, which consists in habitual communion with God. The believer
   needs, in order to maintain his spiritual health and vigour, regular
   and stated seasons of prayer, as the body needs its daily meals. "When
   thou prayest," is the direction given by our Lord, "enter into thy
   closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is
   in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee
   openly." (Matt. vi. 6.) The Bible presents to us the example of the
   people of God, and of our blessed Lord himself, as a rule of conduct on
   this subject. We read that Christ often retired for the purpose of
   prayer, and not unfrequently spent whole nights in that exercise. If
   the spotless soul of Jesus needed these seasons of converse with God,
   none of his followers should venture to neglect this important means of
   grace. Let each day, at least, begin and end with God.

   Social prayer includes family prayer, and prayer in the assemblies of
   the people for social worship. As man's nature is social, he must have
   fellowship with his fellow men in all that concerns his inward and
   outward life. No man lives, or can live for himself, in religion any
   more than in any other relation. As the family is the most intimate
   bond of fellowship among men, it is of the utmost importance that it
   should be hallowed by religion. All the relations of parents, children,
   and domestics are purified and strengthened, when the whole household
   is statedly assembled, morning and evening, for the worship of God.
   There is no substitute for this divinely appointed means of promoting
   family religion. It supposes, indeed, a certain amount of culture. The
   head of the family should be able to read the Scriptures as well as to
   lead in the prayer. Those, however, who cannot do the former, may at
   least do the latter. All persons subject to the watch or care of the
   Church should be required to maintain in their households this stated
   worship of God. The character of the Church and of the state depends on
   the character of the family. If religion dies out in the family, it
   cannot elsewhere be maintained. A man's responsibility to his children,
   as well as to God, binds him to make his house a Bethel; if not a
   Bethel, it will be a dwelling place of evil spirits.

   When and where the mass of the people were so ignorant as to be
   incompetent profitably to maintain religious services in their
   families, it was natural and proper for the Church daily to open its
   doors, and call the people to matins and vespers. It was far better to
   have this opportunity for daily worship, than that such stated service
   should be neglected. It is not wise, however, to continue a custom when
   the grounds on which it was introduced no longer exist; or to make a
   church ordinance the substitute for a divine institution.

   Public Prayer.

   The public services of the sanctuary are designed for worship and
   instruction. The former includes prayer and singing; the latter, the
   reading the word of God and preaching. These elements should be
   preserved in due proportion. In some churches instruction is made
   entirely subordinate to worship; twice the time being devoted to the
   latter that is allotted to the former. This seems to be contrary to the
   Scriptural rule. Knowledge in the Bible is represented as the essential
   element of religion. There can be no true worship of God without
   adequate knowledge of God; there can be no repentance, faith, or holy
   living unless the truths on which these exercises and this living are
   dependent are understood, and are present to the mind. Religion is a
   reasonable, that is (logike) a rational service, with which ignorance
   is incompatible. Christian ministers, therefore, are always in the New
   Testament called didaskaloi, teachers. Their great commission received
   from Christ was "to teach all nations." The Apostles, therefore, went
   everywhere, preaching. Paul says Christ did not send him to baptize, or
   to perform mere religious services, but to preach tho Gospel, which he
   declared to be the wisdom of God and the power of God unto salvation.
   No human authority could have transformed Paul from a preacher into an
   offerer of prayers. It was not until pagan ideas of worship began to
   pervade the Church, and ministers were transmuted from teachers into
   priests, that the teaching element was made so entirely subordinate to
   that of worship, as it has been for ages in the Church of Rome.

   While teaching should be, as it clearly was during the apostolic age,
   the prominent object in the services of the Lord's day, the importance
   of public prayer can hardly be overestimated. This, it is often said,
   is the weak point in the Presbyterian Sabbath service. This is probably
   true. That is, it is probably true that there are more good preachers
   than good prayers. The main reason for this is, that the minister
   devotes a great part of the labour of the week to the preparation of
   his sermon, and not a thought to his prayers. It is no wonder,
   therefore, that the one should be better than the other.

   In order that this part of divine service should be conducted to the
   edification of the people, it is necessary, (1.) That the officiating
   minister should have a truly devout spirit; that the feelings and
   desires, of which the prayers are the utterance, should be in exercise
   in his own heart. (2.) That his mind and memory should be well stored
   with the thoughts and language of Scripture. Holy men of old spake as
   they were moved by the Holy Ghost. Their utterances, whether in
   adoration, thanksgiving, confession, or supplication, were controlled
   by the Spirit of God. Hence they express the mind of the Spirit; they
   are the most appropriate vehicles for the expression of those feelings
   and desires which the Spirit awakens in the minds of God's people. No
   prayers, therefore, are more edifying, other things being equal, than
   those which abound in the appropriate use of Scriptural language. (3.)
   The prayer should be well ordered, so as to embrace all the proper
   parts and topics of prayer in due proportion This will prevent its
   being rambling, diffuse, or repetitious. (4.) It should also be suited
   to the occasion, whether that be the ordinary service on the Lord's
   day, or the administration of the sacraments, or the special service on
   days of thanksgiving or of fasting and humiliation. (5.) It is hardly
   necessary to say that the language employed should be simple, solemn,
   and correct. (6.) The prayers should be short. Undue length in this
   service is generally owing, not more to diffuseness than to useless
   repetitions.

   Prayer as a Means of Grace.

   Means of grace, as before stated, are those means which God has
   ordained for the end of communicating the life-giving and sanctifying
   influences of the Spirit to the souls of men. Such are the word and
   sacraments, and such is prayer. It has not only the relation which any
   other cause has to the end for which it was appointed, and thus is the
   condition on which the blessings of God, providential or spiritual, are
   bestowed; but it brings us near to God, who is the source of all good.
   Fellowship with Him, converse with Him, calls into exercise all
   gracious affections, reverence, love, gratitude, submission, faith,
   joy, and devotion. When the soul thus draws near to God, God draws near
   to it, manifests his glory, sheds abroad his love, and imparts that
   peace which passes all understanding. Our Lord says, "If a man love me,
   he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come
   unto him, and make our abode with him." (John xiv. 28.) In such
   fellowship, the soul must be holy and must be blessed.

   The Power of Prayer.

   The course of human events is not controlled by physical force alone.
   There are other powers at work in the government of the world. There is
   the power of ideas, true or false; the power of truth; the power of
   love and human sympathy; the power of conscience; and above all, the
   Supreme Power, immanent in the world as well as over it, which is an
   intelligent, voluntary, personal power, coöperating with and
   controlling the operations of all creatures, without violating their
   nature. This Supreme Power is roused into action by prayer, in a way
   analogous to that in which the energies of a man are called into action
   by the entreaties of his fellow-men. This is the doctrine of the Bible;
   it is perfectly consistent with reason, and is confirmed by the whole
   history of the world, and especially of the Church. Moses by his prayer
   saved the Israelites from destruction; at the prayer of Samuel the army
   of the Philistines was dispersed; "Elias was a man subject to like
   passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and
   it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.
   And he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth brought
   forth her fruit." These facts are referred to by the Apostle James, for
   the purpose of proving that the prayer of a righteous man availeth
   much. Paul constantly begged his Christian brethren to pray for him,
   and directed that prayer should "be made for all men: for kings, and
   for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
   life in all godliness and honesty." This of course supposes that prayer
   is a power. Queen Mary of Scotland was not beside herself, when she
   said she feared the prayers of John Knox, more than an army. Once admit
   the doctrine of theism, that is of the existence of a personal God, and
   of his constant control over all things out of Himself, and all ground
   for doubt as to the efficacy of prayer is removed, and it remains to
   us, as it has been to the people of God in all ages, the great source
   of spiritual joy and strength, of security for the present and
   confidence for the future. The Forty-sixth Psalm still stands: "The
   Lord of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge."

   [737] Philosophers, says Dr. Chalmers, "look on the Supreme Principle
   to be in every way as inflexible and sure as they have uniformly found
   of the subordinate principles; and that He is as unfit to be addressed
   by a petition or the expression of a wish, as any fancied spirit that
   may reside in a volcano or a storm, in any other department of nature's
   vast machinery -- that the cries of urgency and distress are of no more
   avail when sent up to Him who wields the elements of the world, as if
   they were only lifted to the elements themselves -- that the same
   unchangeableness which pervades all nature, is also characteristic of
   nature's God: and so they deem to be an aberration from sound

CHAPTER I.

  STATE OF THE SOUL AFTER DEATH.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Protestant Doctrine.

   THE Protestant doctrine on the state of the soul after death includes,
   first of all, the continued conscious existence of the soul after the
   dissolution of the body. This is opposed, not only to the doctrine that
   the soul is merely a function of the body and perishes with it, but
   also to the doctrine of the sleep of the soul during the interval
   between death and the resurrection.

   The former doctrine belongs to the theory of materialism, and stands or
   falls with it. If there be no substance but matter, and no force but
   such as is the phenomenon of matter; and if the form in which physical
   force manifests itself as mind, or mental action, depends on the highly
   organized matter of the brain, then when the brain is disorganized the
   mind ceases to exist. But if the soul and body are two distinct
   substances, then the dissolution of the latter does not necessarily
   involve the end of the conscious existence of the former.

   There is another view on this subject adopted by many who are not
   materialists, but who still hold that mind cannot act or manifest
   itself without a material organ. Thus, for example, the late Isaac
   Taylor says that as extension is an attribute of matter, the soul
   without a body cannot be extended. But extension is a relation to
   space; what is not extended is consequently nowhere. "We might as
   well," he says, "say of a pure spirit that it is hard, heavy, or red,
   or that it is a cubic foot in dimensions, as say that it is here or
   there, or that it has come, and is gone." "When we talk of absolute
   immateriality, and wish to withdraw mind altogether from matter, we
   must no longer allow ourselves to imagine that it is, or that it can
   be, in any place, or that it has any kind of relationship to the
   visible and extended universe." In like manner, he argues that mind is
   dependent upon its corporeity, or union with matter, for its
   relationship to time. A pure spirit could not tell the difference
   between a moment and a century; it could have no perception of the
   equable flow of duration, for that is a knowledge drawn from the
   external world and its regular motions. To its union with matter, mind
   is indebted also for its sensibility or sensations, for its power over
   matter, for its imaginative emotions, and for its "defined,
   recognizable individuality," and of course for its personality. The
   soul after death, therefore, must either cease its activity, at least
   in reference to all out of itself, or be furnished at once with a new
   body. The latter assumption is the one commonly adopted. "Have the dead
   ceased to exist?" he asks, "Have those who are fallen asleep perished?
   No; -- for there is a spiritual body, and another vehicle of human
   nature, as well as a natural body; and, therefore, the dissolution of
   this animal structure leaves the life untouched. The animal body is not
   itself the life, nor is it the cause of life; nor again is the
   spiritual body the life, nor the cause of it; but the one as well as
   the other are the instruments of the mind, and the necessary medium of
   every productive exercise of its faculties." [746]

   On this theory of the dependence of mind on matter, "for every
   productive exercise of its faculties," for its individuality, and its
   susceptibilities, it may be remarked, (1.) That the theory is admitted
   to be untrue in relation to God. He has no body; and He can act and be
   acted upon, and his activity is productive. If such be the case with
   God who is a pure spirit, it is altogether arbitrary to deny that it is
   true with regard to the human soul. Man as a spirit is of the same
   nature with God. He is like Him in all that is essential to the nature
   of a spirit. (2.) The theory has no support from Scripture, and,
   therefore, has no right to intrude itself into the explanation of
   Scriptural doctrines. The Bible never attributes corporeity to angels;
   yet it ascribes to them a "ubi"; speaks of their coming and going;. and
   of their being mighty in power to produce effects in the material and
   spiritual worlds. It never speaks of man's having any other body
   besides his earthly tabernacle, and the body which he is to have at the
   resurrection. And yet it speaks of the soul as active and conscious
   when absent from the body and present with the Lord. (3.) If the soul
   is a substance it has power, power of self-manifestation, and
   productive power according to its nature. Electricity may be a force in
   nature manifested to us, in our present state, only under certain
   conditions. But that does not prove that it is active only under those
   conditions, or that beings constituted differently from what we are,
   may not be cognizant of its activity. It is enough, however, that the
   theory in question is extra-scriptural, and therefore has no authority
   in matters of faith.

   It is no less evident that according to the pantheistic theory, in all
   its phases, which regards man as only one of the transient forms of
   God's existence, there is no room for the doctrine of the conscious
   existence of the soul after death. The race is immortal, but the
   individual man is not. Trees and flowers cover the earth from
   generation to generation; yet the same flower blooms but once. The mass
   of men whose convictions, on such subjects, are founded on their moral
   and religious nature, have in all ages believed in the continued
   existence of the soul after death. And that universality of belief is
   valid evidence of the truth believed. But men whose opinions are under
   the control of the speculative understanding, have never arrived at any
   settled conviction on this subject. To be, or not to be? was a question
   speculation could not answer. The dying Hume said he was about to take
   a leap in the dark. The continued existence of the soul after death is
   a matter of divine revelation. It was part of the faith of the Church
   before the coming of Christ. The revelation of all the great doctrines
   which concern the destiny and salvation of men has been indeed
   progressive. It is not, therefore, a matter of surprise that the
   doctrine of the future state is much less clearly unfolded in the Old
   Testament than in the New. Still it is there. When the Apostle Paul (2
   Tim. i. 10) speaks of "Our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished
   death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the
   Gospel," he is not to be understood as saying that the future life was
   unknown, as Archbishop Whately argues, before the coming of Christ.
   This would be inconsistent with the most explicit declarations
   elsewhere. It is often said that Christ came to preach the Gospel, to
   make propitiation for sin, and to reveal the way of reconciliation with
   God. Paul says in Galatians iii. 23, "before faith came we were kept
   under the law." Yet he strenuously insists that the Gospel, or plan of
   salvation which he taught, was taught by the law and prophets (Rom.
   iii. 21); and that the patriarchs were saved by faith in the same
   promise on which sinners are now called upon to rely. What was
   imperfectly revealed under the old economy, is clearly revealed under
   the new. This is all that those passages which speak of the Gospel
   bringing new truths to light, are intended to teach. Christ shed a
   flood of light on the darkness beyond the grave. Objects before dimly
   discerned in that gloom, now stand clearly unveiled; so that it may
   well be said He brought life and immortality to light, he revealed the
   nature of this future state, and showed how, for the people of God,
   that state was one of life. It may be observed in passing, that many
   Christian writers who speak of the doctrine of a future life being
   unknown, at least to the patriarchs, and to the writers of the Psalms,
   mean "the Christian doctrine" on that subject. They do not intend to
   deny that the people of God from the beginning believed in the
   conscious existence of the soul after death. This Hengstenberg, for
   example, distinctly asserts concerning himself. [747]

   Doctrine of a Future Life revealed under the Old Testament.

   1. The first argument on this subject is an à priori one. That the
   Hebrews, God's chosen people, the recipients and custodians of a
   supernatural revelation, should be the only nation on the face of the
   earth, in whose religion the doctrine of a future state had no place,
   would be a solecism. It is absolutely incredible, for it supposes human
   nature in the case of the Hebrews to be radically different from what
   it is in other men.

   2. Instead of the Hebrews having lower views of man than other nations,
   they alone were possessed of the truth concerning his origin and
   nature. They had been taught from the beginning that man was created in
   the image of God, and, therefore, like God, of the same nature as a
   spirit, and capable of fellowship with his maker. They had also been
   taught that man was created immortal, that the death even of the body,
   was a punishment; that the sentence of death (in the sense of
   dissolution) concerned only the body. "Dust thou art, and unto dust
   shalt thou return." The soul is not dust, and therefore, according to
   the earliest theology of the Hebrews, was not to return to dust; it was
   to return to God who gave it.

   3. We accordingly find that throughout the Old Testament Scriptures the
   highest views are presented of the nature and destiny of man. He is the
   child of God, destined to enjoy his fellowship and favour; the
   possessions and enjoyments of earth are always represented as temporary
   and insignificant, not adapted to meet the soul's necessities; they
   were taught not to envy the wicked in their prosperity, but to look to
   God as their portion they were led to say, "Whom have I in heaven but
   thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee;" and "I
   had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in
   the tents of wickedness." In the Old Testament, the righteous are
   always represented as strangers and pilgrims upon the earth, whose home
   and whose reward are not in this world; that their portion is in
   another world, and, therefore, that it is better to be the humblest and
   most afflicted of God's people than to be the most prosperous of the
   wicked. The judgments of God are represented as falling on the wicked
   in a future state, and thus effectually vindicating the justice of God
   in his dealings with men. The Psalmist said, he was envious at the
   foolish, when he saw the prosperity of the wicked, until he went into
   the sanctuary of God and understood their end. In contrasting his own
   state and prospects with theirs, he said, "I am continually with
   thee. . . . . Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward
   receive me to glory." (Ps. lxxiii. 23, 24.) Such is the drift and
   spirit of the Old Testament Scriptures. Their whole tendency was to
   raise the thoughts of the people from the present and turn them towards
   the future; to make men look not at the things seen, but at the things
   unseen and eternal.

   4. The dead in the Old Testament are always spoken of as going to their
   fathers, as descending into "Sheol," i.e., into the invisible state,
   which the Greeks called Hades. Sheol is represeated as the general
   receptacle or abode of departed spirits, who were there in a state of
   consciousness; some in a state of misery, others in a state of
   happiness. In all these points the pagan idea of Hades corresponds to
   the Scriptural idea of Sheol. All souls went into Hades, some dwelling
   in Tartarus, others in Elysium. That the Hebrews regarded the souls of
   the dead as retaining their consciousness and activity is obvious from
   the practice of necromancy, and is confirmed by the fact of the
   appearance of Samuel to Saul, as recorded in 1 Samuel xxviii. The
   represennation given in Isaiah xiv. of the descent of the King of
   Babylon, when all the dead rose to meet and to reproach him, takes for
   granted and authenticates the popular belief in the continued conscious
   existence of departed spirits.

   5. In several passages of the Old Testament, the doctrine of a future
   life is clearly asserted. We know upon the authority of the New
   Testament that the Sixteenth Psalm is to be understood of the
   resurrection of Christ, with which, the Apostle teaches us that of his
   people is inseparably connected. His soul was not to be left in Sheol;
   nor was his body to see corruption. In Psalm xvii. 15, after having
   described the cruelty and prosperity of the wicked, the Psalmist says,
   in regard to himself: "I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall
   be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness." Isaiah xxvi. 19, says:
   "Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise.
   Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust, for my dew is as the dew of
   herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead." (Dan. xii. 2.) "And many
   of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake; some to
   everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. And they
   that be wise, shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they
   that turn many to righteousness, as the stars forever and ever." These
   prophetic declarations are indeed often explained as referring to the
   restoration of the nation from a state of depression to one of
   prosperity and glory. But the language employed, the context in which
   there is clear reference to the Messianic period, and the sanction
   given by Christ and his Apostles to the doctrine taught by the literal
   sense of the words here used, are considerations decisive in favour of
   the ordinary interpretation, which is adopted by Delitzsch, [748]
   Hengstenberg, [749] Oehler, [750] and many others of the modern
   interpreters. Even Mr. Alger, in his elaborate work on the doctrine of
   a future life, concedes the point so far as the passage in Daniel is
   concerned. "No one," he says, "can deny that a judgment, in which
   reward and punishment shall be distributed according to merit, is here
   clearly foretold." [751] Those German writers whose views of
   inspiration are so low as to enable them to interpret each book of the
   Bible as the production of an individual mind, and to represent the
   several writers as teaching different doctrines, in many cases take the
   ground that in the early books of the Scriptures, the simple fact of a
   future life is taken for granted, but not taught, and that nothing was
   made known as to the nature of that life. Thus Schultz says, "That all
   the books of the Old Testament assume that men are in some way or other
   to live after death. Even in the Pentateuch this is taken for granted.
   It is not taught, but assumed as a self-evident truth, immanent in the
   consciousness of the people." [752]

   6. It is to be remembered that we have in the New Testament an
   inspired, and, therefore, an infallible commentary on the Old Testament
   Scriptures. From that commentary we learn that the Old Testament
   contains much which otherwise we should never have discovered. Not only
   is the compass of the truths revealed to the fathers shown to be far
   greater than the simple words would suggest, but truths are declared to
   be therein taught, which, without divine assistance, we could not have
   discovered. There is another thing concerning the faith of the Old
   Testament saints to be taken into consideration. They may have
   understood, and probably did understand their Scriptures far better
   than we are disposed to think possible. They had the advantage of the
   constant presence of inspired men to lead them in their interpretation
   of the written word, and they enjoyed the inward teaching of the Holy
   Spirit. What that spiritual illumination availed in their case, we
   cannot tell; but we know that now the humble Christian who submits
   himself to the teachings of the Spirit, understands the Bible far
   better than any mere verbal critic.

   We have then in the New Testament the most explicit declarations, not
   only that the doctrine of a future state was revealed in the Old
   Testament, but that from the beginning it was part of the faith of the
   people of God. Our Lord in refuting the Sadducees, who denied not only
   the resurrection of the body, but also the conscious existence of man
   after death, and the existence of any merely spiritual beings, appeals
   to the fact that in the Pentateuch, the authority of which the
   Sadducees admitted, God is familiarly called the God of Abraham, Isaac,
   and Jacob; but as He is the God not of the dead but of the living, the
   designation referred to proves that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are now
   living, and living too in the fellowship and enjoyment of God.
   "Christ," says Mr. Alger, whom we quote the rather because he belongs
   to the class of men who call themselves liberal Christians, [753]
   "Christ once reasoned with the Sadducees as touching the dead, that
   they rise;' in other words, that the souls of men upon the decease of
   the body pass into another and an unending state of existence: --
   Neither can they die any more; for they are equal with the angels, and
   are the children of God, being children of the resurrection.' His
   argument was, that God is the God of the living, not of the dead; that
   is, the spiritual nature of man involves such a relationship with God
   as pledges his attributes to its perpetuity. The thought which supports
   this reasoning penetrates far into the soul and grasps the moral
   relations between man and God. It is most interesting, viewed as the
   unqualified affirmation by Jesus, of the doctrine of a future life
   which shall be deathless." [754] The reasoning of Christ, however, is
   not only an affirmation of the truth of the doctrine of a future
   deathless life, but an affirmation also that that doctrine is taught in
   the Old Testament. The words which He quotes are contained in the book
   of Exodus; and those words, as explained by Him, teach the doctrine of
   the blessed and unending life of the righteous.

   That the Jews when Christ came, universally, with the exception of the
   sect of the Sadducees, believed in a future life, is beyond dispute.
   The Jews at this period were divided into three sects: the Sadducees,
   who were materialistic skeptics, believing neither in the resurrection,
   nor in angels, nor in spirits; the Essenes, who were a philosophical
   and ascetic sect, believing that the souls of the just being freed at
   death from the prison of the body, rejoice and are borne aloft where a
   happy life forever is decreed to the virtuous; but the wicked are
   assigned to eternal punishment in a dark cold place; [755] and the
   Pharisees, who, as we know from the New Testament, believed in the
   resurrection of the body in the sense in which Paul believed that
   doctrine (Acts xxvi. 6), for he claimed in his controversy with the
   Sadducees, that the Pharisees were on his side. They believed that the
   soul was in its nature immortal; that the righteous only are happy
   after death, and that the wicked are eternally miserable. That the Jews
   derived their doctrine from their own Scriptures is plain, (1.) Because
   they admitted no other source of religious knowledge. The Scriptures
   were their rule of faith, as those Scriptures had been understood and
   explained by their fathers. (2.) There is no other known source from
   which the doctrine of a future state as held by the Jews in the time of
   Christ, could have been obtained. The doctrines, whether religious or
   philosophical, of their heathen neighbours were antagonistic to their
   own. This is true even of the doctrines of Zoroaster, which in some
   points had most affinity with those of the Jews. (3.) The inspired
   writers of the New Testament teach the same doctrines. and affirm that
   their knowledge was derived not from men, but from the revelation of
   God as contained in the Old Testament, and as made by Christ.

   A few of the passages in which the Apostles teach that the doctrine of
   a future life was known to the patriarchs before the coming of Christ,
   are the following: Paul was arraigned before the council in Jerusalem,
   and "when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the
   other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a
   Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the
   dead I am called in question." (Acts xxiii. 6.) He here declares that
   in the dispute between these two parties, on the question whether the
   doctrine of a future life and of the resurrection of the dead was
   taught in the Scriptures which both parties acknowledged, he sided with
   the Pharisees. Again in his speech before Agrippa, be said: "I stand,
   and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
   unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving God day and
   night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, King Agrippa, I am accused
   of the Jews. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that
   God should raise the dead?" (Acts xxvi. 6-8.) The promise to which he
   refers is the promise of redemption through the Messiah, which
   redemption includes the deliverance of his people from the power of
   death and other evil consequences of sin. This was the promise to which
   the twelve tribes hoped to come. The belief, therefore, in a future
   life is thus declared to have been a part of the religion of the whole
   Hebrew nation.

   In Galatians iii. 8, the Apostle says, God "preached before the gospel
   unto Abraham." The Gospel, however, in the Apostle's sense of the term,
   is the glad tidings of salvation; and salvation is deliverance from the
   penalty of the law and restoration to the image and favour of God. This
   of necessity involves the idea of a future life; of a future state of
   misery from which the soul is delivered, and of a future state of glory
   and blessedness into which it is introduced. In teaching, therefore,
   that men before the coming of Christ needed and desired salvation, in
   the Christian sense of the word, the Apostle assumed that they had a
   knowledge of the evils which awaited unpardoned sinners in the world to
   come. The evidence, however, that the New Testament affords of the fact
   that the Hebrews believed in a future state, is not found exclusively
   in direct assertions of that fact, but in the whole nature of the plan
   of salvation therein unfolded. The New Testament takes for granted that
   all men, since the apostasy of Adam, are in a state of sin and
   condemnation; that from that state no man can be delivered except
   though the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the only Saviour of
   men. It is, therefore, taught that the knowledge of this Redeemer was
   communicated to our race from the beginning, and in express terms in
   the promise made to Abraham; that the condition of salvation was then,
   as it is now, faith in Christ; that the blessings secured for believers
   were enjoyed before the advent of the Son of God in the flesh, as well
   as since. The heaven of believers is called the bosom of Abraham. All
   this of course assumes that the truths made known in the New Testament
   are in their germs revealed in the Old; just as all the doctrines
   unfolded in the Epistles are contained in the words of Christ as
   recorded in the Gospels.

   The Epistle to the Hebrews is specially devoted to the object of
   unfolding the relation between the Old Dispensation and the New. The
   former was the shadow, or image, of the latter. What in the New is
   taught in words, in the Old, was taught through types. That men are
   sinners, and as such under condemnation; that sin can only be cleansed
   by blood, or that the expiation of guilt by a vicarious sacrifice is
   necessary in order to forgiveness; that men therefore are saved by a
   priest appointed to draw near to God in their behalf and to offer gifts
   and sacrifices for sin; and that the effect of this priestly
   intervention is eternal salvation, are said to be the truths which
   underlie the religion of the Old Testament, as they constitute the life
   of the religion of the New. Faith was to the saints of old as it is to
   us, "the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not
   seen." They walked by faith, and not by sight. They lived with their
   eyes fixed on the unseen and eternal. It was the future that filled
   their vision and elevated them above the present. They "died in faith,
   not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and
   were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were
   strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things
   declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been
   mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had
   opportunity to have returned; but now they desire a better country,
   that is, an heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their
   God: for he hath prepared for them a city." (Heb. xi. 13-16.) Moses by
   faith chose rather "to suffer affliction with the people of God, than
   to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season." It was through faith, the
   belief and hope of a better life hereafter, that the saints of old
   "subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped
   the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of
   the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight,
   turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead
   raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting
   deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: and others
   had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and
   imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted,
   were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheep-skins and
   goat-skins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented (of whom the world
   was not worthy); they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in
   dens and caves of the earth." Nothing more than this can be said of
   Christian confessors and martyrs. The faith of the Old Testament saints
   in the unseen and eternal was, therefore, as strong as that of any set
   of men since the creation. It has been said that the opinion of the New
   Testament writers is of no weight in a matter of criticism, and,
   therefore, it is of no consequence what they thought about the
   teachings of the Old Testament. This is true, if those writers were
   ordinary men; but if they spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost,
   then what they said, God said. We have, therefore, the sure word of
   inspiration that the people of God from the beginning of the world have
   believed in a state of conscious existence beyond the grave. That such
   is the doctrine of the New Testament is not disputed, and therefore
   need not be argued.

   The Intermediate State.

   As all Christians believe in the resurrection of the body and a future
   judgment, they all believe in an intermediate state. That is, they
   believe that there is a state of existence which intervenes between
   death and the resurrection; and that the condition of the departed
   during that interval is, in some respects, different from that which it
   is to be subsequent to that event. It is not, therefore, as to the fact
   of an intermediate state, but as to its nature, that diversity of
   opinion exists among Christians.

   The common Protestant doctrine on this subject is that "the souls of
   believers are at their death, made perfect in holiness, and do
   immediately pass into glory; and their bodies, being still united to
   Christ, do rest in their graves till the resurrection." According to
   this view the intermediate state, so far as believers are concerned, is
   one of perfect freedom from sin and suffering, and of great exaltation
   and blessedness. This is perfectly consistent with the belief that
   after the second coming of Christ, and the resurrection of the dead,
   the state of the soul will be still more exalted and blessed.

   In support of the Protestant doctrine as thus stated, it may be
   remarked,

   1. That it is simply a question of fact. What do the Scriptures teach
   as to the state of the soul of a believer immediately after death? It
   is not legitimate to decide this question on psychological grounds; to
   argue that such is the nature of the soul that it cannot retain its
   individuality, or personality, when separated from the body; or, that
   it is a mere function of the brain; or, that it cannot act or be acted
   upon -- can neither perceive nor be perceived except through and by
   means of the senses; or, that as vegetable and animal life are only
   manifest and active in connection with some form of matter, in other
   words, as there must be a physical basis of life, so the soul
   necessarily requires a material basis for its manifestation and
   activity. All these speculations, or theories, are, for the Christian,
   of no account, if the Bible teaches the fact of the continued,
   personal, individual existence of the soul after the death and
   dissolution of the body. The Bible does not formally teach anthropology
   in either of the branches of physiology or psychology, as a department
   of human science, but it assumes a great deal that falls under these
   several heads. It assumes that soul and body in man are two distinct
   substances united in a vital union so as to constitute the man, in the
   present state of existence, one individual person. It assumes that the
   seat of this personality is the soul. The soul is the self, the Ego, of
   which the body is the organ. It assumes that the soul continues its
   conscious existence, and its power of acting and of being acted upon
   after its separation from the body. This we have seen to be the
   doctrine of the whole Bible. The dead, according to the Scriptures, do
   not cease to be; they do not cease to be conscious and active.

   There is, therefore, nothing in the psychology of the Scriptures, which
   is that of the vast majority of men, learned or unlearned, inconsistent
   with the doctrine that the souls of believers do, at death, immediately
   pass into glory.

   2. According to the Scriptures and the faith of the Church, the
   probation of man ends at death. As the tree falls, so it lies. He that
   is unjust let him be unjust still, and he that is righteous let him be
   righteous still. When the bridegroom comes, they that are ready enter
   in, and the door is shut. According to the parable of the rich man and
   Lazarus, there is no passing after death from one state to another;
   there is a great gulf between the righteous and the wicked from that
   time for evermore. It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after
   that the judgment The destiny of the soul is decided at death.

   3. There is no satisfaction to be rendered in the future life for the
   sins done in the body. The Romish doctrine of satisfactions renders
   necessary the assumption of a purgatorial state after death for those
   who have not in this life made full expiation for their sins. But if
   the one offering of Christ forever perfects them that believe; if his
   sacrifice be a perfect satisfaction for our sins, then there is no
   reason why believers should be kept out of blessedness until they have
   expiated their sins by their own sufferings.

   4. There is nothing contrary to Scripture, or to analogy, in the
   assumption of a sudden and immediate change from imperfect to perfect
   holiness. The Protestant doctrine is that the souls of believers are at
   death made perfect in holiness. But it is asked, what sanctifying power
   is there in death? Progress in moral excellence is gradual; as no one
   becomes thoroughly evil by one act, or in a moment, so, it is said, it
   is unreasonable to suppose that a sudden change from imperfect to
   perfect moral excellence takes place at the moment of death. This
   objection supposes that the salvation of men is a natural process; if
   it be a supernatural work, the objection has no force. Curing a man of
   leprosy was a slow process; but when Christ said to the leper "I will
   be thou clean." he was healed in a moment. The change which takes place
   in a believer at death, can hardly be much greater than that
   instantaneously produced in Paul on his journey to Damascus. Paul, in
   Galatians i. 16, attributes that change to the revelation of the Son of
   God to him. If the momentary vision of the divine glory of Christ
   produced such an effect upon the Apostle, is it strange that the
   Scriptures should teach that the souls of believers, when separated
   from the world and the flesh, and redeemed from the power of the devil,
   and bathed in the full brightness of the glory of the blessed Redeemer,
   should in a moment be purified from all sin?

   If, therefore, there be nothing in the nature of the soul inconsistent
   with its separate existence; if the body be not a necessary condition
   of its consciousness or activity; if its probation terminates at death;
   if the perfection of Christ's work precludes all necessity of future
   satisfaction for sin; and if the immediate change from imperfect to
   perfect holiness be consistent with the analogy of faith, then there is
   no à prioriobjection to the doctrine that the souls of believers at
   death do immediately pass into glory.

   5. That such is the doctrine of Scripture may be argued from the
   general drift of the sacred volume, so far as this subject is
   concerned. The Bible constantly speaks of the present life as a state
   of conflict, of labour, and of suffering; and of death as the entrance
   into rest. There remains a rest for the people of God. That rest
   follows the state of labour and trial. Believers then cease from their
   works. The rest on which they enter is not merely a rest from conflict
   and sin, but a rest which arises from the attainment of the end of
   their being, from their restoration to their proper relation to God,
   and all their capacities being satisfied and filled.

   6. Besides these general considerations the doctrine in question is
   taught in many passages of Scripture with more or less distinctness.
   Thus, in Revelation xiv. 13, the Apostle says, "I heard a voice from
   heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the
   Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from
   their labours; and their works do follow them." The simple meaning of
   this passage is that those who die in the Lord are, from that moment
   onward, in a state of blessednesss; because they cease from their
   labours, and enter on the reward of the righteous. Death is for them
   emancipation from evil, and the introduction into a state of happiness.

   Our Lord constantly teaches concerning those who believe in Him, (1.)
   That they are not condemned. They are no longer under the sentence of
   the law. (2.) That they have eternal life. That the effect of the union
   between Himself and them, consummated by faith, is that they partake of
   his life in a sense analogous to that in which the branch partakes of
   the life of the vine. As He lives always, those who partake of his life
   can never perish. And as He lives unto God, so the life of his people
   is a holy and divine life. That life, from its nature, is an unfailing
   source of blessedness. It purifies, exalts, and glorifies. It is
   impossible that the souls in which Christ thus lives should remain is a
   state of misery and degradation, or in that dreamy state of existence
   in "the under-world" which so many of the fathers imagined to be the
   abode of the departed spirits of believers, awaiting the second coming
   of Christ. (3.) Our Lord promised that He would raise his people from
   the dead on the last day. It would seem, therefore, to be involved in
   the nature of the redemption of Christ, and of the union between Him
   and his people, that when absent from the body they are present with
   the Lord. It is inconceivable that with the Spirit of God dwelling in
   them, which is the Spirit of holiness and of glory, they should sink at
   death into a lower state of existence than that which they enjoyed in
   this world. We accordingly find that in the parable of the rich man and
   Lazarus, Christ says: "The beggar died, and was carried by the angels
   into Abraham's bosom." (Luke xvi. 22.) The implication is undeniable
   that in his case the transition was immediate from earth to heaven.
   Still more explicit is the declaration of our Lord to the penitent
   thief, "To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise." (Luke xxiii. 43.)
   The word paradise occurs in two other places in the New Testament. In 2
   Corinthians xii. 4, Paul says he was caught up into paradise, which he
   explains by saying that he was caught up into the third heaven. And in
   Revelation ii. 7, Christ says: "He that hath an ear, let him hear what
   the Spirit saith unto the churches: To him that overcometh will I give
   to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of
   God." There can, therefore, be no doubt that paradise is heaven, and
   consequently when Christ promised the dying thief that he should that
   day be in paradise, he promised that he should be in heaven. It would,
   therefore, seem impossible that any who do not rest their faith on the
   fathers rather than on the Bible, should deny that the souls of
   believers do at death immediately pass into heaven. The fathers made a
   distinction between paradise and heaven which is not found in the
   Scriptures. Some of them regarded the former as one division of Hades,
   corresponding to the Elysium of the pagans; others located it somewhere
   on the earth, while others regarded it as a locality high up above the
   earth, but below the dwelling-place of God. These are mere fancies. The
   word heaven is indeed a term of wide application in the Bible as it is
   in common life. We speak of the fowls of heaven; of the stars of
   heaven; of our Father who is in heaven; and of believers being the
   citizens of heaven. In each of these cases the word has a different
   sense. Whether paradise and heaven are the same is a mere dispute about
   words. If the word heaven be taken in one of its legitimate senses,
   they are the same; if it be taken in another of its senses, they are
   not the same. It would not be in accordance with Scriptural usage to
   say that believers are now in, paradise; but the Apostle does say they
   are now en tois epouraniois (Eph. ii. 6), i.e., in heaven. Paradise, as
   the word is used by Christ and his Apostles, is the place where Christ
   now is, and where He manifests his presence and glory. Whether it is
   the place where He will finally establish his kingdom; and whether all
   the redeemed, clothed in their resurrection bodies, shall there be
   gathered together, is a matter of which we have no knowledge, and in
   which we need take no interest. All we need know is that it is where
   Christ is; that it is a place and state in which there is neither sin
   nor sorrow, and where the saints are as exalted and happy as, in the
   existing circumstances of their being, it is possible for them to be.
   Whether any, in obedience to patristic usage, choose to call this
   paradise a department of Hades, is a matter of no concern. All that the
   dying believer need know is that he goes to be with Christ. That to him
   is heaven.

   In 2 Corinthians v. 2, the Apostle says: "We know, that if our earthly
   house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an
   house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." There are three
   ways in which these words, in connection with those which follow, are
   interpreted. (1.) According to one view, the house not made with hands
   into which the believer is received at death, is heaven. (2.) According
   to another view the meaning of the Apostle is, that when our present
   body is dissolved the soul will not be found naked, but will be
   immediately clothed with another and more spiritual body suited to the
   altered state of its existence. (3.) That the new house or body
   intended is the resurrection body. The second of these interpretations
   is founded on a gratuitous assumption. It assumes that the soul is
   furnished with a body of which the Scriptures make no mention, and of
   the existence of which we have no evidence. The Bible knows nothing of
   any human body save that which we now have, and that which we are to
   have at the resurrection; the one natural, the other spiritual. The
   third interpretation assumes that the Apostles erred not only in their
   own convictions, but in their teaching. It assumes that what they
   taught could be true only on the condition that the second coming of
   Christ was to occur while the men of that generation were alive. The
   point, however, in which all these views of this passage agree, is the
   only one which concerns the question under consideration. They all
   suppose that the soul is received into a state of blessedness
   immediately after death. This the Apostle clearly teaches. As soon as
   our earthly house is destroyed, the soul, instead of being left
   houseless and homeless, is received in that house which is eternal in
   the heavens. "We are always confident," he says, "knowing that, whilst
   we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: we are
   confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to
   be present with the Lord."

   In Philippians i. 23, he expresses the same confidence: "For," he says,
   "I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be
   with Christ; which is far better: nevertheless, to abide in the flesh
   is more needful for you." Two things are here perfectly plain; first,
   that Paul regards the state of the soul after death as more exalted
   than its condition while in the flesh. This he distinctly asserts. And,
   secondly, that this change for the better takes place immediately after
   death. He was confident that as soon as he departed he would be with
   Christ. Both these points are conceded, even by those who deny the
   doctrine which they evidently involve. Some say that Paul, finding that
   Christ did not come as soon as he expected, changed his opinion, and
   held that the souls of believers were admitted at death into heaven,
   instead of awaiting the second advent in the underworld. The fathers
   said that while the great body of believers at death went into Hades,
   some few, especially the martyrs, were admitted at once into heaven.
   Mr. Alger conjectures that "we may assume . . . . that Paul believed
   there would be vouchsafed to the faithful Christian during his
   transient abode in the under world a more intimate and blessed
   spiritual fellowship with his Master than he could experience while in
   the flesh." [756] All this is floundering. The simple fact is that the
   inspired Apostle confidently anticipated for himself, and evidently for
   his fellow-believers, immediate admission at death to the presence of
   Christ. The ancients regarded the "under-world" or Hades, as "a gloomy
   prison," as Mr. Alger himself calls it. That Paul should have desired
   death in order that he should be thrust into a dungeon, no man can
   believe.

   The Scriptures represent Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as being in heaven.
   The good, at death, are carried by angels to Abraham's bosom. Moses and
   Elijah appeared in glory on the mount of transfiguration, conversing
   with Christ. In the Epistle to the Hebrews, it is said, "Ye are come
   unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
   Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general
   assembly and church of the first born, which are written in heaven, and
   to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,
   and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of
   sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel." Nothing can
   be more utterly inconsistent with the nature of the Gospel, than the
   idea that the fire of divine life as it glows in the hearts of God's
   elect, is, at death, to be quenched in the damp darkness of an
   underground prison, until the time of the resurrection.

   § 2. The Sleep of the Soul.

   The doctrine that the soul exists, during the interval between death
   and the resurrection, in a state of unconscious repose, properly
   supposes the soul to be a distinct substance from the body. It is
   therefore to be distinguished from the materialistic theory, which
   assumes that as matter in certain states and combinations exhibits the
   phenomena of magnetism or light, so in other combinations it exhibits
   the phenomena of life, and in others the phenomena of mind, and hence
   that vital and mental activity are as much the result or effect of the
   molecular arrangements of matter, as any physical operations in the
   external world. As in this view it would be absurd to speak of the
   sleep or quietude of magnetism or light when the conditions of their
   existence are absent, so it would be equally absurd, on this theory, to
   speak of the sleep of the soul after the dissolution of the body.

   The doctrine of the sleep of the soul, moreover, is not identical with
   that which assumes that, although matter is in none of its combinations
   the cause of mental activity, yet that it is the necessary condition
   (so far as man is concerned) of its manifestation. The best of
   scientific men teach with regard to life, or vital force, that it is
   not the result of material combinations, but that such combination is
   necessary to its manifestation. "We recognize that these [vital]
   phenomena," says Professor Nicholson, "are never manifested except by
   certain forms of matter, or, it may be, by but a single form of matter.
   We conclude, therefore, that there must be an intimate connection
   between vital phenomena and the matter of life;' but we can go no
   further than this, and the premises do not in any way warrant the
   assertion that life is the result of living matter, or one of its
   properties." "The more philosophical view as to the nature of the
   connection between life and its material basis, is the one which
   regards vitality as something superadded and foreign to the matter by
   which vital phenomena are manifested. Protoplasm is essential as the
   physical medium through which vital action may be manifested; just as a
   conductor is essential to the manifestation of electric phenomena, or
   just as a paint-brush and colours are essential to the artist. Because
   metal conducts the electric current, and renders it perceptible to our
   senses, no one thinks of therefore asserting that electricity is one of
   the inherent properties of a metal, any more than one would feel
   inclined to assert that the power of painting was inherent in the
   camel's hair or in the dead pigments. Behind the material substratum,
   in all cases, is the active and living force; and we have no right to
   assume that the force ceases to exist when its physical basis is
   removed, though it is no longer perceptible to our senses. It is, on
   the contrary, quite conceivable theoretically that the vital forces of
   an organism should suffer no change by the destruction of the physical
   basis, just as electricity would continue to subsist in a world
   composed universally of non-conductors. In neither case could the force
   manifest its presence, or be brought into any perceptible relation with
   the outer world; but in neither case should we have the smallest ground
   for assuming that the power was necessarily non-extant." [757]

   This view when transferred to the soul, or mental phenomena, may be
   applied in three different forms to the doctrine of the state of man
   after death. First, God may be regarded as the universal mind-force
   which manifests itself through the human brain as electricity does
   through a conductor. When the brain is disintegrated, the mind-force
   remains, but not the individual man. Secondly, we may assume the
   realistic doctrine of generic humanity, manifesting itself in
   connection with proper corporeal organizations. Here again, it would
   seem to follow that when any individual human body is dissolved, the
   generic human life remains, but not the man. This is nearly the
   doctrine of Olshausen, before referred to. He held that the
   individuality of man depends on the body; so that without a body there
   can be no soul; that the only existence of the soul of man possible
   between death and the resurrection must be the scattered dust of its
   human frame. Thirdly, we may take the doctrine of Swedenborg, who
   taught that man has two bodies, an exterior and interior, a material
   and spiritual, and that it is the former only that dies; the latter
   remains as the organ of the soul. Or, as others believe, the new, or
   spiritual, or resurrection body is provided at the moment of death, so
   that the soul passes from ifs earthly to its heavenly tabernacle in a
   moment. In none of these forms, however, is this theory of the absolute
   dependence of the soul for its power of self-manifestation properly
   applicable to the doctrine of the sleep of the soul after death. It is
   nevertheless probable that those who advocated this doctrine, in
   different periods in the history of the Church, had some such theory
   underlying their views.

   Eusebius [758] mentions a small sect of Christians in Arabia who held
   that the soul remained unconscious from death to the resurrection. At
   the time of the Reformation there was such a revival of that doctrine
   that Calvin deemed it expedient to write an essay devoted to its
   refutation. Socinus also taught that the soul after death perceived and
   received nothing out of itself, although it remained self-conscious and
   self-contemplative. Archbishop Whately [759] says that, so far as the
   Scriptures are concerned, it is an open question whether the soul
   remains in a conscious state after death or not. In the third lecture
   he gives reasons which favour the view of continued consciousness; and
   in the fourth, those which seem to teach the opposite doctrine. To the
   understanding, he says, there is no difference between the two views;
   although to the imagination, the difference is great. In the
   consciousness of the soul of the believer, in either case, entrance
   into heaven would instantaneously succeed death. An interval of which
   the soul was unconscious, would, for it, have no existence. The
   archbishop for himself thinks that the arguments on the one side are as
   strong as those on the other. The two considerations which seem to him
   to favour the doctrine of the sleep of the soul between death and the
   resurrection, are, first the fact that death is so often called a
   sleep. The dead are those who are asleep. (1 Thess. xiv. 4.) This
   expression cannot properly be understood of the body. A dead body can
   no more be said to sleep than a stone. The fair intimation, therefore,
   is, as the Archbishop thinks, that the soul sleeps when the body dies.
   The second consideration is that the New Testament clearly teaches that
   there is a solemn final judgment at the last day, when the destiny of
   each soul will be decided for eternity. But this appears inconsistent
   with the doctrine that the fate of the soul is decided immediately
   after it leaves the body. He admits that, according to the Scriptures,
   probation ends with this life, and therefore if the righteous at death
   pass into a state of happiness and the wicked into a state of misery,
   they are thereby judged; and there is no apparent necessity for a
   future judgment. It is obvious that these arguments have little force
   against the clear teachings of the Bible, and the faith of the Church
   universal, and indeed of all mankind. As to the first of the above
   mentioned arguments, it is enough to say, that as a dead body and a
   body asleep are so much alike in appearance, it is the most natural
   thing in the world to speak of death as an unending sleep. This is done
   continually by those who are firm believers in the continued conscious
   activity of the soul after death. The other argument has, if possible,
   still less weight. Although the fate of every man should be decided for
   himself and to his knowledge at the moment of death, there may be
   important and numerous reasons why there should be a public, solemn
   adjudication at the last day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be
   made known, and the justice of God revealed in the presence of men and
   angels.

   § 3. Patristic Doctrine of the Intermediate State.

   Although the true doctrine concerning the state of the dead was, as has
   been shown, revealed in the Old Testament, it was more or less
   perverted in the minds of the people. The prevalent idea was that all
   souls after death descended into Sheol, and there remained in
   expectation of the coming of the Messiah. When He came it was expected
   that the Jews, or at least, the faithful, would be raised from the
   dead, and made partakers of all the glories and blessedness of the
   Messiah's reign. The views presented in the writings of the Rabbins of
   the condition of the souls in Sheol are not only diverse but
   inconsistent. The common representation was that Sheol itself was a
   gloomy, subterraneous abode, whose inhabitants were shades, weak and
   powerless, existing in a dreamy state; the best of them not in a state
   of suffering, and yet with no other enjoyment than the anticipation of
   deliverance when the Messiah should come. At other times, however, more
   life was attributed to the souls of the departed; and Sheol was
   represented as divided into two departments, Paradise and Gehenna. In
   the former were, according to some, all Jews, according to others only
   those who had faithfully observed the law; and in the other, the
   Gentiles. The common opinion was that all the Jews would be raised from
   the dead, when the Messiah came, and all the Gentiles left forever in
   the abode of darkness. Paradise, according to this view, was a place of
   positive enjoyment, and Gehenna a place of positive suffering. It is
   evident that there is no great difference between this Jewish doctrine
   in its essential features, and the true doctrine as presented by our
   Lord in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus. Both are represented
   as going into Sheol or Hades. The one was comforted, the other
   tormented. There was an inseparable barrier between the two. So far
   both doctrines agree. When the Rabbi Jochanan was dying, he said, "Two
   paths open before me, the one leading to bliss, the other to torments;
   and I know not which of them will be my doom." [760] "Paradise is
   separated from hell by a distance no greater than the width of a
   thread." [761]

   According to many modern interpreters the New Testament writers adopted
   this Jewish doctrine not only in substance but in its details. (1.)
   They are represented as teaching that all the people of God who died
   before the advent of Christ, were confined in Sheol, or the
   under-world. Sheol or Hades, as stated above, is constantly spoken of
   "as the gloomy realm of shades, wherein are gathered and detained the
   souls of all the dead generations." The soul at death is said to be
   dismissed "naked into the silent, dark, and dreary region of the
   under-world." (2.) That when Christ died upon the cross, He descended
   "ad inferos," into Hades, or Hell, for the purpose of delivering the
   pious dead from their prison; and that they were the redeemed captives
   of whom the Apostle speaks in Ephesians iv. 8-l0, as led by Christ into
   heaven. (3.) That those who die in the Lord since his advent, instead
   of being admitted into heaven, pass into the same place and the same
   state into which the patriarch passed at death before his coming. (4.)
   And as the Old Testament saints remained in Sheol until the first
   coming of the Messiah, so those who die under the New Testament, are to
   remain in Hades, until his second coming. Then they are not only to be
   delivered from Sheol, but their bodies are to be raised from the dead,
   and soul and body, reunited and glorified, are to be admitted into
   heaven.

   Such is the scheme of doctrine said to be taught in the New Testament.
   Our Lord is regarded as giving it his sanction in the parable
   concerning Lazarus. Paul is made to teach it when he speaks of Christ
   as descending to "the lower parts of the earth," which is said to mean
   "the parts lower than the earth," that is, the under-world. His object
   in thus descending was, according to the theory, to deliver the souls
   confined in the gloomy prison of Sheol. Christ's triumph over
   principalities and powers is referred to the same event, his descent
   into Hades. Mr. Alger, representing a large class of writers, says that
   according to Paul's doctrine, "Christ was the first person clothed with
   humanity and experiencing death, admitted into heaven. Of all the hosts
   who had lived and died, every one had gone down into the dusky
   under-world. They were all held in durance waiting for the Great
   Deliverer." [762] The fate of those who die since the advent is no
   better, for they, as Paul is made to teach, are "all to remain in the
   under-world" until the second coming of Christ, "when they and the
   transformed living shall ascend together with the Lord." [763]

   St. Peter is made to teach the same doctrine in still more explicit
   terms. In his discourse delivered on the day of Pentecost, he argued
   that Jesus is the Christ from the fact that God raised Him from the
   dead. That He was thus raised he argued from the sixteenth Psalm, where
   it is written, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou
   suffer thine Holy One to see corruption." That these words cannot refer
   to David, Peter argued, because he did see corruption, and his
   sepulchre remained until that day. The words of the Psalmist,
   therefore, must be understood of Christ, whose soul was not left in
   hell (Sheol), neither did his flesh see corruption. As for David, he
   "is not ascended into heaven." (Acts ii. 34.) Something, therefore,
   happened to Christ that did not happen to David or to any other man.
   Christ was not left in hell; David and all other men were thus left.
   Christ did ascend to heaven; David did not; and if David did not, then
   other saints of his time did not. Thus it is that Peter is made to
   teach that the souls of the pious dead do not ascend to heaven, but
   descend to the gloomy abode of Sheol, Hades, or Hell, all these terms
   being equivalent. This exposition of the Apostle's teaching is
   plausible, and if consistent with other parts of Scripture, might be
   accepted. But as it contradicts what the Bible clearly teaches in many
   other places, it must be rejected. Peter's object was to prove the
   Messiahship of Christ from the fact of the resurrection of his body.
   The essential idea of "rising from the dead" was the restoration of the
   body to life. The soul does not die, and is not raised. The Apostle
   proved that Christ's body did not see corruption, but was restored to
   life; first, because it was a historical fact of which he and his
   brethren were witnesses; and secondly, from the prediction of the
   Psalmist that the Messiah was not to remain in the grave. That the
   sixteenth Psalm does not refer to David, he argued, because David died
   and was buried; his body did see corruption; his sepulchre remained
   among them; he, his body, he, as a man composed of soul and body, had
   not ascended to heaven. The whole argument concerns the body; because
   it is true only of the body, that it dies, is buried, sees corruption,
   and does not ascend to heaven. The simple meaning of Psalm xvi. 10, is
   that the person there spoken of was not to remain under the power of
   death. He was to rise from the dead before his body had time to see
   corruption. This is all that the passage teaches. This is true of
   Christ; it was not true of David or of any of the saints who died
   before the advent; and it is not true of those who have died since the
   advent. In this respect, as in so many others, Christ stands gloriously
   alone.

   The difficult passage 1 Peter iii. 18, 19, however it may be
   interpreted, proves nothing against the Protestant doctrine that the
   souls of believers do at death immediately pass into glory. What
   happens to ordinary men happened to Christ when He died. His cold and
   lifeless body was laid in the tomb. His human soul passed into the
   invisible world. This is all that the creed, commonly called the
   Apostles', means, when it says Christ was buried, and descended into
   Hell, or Hades, the unseen world. This is all that the passage in
   question clearly teaches. Men may doubt and differ as to what Christ
   did during the three days of his sojourn in the invisible world. They
   may differ as to who the spirits in prison were to whom he preached,
   or, rather, made proclamation (ekeruxen); whether they were the
   antediluvians; or, the souls of the people of God detained in Sheol;
   or, the mass of the dead of all antecedent generations and of all
   nations, which is the favorite hypothesis of modern interpreters. They
   may differ also as to what the proclamation was which Christ made to
   those imprisoned spirits; whether it was the gospel; or his own
   triumph; or deliverance from Sheol; or the coming judgment. However
   these subordinate questions may be decided, all that remains certain is
   that Christ, after his death upon the cross, entered the invisible
   world, and there, in some way, made proclamation of what He had done on
   earth. All this is very far from teaching the doctrine of a "Limbus
   Patrum," as taught by the Jews, the Fathers, or the Romanists.

   It is a great mistake in interpretation of the New Testament, to bring
   down its teachings to the level of Jewish or Pagan ideas. Because the
   Jews expected the Messiah to establish an earthly kingdom, it is
   inferred that the kingdom of God, as proclaimed by Christ and his
   Apostles, was to be realized in this life. Because they expected that
   the Messiah was to deliver the souls of their fathers from Sheol, it is
   assumed that this was the work actually effected by Christ. Because the
   Jews regarded imprisonment in the under-world as the special penalty of
   sin, it is inferred that deliverance from that imprisonment was the
   redemption our Lord actually effected. This is to interpret the
   Scriptures by the Talmud and Cabala, and not Scripture by Scripture.
   This is historical interpretation "en oûtre." It is true that Christ
   proclaimed that the kingdom of God was at hand; but his kingdom was not
   of this world. It is true that He came to open the prison doors and
   proclaim liberty to the captives; but his prison was not Sheol, and the
   captives were not the souls of departed patriarchs. It is true that He
   came to redeem his people; but the redemption which He effected was
   from the curse of God's violated law, and not deliverance from the
   gloomy land of Shades.

   We all know that the great evil with which the Apostles had to contend
   in the early Church, and the great source of corruption in the Church
   in after ages, was a Judaizing spirit. Most of the early Christians
   were Jews, and most of the converts from the Gentiles were proselytes
   imbued with Jewish doctrines. These doctrines, moreover, were congenial
   with what the Apostle calls "the carnal mind." It is not wonderful,
   therefore, that they were transferred to the Christian Church, and
   proved in it a permanently corrupting leaven. Modern critics are going
   back to the beginning, and doing in our day what the Judaizers did in
   the age of the Apostles. They are eliminating Christianity from the
   Gospel, and substituting Judaism, somewhat spiritualized, but still
   essentially Judaic.

   It is notorious that the Jewish doctrines of the merit of works; of the
   necessity and saving efficacy of external rites; of a visible kingdom
   of Christ of splendour and worldly grandeur; of an external church out
   of whose pale there is no salvation; of the priestly character of the
   ministry; and of a church hierarchy, soon began to spread among
   Christians, and at last became ascendant. This being the case it would
   be strange if the Jewish doctrine of Sheol, or of an intermediate
   state, had not been adopted by many of the fathers, together with the
   other elements of the corrupt Judaism of the apostolic age. We
   accordingly find that as the Jews, contrary to the teaching of their
   own Scripture, held that the souls of those who died before the coming
   of the Messiah descended into Sheol, and there awaited the advent of
   the Redeemer, so the Christians began to believe, contrary to the
   teaching of their Scriptures, that the souls of believers at death,
   instead of passing into glory, are shut up in Hades, awaiting the
   second coming of Christ. It is true there were varying and inconsistent
   notions entertained of the nature of this intermediate state; and the
   same is true also with regard to the views on this subject which long
   prevailed in the Church. There are two facts which stand out so plainly
   in the New Testament Scriptures that they could not be always
   overlooked or denied. The one is that Christ, forty days after his
   resurrection, ascended into heaven, and is now seated at the right hand
   of the Majesty on high. The other is that the souls of believers when
   absent from the body are present with the Lord. As many of the Jews,
   therefore, assumed that in Sheol there were two departments, Paradise
   and Gehenna, the one the abode of the righteous, the other of the
   wicked; so the Christians, in many cases, made the same distinction
   with regard to the intermediate state; the souls of believers went to
   paradise; the souls of the wicked into hell. And they often so exalted
   the blessedness of the former as to make it a mere dispute about words
   whether they went to heaven or into an intermediate state. The real
   controversy. so far as any exists, is not as to whether there is a
   state intermediate between death and the resurrection in which
   believers are less glorious and exalted than they are to be after the
   second advent of Christ, but what is the nature of that state. Are
   believers after death with Christ? Do their souls immediately pass into
   glory? or, are they in a dreamy, semi-conscious state, neither happy
   nor miserable, awaiting the resurrection of the body. That this latter
   view was for a long time prevalent in the Church may be inferred, (1.)
   From the fact that this was the view of the intermediate state commonly
   adopted by the Jews. (2.) It is the view attributed to the writers of
   the New Testament. (3.) It is the doctrine avowed by many of the
   patristic and mediæval writers. (4.) There would otherwise be no ground
   for the opposition manifested to the doctrine of Protestants on this
   subject. Daillé says, "The doctrine that heaven shall not be opened
   till the second coming of Christ, -- that during that time the souls of
   all men, with few exceptions, are shut up in the under-world, -- was
   held by Justin Martyr, Irenæus, Tertullian, Augustine, Origen,
   Lactantius Victorinus, Ambrose, Chrysostom, Theodoret, OEcomenius,
   Aretas, Prudentius, Theophylact, Bernard, and many others, as is
   confessed by all. . . . . This doctrine is literally held by the whole
   Greek Church at the present day; nor did any of the Latins expressly
   deny any part of it until the Council of Florence, in the year of our
   Lord 1439." [764]

   Flügge [765] says in reference to the early fathers, that they "were
   not in doubt as to the fate of the soul when separated from the body
   until the resurrection, because they rested on the Jewish doctrine on
   that subject." Justin Martyr speaks in this way: [766] [Phemi:] Tas men
   [psuchas] ton eusebon en kreittoni poi choro menein, tas de adikous kai
   poneras en cheironi, ton tes kriseos ekdechomenas chronon tote, that
   is, "I say, that the souls of the pious dwell in some better place, and
   ungodly and wicked souls in a worse place, thus awaitng the time of
   judgment."

   The fathers say but little about Hades. Hippolytus, however, gives an
   account of it which is in substance as follows: [767] Hades, in which
   the souls of the righteous and unrighteous are detained, was left at
   the creation in a state of chaos, to which the light of the sun never
   penetrates, but where perpetual darkness reigns. This place is the
   prison of souls, over which the angels keep watch. In Hades there is a
   furnace of unquenchable fire into which no one has yet been cast. It is
   reserved for the banishment of the wicked at the end of the world, when
   the righteous will be made citizens of an eternal kingdom. The good and
   the bad, although both in Hades, are not in the same part of it. They
   enter the under-world by the same gate. When this gate is passed, the
   guardian angels guide the souls of the departed different ways; the
   righteous are guided to the right to a region full of light; the wicked
   are constrained to take the left hand path, leading to a region near
   the unquenchable fire. The good are free from all discomfort, and
   rejoice in expectation of their admission into heaven. The wicked are
   miserable in constant anticipation of their coming doom. An impassable
   gulf separates the abode of the righteous from that of the wicked. Here
   they remain until the resurrection, which he goes on to explain and
   defend.

   Flügge admits that there was no uniformity of representation on this
   subject in the early Church. The same general idea, however, is
   constantly reproduced; the Latins agreeing substantially with the
   Greeks. Tertullian represents the under-world as the general receptacle
   of departed spirits who retain their consciousness and activity. In
   this unseen world there are two divisions, both called "Inferi." "Nobis
   inferi non nuda cavositas, nec subdivalis aliqua mundi sentina
   creduntur: sed in fossa terræ et in alto vastitas, et in ipsis
   visceribus ejus abstrusa profunditas." [768] In this region there are
   two divisions; the one called "infernum," by way of eminence, or
   Gehenna, "quæ est ignis arcani subterraneus ad poenam thesaurus;" the
   other is the bosom of Abraham or paradise, "divinæ amoenitatis
   recipiendis sanctorum spiritibus destinatum, materia [maceria] quadam
   igneæ illius zonæ a notitia orbis communis segregatum." [769] According
   to this mode of representation, the intermediate state was itself a
   state of reward and punishment; at other times, however, this was
   denied; all retribution being reserved to the day of judgment. In the
   early Greek Church, this latter view was the more prevalent; [770] but
   later both the Greeks and Latins agreed in regarding the state of the
   righteous after death as far more favourable than that of the wicked.

   The common views on this subject are perhaps fairly represented in the
   elaborate work of the Honourable Archibald Campbell, on "the doctrine
   of a middle state between death and the resurrection." [771] He thus
   sums up the points which he considers himself to have proved to be the
   doctrine of the Bible, of the Fathers, and of the Church of England.

   "First. That the souls of the dead do remain in an intermediate, or
   middle state between death and the resurrection."

   "That the proper place appointed for the abode of the righteous during
   the interim between death and the resurrection, called paradise, or
   Abram's bosom, is not the highest heavens where alone God is at
   present, fully to be enjoyed, but it is, however, a very happy place,
   one of the lower apartments or mansions of heaven, a place of
   purification and improvement, of rest and refreshment, and of divine
   contemplation. A place whence our Blessed Lord's humanity is sometimes
   to be seen, though clouded or veiled if compared with the glory He is
   to appear with, and be seen in, at, and after his second coming. Into
   which middle state and blessed place, as they are carried by the holy
   angels, whose happy fellowship they there enjoy; so afterward at the
   resurrection, after judgment, they are led into the beatific vision by
   the captain of our salvation, Jesus Christ Himself, where they shall
   see Him fully as He is, and there they shall enjoy God forever and
   ever, or sempiternally."

   The souls of the wicked at death do not go into hell, but into a middle
   state, "which state is dark, dismal, and uncomfortable, without light,
   rest, or any manner of refreshment, without any company but that of
   devils and such impure souls as themselves to converse with, and where
   these miserable souls are in dismal apprehensions of the deserved wrath
   of God."

   "Secondly, That there is no immediate judgment after death, no trial on
   which sentence is pronounced, of neither the righteous nor the wicked,
   until Christ's second coming. And that, therefore, none of any age or
   class from the beginning of the world to the glorious appearing of our
   blessed Saviour at his second coming, are excepted from continuing in
   their proper middle state, from their death until their resurrection,
   whether they be patriarchs, prophets, Apostles, or martyrs."

   "Thirdly, That the righteous in their happy middle state, do improve in
   holiness, and make advances in perfection, and yet they are not for all
   that carried out of that middle state into glory, or into the beatific
   vision, until after their resurrection."

   "Fourthly, That prayers for those who are baptized according to
   Christ's appointment, and who die in the pale and peace of his Church,
   which the ancients called dying with the sign of faith, I say that
   prayers for such are acceptable to God as being fruits of our ardent
   charity, and are useful both to them and to us, and are too ancient to
   be popish."

   "Lastly, That this doctrine for an intermediate state between death and
   the resurrection, as I have proved it, does effectually destroy the
   popish purgatory, invocation of the saints departed, popish penances,
   commutations of those penances, their indulgences, and treasures of
   merits purchased by supererogation."

   As an example of the prayers for the dead he gives the following
   extract from the Office to be used at the Burial of the Dead in the
   first Liturgy of King Edward the Sixth: [772] "O Lord, with whom do
   live the spirits of them that be dead, and in whom the souls of them
   that be elected, after they be delivered from the burden of the flesh
   be in joy and felicity; grant unto this thy servant that the sins which
   he committed in this world be not imputed unto him, but that he,
   escaping the gates of hell and pains of eternal darkness, may ever
   dwell in the region of light, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the
   place where is no weeping, sorrow, nor heaviness; and when that
   dreadful day of the general resurrection shall come, make him to rise
   also with the just and righteous, and receive this body again to glory,
   then made pure and incorruptible."

   Jeremy Taylor, bishop of Down and Connor, says: [773] Paradise is
   distinguished from the heaven of the blessed; being itself a receptacle
   of holy souls, made illustrous with visitation of angels, and happy by
   being a repository for such spirits, who, at the day of judgment, shall
   go forth into eternal glory."

   Again, he says: [774] "I have now made it as evident as questions of
   this nature will bear, that in the state of separation, the spirits of
   good men shall be blessed and happy souls, -- they have an antepast or
   taste of their reward; but their great reward itself, their crown of
   righteousness, shall not be yet; that shall not be until the day of
   judgment. . . . . This is the doctrine of the Greek Church unto this
   day, and was the opinion of the greatest part of the ancient Church
   both Latin and Greek; and by degrees was, in the west, eaten out by the
   doctrine of purgatory and invocation of saints; and rejected a little
   above two hundred years ago, in the Council of Florence."

   It appears, therefore, that there is little difference between the
   advocates of an intermediate state and those who are regarded as
   rejecting that doctrine. Both admit, (1.) That the souls of believers
   do at death pass into a state of blessedness. (2.) That they remain in
   that state until the resurrection. (3.) That at the second coming of
   Christ, when the souls of the righteous are to be clothed with their
   glorified bodies, they will be greatly exalted and raised to a higher
   state of being. Bishop Hickes in his highly commendatory review of the
   work of the Honourable Archibald Campbell just referred to, which is
   appended to that volume, although he lays great stress on the doctrine
   in question, says that those who call the state into which the
   righteous enter, heaven; and that into which the wicked are introduced
   when they die, hell, may continue to do so, provided they mean by
   heaven a state which is less perfect than that which awaits them after
   the coming of Christ; and by hell, a condition less miserable than that
   which will be assigned to the wicked.

   The Church of England agrees with other Protestant churches in its
   teachings on this subject. In the Liturgy of Edward VI. just quoted, it
   is said, (1.) That the spirits of all the dead live after the
   dissolution of the body. (2.) That the righteous are with God in a
   state of joy and felicity. (3.) That they have escaped the gates of
   hell and the pains of eternal darkness into which, as is necessarily
   implied, the souls of those who die unreconciled to God immediately
   enter. All the members of that Church are taught to say daily: "The
   glorious company of the Apostles praise thee. The goodly fellowship of
   the Prophets praise thee. The noble army of Martyrs praise thee."
   These, therefore, are all with God, and engaged in his service. In one
   of the prayers appointed to be used in the visitation of the sick,
   these words occur: "O Almighty God, with whom do live the souls of just
   men made perfect, after they are delivered from their earthly prisons."
   The souls of the just, therefore, are made per fect when they are
   delivered from the body.

   § 4. Doctrine of the Church of Rome.

   Although Romanists reject the doctrine of an intermediate state in the
   sense of the ancient Church, they nevertheless divide the world into
   which the souls of men enter at death, into many different departments.

   The Limbus Patrum.

   They hold that the souls of the righteous before the coming of Christ
   descended into Sheol, where they remained in a state of expectancy
   awaiting the coming of the Messiah. When Christ came and had
   accomplished his work of redemption by dying upon the cross, He
   descended into Hades, or the under-world, where the souls of the
   patriarchs were confined, delivered them from their captivity, and
   carried them in triumph to heaven. In other words they hold the common
   Jewish doctrine as to the state of the dead, so far as the saints of
   the Old Testament period are concerned. Their views on that subject
   have an intimate relation, whether causal or inferential is uncertain
   and unimportant, with their doctrine of the sacraments. Holding, first,
   that the sacraments are the only channels by which the saving blessings
   of redemption are conveyed to men; and, secondly, that the sacraments
   of the Old Testament signified but did not communicate grace, they
   could not avoid the conclusion that those who died before the coming of
   Christ were not saved. The best that could be hoped concerning them was
   that they were not lost, but retained in a salvable state awaiting the
   coming deliverer. Whether they inferred that the Old Testament saints
   were not saved because they had no grace-bearing sacraments, or
   concluded that their sacraments were ineffectual, because those who had
   no others were not saved, it is not easy to determine. The latter is
   the more probable; as most naturally they received the doctrine of
   Sheol from the Jews, as they did so many other doctrines; and being led
   to believe that the patriarchs were not in heaven, they could not avoid
   the conclusion that circumcision and the passover were very far
   inferior in efficacy to the Christian sacraments.

   The Limbus Infantum.

   This is the name given to the place and state pertaining to the
   departed souls of unbaptized infants. As this class includes, perhaps,
   a moiety of the whole human race, their destiny in the future world is
   a matter of the deepest interest. The doctrine of the Church of Rome on
   this subject is that infants dying without baptism are not at death, or
   ever after it, admitted into the kingdom of heaven. They never partake
   of the benefits of redemption. This doctrine is explicitly stated in
   the symbols of that Church, and defended by its theologians. Cardinal
   Gousset, for example, says that original sin, of which all the children
   of Adam are partakers, is the death of the soul. Its consequences in
   this life are ignorance or obscuration of the understanding, feebleness
   of the will which can do nothing spiritually good without the
   assistance of divine grace, concupiscence or revolt of our lower
   nature, infirmities, sorrow, and the death of the body. Its
   consequences in the life to come are exclusion from the kingdom of
   heaven, privation of life eternal, of the beatific vision; "no one can
   enter into the kingdom of God unless he be born again in Jesus Christ
   by baptism; Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot
   enter into the kingdom of God.' This is what faith teaches, but it goes
   no further. The Church leaves to the discussions of the schools the
   different opinions of theologians touching the fate of those who are
   excluded from the kingdom of heaven on account of original sin;
   infants, for example, who die without having received the sacrament of
   baptism." [775]

   Perrone speaking on this subject says, "We must distinguish the certain
   from the uncertain. What is certain, yea, a matter of faith, we have
   from the decisions of the Second Council of Lyons and the Council of
   Florence, both of which declare concerning infants and idiots: Credimus
   . . . . illorum animas, qui in mortali peccato vel cum solo originali
   decedunt, mox in infernum descendere, poenis tamen disparibus
   puniendas.' Ita quidem Florentinum in decreto Unionis,' quod descripsit
   verba Lugdunensis in fidei professione. De fide igitur est, (1.)
   parvulos ejusmodi in infernum descendere seu damnationem incurrere;
   (2.) poenis puniri disparibus ab illis quibus puniuntur adulti. Quæ
   proinde spectant ad hunc inferni locum, ad poenarum disparitatem, seu
   in quo hæc disparitas constituenda sit, ad parvulorum statum post
   judicii diem incerta sunt omnia, nec fidem attingunt. Hinc variæ de his
   sunt patrum ac theologorum sententiæ." [776] Perrone goes on to show
   that the Latin fathers represent infants as suffering "poenam sensus;"
   while most of Greek fathers say that they incur only "poenam damni," a
   sense of loss in being deprived of the blessedness of heaven. What that
   involves, however, he says is much disputed among theologians.

   The Scriptural proof of this doctrine, as argued by Romanists is
   principally twofold; the first is derived from the doctrine of original
   sin. They admit that the sin of Adam brought guilt and spiritual death
   upon all mankind. Baptism is the only means appointed for the
   deliverance of men from these dreadful evils. Hence it follows that the
   unbaptized remain under this guilt and pollution. The second great
   argument is founded upon John iii. 5, "Except a man be born of water,
   and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." This
   Romanists understand as an explicit declaration that the unbaptized
   cannot be saved. On this, however, as on all other subjects, their main
   dependence is upon the decision of Councils and the testimony of the
   fathers. Besides the Councils of Lyons and Florence, both regarded as
   ecumenical by Romanists, appeal is made to the canons of the Council of
   Trent, "Si quis parvulos recentes ab uteris matrum baptizandos negat,
   etiam si a baptizatis parentibus orti; aut dicit in remissionem quidem
   peccatorum eos baptizari, sed nihil ex Adam trahere originalis peccati,
   quod regenerationis lavacro necesse sit expiari ad vitam æternam
   consequendam.. . . . . anathema sit." [777] The Synod of Carthage, A.
   D. 416, is also quoted, which decided: [778] "Quicunque negat, parvulos
   per baptismum Christi a perditione liberari, et salutem percipere
   posse; anathema sit." Although the councils declare that the souls of
   unbaptized infants descend immediately into hell, Cardinal Gousset
   remarks, it is to be remembered that there are many departments in
   hell. There was one for the impenitent who died before the coming of
   Christ, and another for the souls of the righteous who awaited the
   advent of the Messiah; so there is no reason for denying that there is
   still another for the souls of unbaptized infants. "We repeat," he
   says, [779] "that neither the Council of Florence nor that of Lyons
   pronounces on the nature of the punishment of those who die with only
   the guilt of original sin, except to show that they are forever
   excluded from the kingdom of heaven." We can, therefore, without going
   counter to the decisions of the Church, maintain the sentiment which
   exempts such unfortunates from the punishment of hell, and the rather
   because the opposite opinion is generally abandoned, and this
   abandonment is in accord with Pope Innocent III., who, distinguishing
   between the punishment of original and of actual sin, makes the latter
   to be the pain of eternal fire; the former, the simple loss of the
   beatific (or intuitive) vision: "Poena originalis peccati est carentia
   visionis Dei, actualis vero poena peccati est gehennæ perpetuæ
   cruciatus." [780] On the following page he says, "We will go still
   further, and say with St. Thomas, that although unbaptized infants are
   deprived forever of the happiness of the saints, they suffer neither
   sorrow nor sadness in consequence of that privation." It is a matter of
   rejoicing that the doctrine of Romanists on the condition of unbaptized
   infants in a future life has admitted of this amelioration, although it
   is hard to reconcile it with the decisions of councils which declare
   that the souls of such infants do at death immediately descend into
   hell, if that word be understood according to the sense in which it was
   generally used when those decisions were made. The current
   representations of the theologians of the Latin Church are against this
   modified form of the doctrine. The Council of Trent anathematizes those
   who say that baptism is not necessary for the expiation of original
   sin; as that of Carthage those who affirm that it does not save infants
   from perdition. Romanists, however, of our day, have the right to state
   their doctrine in their own way, and should not be charged with holding
   sentiments which they repudiate.

   Hell.

   Hell is defined by Romanists as the place or state in which the fallen
   angels and men who die in a state of mortal sin, or, as it is also
   expressed, of final impenitence, suffer forever the punishment of their
   sins.

   That the punishment of the wicked is unending they prove from the
   express declarations of Scripture, from the faith of the Church
   universal, and from the general belief of men. As to the nature of the
   sufferings of those who perish, they say they are those of loss; they
   are deprived of the favour, vision, and presence of God; and those "of
   sense," or of positive infliction. To this latter class are to be
   referred such sufferings as arise from wicked passions, from remorse
   and despair, as well as those which spring from the external
   circumstances in which the finally condemned are placed. Whether the
   unquenchable fire of which the Bible speaks, is to be understood
   literally or figuratively, is a question about which Romanists differ.
   Gousset proposes the question, and says that it is one on which the
   Church has given no decisions. "It is of faith," he says, "that the
   condemned shall be eternally deprived of the happiness of heaven, and
   that they shall be eternally tormented in hell; but it is not of faith
   that the fire which causes their suffering is material. Many doctors,
   whose opinion has not been condemned, think that as the worm which
   never dies' is a figurative expression, so also is the fire that is
   never quenched;' and that the fire means a pain analogous to that by
   fire rather than the real pain produced by fire. Nevertheless the idea
   that the fire spoken of is real material fire is so general among
   Catholics, that we do not venture to advance a contrary opinion." [781]

   Into this place and state of endless misery do pass, at death, all who
   die out of the pale of the Catholic Church; all the unbaptized (at
   least among adults); all schismatics; all heretics; all who die
   impenitent, or in a state of mortal sin, that is, sin the penalty of
   which is eternal death, which has not been remitted by priestly
   absolution.

   Heaven.

   Heaven, on the other hand, is the place and state of the blessed, where
   God is; where Christ is enthroned in majesty, and where are the angels
   and the spirits of the just made perfect. Those who enter heaven are in
   possession of the supreme good. "The happiness of the saints above is
   complete; they possess God, and in that possession they find perfect
   rest, and the enjoyment of all good." Their blessedness is perfect
   because it is everlasting. They see God face to face. They will
   eternally love Him and be loved by Him. "Beatitudo, quæ etiam summum
   bonum aut ultimus finis nuncupatur, a Boetio [782] definitur: status
   bonorum omnium congregatione perfectus;' a S. Augustino, [783] Bonorum
   omnium summa et cumulus;' a scholasticis autem: 'summum bonum appetivus
   rationalis satiativum.'" [784] It is, therefore, heaven in the highest
   sense of the term, into which the saints are said to enter.

   There are, however, degrees in this blessedness. "The elect," says
   Cardinal Gousset, "in heaven, see God in a manner more or less perfect,
   according as they have more or less of merit, pro meritorum
   diversitate,' as it is expressed by the Council of Florence, which
   agrees with the words of our Lord, who says, In my Father's house are
   many mansions.'" [785] Into this only a few, however, even of true
   believers, according to Romanists, enter at death. The advocates of the
   doctrine of an intermediate state, as has been shown, assert that none
   of the human family, whether patriarch, prophet, Apostle, or martyr, is
   admitted to the vision of God when he leaves the body; and that none of
   the wicked goes into the place of final retribution. Both the righteous
   and the wicked remain in a middle state, awaiting their final doom and
   location at the second coming of Christ. As to both these points,
   Romanists are more nearly agreed with the great body of Protestants.

   On this point the Council of Florence says: "Credimus . . . . illorum
   animas, qui post baptismum susceptum nullam omnino peccati maculam
   incurrerunt, illas etiam animas quæ post contractam peccati maculam vel
   in suis corporibus, vel eisdem exutæ corporibus sunt purgatæ in coelum
   mox recipi, et intueri clare ipsum Deum trinum et unum sicuti est."
   This doctrine Romanists assert not only in opposition to those who
   teach that the soul dies with the body and is revived at the
   resurrection, but also to those who say that the souls even of the
   perfectly purified "in aliqua requie degere, donec post corporum
   resurrectionem adipiscantur æternam beatitudinem, quam interim
   expectant." This error, Perrone says, widely disseminated among the
   Greeks, was adopted by Luther and Calvin. [786]

   Two classes of persons, therefore, according to this view, enter heaven
   before the resurrection; first, those who are perfectly purified at the
   time of death; and second, those who, although not thus perfect when
   they leave this world, have become perfect in purgatory.

   Purgatory.

   According to Romanists, all those who die in the peace of the Church,
   but are not perfect, pass into purgatory; with regard to which they
   teach, (1.) That it is a state of suffering. The commonly received
   traditional, though not symbolical, doctrine on this point is, that the
   suffering is from material fire. The design of this suffering is both
   expiation and purification. (2.) That the duration and intensity of
   purgatorial pains are proportioned to the guilt and impurity of the
   sufferers. (3.) That there is no known or defined limit to the
   continuance of the soul in purgatory, but the day of judgment. The
   departed may remain in this state of suffering for a few hours or for
   thousands of years. (4.) That souls in purgatory may be helped; that
   is, their sufferings alleviated or the duration of them shortened by
   the prayers of the saints, and especially by the sacrifice of the Mass.
   (5.) That purgatory is under the power of the keys. That is, it is the
   prerogative of the authorities of the Church, at their discretion, to
   remit entirely or partially the penalty of sins under which the souls
   there detained are suffering.

   This doctrine is deeply rooted in the whole Romish system. According to
   that system, (1.) Christ delivers us only from the "reatus culpæ," and
   exposure to eternal death. (2.) For all sins committed after baptism
   the offender must make satisfaction by penance or good works. (3.) This
   satisfaction must be complete and the soul purified from all sin,
   before it can enter heaven. (4.) This satisfaction and purification, if
   not effected in this life, must be accomplished after death. (5.) The
   eucharist is a propitiatory sacrifice intended to secure the pardon of
   post-baptismal sins, and takes effect according to the intention of the
   officiating priest. Therefore, if he intends it for the benefit of any
   soul in purgatory, it inures to his advantage. (6.) The pope, being the
   vicar of Christ on earth, has full power to forgive sin; that is, to
   exempt offenders from the obligation to make satisfaction for their
   offences.

   Moehler, and other philosophical defenders of Romanism, soften down the
   doctrine by representing purgatory simply as a state of gradual
   preparation of the imperfectly sanctified for admission into heaven,
   making no mention of positive suffering, much less of material fire.
   Cardinal Gousset does not go so far as this, yet he says: [787] " It is
   of faith, (1.) That the righteous who die without having entirely
   satisfied divine justice, must make satisfaction after this life by
   temporary pains, which are called pains of purgatory; (2.) That the
   souls in purgatory are relieved by the prayers of the Church. This is
   what the faith teaches; but it stops there. Is purgatory a particular
   place rather than a state, or a state rather than a particular place?
   Are the pains of purgatory due to fire, or are the pains those which
   arise from the consciousness of having offended God? What are the
   severity and duration of those pains? These and other questions of like
   kind, are not included in the domain of Catholic doctrine. These are
   questions about which there exists no decision or judgment of the
   Church. Nevertheless it should be known that in the opinion of the
   majority of theologians the torments of purgatory consist in part on
   those of fire, or, at least, in such as are analogous to the pain
   produced by fire. We will add that, according to Saint Augustine and
   Saint Thomas, whose opinion is generally adopted (dont le sentiment est
   assez suivi), the pains of purgatory surpass those of this life: "Poena
   purgatorii," says the angelic Doctor, [788] "quantum ad poenam damni et
   sensus, excedit omnem poenam istius vitæ."

   Cardinal Wiseman, [789] in his lecture on this subject, speaks in the
   mildest terms. He says nothing of the pains of purgatory except that
   they are pains. The satisfaction for sin demanded by the Church of
   Rome, to be rendered in this world, consists of prayers, fastings,
   almsgiving, and the like; and we are told that if this satisfaction be
   not made before death, it must be made after it. This is all that the
   Cardinal ventures to say. He has not courage to lift the veil from the
   burning lake in which the souls in purgatory are represented as
   suffering, according to the common faith of Romanists. Although it is
   true that the Church of Rome has wisely abstained from any
   authoritative decision as to the nature and intensity of purgatorial
   sufferings, it does not thereby escape responsibility on the subject.
   It allows free circulation with ecclesiastical sanction, expressed or
   implied, of books containing the most frightful exhibitions of the
   sufferings of purgatory which the imagination of man can conceive. This
   doctrine, therefore, however mildly it may be presented in works
   designed for Protestant readers, is nevertheless a tremendous engine of
   priestly power. The feet of the tiger with the claws withdrawn are as
   soft as velvet; when those claws are extended, they are fearful
   instruments of laceration and death.

   Arguments used in favour of the Doctrine.

   1. Romanists make comparatively little use of Scripture in defence of
   their peculiar doctrines. [790] Their main support is tradition and the
   authority of the Church. Cardinal Wiseman cites but two passages from
   the New Testament in favour of the doctrine of purgatory. The first is
   our Lord's saying that the sin against the Holy Ghost shall never be
   forgiven either in this world or in the world to come. This is said to
   imply that there are sins which are not forgiven in this life which may
   be forgiven hereafter; and therefore that the dead, or at least a part
   of their number, are not past forgiveness when they die. This is a
   slender thread on which to hang so great a weight. The words of Christ
   contain no such implication. To say that a thing can never happen
   either here or hereafter, in this world or in the world to come, is a
   familiar way of saying that it can never happen under any
   circumstances. Our Lord simply said that blasphemy of the Holy Ghost
   can never be forgiven. The other passage is from Revelation xxi. 21,
   where it said that nothing that defileth shall enter heaven. But as
   very few, if any of the human family, are perfectly pure when they die,
   it follows that, if there be no place or process of purification after
   death, few if any of the sons of men could be saved; or, as Cardinal
   Wiseman puts the argument, "Suppose that a Christian dies who had
   committed some slight transgression; he cannot enter heaven in this
   state, and yet we cannot suppose that he is to be condemned forever.
   What alternative, then, are we to admit? Why, that there is some place
   in which the soul will be purged of the sin, and qualified to enter
   into the glory of God." [791] But does not the blood of Christ cleanse
   from all sin? Were not the sins of Paul all forgiven the moment he
   believed? Did the penitent thief enter purgatory instead of paradise?
   To minds trained under the influence of evangelical doctrine, such
   arguments as the above cannot have the slightest weight.

   2. Great stress is laid upon the fact that the custom of praying for
   the dead prevailed early and long in the Church. Such prayers take for
   granted that the dead need our prayers; and thin supposes that they are
   not in heaven. But if not in heaven where can they be except in a
   preparatory or purgatorial states To this it may be answered, (1.) That
   praying for the dead is a superstitious practice, having no support
   from the Bible. It was one of the corruptions early introduced into the
   Church It will not do to argue from one corruption in support of
   another. (2.) Those who vindicate the propriety of praying for the dead
   are often strenuous opposers of the doctrine of purgatory. Dr. Pusey,
   or example, says: "Since Rome has blended the cruel invention of
   purgatory with the primitive custom of praying for the dead, it is not
   in communion with her that any can seek comfort from this rite." [792]
   The early Christians prayed for the souls of Apostles and martyrs, whom
   they assuredly believed were already in heaven. It was not, therefore,
   for any alleviation of their sufferings, as Dr. Pusey argues, that such
   prayers were offered, but for the augmentation of their happiness, and
   the consummation of their blessedness at the last day.

   3. The argument of most logical force to those who believe the premises
   whence it is derived, is drawn from the doctrine of satisfaction. The
   Romish doctrine on this subject includes the following principles:
   "(1.) That God, after the remission of sin, retains a lesser
   chastisement in his power, to be inflicted on the simmer. (2.) That
   penitential works, fasting, alms-deeds, contrite weeping, and fervent
   prayer, have the power of averting that punishment. (3.) That this
   scheme of God's justice was not a part of the imperfect law, but the
   unvarying ordinance of his dispensation, anterior to the Mosaic ritual,
   and amply confirmed by Christ in the gospel. (4.) That it consequently
   becomes a part of all true repentance to try to satisfy this divine
   justice by the voluntary assumption of such penitential works as his
   revealed truth assures have efficacy before Him." [793] In connection
   with this is to be taken the doctrine of indulgences. This doctrine, we
   are told, rests on the following grounds: (1.) "That satisfaction has
   to be made to God for sin remitted, under the authority and regulation
   of the Church. (2.) That the Church has always considered herself
   possessed of the authority to mitigate, by diminution or commutation,
   the penance which she enjoins; and she has always reckoned such a
   mitigation valid before God, who sanctions and accepts it. (3.) That
   the sufferings of the saints, in union with, and by virtue of Christ's
   merits, are considered available towards the granting this mitigation.
   (4.) That such mitigations, when prudently and justly granted, are
   conducive toward the spiritual weal and profit of Christians." [794]

   We have thus a broad foundation laid for the whole doctrine of
   purgatory. God in the forgiveness of sin remits only the penalty of
   eternal death. There remain temporal pains to be endured in
   satisfaction of divine justice. If such satisfaction be not made in
   this world, it must be rendered in the next. The Church has the power
   of regulating these satisfactions, of directing what they shall be, of
   mitigating or commuting them in this life, and of lessening their
   severity or duration in the life to come. The infinite merit of Christ,
   and the superfluous merits of all the saints, gained by works of
   supererogation, form an inexhaustible treasury, from which the Pope and
   his subordinates may draw at discretion for the mitigation, or plenary
   dispensation, of all the satisfaction due for sin in the way of penance
   in this life, or the pains of purgatory in the life to come. Now when
   it is considered that the pains of purgatory are authoritatively and
   almost universally represented by Romanists to be intolerably severe,
   it will be seen that no such engine of power, no such means of
   subjugating the people, or of exalting and enriching the priesthood has
   ever been claimed or conceded by man. Men really invested with this
   power, of necessity, and of right, are the absolute masters of their
   fellow men; and those who wrongfully claim it, who assume without
   possessing it, are the greatest impostors (consciously or
   unconsciously) and the greatest tyrants the world ever saw.

   4. With Romanists themselves the greatest argument in favour of the
   doctrine of purgatory is tradition. They claim that it has always been
   held in the Church; and in support of that claim they quote from the
   fathers all passages which speak of purification by fire, or of praying
   for the dead. They usually begin with the Second Book of Maccabees xii.
   43, where it is said that Judas Maccabeus sent "2,000 drachmas of
   silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice, to be offered for the sins" of the
   dead. They cite Tertullian [795] who advised a widow to pray for her
   husband, and to offer oblations for him on the anniversary of his
   death; Cyprian, [796] who says that if a man committed a certain
   offence, "no oblation should be made for him, nor sacrifice offered for
   his repose;" Basil, who says of Isaiah ix. 19, "The people shall be as
   the fuel of the fire," ouk aphanismon apeilei, alla ten kaitharsin
   hupophainei, that is, "it does not threaten extermination, but denotes
   purification;" [797] Cyril of Jerusalem, who says: "Deinde et pro
   defunctis sanctis patribus et episcopis, et omnibus generatim, qui
   inter nos vita functi sunt, oramus, maximum hoc credentes adjumentum
   illis animabus fore, pro quibas oratio defertur, dum sancta et tremenda
   coram jacet victima;" [798] that is, "Then we pray for the holy fathers
   and the bishops that are dead; and, in short, for all those who are
   departed this life in our communion; believing that the souls of those
   for whom the prayers are offered, receive very great relief while this
   holy and tremendous victim lies upon the altar;" Gregory of Nyssa,
   [799] who says that in this life the sinner may "be renovated by
   prayers and by the pursuit of wisdom;" but when he has quitted his
   body, "he cannot be admitted to approach the Divinity till the purging
   fire shall have expiated the stains with which his soul was infected;"
   Ambrose, [800] who thus comments upon 1 Corinthians iii. 15, "He
   . . . . shall be saved, yet so as by fire." The Apostle says, "Yet so
   as by fire,' in order that his salvation be not understood to be
   without pain. He shows that he shall be saved indeed, but he shall
   undergo the pain of fire, and be thus purified; not like the
   unbelieving and wicked man, who shall be punished in everlasting fire;"
   Jerome, [801] who says: "As we believe the torments of the devil, and
   of those wicked men, who said in their hearts, There is no God,' to be
   eternal; so, in regard to those sinners, impious men, and even
   Christians, and whose works will be proved and purged by fire, we
   conclude that the sentence of the judge will be tempered by mercy;" and
   Augustine, [802] who says: "The prayers of the Church, or of good
   persons, are heard in favour of those Christians who departed this life
   not so bad as to be deemed unworthy of mercy, nor so good as to be
   entitled to immediate happiness. So, also, at the resurrection of the
   dead, there will some be found to whom mercy will be imparted, having
   gone through those pains to which the spirits of the dead are liable.
   Otherwise it would not have been said of some with truth, that their
   sin shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to
   come, unless some sins were remitted in the next world." And again: "If
   they had built gold and silver, and precious stones, they would be
   secure from both fires; not only from that in which the wicked shall be
   punished forever, but likewise from that fire that purifies those who
   shall be saved by fire. But because it is said shall be saved, that
   fire is thought lightly of; though the suffering will be more grievous
   than anything man can undergo in this life." "These passages," says
   Cardinal Wiseman, "contain precisely the same doctrine as the Catholic
   Church teaches;" they may be found in great abundance in all the
   standard works of Catholic theologians.

   With regard to this argument from the fathers, it may be remarked, (1.)
   That if any one should quote Döllinger, Dupanloup, Wiseman, and Manning
   in favour of any Christian doctrine, it would have more weight with
   Protestants than the same number of these early writers; not only
   because they are, speaking generally, men of far more ability and
   higher culture, but because they are in more favourable circumstances
   to learn the truth. The fathers looked at everything through an
   atmosphere filled with the forms of pagan traditions and ideas. The
   modern leaders of the Church of Rome are surrounded by the light of
   Protestant Christianity. (2.) All the ancient writers, quoted in
   support of the doctrine of purgatory, held doctrines which no Romanist
   is now willing to avow. If they discard the authority of the fathers
   when teaching a Jewish millennium, or sovereign predestination, once
   the doctrine of the universal Church, they cannot reasonably expect
   Protestants to bow to that authority when urged in favour of the pagan
   idea of a purification by fire. (3.) The witnesses cited in support of
   the doctrine of purgatory come very far short of proving the universal
   and constant belief of the doctrine in question. And. according to
   Romanists themselves, no doctrine can plead the support of tradition
   that cannot stand the crucial test, "quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab
   omnibus." (4.) That purgatory is, what Dr. Pusey calls it, "a modern
   invention," has been demonstrated by tracing historically its origin,
   rise, and development in the Church.

   Arguments against the Doctrine.

   1. The first, most obvious, and, for Protestants, the most decisive
   argument against the doctrine is, that it is not taught in the Bible.
   This is virtually admitted by its advocates. The most that is pretended
   is, that having adopted the doctrine on other grounds, they can find in
   Scripture here and there a passage which can be explained in accordance
   with its teachings. There is no passage which asserts it. There is no
   evidence that it formed a part of the instructions of Christ or his
   Apostles.

   2. It is not only destitute of all support from Scripture, but it is
   opposed to its clearest and most important revelations. If there be
   anything plainly taught in the Bible, it is that if any man forsakes
   his sins, believes in the Lord Jesus Christ as the eternal Son of God,
   trusts simply and entirely to Him and his work, and leads a holy life,
   he shall certainly be saved. This the doctrine of purgatory denies. It
   rests avowedly on the assumption that notwithstanding the infinitely
   meritorious sacrifice of Christ, the sinner is bound to make
   satisfaction for his own sins. This the Bible declares to be
   impossible. No man does or can perfectly keep the commandments of God,
   much less can he not only abstain from incurring new guilt, but also
   make atonement for sins that are past.

   The doctrine moreover assumes the merit of good works. Here again it is
   clearer than the sun that the New Testament teaches that we are saved
   by grace and not by works; that to him that worketh, the reward is a
   matter of debt; but to him who simply believes, it is a matter of
   grace; and that the two are incompatible. What is of grace is not of
   works; and what is of works is not of grace. There is nothing more
   absolutely incompatible with the nature of the Gospel than the idea
   that man can "satisfy divine justice" for his sins. Yet this idea lies
   at the foundation of the doctrine of purgatory. If there be no
   satisfaction of justice, on the part of the sinner, there is no
   purgatory, for, according to Romanists, purgatory is the place and
   state in which such satisfaction is rendered. As the renunciation of
   all dependence upon our own merit, of all purpose, desire, or effort to
   make satisfaction for ourselves, and trusting exclusively to the
   satisfaction rendered by Jesus Christ, is of the very essence of
   Christian experience, it will be seen that the doctrine of purgatory is
   in conflict not only with the doctrines of the Bible but also with the
   religious consciousness of the believer. This is not saying that no man
   who believes in purgatory can be a true Christian. The history of the
   Church proves that Christians can be very inconsistent; that they may
   speculatively adhere to doctrines which are inconsistent with what
   their hearts know to be true.

   It is, however, not only the doctrine of satisfaction, but also the
   absolutely preposterous doctrine of supererogation which must be
   admitted, if we adopt the creed of the Church of Rome in this matter.
   The idea is that a man may be more than perfect; that he may not only
   do more than the law requires of him, but even render satisfaction to
   God's justice so meritorious as to be more than sufficient for the
   pardon of his own sins. This superfluous merit, is the ground on which
   the sins of those suffering in purgatory may be forgiven. This is a
   subject which does not admit of argument. It supposes an impossibility.
   It supposes that a rational creature can be better than he ought to be;
   i.e., than he is bound to be. Romanists moreover strenuously deny the
   possibility that Christ's righteousness can be imputed to the believer
   as the ground of his justification; and yet they teach that the merits
   of the saints may be imputed to sinners in purgatory as the ground of
   their forgiveness.

   Another antiscriptural assumption involved in the doctrine is that the
   pope, and his subordinates, have power over the unseen world; power to
   retain or to remit the sins of departed souls; to deliver them from
   purgatorial fire or to allow them to remain under its torments. This is
   a power which could not be trusted in the hands of an angel. Nothing
   short of infinite knowledge and infinite rectitude could secure it from
   fatal abuse. No such power we may be assured has ever been committed to
   the hands of sinful men.

   There are two entirely different things involved in this priestly power
   to forgive sins. There are two kinds of punishment denounced against
   sin. The one is the sentence of eternal death; the other is the
   temporary punishment to which the sinner remains subject after the
   eternal penalty is remitted. [803] With regard to both the priest
   interferes. Neither can be remitted without his intervention. The
   eternal penalty is remitted in the sacrament of penance The latter is
   exacted, mitigated, or dispensed with at the discretion of the Church,
   or its organs. As to the remission of the eternal penalty the
   intervention of the priest is necessary because he alone can administer
   the sacrament of penance, which includes contrition, confession, and
   satisfaction. All are necessary. It is not enough that the sinner be
   penitent in heart and truly turn from sin unto God; he must confess his
   sins to the priest. The Church "maintains that the sinner is bound to
   manifest his offences to the pastors of his Church, or, rather, to one
   deputed and authorized by the Church for that purpose; to lay open to
   him all the secret offences of his soul, to expose all its wounds, and
   in virtue of the authority vested by our Blessed Saviour in him, to
   receive through his hands, on earth, the sentence which is ratified in
   heaven, of God's forgiveness." Christ also "gave to the Church power of
   retaining sins, that is, of withholding forgiveness, or delaying it to
   more seasonable time." [804] "Here is a power, in the first place,
   truly to forgive sin. For this expression to forgive sins,' in the New
   Testament, always signifies to clear the sinner of guilt before God."
   "The Apostles, then, and their successors, received this authority;
   consequently, to them was given a power to absolve, or to cleanse the
   soul from its sins. There is another power also: that of retaining sins
   What is the meaning of this? clearly the power of refusing to forgive
   them. Now, all this clearly implies -- for the promise is annexed, that
   what sins Christ's lawful ministers retain on earth, are retained in
   heaven -- that there is no other means of obtaining forgiveness, save
   through them. For the forgiveness of heaven is made to depend upon that
   which they forgive on earth; and those are not to be pardoned there,
   whose sins they retain. [805] This is sufficiently explicit. It is to
   be remembered the power of forgiveness here claimed has reference, not
   to the temporary punishment imposed in the way of penance or
   satisfaction, but to the remission of "the eternal debt." Now, as to
   the temporary punishment, which, as we have seen, may last thousands of
   years and exceed in severity any sufferings on earth, Romanists teach,
   (1.) That "they are expiatory of past transgression." [806] (2.) That
   they are of the same nature with the penances imposed by the discipline
   of the early Church. That discipline was naturally, perhaps
   necessarily, very severe; the Church was then surrounded by heathenism,
   and many of its members were heathen converts. What tendencies, and
   what temptations to unchristian conduct, were unavoidable under such
   circumstances, may be learned from the state of the Church in Corinth
   as depicted in Paul's epistles. The great danger was that Christians
   should be involved, intentionally or unintentionally, in the idolatrous
   services to which they had been accustomed. As the worship of idols in
   any form, was a renunciation of the Gospel, it was against that offence
   the discipline of the Church was principally directed. One party
   contended that the "lapsed" ought never to be restored to Christian
   fellowship; another, which allowed their readmission to the Church,
   insisted that they should be restored only after a long and severe
   course of penance. Some were required "to lay prostrate for a certain
   period of months or years before the doors of the Church, after which
   they were admitted to different portions of the divine service; while
   others were often excluded through their whole lives from the
   liturgical exercises of the faithful, and were not admitted to
   absolution until they were at the point of death." These penances
   Romanists pronounce "meritorious in the sight of God," they "propitiate
   his wrath." This is the doctrine of satisfaction; and such satisfaction
   for sin is the necessary condition of its forgiveness. (3.) As these
   penances or satisfactions are imposed by the Church, they can be
   mitigated or remitted by the Church. (4.) As the pains of purgatory are
   of the nature of satisfactions, "expiatory," "meritorious," and
   "propitiatory," they are as much under the control of the Church, as
   the penances to be endured in this life

   This is the true, and it may be said, the virtually admitted genesis of
   the doctrine of purgatory in the Church of Rome. It is a perversion of
   the ecclesiastical discipline of the early Christians. To be sure, the
   genesis, or birth, is spurious; there is no legitimate connection
   between the premises and the conclusion. Admitting the fact that the
   early Church imposed severe penances on offenders before restoring them
   to fellowship; admitting that this was right on the part of the Church;
   admitting that such penances were of the nature of satisfactions, so
   far as they were designed to satisfy the Church that the repentance of
   the offender was sincere; and admitting that these penances being
   matters of Church discipline were legitimately under the power of the
   Church, how does all this prove that they were "expiatory in the sight
   of God, that "they satisfied divine justice," or that they were the
   necessary conditions of forgiveness at his bar? Satisfactory to the
   Church as evidences of repentance, and satisfactory to God's justice,
   are two very different things, which Romanists have confounded.
   Besides, how does it follow, because the visible Church has control of
   the discipline of its members, in this life, that it has control of the
   souls of men in the life to come? Yet Romanists reason from the one to
   the other.

   3. Another decisive argument against the doctrine of purgatory is drawn
   from the abuses to which it has led, and which are its inevitable,
   being its natural consequences. It is à priorievident that a power
   committed to weak and sinful men which is safe in no other hands but
   those of God Himself, must lead to the most dreadful abuses. The
   doctrine, as we have seen, is, (1.) That the priest has power to remit
   or retain, the penalty of eternal death denounced against all sin. (2.)
   That he (or the appropriate organ of the Church) has power to
   alleviate, to shorten, or to terminate, the sufferings of souls in
   purgatory. That this power should fail to be abused, in the hands of
   the best of men, is impossible. Vested in the hands of ordinary men, as
   must be generally the case, or in the hands of mercenary and wicked
   men, imagination can set no limit to its abuse; and imagination can
   hardly exceed the historical facts in the case. This is not a matter of
   dispute. Romanists themselves admit the fact. Cardinal Wiseman
   acknowledges that "flagrant and too frequent abuses, doubtless,
   occurred through the avarice, and rapacity, and impiety of men;
   especially when indulgence was granted to the contributors towards
   charitable or religious foundations, in the erection of which private
   motives too often mingle." [807] The reader must be referred to the
   pages of history for details on this subject. The evils which have in
   fact flowed from this doctrine of purgatory and of the priestly power
   of retaining or remitting sin, are such as to render it certain that no
   such doctrine can be of God.

   4. Romanists, however, confidently appeal, in support of their
   doctrine, to the express declaration of Christ, "Whosesoever sins ye
   remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain,
   they are retained." (John xx. 23.) To the same effect it is said, in
   Matthew xvi. 19, "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
   heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in
   heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt Loose on earth, shall be loosed in
   heaven." The first remark to be made on these passages is, that
   whatever power is granted in them to the Apostles, is granted in
   Matthew xviii. 18 to all Christians, or, at least, to every association
   of Christians which constitutes a Church. "If thy brother shall
   trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him
   alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he
   will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the
   mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if
   he neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church: but if he neglect to
   hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
   Verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be
   bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed
   in heaven." This power, therefore, of binding and loosing, whatever it
   was, was not vested exclusively in the Apostles and their successors,
   but in the Church. But the true Church to which the promises and
   prerogatives of the Church belong, consists of true believers. This is
   not only the doctrine of the Bible and of all Protestants at the time
   of the Reformation, but would seem to be a matter of course. Promises
   made to the Apostles were made to true apostles, not to those who
   pretended to the office, and were false apostles. So the promises made
   to Christians are made not to nominal, pretended, or false Christians,
   but to those who truly are what they profess to be. If this be clear,
   then it is no less clear that the power of binding and loosing, of
   remitting or retaining sin, was never granted by Christ to
   unregenerated, wicked men, no matter by what name they may be called.
   This is a great point gained. The children of God in this world are not
   under the power of the children of the devil, to be forgiven or
   condemned, saved or lost, at their discretion. Therefore, when Luther
   was anathematized by the body calling itself the Church, as Athanasins
   had been before him, it did not hurt a hair of his head.

   Secondly, the power granted by Christ to his Church of binding and
   loosing, of forgiving or retaining sin, is not absolute, but
   conditional. The passages above quoted are analogous to many others
   contained in the Scriptures, and are all to be explained in the same
   way. For example, our Lord said to his disciples; They who hear you,
   hear me. That is, the people were as much bound to believe the gospel
   when preached by the disciples, as though they heard it from the lips
   of Christ Himself. Or, if these words are to be understood as addressed
   exclusively to the Apostles, and to include a promise of infallibility
   in teaching, the meaning is substantially the same. Men were as much
   bound to receive the doctrines of the Apostles, as the teachings of
   Christ, for what they taught He taught. St. John, therefore, says, "He
   that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us." (1
   John iv. 6.) Nevertheless, although Christ required all men to hear his
   Apostles as though He himself were speaking; yet no man was bound to
   hear them unless they preached Christ's gospel. Therefore St. Paul
   said, "Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto
   you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed."
   (Gal. i. 8.) If the Apostles taught anything contrary to the
   authenticated revelation of God, they were to be rejected. If they
   undertook to bind or loose, to remit or retain sin on any other terms
   than those prescribed by Christ, their action amounted to nothing; it
   produced no effect. In teaching and in absolution their power was
   simply declarative. In the one case, they, as witnesses, declared what
   were the conditions of salvation and the rule of life prescribed in the
   gospel; and in the other case, they simply declared the conditions on
   which God will forgive sin, and announced the promise of God that on
   those conditions He would pardon the sins of men. A child, therefore,
   may remit sin just as effectually as the pope; for neither can do
   anything more than declare the conditions of forgiveness. It once
   required the heroism of Luther to announce that truth which emancipated
   Europe; now it is an every-day truth.

   There is, of course, a great difference between the Apostles and other
   Christian teachers. Christ bore witness to the correctness of their
   testimony as to his doctrines, and sanctioned their declarations, by
   signs, and wonders, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, thus giving the seal
   of infallibility to their teachings as uttered by the lips and as we
   have them recorded in the Bible. And, there is also a difference
   between the official ministers of the gospel and other men, in so far
   as the former are specially called to the work of preaching the word.
   But in all cases, in that of the Apostles, in that of office-bearers in
   the Church, and in that of laymen, the power is simply declaratory.
   They declare what God has revealed. What difference does it make in the
   authority of the message, whether the gospel be read at the bed of a
   dying sinner, by a child, or by an archbishop? None in the world.

   There is another class of passages analogous to those under
   consideration. When our Lord says, Ask and ye shall receive, Whatsoever
   ye ask in my name I will do it, no one understands these promises as
   unconditional. No one believes that any prayer of the Christian is ever
   heard, if it be not for something agreeable to the will of God. When
   then it is said, "Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted," why
   should it be inferred that no condition is implied? The language is not
   more explicit in the one case than in the other. As no man's prayers
   are heard unless he asks for things agreeable to the will of God; so no
   man's sins are remitted unless he truly repents and truly believes in
   the Lord Jesus Christ. One man has no more power to forgive sins, than
   another. The forgiveness of sin is the exclusive prerogative of God.

   Thirdly, there is another remark to be made about this power of binding
   and loosing. Christ has ordained that the terms of admission to the
   Church, should be the same as those of admission into heaven; and that
   the grounds of exclusion from the Church, should be the same as those
   of exclusion from heaven. He, therefore, virtually said to his
   disciples, Whom ye receive into the Church, I will receive into heaven;
   and whom ye exclude from the Church, I will exclude from heaven. But
   this, of course, implies that they should act according to his
   directions. He did not bind Himself to sanction all their errors in
   binding and loosing; any more than He was bound by his promise to hear
   their prayers, to grant all the foolish or wicked petitions his people
   might offer; or by his promise in reference to their teaching, to
   sanction all the false doctrines into which they might be seduced. If
   we interpret Scripture by Scripture, we escape a multitude of errors.

   Fourthly, Romanists rest their doctrine of absolution and of the power
   of the keys over souls in purgatory, very much upon the special gifts
   granted to the Apostles and to their successors. In reference to this
   agreement it may be remarked, --

   1. That the Apostles never claimed, never possessed, and never
   pretended to exercise, the power assumed by Romanists, in the remission
   of sins. They never presumed to pronounce the absolution of a sinner in
   the sight of God. Christ could say "Thy sins be forgiven thee;" but we
   never hear such language from the lips of an Apostle. They never
   directed those burdened with a sense of sin to go to the priest to make
   confession and receive absolution. They had no authority in this
   respect above that which belongs to the ordinary officers of the
   Church. They could declare the terms on which God had promised to
   forgive sins; and they could suspend or excommunicate members, for
   cause, from the communion of the visible Church. In the case of the
   incestuous man whom the Church in Corinth allowed to remain in its
   fellowship, Paul determined to do what he censured the Church for not
   doing; that is, in virtue of his apostolic jurisdiction extending over
   all the churches, he excommunicated the offender, or, delivered him to
   Satan, that he might repent. (1 Cor. v.) When the man did repent, the
   Apostle exhorted the Corinthians to restore him to their fellowship,
   saying, "To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also." (2 Cor. ii. 10.)
   He claimed for himself no power which he did not recognize as belonging
   to them. It was a mere matter of Church discipline from beginning to
   end. This power of discipline, which all Churches recognize and
   exercise, the Romanists have perverted into the priestly power of
   absolution.

   2. Admitting, what, however, is not conceded, that the Apostles had
   special power to forgive sin, that power must have rested on their
   peculiar gifts and qualifications. They were infallible men; not
   infallible indeed in reading men's hearts, or in judging of their
   character, but simply infallible as teachers; and they had authority to
   organize the Church, and to lay down laws for its future government and
   discipline. These gifts and prerogatives, indeed, in no way qualified
   them to sit in judgment on the souls of men, to pardon or condemn them
   at discretion; but, such as they were, they were personal. Those who
   claim to be their official successors, and arrogate their peculiar
   prerogatives, do not pretend to possess their gifts; they do not
   pretend to personal infallibility in teaching, nor do they claim
   jurisdiction beyond their own dioceses. As no man can be a prophet
   without the gifts of a prophet, so no man can be an Apostle without the
   gifts of an Apostle. The office is simply authority to exercise the
   gifts; but if the gifts are not possessed what can the office amount
   to?

   But even if the impossible be admitted; let it be conceded that the
   prelates have the power of remitting and retaining sin, as claimed by
   Romanists, in virtue of their apostleship, how is this power granted to
   priests who are not Apostles? It will not do to say that they are the
   representatives and delegates of the bishop. The bishop is said to have
   this power because he has received the Holy Ghost. If this means
   anything, it means that the Holy Spirit dwells in him, and so
   enlightens his mind and guides his judgment, as to render his decisions
   in retaining or remitting sin, virtually the decisions of God; but this
   divine illumination and guidance can no more be delegated than the
   knowledge of the lawyer or the skill of the surgeon. How can a prophet
   delegate his power to foresee the future to another man? It is
   impossible to believe that God has given men the power of forgiving or
   retaining sin, unless He has given them the power of infallible
   judgment; and that such infallibility of judgment belongs to the Romish
   priesthood, no man can believe.

   It has already been urged as valid arguments against the Romish
   doctrine of purgatory, (1.) That it is destitute of all Scriptural
   support. (2.) That it is opposed to many of the most clearly revealed
   and most important doctrines of the Bible. (3.) That the abuses to
   which it always has led and which are its inevitable consequences,
   prove that the doctrine cannot be of God. (4.) That the power to
   forgive sin, in the sense claimed by Romanists, and which is taken for
   granted in their doctrine of purgatory, finds no support in the words
   of Christ, as recorded in John xx. 23, and Matt. xvi. 19, which are
   relied on for that purpose. (5.) The fifth argument against the
   doctrine is derived from its history, which proves it to have had a
   pagan origins and to have been developed by slow degrees into the form
   in which it is now held by the Church of Rome.

   History of the Doctrine.

   The details on this subject must be sought in the common books on the
   history of doctrine. Here only the most meagre outline can be expected.
   A full exposition on this subject would require first an account of the
   prevalence of the idea of a purification by fire among the ancients
   before the coming of Christ, especially among the people of central
   Asia; secondly, an account of the early appearance of this idea in the
   first three centuries in the Christian Church, until it reached a
   definite form in the writings of Augustine; and thirdly, the
   establishment of the doctrine as an article of faith in the Latin
   Church, principally through the influence of Gregory the Great.

   Fire is the most effectual means of purification. It is almost the only
   means by which the dross can be separated from the gold. In the
   Scriptures it is frequently referred to, in illustration of the painful
   process of the sanctification of the human soul. In Zechariah xiii. 9,
   it is said, "I will bring the third part through the fire, and will
   refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried:
   they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my
   people; and they shall say, The Lord is my God." It is in allusion to
   the same familiar fact, that afflictions are so often compared to a
   furnace, and the trials of God's people are said to be by fire. "The
   fire," says the Apostle, "shall try every man's work, of what sort it
   is. With the ancient Persians fire was sacred. It became an object of
   worship, as the symbol of the divinity; and elemental fire was even for
   the soul the great means of purification. In the Zendavesta, Ormuz is
   made to say to Zoroaster, "Thine eyes shall certainly see all things
   live anew. -- For the renovated earth shall yield bones and water,
   blood and plants, hair, fire and life as at the beginning. -- The souls
   will know their bodies. -- Behold my father! my mother! my wife! Then
   will the inhabitants of the universe appear on earth with mankind.
   Everyone will see his good or evil. Then a great separation will occur.
   Everything corrupt will sink into the abyss. Then too through the
   fierceness of the lire all mountains shall melt; and through the
   flowing stream of fire, all men must pass. The good will go through as
   easily as through flowing milk. The wicked find it real fire; but they
   must pass through and be purified. Afterward the whole earth shall be
   renewed." [808]

   With the Greek Stoics also, fire was the elementary principle and soul
   of the world, and they also taught a renovation of the world through
   fire. With the Stoics, "The universe is one whole, which comprises all
   things; yet contains a passive principle, matter, to paschon, and an
   active principle, to poiou, which is reason, or God. The soul of man is
   part of this divine nature, and will be reabsorbed into it and lose its
   individual existence. The Deity in action, if we may so speak, is a
   certain active æther, or fire, possessed of intelligence. This first
   gave form to the original chaos, and, being an essential part of the
   universe, sustains it in order. The overruling power, which seems
   sometimes in idea to have been separated from the Absolute Being, was
   heimarmene, fate, or absolute necessity. To this the universe is
   subject, both in its material and divine nature. Men return to this
   life totally oblivious of the past, and by the decrees of fate are
   possessed of a renovated existence, but still in imperfection and
   subject to sorrow as before." [809] This is an inchoate form of the
   pantheism of the present day. The system as stated is not
   self-consistent; as it says that the souls of men are to be absorbed
   into the soul of the world, and yet that they are to return to this
   life, although oblivious to the past; which amounts to saying that
   there will be a new generation of men.

   The idea of a purification by fire after death became familiar to the
   Greek mind, and was taken up by Plato, and wrought into his philosophy;
   he taught that no one could become perfectly happy after death, until
   he had expiated his sins; and that if they were too great for
   expiation, his sufferings would have no end. [810] That this doctrine
   passed from the Gentiles to the Jews may be inferred not only from the
   fact already mentioned that Judas Maccabeus sent money to Jerusalem to
   pay for sacrifices to be offered for the sins of the dead; but also
   from the doctrine of the Rabbins, that children, by means of sin
   offerings, could alleviate the sufferings of their deceased parents.
   [811] Some of them also taught that all souls, not perfectly holy, must
   wash themselves in the fire-river of Gehenna; that the just would
   therein be soon cleansed, but the wicked retained in torment
   indefinitely. [812] It was in this general form of a purification by
   fire after death that the doctrine was adopted by some of the fathers.
   Nothing more than this can be proved from the writings of the first
   three centuries. Origen taught first that this purification was to take
   place after the resurrection. "Ego puto," he says, "quod et post
   resurrectionem ex mortuis indigeamus sacramento eluente nos atque
   purgante: nemo enim absque sordibus resurgere poterit: nec ullam posse
   animam reperiri quæ universis statim vitiis careat." [813] And
   secondly, that in the purifying fire at the end of the world, all
   souls, and all fallen angels, and Satan himself, will ultimately be
   purged from sin, and restored to the favour of God. In his comment on
   Romans viii. 12, he says: "Qui vero verbi Dei et doctrinæ Evangelicæ
   purificationem spreverit, tristibus et poenalibus purificationibus
   semetipsum reservat, ut iguis gehennæ in cruciatibus purget, quem nec
   apostolica doctrina nec evangelicus sermo purgavit." [814] This
   doctrine was condemned in the Church; but, as Flügge [815] says: "This
   anathema was the less effective because the eastern views on this
   subject differed so much from the western or Church doctrine. The
   former, or Origen's doctrine, contemplated the purification of the
   greatest sinners and of the devil himself; the Latin Church thought
   only of believers justified by the blood of Christ. The one supposed
   the sinner to purify himself from his desire of evil; the other,
   asserted expiation by suffering. According to the former, the sinner
   was healed and strengthened; according to the latter, divine justice
   must be satisfied." It is not to be inferred from this, that the Greek
   Church adopted Origen's views as to "the restoration of all things;"
   but it nevertheless maintained until a much later period the views by
   which it was distinguished from the Latins on the doctrine of the
   future state.

   It was, therefore, in the western Church that the development of the
   doctrine of purgatory took place. Augustine first gave it a definite
   form, although his views are not always consistently or confidently
   expressed. Thus he says: It is doubtful whether a certain class of men
   are to be purified by fire after death, so as to be prepared to enter
   heaven; "utrum ita sit," he says, "quæri potest: et aut inveniri, aut
   latere, nonnullos fideles per ignem quemdam purgatorium; quanto magis
   minusve bona pereuntia dilexerunt, tanto tardius citiusque salvari."
   [816] In other places, however, he teaches the two essential points in
   the doctrine of purgatory, first, that the souls of a certain class of
   men who are ultimately saved, suffer after death; and secondly, that
   they are aided through the eucharist, and the alms and prayers of the
   faithful. [817]

   It was, however, Gregory the Great who consolidated the vague and
   conflicting views circulating through the Church, and brought the
   doctrine into such a shape and into such connection with the discipline
   of the Church, as to render it the effective engine for government and
   income, which it has ever since remained. From this time onward through
   all the Middle Ages, purgatory became one of the prominent and
   constantly reiterated topics of public instruction. It took firm hold
   of the popular mind. The clergy from the highest to the lowest, and the
   different orders of monks vied with each other in their zeal in its
   inculcation; and in the marvels which they related of spiritual
   apparitions, in support of the doctrine. They contended fiercely for
   the honour of superior power of redeeming souls from purgatorial pains.
   The Franciscans claimed that the head of their order descended annually
   into purgatory, and delivered all the brotherhood who were there
   detained. The Carmelites asserted that the Virgin Mary had promised
   that no one who died with the Carmelite scapulary upon their shoulders,
   should ever be lost. [818] The chisel and pencil of the artist were
   employed in depicting the horrors of purgatory, as a means of
   impressing the public mind. No class escaped the contagion of belief;
   the learned as well as the ignorant; the high and the low; the soldier
   and the recluse; the skeptic and the believer were alike enslaved.
   [819] From this slavery the Bible, not the progress of science, has
   delivered all Protestants.

   Church. By Cardinal Wiseman. Two volumes in one. Sixth American from
   the last London edition. Revised and Corrected. Baltimore, 1870.
   Lecture XI. On Satisfaction and Purgatory.

   [790] Cardinal Wiseman says: "I have more than once commented on the
   incorrectness of that method of arguing which demands that we prove
   every one of our doctrines individually from the Scriptures. I occupied
   myself, during my first course of lectures, in demonstrating the
   Catholic principle of faith that the Church of Christ was constituted
   by Him the depositary of his truths, and that, although many were
   recorded in his holy word, still many were committed to traditional
   keeping, and that Christ Himself has faithfully promised to teach in
   his Church, and has thus secured her from error." Lectures, ut supra,
   xi. vol. ii. p. 45. This resolves all controversies with Romanists into
   two questions. First, what is the prerogative of the Church as a
   teacher; and secondly, is the Church of Rome, or any other external
   organized body, the body of Christ to which the prerogatives and
   promises of the Church belong?

   [792] An earnest Remonstrance to the author of the "Pope's Pastoral
   Letter to Certain Members of the University of Oxford," London, 1836,
   p. 25. The Hon. Archibald Campbell, whose work is quoted above, says
   that all the authorities to which he refers from among the English
   Bishops and theologians, side with him in defending prayers for the
   dead and in denouncing purgatory.

   [793] Wiseman, ut supra, vol. ii. p. 40. It will be observed that the
   Cardinal, in detailing the kind of satisfaction to be made, mentions
   fasting, alms-giving, and prayer, but says nothing of scourgings, hair
   shirts, spiked girdles, and all other means of self-torture so common
   and so applauded in the Romish Church. In this way he softens down and
   understates all "Catholic Doctrines and Practices," to render them less
   revolting to the reason and conscience of his readers. Purgatory with
   him is a bed of roses with here and there a thorn, instead of the lake
   of real fire and brimstone which glares through all Church history.

   [803] In the passage quoted in part on a preceding page, Cardinal
   Wiseman says: "No fasting, no prayers, no alms-deeds, no works that we
   can conceive to be by man, however protracted, however expensive or
   rigorous they may be, can, according to the Catholic doctrine, have the
   most infinitesimal weight for obtaining the remission of sin, or of the
   eternal punishment allotted to it. This constitutes the essence of
   forgiveness, of justification, and in it we hold that man has no power.
   Now, let us come to the remaining part of the sacrament [of penance].
   We believe that upon this forgiveness of sins, that is, after the
   remission of that eternal debt, which God in his justice awards to
   transgressions against his law, He has been pleased to reserve a
   certain degree of inferior or temporary punishment appropriate to the
   guilt which had been incurred; and it is on this part of the punishment
   alone, that, according to the Catholic doctrine, satisfaction can be
   made to God." Lectures, ut supra, vol. ii. p. 35.

CHAPTER II.

  THE RESURRECTION.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Scriptural Doctrine.

   By the resurrection is not meant the continued existence of the soul
   after death. The fact that the Sadducees in the time of Christ, against
   whom most of the arguments found in the New Testament in favour of the
   doctrine of the resurrection were directed, denied not only that
   doctrine, but also that of the continued existence of the soul after
   death, sufficiently accounts for the sacred writings combining the two
   subjects. Thus our Lord, in reasoning with the Sadducees, said: "As
   touching the dead, that they rise; have ye not read in the book of
   Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of
   Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God
   of the dead, but the God of the living." (Mark xii. 26.) All that this
   passage directly proves is that the dead continue alive after the
   dissolution of the body. But as this is Christ's answer to a question
   concerning the resurrection, it has been inferred that the resurrection
   means nothing more than that the soul does not die with the body, but
   rises to a new and higher life. Thus also the Apostle in the elaborate
   argument contained in 1 Corinthians xv. evidently regards the denial of
   the resurrection as tantamount with the denial of the future life of
   the soul. Hence many maintain that the only resurrection of which the
   Bible speaks is the resurrection of the soul when the body dies. The
   first position, therefore, to be defended, in stating the Scriptural
   doctrine on this subject is, that our bodies are the subjects of the
   resurrection spoken of in the Scriptures.

   The Bodies of Men are to rise again.

   This is denied, first, by those who take the word resurrection in a
   figurative sense, expressing the rising of the soul from spiritual
   death to spiritual life. At the grave of Lazarus Martha said to our
   Lord, "I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last
   day." To which our Lord, according to Mr. Alger, replies substantially,
   "You suppose that in the last day the Messiah will restore the dead to
   live again upon the earth. I am the Messiah, and the last days have
   therefore arrived. I am commissioned by the Father to bestow eternal
   life upon all who believe on me; but not in the manner you have
   anticipated. The true resurrection is not calling the body from the
   tomb, but opening the fountains of eternal life in the soul. I am come
   to open the spiritual world to your faith. He that believeth in me and
   keepeth my commandments, has passed from death unto life become
   conscious that though seemingly he passes into the grave, yet really he
   shall live with God forever. The true resurrection is, to come into the
   experience of the truth that, God is not the God of the dead but of the
   living; for all live unto Him.' Over the soul that is filled with such
   an experience, death has no power. Verily, I say unto you, the hour is
   coming, and now is, when the dead, the ignorant and guilty, buried in
   trespasses and sins, shall lay hold of the life thus offered, and be
   blessed." [820]

   Secondly, the resurrection of the body is denied by those who, with the
   Swedenborgians, hold that man, in this life, has two bodies, an
   external and internal, a material and psychical. [821] The former dies
   and is deposited in the grave, and there remains never to rise again.
   The other does not die, but in union with the soul passes into another
   state of existence. The only resurrection, therefore, which is ever to
   occur, takes place at the moment of death.

   Thirdly, it is denied by those who assume that the soul as pure spirit,
   cannot be individualized or localized; that it cannot have any relation
   to space, or act or be acted upon, without a corporeity of some kind;
   and who, therefore, assume that it must be furnished with a new, more
   refined, ethereal body, as soon as its earthly tabernacle is laid
   aside. The resurrection body is according to this view also furnished
   at the moment of death.

   That the Scriptures, however, teach a literal resurrection of the body
   is proved, (1.) From the meaning of the word. Resurrection signifies a
   rising again; a rising of that which was buried; or a restoration of
   life to that which was dead. But the soul, according to the Scriptures,
   does not die when the body is dissolved. It, therefore, cannot be the
   subject of a resurrection except in the sense antithetical to spiritual
   death, which is not now in question. The same is true of the psychical
   body, if there be such a thing. It does not die, and, therefore, cannot
   rise again. The same may also be said of a new body furnished the soul
   when its earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved.

   (2.) Those who are in the dust of the earth; those "that are in the
   graves" are said to rise. But it is only of the body that it can be
   said, it is in the grave; and, therefore, it is of the body the
   resurrection spoken of, must be understood.

   (3.) It is "our mortal bodies" which are to rise again. This form of
   expression is decisive of the Apostle's meaning. "He that raised Christ
   from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that
   dwelleth in you." (Rom. viii. 11.) It is "our vile body" which is to be
   fashioned like unto Christ's glorious body. (Phil. iii. 21.)

   (4.) This also is clearly the doctrine taught in the fifteenth chapter
   of First Corinthians. There were certain errorists in Corinth who
   denied the fact and the desirableness of the resurrection of believers.
   Paul's argument is directed to both those points. As to the fact that
   the dead can rise, he refers to what no Christian could deny, the
   rising of Christ from the dead. This, as a historical fact, he supports
   by historical evidence. He then shows that the denial of the
   resurrection of Christ, is the denial of the whole Gospel, which rests
   on that fact. "If Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
   your faith is also vain." But if Christ rose from the dead, all his
   people must. Christ rose as the first fruits of them that sleep. There
   is in Paul's view, the same divinely appointed, and therefore necessary
   connection between the resurrection of Christ and that of his people,
   as between the death of Adam and that of his descendants. As surely as
   all in Adam die, so surely shall all in Christ be made alive. And
   finally, on this point, the Apostle condescends to argue from the faith
   and practice of the Church. What is the use, he asks, of being baptized
   for the dead, if the dead rise not? The whole daily life of the
   Christian is founded, he says, on the hope of the resurrection; not of
   the continued existence of the soul merely, but of the glorious
   existence of the whole man, soul and body, with Christ in heaven. As to
   the second point, the desirableness of the resurrection of the body, he
   shows that all objections on this score are founded on the assumption
   that the future is to be like the present body. He says that the man
   who makes that objection is a fool. The two are no more alike than a
   seed and a flower, a clod of earth and a stare the earthly and the
   heavenly. "It [the body of course] is sown in corruption. it is raised
   in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory: it is
   sown in weakness, it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body, it
   is raised a spiritual body." This whole discourse, therefore, is about
   the body. To the objection that our present bodies are not adapted to
   our future state of existence, he answers, Granted; it is true that
   flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; this corruptible
   must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. It
   would seem that the Apostle in this chapter must have had in his eye a
   host of writers in our day who make themselves merry with the doctrine
   of the resurrection, on much the same grounds as those relied upon by
   the errorists of Corinth, whose fragments he scattered to the winds
   eighteen centuries ago.

   (5.) Another argument on this subject is drawn from the analogy
   constantly presented, between the resurrection of Christ and that of
   his people. The sacred writers, as we have seen, argue the possibility
   and the certainty of the resurrection of our bodies, from the fact of
   Christ's resurrection; and the nature of our future bodies from the
   nature of his body in heaven. There would be no force in this argument
   if the body were not the thing which is to rise again.

   (6.) Finally, as Paul argued from the faith of the Church, we cannot
   err in following his example. The Bible is a plain book, and the whole
   Christian world, in all ages, has understood it to teach, not this or
   that, but the literal rising from the dead of the body deposited in the
   grave. All Christians of every denomination are taught to say, I
   believe in "The forgiveness of sins; The resurrection of the body; And
   the life everlasting."

   The Identity of the Future with our Present Body.

   There are two distinct questions to be here considered. First, Do the
   Scriptures teach that the resurrection body is to be the same as that
   deposited in the grave? Second, Wherein does that sameness or identity
   consist? The first of these questions we may be able to answer with
   confidence; the second we may not be able to answer at all.

   The arguments to prove that we are hereafter to have the same bodies
   that we have in the present life, are substantially the same as those
   already adduced. Indeed, identity is involved in the very idea of a
   resurrection; for resurrection is a living again of that which was
   dead; not of something of the same nature, but of the very thing
   itself. And all the passages already quoted as proving the resurrection
   of the body, assume or declare that it is the same body that rises. It
   is our present "mortal bodies;" "our vile body;" it is "this
   corruptible," "this mortal;" it is that which is sown, of which the
   resurrection and transformation is predicted and promised. Our
   resurrection is to be analogous to that of Christ; but in his case
   there can be no doubt that the very body which hung upon the cross, and
   which laid in the tomb, rose again from the dead. Otherwise it would
   have been no resurrection. This identity was the very thing Christ was
   anxious to prove to his doubting disciples. He showed them his pierced
   hands and feet, and his perforated side. On this subject, however,
   there is little difference of opinion. Wherever the resurrection of the
   body is an article of faith the identity of the present and future body
   has been admitted. The usual form of Christian burial, in the case of
   the faithful, has ever been, "We commit this body to the grave in the
   sure hope of a blessed resurrection."

   Wherein does this Identity consist?

   It is obvious that identity in different cases depends on very
   different conditions. First, in the case of unorganized matter, as a
   clod of earth or a stone, the identity depends on the continuity of
   substance and of form. If the stone be reduced to powder and scattered
   abroad, the same substance continues, but not in the same combination;
   and therefore the identity is gone. In what sense is water in a goblet
   the same from hour to hour, or from day to day? It is the same
   substance resulting from the combination of oxygen and hydrogen, and it
   is the same portion of that substance. If that goblet be emptied into
   the ocean, what becomes of the identity of the water which it
   contained? If you separate the water into its constituent gases, the
   elementary substances continue, but they are no longer water. You may
   change its state without destroying its identity. If frozen into ice
   and again thawed, it is the same water. If evaporated into steam, and
   then condensed, it is the same water still. This sameness, of which
   continuance of the same substance is the essential element, is the
   lowest form of identity. In the Church it has often been assumed that
   sameness of substance is essential to the identity between our present
   and future bodies. This idea has been pressed sometimes to the utmost
   extreme. Augustine seems to have thought that all the matter which at
   any period entered into the organism of our present bodies, would in
   some way be restored in the resurrection body. Every man's body,
   however dispersed here, shall be restored perfect in the resurrection.
   Every body shall be complete in quantity and quality. As many hairs as
   have been shaved off, or nails cut, shall not return in such vast
   quantities as to deform their original places; but neither shall they
   perish; they shall return into the body into that substance from which
   they grew. [822] Thomas Aquinas was more moderate. He taught that only
   those particles which entered into the composition of the body at
   death, would enter into the composition of the resurrection body. This
   idea seems to have entered into the theology of Romanists, as some at
   least of the theologians of the Church of Rome labour to remove the
   objection to this view of the subject derived from the fact that the
   particles of the human body after death are not only dispersed far and
   wide and mingled with the dust of the earth, but also enter into the
   composition of the bodies of plants, of animals, and of men. To this
   Perrone answers, "Difficile Deo non est moleculas omnes ad corpus
   aliquod spectantes, etiam post innumeros transitus ex uno in aliud
   colligere. Hæc mutatio seu transitus accidentalis est, minime vere
   essentialis, ut ex physiologia ac zoobiologia constat universa." [823]
   It is true, as our Lord teaches us: "With God all things are possible;"
   and if sameness of substance be essential to that identity between our
   present and future bodies, which the Bible asserts, then we should have
   to submit to these difficulties, satisfied that it is within the power
   of omniscient omnipotence to do whatever God has promised to effect.

   Others assume that it is not necessary to the identity contended for
   that all the particles of the body at death should be included in the
   resurrection body. It is enough that the new body should be formed
   exclusively out of particles belonging to the present body. But as the
   body after the resurrection is to be refined and ethereal, a tenth, a
   hundredth, or a ten thousandth portion of those particles would
   suffice. It would take very little of gross matter to make a body of
   light. Tertullian thought that God had rendered the teeth
   indestructible in order to furnish material for the future body. Many
   others also suppose that there is somewhere an indestructible germ in
   our present body, which is to be developed into the body of the future.
   [824]

   Secondly, in works of art sameness of substance holds a very
   subordinate part. The Apollo Belvidere once lay dormant in a block of
   marble. The central portion of that block containing every particle of
   matter in the statue was not the Apollo of the artist. Could every
   particle clipped off, be restored, the substance would remain, but the
   statue would be gone. Here form, expression, the informing idea are the
   main constituents of identity. If a penitentiary should be taken down,
   and the materials be employed in the construction of a cathedral, the
   substance would be the same, but not the building. When you look into a
   mirror the image reflected remains the same, but not the substance; for
   that is changed with every new reflection. And if it were possible, or
   proved, that in like manner the Madonna del Sixti of Raphael had a
   thousand times changed its substance, it would remain the same picture
   still. The soul here informs the body. The character is more or less
   visibly impressed upon the face. We know the former by looking at the
   latter. If this be so, if the soul have power thus to illuminate and
   render intelligent the gross material of our present frames, why may it
   not hereafter render its ethereal vestment so expressive of itself as
   to be at once recognized by all to whom it was ever known. Thus we may
   at once recognize Isaiah, Paul, and John. It is not said that this will
   be so; that herein lies the identity of their heavenly and earthly
   bodies; but should it prove to be true, we should not stop to inquire
   or to care how many particles of the one enter into the composition of
   the other.

   Thirdly, identity in living organisms is something still higher, and
   more inscrutable than in works of art. The acorn and the oak are the
   same; but in what sense? Not in substance, not in form. The infant and
   the man are the same, through all the stages of life; boyhood, manhood,
   and old age; the substance of the body, however, is in a state of
   perpetual change. It is said this change is complete once every seven
   years. Hence if a man live to be seventy years old, the substance of
   his body has, during that period, been entirely changed ten times.
   Here, then, is an identity independent of sameness of substance. Our
   future bodies, therefore, may be the same as those we now have,
   although not a particle that was in the one should be in the other.

   The object of these remarks on the different kinds of identity, is not
   to explain anything. It is not intended to teach wherein the identity
   of the earthly and heavenly consists; whether it be an identity of
   substance; or of expression and idea, as in works of art; or of the
   uninterrupted continuity of the same vital force as in the plant and
   animal through their whole progress of growth and decay; or whether it
   is a sameness which includes all these; or something different from
   them all. Nothing is affirmed. The subject is left where the Bible
   leaves it. The object aimed at is twofold; first, to show that it is
   perfectly rational for a man to assert the identity between our present
   and our future bodies, although he is forced to admit that he does not
   know wherein that identity is to consist. This is no more than what all
   men have to admit concerning the continued sameness of our present
   bodies. And, secondly, to stop the mouths of gainsayers. They ridicule
   the idea of a resurrection of the body; asking if the infant is to rise
   as an infant; the old man, wrinkled and decrepid; the maimed as maimed;
   the obese with their cumbrous load; and by such questions think they
   have refuted a Scripture doctrine. The Bible teaches no such
   absurdities; and no Church goes beyond the Scriptures in asserting two
   things, namely: that the body is to rise, and that it is to be the same
   after the resurrection that it was before; but neither the Bible nor
   the Church determines wherein that sameness is to consist.

   With regard to our present bodies, the fact of their continued identity
   is not denied. According to one view the principle of this identity is
   in the body and perishes, or ceases, with it. According to another,
   although in the body, it does not perish with it, but remains united to
   the soul, and under appropriate circumstances fashions for itself a new
   body. According to others, this vital principle is in the soul itself.
   Agassiz, as a zoologist, teaches that with every living germ there is
   an immaterial principle by which one species is distinguished from
   another, and which determines that the germ of a fish develops into a
   fish; and that of a bird, into a bird, although the two germs are
   exactly the same (i.e., alike) in substance and structure. When the
   individual dies, this immaterial principle ceases to exist. This is
   Agassiz's doctrine. Dr. Julius Müller [825] thinks that this vital
   organizing force continues in union with the soul, but is not operative
   between death and the resurrection. He says, "it is not the sarx, the
   mass of earthly material, . . . . but the soma, the organic whole, to
   which the Scriptures promise a resurrection. . . . . The organism, as
   the living form which appropriates matter to itself, is the true body,
   which in its glorification becomes the soma pneumatikon. But he
   understands the Apostle in 2 Corinthians v. 4, as clearly teaching that
   the soul during the interval between death and the resurrection remains
   unclothed. Dr. Lange, whose imagination often dominates him, teaches
   that the soul was created to be incarnate; and therefore was endowed
   with forces and talents to that end. In virtue of its nature, it as
   certainly gathers from surrounding matter the materials for a body, as
   a seed gathers from the earth and air the matter suited to its
   necessities. He assumes, therefore, that there is in the soul "a law or
   force, which secures its forming for itself a body suited to its
   necessities and sphere or more properly," he adds, "the organic
   identity" may be characterized as the "Schema des Leibes," which is
   included in the soul, or, as the "Incarnationstrieb des Geistes;" a
   "nisus formativus" which belongs to the human soul. [826] The soul
   while on earth forms for itself a body out of earthly materials; when
   it leaves the earth it fashions a habitation for itself out of the
   materials to be found in the higher sphere to which it is translated;
   and at the end of the world, when the grand palingenesia is to occur,
   the souls of men, according to their nature, will fashion bodies for
   themselves out of the elements of the dissolving universe. "The
   righteous will clothe themselves with the refined elements of the
   renovated earth; they shall shine as the sun. The wicked shall be
   clothed with the refuse of the earth; they shall awake to shame and
   everlasting contempt." [827]

   Leaving out of view what is fanciful in this representation, it may be
   readily admitted by those who adhere to the generally received doctrine
   that man consists of soul and body (and not of spirit, soul, and body),
   that the soul, besides its rational, voluntary, and moral faculties,
   has in it what may be called a principle of animal life. That is, that
   it has not only faculties which fit it for the higher exercises of a
   rational creature capable of fellowship with God, but also faculties
   which fit it for living in organic union with a material body. It may
   also be admitted that the soul, in this aspect, is the animating
   principle of the body, that by which all its functions are carried on.
   And it may further be admitted that the soul, in this aspect, is that
   which gives identity to the human body through all the changes of
   substance to which it is here subjected. And finally it may be
   admitted, such being the case, that the body which the soul is to have
   at the resurrection, is as really and truly identical with that which
   it had on earth, as the body of the man of mature life is the same
   which he had when he was an infant. All this may pass for what it is
   worth. What stands sure is what the Bible teaches, that our heavenly
   bodies are in some high, true, and real sense, to be the same as those
   which we now have.

   Nature of the Resurrection Body.

   It is obvious that this is a subject of which we can know nothing,
   except from divine revelation. We are of necessity as profoundly
   ignorant of this matter, as of the nature of the inhabitants of the
   planets or of the sun. The speculations of men concerning the nature of
   the future body have been numerous; some merely fanciful, others,
   revolting.

   There are two negative statements in the Bible on this subject, which
   imply a great deal. One is the declaration of Christ, That in the
   resurrection men neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as
   the angels of God. The other is the words of Paul in 1 Corinthians xv.
   50, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God." There seem to
   be plainly three things implied or asserted in these passages. (1.)
   That the bodies of men must be specially suited to the state of
   existence in which they are to live and act. (2.) That our present
   bodies, that is, our bodies as now organized, consisting as they do of
   flesh and blood, are not adapted to our future state of being. And (3.)
   That everything in the organization or constitution of our bodies
   designed to meet our present necessities, will cease with the life that
   now is. Nothing of that kind will belong to the resurrection body. If
   blood be no longer our life, we shall have no need of organs of
   respiration and nutrition. So long as we are ignorant of the conditions
   of existence which await us after the resurrection, it is vain to
   speculate on the constitution of our future bodies. It is enough to
   know that the glorified people of God will not be cumbered with useless
   organs, or trammeled by the limitations which are imposed by our
   present state of existence.

   The following particulars, however, may be inferred with more or less
   confidence from what the Bible has revealed on this subject, --

   1. That our bodies after the resurrection will retain the human form.
   God, we are told, gave to all his creatures on earth each its own body
   adapted to its nature, and necessary to attain the end of its creation.
   Any essential change in the nature of the body would involve a
   corresponding change in its internal constitution. A bee in the form of
   a horse would cease to be a bee and a man in any other than a human
   form, would cease to be a man. His body is an essential element in his
   constitution. Every intimation given in Scripture on this subject,
   tends to sustain this conclusion. Every time Christ appeared to his
   disciples not only before, but also after his ascension, as to Stephen,
   Paul, and John, it was in human form. Origen conceited that, because
   the circle is the most perfect figure, the future body will be
   globular. But a creature in that form would not be recognized either in
   earth or heaven as a man.

   2. It is probable that the future body will not only retain the human
   form, but that it will also be a glorified likeness of what it was on
   earth. We know that every man has here his individual character, --
   peculiarities mental and emotional which distinguish him from every
   other man. We know that his body by its expression, air, and carriage
   more or less clearly reveals his character. This revelation of the
   inward by the outward will probably be far more exact and informing in
   heaven than it can be here on earth. How should we know Peter or John
   in heaven, if there were not something in their appearance and bearing
   corresponding to the image of themselves impressed by their writings on
   the minds of all their readers?

   3. This leads to the further remark that we shall not only recognize
   our friends in heaven, but also know, without introduction, prophets,
   apostles, confessors, and martyrs, of whom we have read or heard while
   here on earth. (a.) This is altogether probable from the nature of the
   case. If the future body is to be the same with the present, why should
   not that sameness, whatever else it may include, include a certain
   sameness of appearance. (b.) When Moses and Elias appeared on the mount
   with Christ, they were at once known by the disciples. Their appearance
   corresponded so exactly with the conceptions formed from the Old
   Testament account of their character and conduct, that no doubt was
   entertained on the subject. (c.) It is said that we are to sit down
   with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. This implies
   that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be known; and if they are known
   surely others will be known also. (d.) It is promised that our cup of
   happiness will then be full; but it could not be full, unless we met in
   heaven those whom we loved on earth. Man is a social being with a soul
   full of social affections, and as he is to be a man in heaven, is it
   not likely that he will retain all his social affections there? God
   would hardly have put this pure yearning in the hearts of his people if
   it were never to be gratified. David weeping over his dead son, said,
   "I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me." And this has been
   the language of every bereaved heart from that day to this. (e.) The
   Bible clearly teaches that man is to retain all his faculties in the
   future life. One of the most important of those faculties is memory. If
   this were not retained there would be a chasm in our existence. The
   past for us would cease to exist. We could hardly, if at all, be
   conscious of our identity. We should enter heaven, as creatures newly
   created, who had no history. Then all the songs of heaven would cease.
   There could be no thanksgiving for redemption; no recognition of all
   God's dealings with us in this world. Memory, however, is not only to
   continue, but will doubtless with all our faculties be greatly exalted,
   so that the records of the past may be as legible to us as the events
   of the present. If this be so, if men are to retain in heaven the
   knowledge of their earthly life; this of course involves the
   recollection of all social relations, of all the ties of respect, love,
   and gratitude which bind men in the family and in society. (f.) The
   doctrine that in a future life we shall recognize those whom we knew
   and loved on earth, has entered into the faith of all mankind. It is
   taken for granted in the Bible, both in the Old Testament and in the
   New. The patriarchs always spoke of going to their fathers when they
   died. The Apostle exhorts believers not to mourn for the departed as
   those who have no hope; giving them the assurance that they shall be
   reunited with all those who die in the Lord.

   4. We know certainly that the future bodies of believers are to be, --
   (a.) Incorruptible; not merely destined never to decay, but not
   susceptible of corruption. By the certain action of physical laws, our
   present body, as soon as deserted by the soul, is reduced to a mass of
   corruption, so revolting that we hasten to bury our dead out of our
   sight. The future body will be liable to no such change; neither, as we
   learn from Scripture, will it be subject to those diseases and
   accidents which so often mar the beauty or destroy the energy of the
   bodies in which we now dwell. Being unsusceptible of decay, they will
   be incapable of, or at least, carefully preserved from, suffering, by
   Him who has promised to wash all tears from our eyes.

   (b.) The future body is to be immortal. This is something different
   from, something higher than incorruptible; the latter is negative, the
   other positive; the one implies immunity from decay; the other not
   merely immunity from death, but perpetuity of life. There is to be no
   decrepitude of age no decay of the faculties; no loss of vigour; but
   immortal youth.

   (c.) The present body is sown in weakness, it will be raised in power.
   We know very well how weak we now are, how little we can effect; how
   few are our senses; how limited their range; but we do not yet know in
   what ways, or in what measure our power is to be increased. It is
   probable that however high may be our expectations on this subject,
   they will fall short of the reality; for it doth not yet appear, it is
   not revealed in experience or in hope, what we shall be. We may have
   new senses, new and greatly exalted capabilities of taking cognizance
   of external things, of apprehending their nature and of deriving
   knowledge and enjoyment from their wonders and their beauties. Instead
   of the slow and wearisome means of locomotion to which we are now
   confined, we may be able hereafter to pass with the velocity of light
   or of thought itself from one part of the universe to another. Our
   power of vision, instead of being confined to the range of a few
   hundred yards, may far exceed that of the most powerful telescope.
   These expectations cannot be extravagant, for we are assured that eye
   hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of
   man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for them that love
   Him.

   (d.) The body is sown in dishonour, it shall be raised in glory. Glory
   is that which excites wonder, admiration, and delight. The bodies of
   the saints are to be fashioned like unto Christ's glorious body. We
   shall be like Him when we see Him as He is. More than this cannot be
   said; what it means we know not now, but we shall know hereafter. We
   already know that when the body of Christ was transfigured upon the
   mount, the Apostles fainted and became as dead men in its presence; and
   we know that when He shall come again the second time unto salvation
   the heavens and the earth shall flee away at the sight of his glory.
   Let it suffice us to know that as we have borne the image of the
   earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. Well might the
   Apostle exhort believers not to mourn for the pious dead, whom they are
   to see again, arrayed in a beauty and glory of which we can now have no
   conception.

   (e.) It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. When
   words are used thus antithetically, the meaning of the one enables us
   to determine the meaning of the other. We can, therefore, in this case
   learn what the word "spiritual" means, from what we know ot the meaning
   of the word "natural." The psuchikon, translated "natural," as every
   one knows, is derived from psuche, which means sometimes the life;
   sometimes the principle of animal life which men have in common with
   the brutes; and sometimes the soul in the ordinary and comprehensive
   sense of the term; the rational and immortal principle of our nature;
   that in which our personality resides; so that to say "My soul
   rejoices," or, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful," is equivalent to
   saying, "I rejoice," or, "I am sorrowful." Such being the signification
   of the psuche, it is plain that soma psuchikon, the psychical, or
   natural, body, cannot by possibility mean a body made out of the
   psuche. In like manner it is no less plain that soma pneumatikon cannot
   by possibility mean a body made of spirit. That indeed would be as much
   a contradiction in terms, as to speak of a spirit made out of matter.
   Again, we know that man has an animal as well as a rational nature;
   that is, his soul is endowed not only with reason and conscience, but
   also with sensibilities, or faculties which enable it to take
   cognizance of the appetites of the body, as hunger and thirst, and of
   its sensations of pleasure and pain. These appetites and sensations are
   states of consciousness of the soul. The soma psuchikon, or natural
   body, therefore, is a body adapted to the soul in this aspect of its
   nature; and the soma pneumatikon, or spiritual body, is a body adapted
   to the higher attributes of the soul. We know from experience what the
   former is; it is an earthly body, made of the dust of the earth. The
   chemist can analyze it, and reduce it to its constituents of ammonia,
   hydrogen, carbon, etc.; and in the grave it soon becomes
   undistinguishable from other portions of the earth's surface. It is a
   body which, while living, has constant need of being repaired; it must
   be sustained by the oxygen of the air, and by the chemical elements of
   its food. It soon grows weary, and must be refreshed by rest and sleep.
   In a little more than seventy years, it is worn out, and drops into the
   grave. The reverse of this is true of the spiritual body; it has no
   such necessities, and is not subject to such weariness and decay. It is
   no doubt involved in the fact, that while our present bodies are
   adapted to the lower faculties of our nature, and the spiritual body to
   our higher faculties, that the latter must be more refined, ætherial,
   and, as Paul says, heavenly, than the other. Even now the soul, in one
   sense, pervades the body. It is in every part of it; it is sensible of
   all its changes of state; it gives to it a look and carriage which
   reveal man as the lord of this world. To a far greater degree may the
   soul permeate the refined and glorified body which it is to receive at
   the resurrection of the just; and thus render it to a degree now
   incomprehensible, in its very nature spiritual. If the face of man
   formed out of the dust of the earth often beams with intelligence and
   glows with elevated emotions, what may be expected of a countenance
   made like unto that of the Son of God.

   If then our future bodies are to retain the human form; to be easily
   distinguished by those who knew and loved us on earth; if they are to
   be endued with an unknown power; if they are to be incorruptible,
   immortal, and spiritual; if we are to bear the image of the heavenly,
   we may well bow down with humble and joyful hearts and receive the
   exhortation of the Apostle: "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
   steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,
   forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."

   § 2. History of the Doctrine.

   The doctrine of the resurrection of the body is not exclusively a
   doctrine of the Bible. It is found, in different forms, in many of the
   ancient religions of the world. This is the more remarkable as it is in
   itself so improbable, and so much out of the analogy of nature. One
   generation of plants and animals succeeds another in uninterrupted
   succession; but the same individuals never reappear. The case is the
   more remarkable when we consider the difficulties with which the
   doctrine is beset; difficulties so great that it is rejected and even
   ridiculed by all in this generation who do not recognize the sacred
   Scriptures as an authority from which they dare not dissent. When such
   doctrines are found not only in the Bible but also in the religions of
   heathen nations it may be assumed that the Hebrews borrowed then, from
   their heathen neighbours. This is the hypothesis adopted generally by
   rationalists. They urge in its support that the doctrine of Satan, of
   the resurrection of the body, and of the destruction and renovation of
   the earth, do not appear in those portions of the Scriptures which were
   written before the Babylonish captivity. To carry out this argument
   they refer Job, Daniel, and a large portion of Isaiah to a period
   subsequent to the exile, contrary to evidence both external and
   internal in favour of the greater antiquity of those books. Even if it
   be conceded that the doctrines do not appear distinctly in any but the
   later writings of the Old Testament, that would not justify the
   assumption of their heathen origin, provided that their genesis can be
   traced in the earlier books of Scripture. Nothing is more obvious, or
   more generally admitted than the progressive character of the divine
   revelations. Doctrines at first obscurely intimated are gradually
   developed. This is the case with the doctrines of the Trinity, of the
   personality of the Holy Spirit, of the divinity of Christ, of the
   nature of his redemption, of the future state; and, as might be
   expected, of the resurrection of the dead. It is just as unreasonable
   and as unhistorical to say that the Church received the doctrine of the
   resurrection of the body from the heathen, as that it received from
   Plato the doctrine of the Trinity. There is another consideration on
   this subject, which for the Christian is decisive. The doctrines which
   in the New Testament are declared to be part of the revelation of God,
   are thereby declared not to be of heathen origin. The heathen may have
   held them, as they hold the doctrine of the existence of God and of the
   immortality of man; that does not prove that such doctrines have only a
   human origin and human authority.

   These things being premised, it is admitted as a remarkable fact that
   belief in the resurrection of the body did prevail among the ancients
   prior to the advent of Christ. Reference is sometimes made to the
   Brahminic doctrine of the constant succession of cycles of countless
   ages in the history of the universe, one cycle being a reproduction or
   renewal of another, as having an analogy to the Christian doctrine of
   the resurrection. "The first appearance of this notion of a bodily
   restoration," says Mr. Alger, [828] "which occurs in the history of
   opinions, is among the ancient Hindus. With them it appears as a part
   of a vast conception, embracing the whole universe in an endless series
   of total growths, decays, and exact restorations. In the beginning the
   Supreme Being is one and alone. He thinks to himself I wills become
   many' [This is a figure of speech; for according to the Hindu system
   the Supreme Being, the Absolute, cannot think]. Straight way the
   multiform creation germinates forth, and all beings live. Then for an
   inconceivable period -- a length of time commensurate with the
   existence of Brahma, the Demiurgus [This again is a mixture of ideas,
   for Brahma of the Hindus does not correspond with the Demiurgus of the
   Greeks] -- the successive generations flourish and sink. At the end of
   this period all forms of matter, all creatures, sages, and gods, fall
   back into the Universal Source whence they arose. Again the Supreme
   Being is one and alone. After an interval the same causes produce the
   same effects, and all things recur exactly as they were before." [829]
   According to the Hindu system men have not to wait for the conclusion
   of one of these great cycles to be absorbed in the Supreme Being. By a
   life strictly conformed to prescribed rules, and by a process of
   complete self-abnegation, they attain a state in which they are lost in
   the Infinite as drops of rain in the ocean. As individuals they can
   never be reproduced, any more than the drops of rain can be recovered
   from the ocean. The ocean, by evaporation may produce other clouds
   which shall fall in other drops of rain; but this is not a reproduction
   of those which fell a thousand years ago. There is therefore no analogy
   between this theory and the Christian doctrine of the resurrection.

   "The same general conception," continues Mr. Alger, [830] "in a
   modified form was held by the Stoics of later Greece, who doubtless
   borrowed it from the East, and who carried it out in greater detail.
   God is an artistic fire, out of which the cosmopoeia issues.' This fire
   proceeds in a certain fixed course, in obedience to a fixed law,
   passing through certain intermediate gradations, and established
   periods, until it returns into itself and closes with a universal
   conflagation. . . . . The Stoics supposed each succeeding formation to
   be perfectly like the preceding. Every particular that happens now, has
   happened exactly so a thousand times before, and will happen a thousand
   times again. This view they connected with astronomical calculations
   making the burning and recreating of the world coincide with the same
   position of the stars as that at which it previously occurred. This
   they called the restoration of all things. The idea of these enormous
   revolving identical periods -- Day of Brahm, Cycle of the Stoics, or
   Great Year of Plato -- is a physical fatalism, effecting a universal
   resurrection of the past, by reproducing it over and over forever."
   [831]

   In the first volume of this work the attempt was made to show that the
   Brahminical and several Grecian systems of philosophy, were only
   different modifications of the pantheistic theory of the Infinite by
   fixed and necessary laws manifesting itself in the finite in all its
   endless diversities of forms. This endless succession of individuals,
   however, has no affinity with the Bible doctrine of the resurrection of
   the dead. The flora and fauna of this are not a resurrection of the
   plants and animals of the geologic periods.

   In the religion of Zoroaster there is a far nearer approach to the
   doctrines of the Bible. [832] As the Scriptures teach that God at first
   created all things good, and made man after his own image, and placed
   him upon probation in Eden; so Zoroaster taught that Ormuzd created all
   things good, and that all were sinless and happy, and fitted for
   immortality. And as the Bible teaches that through the seduction of
   Satan man fell from his original state, and became the subject of sin,
   misery, and death; so in the religion of the ancient Persians it is
   taught, that Ahriman, the personal principle of evil, co-eternal with
   Ormuzd the principle of good, effected the ruin of man for this world
   and the next. Such was the origin of evil; such was the beginning of
   the conflict between good and evil, of which our earth has been the
   theatre. Both systems teach the ultimate triumph of the good, and the
   redemption of man; both teach a future state, the resurrection of the
   body, and the renewal of the earth, or, that there are to be a new
   heaven and a new earth. It is certain from the teachings of the New
   Testament that the Hebrews did not derive these doctrines from the
   Persians; it is, therefore, in the highest degree probable that the
   Persians derived them from their neighbours of the family of Shem, who
   were the depositaries of the revelations of God.

   It has already been seen that the doctrine of the resurrection of the
   body was clearly taught in the Old Testament, and in the apocryphal
   books of the Jews; that it was a cardinal article of faith among the
   Jews when Christ came into the world; and that it was emphatically
   asserted by Christ and his Apostles. We have also seen that the Bible
   teaches nothing on this subject beyond (1.) That the body is to rise
   again. (2.) That its identity will be preserved. And (3.) That it is to
   be so changed and refined as to adapt it to the high state of existence
   to which it is destined. In this simple form the doctrine has ever been
   held by the Church, which is not responsible for the fanciful theories
   adopted by many of its members.

   The philosophical theologians of the Alexandrian school, in the early
   Church, were disposed to spiritualize all the Bible says of the
   resurrection of the body, and of its future state. The Latins, on the
   other hand, adhered to a literal interpretation of Scriptural language,
   often to the grossest extremes. Augustine, as we have seen, thought the
   resurrection body was to be composed of all the matter that ever
   belonged to it in this world, and Jerome asks: "If men are not raised
   with flesh and bones, how can the damned gnash their teeth in hell?"
   [833]

   During the Middle Ages, the faith of the Church, on this subject,
   remained unchanged. The speculations of individual writers were
   diverse, inconsistent, and of little interest, because of no authority.

   At the time of the Reformation the simple doctrine of the Bible was
   reaffirmed; and theologians beyond those limits were left to their own
   guidance. The form in which the doctrine was usually presented by the
   theologians of the seventeenth century, was: (1.) That the resurrection
   body is to be numerically and in substance, one with the present body.
   (2.) That it is to have the same organs of sight, hearing, etc., as in
   this life. (3.) Many held that all the peculiarities of the present
   body as to size or stature, appearance, etc., are to be restored. (4.)
   As the bodies of the righteous are to be refined and glorified, those
   of the wicked, it was assumed, would be proportionately repulsive. The
   later Protestant theologians, as well Lutheran as Reformed, confine
   themselves more strictly within the limits of Scripture.

   Rationalism, as far as it prevailed, swept the whole doctrine away.
   Reason does not teach the doctrine, and cannot explain it; therefore,
   it has no title to recognition. Deistical rationalists admitted that
   the doctrine was taught in the Scriptures, but this was to them only an
   additional reason for denying their divine origin. The more moderate
   rationalists, who admitted the Bible to be a revelation of the truths
   of reason, or of natural religion, explained away all that it teaches
   concerning the resurrection, making it refer to the rising of the soul
   from a state of sin to a state of holiness; or, as relating not to the
   resurrection of the body, but to the continued life of the soul in a
   future state.

   Of course the modern speculative, or pantheistic theology, ignores the
   doctrine of a resurrection. It does not even admit of the existence of
   the soul after the dissolution of the body. The race is immortal, but
   the individuals of which it is composed are not. Scientific materialism
   admits of no other resurrection than the reappearance of the same
   chemical elements which now form our bodies, in the bodies of future
   plants, animals, or men. The lime in our bones may help to form the
   bones of those who come after us. Thus philosophy and science, when
   divorced from the Bible, lead us only to negations, darkness, and
   despair.

CHAPTER III.

  SECOND ADVENT.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. Preliminary Remarks.

   This is a very comprehensive and very difficult subject. It is
   intimately allied with all the other great doctrines which fall under
   the head of eschatology. It has excited so much interest in all ages of
   the Church, that the books written upon it would of themselves make a
   library. The subject cannot be adequately discussed without taking a
   survey of all the prophetic teachings of the Scriptures both of the Old
   Testament and of the New. This task cannot be satisfactorily
   accomplished by any one who has not made the study of the prophecies a
   specialty. The author, knowing that he has no such qualifications for
   the work, purposes to confine himself in a great measure to a
   historical survey of the different schemes of interpreting the
   Scriptural prophecies relating to this subject.

   The first point to be considered is the true design of prophecy, and
   how that design is to be ascertained. Prophecy is very different from
   history. It is not intended to give us a knowledge of the future,
   analogous to that which history gives us of the past. This truth is
   often overlooked. We see interpreters undertaking to give detailed
   expositions of the prophecies of Isaiah, of Ezekiel, of Daniel, and of
   the Apocalypse, relating to the future, with the same confidence with
   which they would record the history of the recent past. Such
   interpretations have always been falsified by the event. But this does
   not discourage a certain class of minds, for whom the future has a
   fascination and who delight in the solution of enigmas, from renewing
   the attempt. In prophecy, instruction is subordinate to moral
   impression. The occurrence of important events is so predicted as to
   produce in the minds of the people of God faith that they will
   certainly come to pass. Enough is made known of their nature, and of
   the time and mode of their occurrence, to awaken attention, desire, or
   apprehension, as the case may be; and to secure proper effort on the
   part of those concerned to be prepared for what is to come to pass.
   Although such predictions may be variously misinterpreted before their
   fulfilment; yet when fulfilled, the agreement between the prophecy and
   the event is seen to be such as to render the divine origin of the
   prophecy a matter of certainty. Thus with regard to the first advent of
   Christ, the Old Testament prophecies rendered it certain that a great
   Redeemer was to appear; that He was to be a Prophet, Priest, and King;
   that He would deliver his people from their sins, and from the evils
   under which they groaned; that He was to establish a kingdom which
   should ultimately absorb all the kingdoms on earth; and that He would
   render all his people supremely happy and blessed. These predictions
   had the effect of turning the minds of the whole Jewish nation to the
   future, in confident expectation that the Deliverer would come; of
   exciting earnest desire for his advent; and of leading the pious
   portion of the people to prayerful preparation for that event.
   Nevertheless, of all the hundreds of thousands to whom these
   predictions of the Hebrew Scriptures were made known, not a single
   person, so far as appears, interpreted them aright; yet, when
   fulfilled, we can almost construct a history of the events from these
   misunderstood predictions concerning them. Christ was indeed a king,
   but no such king as the world had ever seen, and such as no man
   expected; He was a priest, but the only priest that ever lived of whose
   priesthood he was Himself the victim; He did establish a kingdom, but
   it was not of this world. It was foretold that Elias should first come
   and prepare the way of the Lord. He did come; but in a way in which no
   man did or could have anticipated.

   It follows, from what has been said, that prophecy makes a general
   impression with regard to future events, which is reliable and
   salutary, while the details remain in obscurity. The Jews were not
   disappointed in the general impression made on their minds by the
   predictions relating to the Messiah. It was only iu the explanation of
   details that they failed. The Messiah was a king; He did sit upon the
   throne of David, but not in the way in which they expected; He is to
   subdue all nations, not by the sword, as they supposed, but by truth
   and love; He was to make his people priests and kings, but not worldly
   princes and satraps. The utter failure of the Old Testament Church in
   interpreting the prophecies relating to the first advent of Christ,
   should teach us to be modest and diffident in explaining those which
   relate to his second coming. We should be satisfied with the great
   truths which those prophecies unfold, and leave the details to be
   explained by the event. This the Church, as a Church, has generally
   done.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 2. The Common Church Doctrine.

   The common Church doctrine is, first, that there is to be a second
   personal, visible, and glorious advent of the Son of God. Secondly,
   that the events which are to precede that advent, are

   1. The universal diffusion of the Gospel; or, as our Lord expresses it,
   the ingathering of the elect; this is the vocation of the Christian
   Church.

   2. The conversion of the Jews, which is to be national. As their
   casting away was national, although a remnant was saved; so their
   conversion may be national, although some may remain obdurate.

   3. The coming of Antichrist.

   Thirdly, that the events which are to attend the second advent are: --

   1. The resurrection of the dead, of the just and of the unjust.

   2. The general judgment.

   3. The end of the world. And,

   4. The consummation of Christ's kingdom.

   § 3. The Personal Advent of Christ.

   It is admitted that the words "coming of the Lord" are often used in
   Scripture for any signal manifestation of his presence either for
   judgment or for mercy. When Jesus promised to manifest Himself to his
   disciples, "Judas saith unto Him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that
   thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? Jesus
   answered and said unto him, If a man love me he will keep my words: and
   my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode
   with him." (John xiv. 22, 23.) There is a coming of Christ, true and
   real, which is not outward and visible. Thus also in the epistle to the
   Church in Pergamos it is said: "Repent; or else I will come unto thee
   quickly." (Rev. ii. 16.) This form of expression is used frequently in
   the Bible. There are, therefore, many commentators who explain
   everything said in the New Testament of the second coming of Christ, of
   the spiritual manifestation of his power. Thus Mr. Alger, to cite a
   single example of this school, says: "The Hebrews called any signal
   manifestation of power -- especially any dreadful calamity -- a coming
   of the Lord. It was a coming of Jehovah when his vengeance strewed the
   ground with the corpses of Sennacherib's host; when its storm swept
   Jerusalem as with fire, and bore Israel into bondage; when its sword
   came down upon Idumea and was bathed in blood upon Edom. The day of the
   Lord' is another term of precisely similar import. It occurs in the Old
   Testament about fifteen times. In every instance it means some mighty
   manifestation of God's power in calamity. These occasions are pictured
   forth with the most astounding figures of speech." [834] On the
   following page he says he fully believes that the evangelists and early
   Christians understood the language of Christ in reference to his second
   coming, as predictions of a personal and visible advent, connected with
   a resurrection and a general judgment, but he more than doubts whether
   such was the meaning of Christ Himself. (1.) Because he says nothing of
   a resurrection of the dead. (2.) The figures which He uses are
   precisely those which the Jewish prophets employed in predicting "great
   and signal events on the earth." (3.) Because He "fixed the date of the
   events He referred to within that generation." Christ he thinks, meant
   to teach that his "truths shall prevail and shall be owned as the
   criteria of Divine judgment. According to them," he understands Christ
   to say, "all the righteous shall be distinguished as my subjects, and
   all the iniquitous shall be separated from my kingdom. Some of those
   standing here shall not taste death till all these things be fulfilled.
   Then it will be seen that I am the Messiah, and that through the
   eternal principles of truth which I have proclaimed I shall sit upon a
   throne of glory, -- not literally, in person, as you thought, blessing
   the Jews and cursing the Gentiles, but spiritually, in the truth,
   dispensing joy to good men and woe to bad men, according to their
   deserts." It is something to have it admitted that the Apostles and
   early Christians believed in the personal advent of Christ. What the
   Apostles believed we are bound to believe; for St. John said "He that
   knoweth God, heareth us." That the New Testament does teach a second,
   visible, and glorious appearing of the Son of God, is plain: --

   1. From the analogy between the first and second advents. The
   rationalistic Jews would have had precisely the same reasons for
   believing in a more spiritual coming of the Messiah as modern
   rationalists have for saying that his second coming is to be spiritual.
   The advent in both cases is predicted in very nearly the same terms.
   If, therefore, his first coming was in person and visible, so his
   second coming must be. The two advents are often spoken of in
   connection, the one illustrating the other. He came the first time as
   the Lamb of God bearing the sins of the world; He is to come "the
   second time, without sin, unto salvation." (Heb. ix. 28.) God, said the
   apostle Peter, "shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto
   you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all
   things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets
   since the world began." (Acts iii. 20, 21.) Christ is now invisible to
   us, having been received up into heaven. He is to remain thus
   invisible, until God shall send him at the restitution of all things.

   2. In many places it is directly asserted that his appearing is to be
   personal and visible. At the time of his ascension, the angels said to
   his disciples: "Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
   This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come
   in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven." (Acts i. 11.) His
   second coming is to be as visible as his ascension. They saw Him go;
   and they shall see him come. In Matt. xxvi. 64, it is said, "Hereafter
   shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and
   coming in the clouds of heaven;" Matt. xxiv. 30, "Then shall all the
   tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in
   the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." Luke xxi. 27, "Then
   shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud."

   3. The circumstances attending the second advent prove that it is to be
   personal and visible. It is to be in the clouds; with power and great
   glory; with the holy angels and all the saints; and it is to be with a
   shout and the voice of the archangel.

   4. The effects ascribed to his advent prove the same thing. All the
   tribes of the earth shall mourn; the dead, both small and great are to
   arise; the wicked shall call on the rocks and hills to cover them; the
   saints are to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air; and the earth
   and the heavens are to flee away at his presence.

   5. That the Apostles understood Christ to predict his second coming in
   person does not admit of doubt. Indeed almost all the rationalistic
   commentators teach that the Apostles fully believed and even taught
   that the second advent with all its glorious consequences would occur
   in their day. Certain it is that they believed that He would come
   visibly and with great glory, and that they held his coming as the
   great object of expectation and desire. Indeed Christians are described
   as those who "are waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" (1
   Cor. i. 7); as those who are "looking for that blessed hope, and the
   glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ" (Tit.
   ii. 13) (it is to them who look for Him, He is to "appear the second
   time, without sin unto salvation," Heb. ix. 28); as those who are
   expecting and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God. (2 Pet.
   iii. 12.) It is a marked characteristic of the apostolic writings that
   they give such prominence to the doctrine of the second advent. "Judge
   nothing before the time, until the Lord come. (1 Cor. iv. 5.) "Christ
   the first-fruits; afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming." (1
   Cor. xv. 23.) Ye are our rejoicing "in the day of the Lord Jesus." (2
   Cor. i. 14.) "He . . . . will perform it until the day of Jesus
   Christ." (Phil. i. 6.) "That I may rejoice in the day of Christ." (ii.
   16.) "Our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the
   Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ." (iii. 20.) "When Christ, who is our
   life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in glory." (Col.
   iii. 4.) "To wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the
   dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come." (1 Thess.
   i. 10.) "What is our hope, . . . . are not even ye in the presence of
   our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?" (ii. 19.) "Unblamable in holiness
   . . . . at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
   (iii. 13.) "We which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord
   . . . . shall be caught up . . . . in the clouds, to meet the Lord in
   the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord." (iv. 15-17.) In his
   second epistle he assures the Thessalonians that they shall have rest,
   "when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven." (2 Thess. i. 7.)
   The coming of Christ, however, he tells them was not at hand; there
   must come a great falling away first. Paul said to Timothy, "Keep this
   commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord
   Jesus Christ." (1 Tim. vi. 14.) "There is laid up for me a crown of
   righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at
   that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
   appearing." (2 Tim. iv. 8.) The epistles of Peter afford the same
   evidence of the deep hold which the promise of Christ's second coming
   had taken on the minds of the Apostles and of all the early Christians.
   He tells his readers that they "are kept by the power of God through
   faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time . . . .
   that the trial of your faith. . . . might be found unto praise, and
   honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ." (1 Pet. i. 5-7.)
   Men are to "give account to Him that is ready to judge the quick and
   the dead." (iv. 5.) "Rejoice that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye
   may be glad also with exceeding joy." (verse 13.) "When the chief
   Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory." (v. 4.) " We
   have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you
   the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses
   of his majesty." (2 Pet. i. 16). The transfiguration on the mount was a
   type and pledge of the glory of the second advent. The Apostle warns
   the disciples that scoffers would come "saying, Where is the promise of
   his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as
   they were from the beginning of the creation." In answer to this
   objection, he reminds them that the threatened deluge was long delayed,
   but came at last; that time is not with God as it is with us; that with
   Him a thousand years are as one day, and one day as a thousand years.
   He repeats the assurance that "the day of the Lord will come as a thief
   in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great
   noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also
   and the works that are therein, shall be burned up." (2 Peter iii.
   3-10.)

   From all these passages, and from the whole drift of the New Testament,
   it is plain, (1.) That the Apostles fully believed that there is to be
   a second coming of Christ. (2.) That his coming is to be in person,
   visible and glorious. (3.) That they kept this great event constantly
   before their own minds, and urged it on the attention of the people, as
   a motive to patience, constancy, joy, and holy living. (4.) That the
   Apostles believed that the second advent of Christ would be attended by
   the general resurrection, the final judgment, and the end of the world.

   As already intimated, it is objected to this view of the prophe cies of
   the New Testament referring to the Second Advent, --

   1. That the first advent of Christ is predicted in the Old Testament in
   nearly as glowing terms as his second coming is set forth in the New
   Testament. He was to come in the clouds of heaven; with great pomp and
   power; all nations were to be subject to Him; all people were to be
   gathered before Him; the stars were to fall from heaven; the sun was to
   be darkened, and the moon to be turned into blood. These descriptions
   were not realized by the event; and are understood to refer to the
   great changes in the state of the world to be effected by his coming.
   It is unreasonable, therefore, as it is agreed, to expect anything like
   a literal fulfilment of these New Testament prophecies. To this it may
   be answered, (1.) That in the Old Testament the Messianic period is
   described as a whole. The fact that the Messiah was to come and
   establish an everlasting kingdom which was to triumph over all
   opposition, and experience a glorious consummation, is clearly
   foretold. All these events were, so to speak, included in the same
   picture; but the perspective was not preserved. The prophecies were not
   intended to give the chronological order of the events foretold. Hence
   the consummation of the Messiah's kingdom is depicted as in immediate
   proximity with his appearance in the flesh. This led almost all the
   Jews, and even the disciples of Christ themselves, before the day of
   Pentecost, to look for the immediate establishment of the Messiah's
   kingdom in its glory. Such being the character of the Old Testament
   prophecies, it cannot be fairly inferred that they have as yet received
   their full accomplishment; or that they are now being fulfilled in the
   silent progress of the Gospel. They include the past and the present,
   but much remains to be accomplished in the future more in accordance
   with their literal meaning. (2.) The character of the predictions in
   the New Testament does not admit of their being made to refer to any
   spiritual coming of Christ or to the constant progress of his Church.
   They evidently refer to a single event; to an event in the future, not
   now in progress; an event which shall attract the attention of all
   nations, and be attended by the resurrection of the dead, the complete
   salvation of the righteous, and the condemnation of the wicked. (3.) A
   third answer to the objection under consideration is, that the
   Apostles, as is conceded, understood the predictions of Christ
   concerning his second coming, in the way in which they have been
   understood by the Church, as a whole, from that day to this.

   2. A second objection to the common Church view of the eschatology of
   the New Testament is, that our Lord expressly says that the events
   which He foretold were to come to pass during that generation. His
   words are, "Verily, I say unto you, This generation shall not pass,
   till all these things be fulfilled." This objection is founded upon the
   pregnant discourse of Christ recorded in the twenty-fourth and
   twenty-fifth chapters of Matthew. It is to be remarked that those
   chapters contain the answer which Christ gave to three questions
   addressed to Him by his disciples; first, when the destruction of the
   temple and of Jerusalem was to occur second, what was to be the sign of
   his coming; and third, when the end of the world was to take place. The
   difficulty in interpreting this discourse is, to determine its relation
   to these several questions. There are three methods of interpretation
   which have been applied to this passage. The first assumes that the
   whole of our Lord's discourse refers but to one question, namely, When
   was Jerusalem to be destroyed and Christ's kingdom to be inaugurated;
   the second adopts the theory of what used to be called the double sense
   of prophecy; that is, that the same words or prediction refer to one
   event in one sense, and to a different event in a higher sense; the
   third assumes that one part of our Lord's predictions refers
   exclusively to one of the questions asked, and that other portions
   refer exclusively to the other questions.

   The rationalistic interpreters adopt the first method and refer
   everything to the overthrow of the Jewish polity, the destruction of
   Jerusalem, and the inauguration of the Church which is to do its work
   of judgment in the earth. Some evangelical interpreters also assume
   that our Lord answers the three questions put to Him as one, as they
   constituted in fact but one in the minds of his disciples, since they
   believed that the three events, the destruction of Jerusalem, the
   second coming of Christ, and the end of the world, were all to occur
   together. Thus Luthardt says: "There are three questions according to
   the words; but only one in the minds of the disciples, as they did not
   consider the three events, the destruction of Jerusalem, the second
   coming of Christ, and the end of the world, as separated
   chronologically; but as three great acts in the final drama of the
   world's history." [835] In this sense our Lord, he adds, answered their
   inquiries. He does not separate the different subjects, so as to speak
   first of one and then of another; but he keeps all ever in view. "It is
   the method," he says, "of Biblical prophecy, which our Lord observes,
   always to predict the one great end and all else and what is
   preparatory, only so far as it stands in connection with that end and
   appears as one of its elements." [836] Although, therefore, the
   prophecy of Christ extends to events in the distant future, He could
   say that that generation should not pass away until all was fulfilled;
   for the destruction of Jerusalem was the commencement of that work of
   judgment which Christ foretold.

   According to this view, the first method of interpretation differs very
   little from the second of those above mentioned. Both suppose that the
   same words or descriptions are intended to refer to two or more events
   very different in their nature and in the time of their occurrence.
   Isaiah's prediction of the great deliverance which God was to effect
   for his people, was so framed as to answer both to the redemption of
   the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, and to the greater redemption
   by the Messiah. It was in fact and equally a prediction of both events.
   The former was the type, and the first step toward the accomplishment
   of the other. So also in the fourteenth chapter of Zechariah, the
   prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem, the spiritual redemption, and
   the final judgment, are blended together. As, therefore, in the Old
   Testament the Messianic prophecies took in the whole scope of God's
   dealings with his people, including their deliverance from Babylon and
   their redemption by Christ, so as to make it doubtful what refers to
   the former and what to the latter event; so this discourse of Christ
   may be considered as taking in the whole history of his kingdom,
   including his great work of judgment in casting out the Jews and
   calling the Gentiles, as well as the final consummation of his work.
   Thus everything predicted of the final judgment had its counterpart in
   what was fulfilled in that generation.

   The third method of interpretation is greatly to be preferred, if it
   can be successfully carried out. Christ does in fact answer the three
   questions presented by his disciples. He told when the temple and the
   city were to be destroyed; it was when they should see Jerusalem
   compassed about with armies. He told them that the sign of the coming
   of the Son of Man was to be great defection in the Church, dreadful
   persecutions, and all but irresistible temptations, and that with his
   coming were to be connected the final judgment and the end of the
   world; but that the time when those events were to occur, was not given
   unto them to know, nor even to the angels of heaven. (Matt. xxiv. 36.)

   If this be the method of interpreting these important predictions, then
   the declaration contained in Matt. xxiv. 34, "This generation shall not
   pass, till all these things be fulfilled," must be restricted to the
   "all things spoken of, referring to the destruction of Jerusalem and
   the inauguration of the Church as Christ's kingdom on earth. There is,
   however, high authority for making he genea haute, here and in the
   parallel passages, Mark xiii. 30 and Luke xxi. 32, refer to Israel as a
   people or race; in this case the meaning would be that the Jews would
   not cease to be a distinct people until his predictions were fulfilled.
   [837] There is nothing, therefore, in this discourse of Christ's
   inconsistent with the common Church doctrine as to the nature and
   concomitants of his Second Advent.

   § 4. The Calling of the Gentiles.

   The first great event which is to precede the second coming of Christ,
   is the universal proclamation of the Gospel.

   1. The first argument in proof of the position that the Gospel must be
   preached to all nations before the second advent, is founded on the
   predictions of the Old Testament. It is there distinctly foretold that
   when the Messiah appeared the Spirit should be poured out on all flesh,
   and that all men should see the salvation of God. The Messiah was to be
   a light to lighten the Gentiles, as well as the glory of his people
   Israel. The feet of those who brought the glad tidings and published
   peace, were to be beautiful upon the mountains. God said in Hosea ii.
   23, "I will say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people;
   and they shall say, Thou art my God." And in Isaiah xlv. 22, 23, "Look
   unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and
   there is none else. I have sworn by myself . . . . that unto me every
   knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear." That is, the true religion
   shall prevail oyer the whole earth. Jehovah shall everywhere be
   recognized and worshipped as the only true God. It is to be remembered
   that these and many other passages of like import are quoted and
   applied by the Apostle to the Gospel dispensation. They are enforced on
   the attention of those to whom they wrote as showing the Gentiles that
   the Gospel was designed for them as well as for the Jews; and to
   impress upon the Church its obligation to preach the Gospel to every
   creature under heaven.

   2. Christ repeatediy taught that the Gospel was to be preached to all
   nations before his second coming. Thus in Matt. xxiv. 14, it is said,
   "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a
   witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come." (Mark xiii. 10)
   "The gospel must first be published among all nations."

   3. Accordingly our Lord after his resurrection, in giving his
   commission to the Church, said: "Go ye therefore and teach all nations,
   baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
   Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have
   commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
   world." (Matt. xxviii. 19, 20.) In Mark xvi. 15, the commission reads
   thus: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
   creature." This commission prescribes the present duty of the Church;
   one that is not to be deferred or languidly performed until a new and
   more effective dispensation be inaugurated. The promise of Christ to be
   with his Church, as then commissioned, to the end of the world, implies
   that its obligation to teach the nations is to continue until the final
   consummation.

   4. Having imposed upon his Church the duty to preach the Gospel to
   every creature under heaven, He endowed it with all the gifts necessary
   for the proper discharge of this duty, and promised to send his Spirit
   to render their preaching effectual. "He gave some, Apostles; and some,
   prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers." Of
   these officers some were temporary, their peculiar function being the
   founding and organizing the Church; some were permanent. Their common
   object was the perfecting of the saints. Their mission and duties were
   and are to continue until "all come in the unity of the faith, and of
   the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure
   of the stature of the fulness of Christ." (Eph. iv. 11-13.) The duties
   of the ministry, therefore, are to continue until all, that is, all
   believers, the whole Church, or, as our Lord says, all the elect, are
   gathered in and brought to the stature of perfection in Christ.

   5. The Apostles understood their commission in this sense and entered
   on their duties with a clear view of the task set before them. Our
   Lord, in his high-priestly prayer said concerning them, "As thou hast
   sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world."
   He would not leave them alone; He promised to send the Paraclete, the
   Helper, who should bring all things to their remembrance; He would give
   them a mouth and a wisdom which all their adversaries should be unable
   to gainsay or resist. The Spirit was to abide with them and dwell in
   them, so that it would not be they who spoke, but the Spirit of the
   Father who spoke in them; that Spirit was to convince the world of sin,
   righteousness, and judgment; He was to render their preaching the
   wisdom and power of God unto salvation. Their simple duty was to teach;
   their commission was, "Go teach all nations." One of the great elements
   of the Papal apostasy was the idea derived from paganism, that the main
   design of the Church is "cultus," worship, and not instruction. The
   Apostles, as Peter teaches (Acts i. 22), and as is everywhere else
   taught in Scripture, were to be witnesses of Christ; to bear testimony
   to his doctrines, to the facts of his life, to his death, and
   especially to his resurrection, on which everything else depended. As,
   however, of themselves they could do nothing, they were required to
   attempt nothing, but to abide in Jerusalem, until they were imbued with
   power from on high. When thus imbued they began at once to declare the
   wonderful works of God to "Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the
   dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus and
   Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about
   Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, Cretes and
   Arabians;" thus making the first proclamation of the Gospel after the
   resurrection of Christ typical of its design and destiny as the
   religion of the whole world.

   The Apostles accordingly "went everywhere;" and everywhere taught (1.)
   That God is not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles;
   that He is rich in mercy towards all who call upon him, justifying the
   circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith. (2.) That
   the Gospel, therefore, was designed and adapted for the whole world;
   for all classes of men; not only for Jews and Gentiles, but also for
   the learned and unlearned, the young and the old, for the wicked and
   the righteous. It is the power of God to salvation to every one that
   believeth. (3.) Being thus suited to all men, it should be preached to
   all men. "How shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed?
   and how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? and how
   shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach, except
   they be sent?" (Rom. x. 14, 15.) Paul magnified his office: he thanked
   God for giving him the grace to be the Apostle of the Gentiles. He said
   that he was under obligation to preach the Gospel both to the Greeks
   and to the Barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise. He devotes no
   small portion of his Epistle to the Romans and the greater portion of
   the doctrinal part of that to the Ephesians, to setting forth the
   purpose of God to bring the Gentiles into his Church, and to make them
   equally with the Jews partakers of the redemption of Christ. He teaches
   that the middle wall of partition between the two had been broken down,
   and that the Gentiles were no more "strangers and foreigners, but
   fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God." (Eph.
   ii. 19.) The great object of the Epistle to the Hebrews is to show that
   the Gospel is the substance of which the old dispensation was the
   shadow; that nothing more glorious, real, and effectual was to be, or
   could be, so far as the salvation of sinners is concerned. The eternal
   Son of God, the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image
   of his person, had assumed our nature to become the Apostle and High
   Priest of our profession. There was no hope for those who neglected the
   great salvation which he announced, and no more sacrifice for sin
   remained for those who refused to be cleansed by his most precious
   blood. The final revelation of God's truth, the offering of the
   infinitely meritorious sacrifice for sin, and the cooperation of the
   everywhere present and almighty Spirit of God are all made known in the
   Gospel; and the Bible knows nothing of any other arrangements for the
   salvation of men. It is evident that the Apostles considered the
   dispensation of the Spirit under which we are now living, as the only
   one which was to intervene between the first advent of Christ and the
   end of the world.

   6. In 2 Corinthians iii. the Apostle contrasts the new and old
   dispensations, showing that the former excels the latter, (1.) Because
   the one used the ministration of the latter, the other uses that of the
   spirit. (2.) Because the one was the ministration of death and of
   condemnation, the other is the ministration of the Spirit and of
   righteousness; and (3.) Because the one was transient and the other is
   permanent. "If that which is done away was glorious, much more that
   which remaineth is glorious." (verse 11.)

   7. In Romans xi. 25, Paul teaches that the national conversion of the
   Jews is not to take place "until the fulness of the Gentiles be come
   in." The pleroma ton ethnon, is that which makes the number of the
   Gentiles full; the full complement which the Gentiles are to render to
   make the number of the elect complete.

   This ingathering of the heathen is the special work of the Church. It
   is a missionary work. It was so understood by the Apostles. Their two
   great duties were the propagation and defence of the truth. To these
   they devoted themselves. While they laboured night and day, and
   travelled hither and thither through all parts of the Roman world,
   preaching the Gospel, they laboured no less assiduously in its defence.
   All the epistles of the New Testament, those of Paul, Peter, John, and
   James, are directed towards the correction of false doctrine. These two
   duties of propagating and of defending the truth, the Apostles devolved
   on their successors. During the apostolic age and for some time after
   it, the former had the ascendancy; to preach the Gospel to all nations,
   to bring all men to the knowledge of the truth, was felt to be the
   special vocation of the Church. Gradually, and especially after the
   conversion of Constantine and the establishment of Christianity as the
   religion of the Roman empire, the mind of the Church was directed
   principally to securing what had been attained; in perfecting its
   organization and in stating its creed and defending it against the
   numerous forms of error by which it was assailed.

   From this time for long centuries the Church found its hands filled
   with its internal affairs. Its energies were expended mainly in three
   directions, in building up a hierarchy with a supreme pontiff,
   surrounded by ecclesiastical princes, which sought to concentrate in
   itself all power over the bodies and souls of men; in founding numerous
   orders of monks; and in the subtleties of metaphysical discussions. The
   work of missions during this period was almost entirely neglected.

   When the Reformation came, the Protestants had as much as they could do
   to live. They had arrayed against them everywhere the tremendous power
   of the Romish Church, and in most cases all the power of the State.
   They had to defend their doctrines against the prejudices and learning
   of the age; to organize their Churches, and alas! they were distracted
   among themselves. Under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at
   that the command, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
   every creature," was almost forgotten. It is only within the last fifty
   years that the Church has been brought to feel that its great duty is
   the conversion of the nations. More, probably, has been done in this
   direction during the last half century than during the preceding five
   hundred years. It is to be hoped that a new effusion of the Spirit like
   that of the day of Pentecost may be granted to the Church whose fruits
   shall as far exceed those of the first effusion as the millions of
   Christians now alive exceed in number the one hundred and twenty souls
   then gathered in Jerusalem.

   That the conversion of the Gentile world is the work assigned the
   Church under the present dispensation, and that it is not to fold its
   hands and await the second coming of Christ to accomplish that work for
   it, seems evident from what has already been said, (1.) This is the
   work which Christ commanded his Church to undertake. (2.) He furnished
   it with all the means necessary for its accomplishment; He revealed the
   truth which is the power of God unto salvation; He instituted the
   ministry to be perpetuated to the end of the world, and promised to
   endow men from age to age with the gifts and graces necessary for the
   discharge of its duties, and to grant them his constant presence and
   assistance. (3.) The Apostles and the Church of that age so understood
   the work assigned and addressed themselves to it with a devotion and a
   success, which, had they been continued, the work, humanly speaking,
   had long since been accomplished. (4.) There is no intimation in the
   New Testament that the work of converting the world is to be effected
   by any other means than those now in use. (5.) It is to dishonour the
   Gospel, and the power of the Holy Spirit, to suppose that they are
   inadequate to the accomplishment of this work. (6.) The wonderful
   success of the work of missions in our day goes to prove the fact
   contended for. Barriers deemed insurmountable have been removed;
   facilities of access and intercourse have been increased a hundred
   fold; hundreds of missionary stations have been established in every
   part of the world; many thousands of converts have been gathered into
   churches and hundreds of thousands of children are under Christian
   instruction; the foundations of ancient systems of idolatry have been
   undermined; nations lately heathen have become Christian, and are
   taking part in sending the Gospel to those still sitting in darkness;
   and nothing seems wanting to secure the gathering in of the Gentiles,
   but a revival of the missionary spirit of the apostolic age in the
   churches of the nineteenth century.

   § 5. Conversion of the Jews.

   The second great event, which, according to the common faith of the
   Church, is to precede the second advent of Christ, is the national
   conversion of the Jews.

   First, that there is to be such a national conversion may be argued, --

   1. From the original call and destination of that people. God called
   Abraham and promised that through him, and in his seed, all the nations
   of the earth should be blessed. He entered into a solemn covenant with
   him engaging to be his God and the God of his posterity to the latest
   generations; and that they should be his people. These promises have
   been hitherto fulfilled; God preserved the Hebrews, although
   comparatively few in numbers amid hostile nations, from destruction or
   dispersion until the promised seed of Abraham appeared and accomplished
   his redeeming work. This is an assurance that the other promises
   relating to this people shall be fully accomplished.

   2. The second argument is from the general drift of the Old Testament
   concerning the chosen people. Those prophecies run through a regular
   cycle often repeated in different forms. The people are rebuked for
   their sins and threatened with severe punishment; when that punishment
   has been inflicted, and the nation brought to repentance, there
   uniformly follow promises of restoration and favour. Isaiah predicted
   that for their idolatry the people should be carried into captivity,
   but that a remnant should be restored to their own land, and their
   privileges secured to them again. Joel and Zechariah predicted that for
   their rejection of the Messiah, they should be scattered to the ends of
   the earth, but that God would bring them back, and that his favour
   should not be finally withdrawn from them. Thus it is with all the
   prophets. As these general predictions are familiar to all the readers
   of the Bible, they need not be specified.

   3. There are in the Old Testament express predictions of their national
   conversion to faith in Him whom they had rejected and crucified. Thus
   in Zechariah xii. it is said; "I will pour upon the house of David and
   upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of
   supplications; and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and
   they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son, and shall
   be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his
   first-born." This is to be a national conversion, for it is said "the
   land shall mourn" every family apart.

   4. The most decisive passage, however, bearing on this subject, one
   which may be taken "instar omnium," is the eleventh chapter of the
   Epistle to the Romans. Paul had taught, (1.) That God had cast off the
   Jews as a nation because they as a nation, represented by the
   Sanhedrim, the High Priest, the scribes and the Pharisees, by their
   rulers of every class, and by the popular voice, had rejected Christ.
   "He came unto his own, and his own received him not." Therefore, as a
   nation, God rejected them. (2.) This rejection, however, he here
   teaches, was not entire. There was "a remnant according to the election
   of grace" who believed in Christ and were received into his kingdom.
   (3.) This national rejection of Israel, as it was not entire, so
   neither was it to be final. It was to continue until the bringing in of
   the Gentiles. God had made a covenant with Abraham that his posterity
   should be his people; and "the gifts and calling of God are without
   repentance." Therefore, although broken oft from the olive-tree for the
   present, they were to be grafted in again. (4.) Thus "all Israel shall
   be saved." Whether this means the Jews as a nation, or the whole elect
   people of God including both Jews and Gentiles, may be doubtful. But in
   either case it is, in view of the context, a promise of the restoration
   of the Jews as a nation. There is, therefore, to be a national
   conversion of the Jews.

   Second, this conversion is to take place before the second advent of
   Christ. This the Apostle teaches when he says, that the salvation of
   the Gentiles was designed to provoke the Jews to jealousy, verse 11;
   and that the mercy shown to the Gentiles was to be the means of the
   Jews obtaining mercy, verse 31. The rejection of the Jews was the
   occasion of the conversion of the Gentiles; and the conversion of the
   Gentiles is to be the occasion of the restoration of the Jews. On this
   point Luthardt says: "As our Lord (Matt. xxiii. 39) said: Ye shall not
   see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the
   name of the Lord' -- so it is certain that, when Jesus comes, who will
   be visible to all the world, as the lightning which cometh out of the
   east, and shineth even unto the west, whom all eyes, even of those who
   pierced Him and all kindreds of the earth shall see (Rev. i. 7; Zech.
   xii. 10), -- the Jews must have been converted and have become a
   Christian nation. . . . . And further when Peter (Acts iii. 19-21)
   exhorts to repentance and conversion until the times of refreshing from
   the presence of the Lord shall come; so it appears to be to me beyond
   all doubt that the conversion of Israel is to precede the Second Advent
   of Christ." [838]

   Are the Jews to be restored to their own Land?

   According to one view, the Jews after their conversion are to be
   restored to the land of their fathers and there constituted a distinct
   nation. According to another, their restoration to their own land is to
   precede their conversion. And according to a third view there is to be
   no such restoration, but they are to be amalgamated with the great body
   of Christians as they were in the times of the Apostles.

   In favour of a literal restoration it is urged, --

   1. That it is predicted in the Old Testament in the most express terms.
   Luthardt says a man must "break" the Scriptures who denies such
   restoration. To him it is certain and undeniable that the Jews are to
   be brought back to their own land and reestablished as a nation. [839]

   2. It is argued that the promise of God to Abraham has never yet been
   fully accomplished. God promised to give to him and to his seed after
   him all the land from the river of Egypt (understood to be the Nile) to
   the river Euphrates. They were, however, during all their national
   history pent up m the narrow strip between the Jordan and the
   Mediterranean Sea, except for a while when the two and a half tribes
   dwelt on the eastern side of Jordan. As the promise cannot fail, the
   time must yet come when the whole region granted to Abraham shall be
   occupied by his descendants.

   3. A presumptive argument is drawn from the strange preservation of the
   Jews through so many centuries as a distinct people. They have often
   been compared to a river flowing through the ocean without mingling
   with its waters. There must be some purpose in this wonderful
   preservation. That people must have a future corresponding to its
   marvellous past.

   4. Reference is also made to the fact that the land promised to the
   Jews is now empty, as though waiting for their return. It once teemed
   with a population counted by millions; and there is no reason why it
   may not in the future be as densely inhabited.

   The arguments against the assumed restoration of the Jews to the Holy
   Land are, --

   1. The argument from the ancient prophecies is proved to be invalid,
   because it would prove too much. If those prophecies foretell a literal
   restoration, they foretell that the temple is to be rebuilt, the
   priesthood restored, sacrifices again offered, and that the whole
   Mosaic ritual is to be observed in all its details. (See the prophecies
   of Ezekiel from the thirty-seventh chapter onward.) We know, however,
   from the New Testament that the Old Testament service has been finally
   abolished; there is to be no new temple made with hands; no other
   priest but the high-priest of our profession; and no other sacrifice
   but that already offered upon the cross. It is utterly inconsistent
   with the character of the Gospel that there should be a renewed
   inauguration of Judaism within the pale of the Christian Church. If it
   be said that the Jews are to return to their own land as Jews, and
   there restore their temple and its service, and then be converted; it
   may be answered that this is inconsistent with the prophetic
   representations. They are to be brought to repentance and faith, and to
   be restored to their land, or, to use the figure employed by the
   Apostle, grafted again into their own olive-tree, because of their
   repentance. When Christ comes, "He shall send his angels with a great
   sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the
   four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." (Matt. xxiv. 31.) But
   further than this, in Zechariah xiv., it ia predicted that after the
   restoration, all the nations of the earth "shall go up from year to
   year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of
   tabernacles." In Isaiah lxvi. 22, 23, it is said, "As the new heavens
   and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the
   Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain. And it shall come to
   pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to
   another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord."
   The literal interpretation of the Old Testament prophecies relating to
   the restoration of Israel and the future kingdom of Christ, cannot by
   possibility be carried out, and if abandoned in one point, it cannot be
   pressed in regard to others.

   2. It is undeniable that the ancient prophets in predicting the events
   of the Messianic period and the future of Christ's kingdom, borrowed
   their language and imagery from the Old Testament institutions and
   usages. The Messiah is often called David; his church is called
   Jerusalem, and Zion, his people are called Israel; Canaan was the land
   of their inheritance; the loss of God's favour was expressed by saying
   that they forfeited that inheritance, and restoration to his favour was
   denoted by a return to the promised land. This usage is so pervading
   that the conviction produced by it on the minds of Christians is
   indelible. To them, Zion and Jerusalem are the Church and not the city
   made with hands. To interpret all that the ancient prophets say of
   Jerusalem of an earthly city, and all that is said of Israel of the
   Jewish nation, would be to bring down heaven to earth, and to transmute
   Christianity into the corrupt Judaism of the apostolic age.

   3. Accordingly in the New Testament it is taught, not in poetic
   imagery, but didactically, in simple, unmistakable prose, that
   believers are the seed of Abraham; they are his sons; his heirs; they
   are the true Israel. (See especially Romans iv. and ix. and Galatians
   iii.) It is not natural descent, that makes a man a child of Abraham.
   "They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children
   of God; but the children of the promise are counted for the seed."
   (Rom. ix. 8.) The Apostle asserts that the promises are made not to the
   Israel kata sarka, but to the Israel kata pneuma. He says in the name
   of believers, "We are the circumcision." (Phil. iii. 3.) "We are
   Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." (Gal. iii. 29.)
   The promise to Abraham that he should be the father of many nations,
   did not mean merely that his natural descendants should be very
   numerous; but that all the nations of the earth should have the right
   to call him father (Rom. iv. 17); for he is "the father of all them
   that believe, though they be not circumcised." (Rom. iv. 11.) It would
   turn the Gospel upside down; not only the Apostle's argument but his
   whole system would collapse, if what the Bible says of Israel should be
   understood of the natural descendants of Abraham to the exclusion of
   his spiritual children.

   4. The idea that the Jews are to be restored to their own land and
   there constituted a distinct nation in the Christian Church, is
   inconsistent not only with the distinct assertions of the Scriptures,
   but also with its plainest and most important doctrines. It is asserted
   over and over again that the middle wall of partition between Jew and
   Gentile has been broken down; that God has made of the two one; that
   Gentile believers are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the
   household of God; that they are built up together with the Jews into
   one temple. (Eph. ii. 11-22.) "As many of you as have been baptized
   into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there
   is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are
   all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ s, then are ye Abraham's
   seed, and heirs according to the promise." (Gal. iii. 27-29.) There
   could not be a more distinct assertion that all difference between the
   Jew and Gentile has been done away within the pale of the Christian
   Church. This, however, is not a mere matter of assertion, it is
   involved in the very nature of the Gospel. Nothing is plainer from the
   teachings of Scripture than that all believers are one body in Christ,
   that all are the partaker. of the Holy Spirit, and by virtue of their
   union with Him are joint and equal partakers of the benefits of his
   redemption; that if there be any difference between them, it is not in
   virtue of national or social distinctions, but solely of individual
   character and devotion. That we are all one in Christ Jesus, is a
   doctrine which precludes the possibility of the preeminence assigned to
   the Jews in the theory of which their restoration to their own land,
   and their national individuality are constituent elements.

   5. The Apostles uniformly acted on this principle. They recognize no
   future for the Jews in which the Gentile Christians are not to
   participate. As under the old dispensation proselytes from the heathen
   were incorporated with the Jewish people and all distinction between
   them and those who were Jews by birth, was lost, so it was under the
   Gospel. Gentiles and Jews were united in undistinguished and
   undistinguishable membership in the same Church. And so it has
   continued to the present day; the two streams, Jewish and Gentile,
   united in the Apostolic Church, have flowed on as one great river
   through all ages. As this was by divine ordinance, it is not to be
   believed that they are to be separated in the future.

   6. The restoration of the Jews to their own land and their continued
   national individuality, is generally associated with the idea that they
   are to constitute a sort of peerage in the Church of the future,
   exalted in prerogative and dignity above their fellow believers; and
   this again is more or less intimately connected with the doctrine that
   what the Church of the present is to look forward to is the
   establishment of a kingdom on earth of great worldly splendour and
   prosperity. For neither of these is there any authority in the didactic
   portions of the New Testament. There is no intimation that any one
   class of Christians, or Christians of any one nation or race, are to be
   exalted over their brethren; neither is there the slightest suggestion
   that the future kingdom of Christ is to be of earthly splendour. Not
   only are these expectations without any foundation in the teachings of
   the Apostles, but they are also inconsistent with the whole spirit of
   their instructions. They did not exhort believers to look forward to a
   reign of wealth and power, but to long after complete conformity to the
   image of Christ, and to pray for the coming of that kingdom which is
   righteousness, joy, and peace in the Holy Ghost. Any Christian would
   rejoice to be a servant of Paul, or of John, of a martyr, or of a poor
   worn-out missionary; but to be servant to a Jew, merely because he is a
   Jew, is a different affair; unless indeed such should prove to be the
   will of Christ; then such service would be an honour. It is as much
   opposed to the spirit of the Gospel that preeminence in Christ's
   kingdom should be adjudged to any man or set of men on the ground of
   natural descent, as on the ground of superior stature, physical
   strength, or wealth.

   The Scriptures, then, as they have been generally understood in the
   Church, teach that before the Second Advent, there is to be the
   ingathering of the heathen; that the Gospel must be preached to all
   nations; and also that there is to be a national conversion of the
   Jews; but it is not to be inferred from this that either all the
   heathen or all the Jews are to become true Christians. In many cases
   the conversion may be merely nominal. There will probably enough remain
   unchanged in heart to be the germ of that persecuting power which shall
   bring about those days of tribulation which the Bible seems to teach
   are to immediately precede the coming of the Lord.

   § 6. Antichrist.

   That Antichrist is to appear before the second coming of Christ, is
   expressedly asserted by the Apostle in 2 Thessalonians ii. 1-3, "We
   beseech you . . . . that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled
   . . . . as that the day of Christ is at hand. . . . . For that day
   shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of
   sin be revealed, the son of perdition." This is clear; but as to who or
   what Antichrist is, there is no little diversity of opinion.

   1. Some understand by that term any antichristian spirit, or power, or
   person. The Apostle John says, "Little children, it is the last time:
   and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there
   many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time . . . . Who
   is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is
   antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son." (1 John ii. 18 and
   22.) And again, "Every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is
   come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that spirit of
   antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now
   already is it in the world." (iv. 3.) And in 2 John 7, it is said,
   "Many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus
   Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist (ho
   planos kai ho antichristos, the deceiver and the antichrist)." Thus our
   Lord had predicted, "There shall arise false Christs, and false
   prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it
   were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." (Matt. xxiv. 24.)
   And the Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy iv. 1, says. "The Spirit speaketh
   expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,
   giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils." These
   passages refer to a marked characteristic of the period between the
   apostolic age and the second coming of Christ. There were to be many
   antichrists; many manifestations of malignant opposition to the person
   and to the work of Christ; many attempts to cast off his authority and
   to overthrow his kingdom.

   2. Besides this general reference to the antichristian spirit which was
   to manifest itself in different forms and with different degrees of
   intensity, many believe that there is yet to be a person, in whom the
   power of the world shall be concentrated, and which will exert all his
   energies to overthrow Christianity, and to usurp the place of Christ on
   earth. This is the Antichrist of prophecy; of whom it is assumed that
   Daniel, Paul, and St. John in the Apocalypse speak. This is the view
   generally adopted by Romanists and by many eminent evangelical
   Protestant theologians.

   3. The common opinion, however, among Protestants is, that the
   prophecies concerning Antichrist have special reference to the papacy.
   This conviction is founded principally on the remarkable prediction
   contained in Paul's second epistle to the Thessalonians. The Apostle
   knew that the Thessalonians, in common with other Christians of the
   early Church, would be exposed to grievous persecutions; to comfort
   them under their sufferings, to give them patience and to, sustain
   their faith, he referred to the promised second coming of Christ. When
   the Lord should come all their sorrows would be ended; those who in the
   meantime had fallen asleep, would not lose their part in the blessing
   of his second advent. For "we which are alive, and remain unto the
   coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the
   Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
   the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall
   rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
   together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
   shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore, comfort one another with
   these words." (1 Thess. iv. 15-17.) These words it seems had been
   perverted and misinterpreted, by some who were "disorderly, working not
   at all, but" were "busybodies;" unsettling the minds of the people,
   turning them off from present duties, as though the day of the Lord
   were at hand. To correct this abuse, the Apostle writes his second
   epistle. He does not set the doctrine of the second advent in the
   background, or say anything to weaken its power as a source of
   consolation to the suffering believers. On the contrary, he sets forth
   the glory of that advent and the richness of the blessings by which it
   should be attended, in more glowing terms than ever before. "We
   ourselves," he says, "glory in you in the churches of God, for your
   patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye
   endure; which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God,
   that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God. for which ye also
   suffer; seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense
   tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you, who are troubled,
   rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
   his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know
   not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: . . . .
   when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in
   all them that believe." (2 Thess. i. 4-10.) All this stands true.
   Nevertheless the Thessalonians were not to be deceived. The great day
   of deliverance was not at hand. They had much to do, and much to suffer
   before that day should come. The time of the second advent was not
   revealed. In his first epistle he had said, "Of the times and the
   seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. For
   yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief
   in the night." (1 Thess. v. 1, 2.) That being conceded, they should
   know that great things must occur before that day could come. First,
   there was to be a great apostasy. As the Church was then in its
   infancy, and had just begun to make progress among the nations, such
   language naturally presupposes a much more extended propagation of the
   Gospel, than had as yet taken place. The second event that was to
   precede the second advent was the coming of Antichrist, or, in other
   words, the man of sin was to be revealed.

   The first question, to be determined in the interpretation of this
   prophecy, is, Whether Antichrist is a particular individual, or an
   institution, a power, or a corporation. Protestants generally adopt the
   latter view; because they do not regard any one pope, but the papacy,
   as the Antichrist of Scripture. In favour of this view it may be urged,
   (1.) That it is according to the analogy of prophecy to speak of
   nations, institutions, or kingdoms, as individuals. In Daniel, the ten
   kings are ten kingdoms or dynasties; the several beasts which he saw in
   vision, were not the symbols of particular men, but of nations. When
   therefore the Apostle speaks of Antichrist as "the man of sin," and
   "the son of perdition," it is perfectly consistent with Scriptural
   usage to understand him to refer to an order of men, or to an
   institution. (2.) The work assigned to Antichrist in prophecy, extends
   over far too long a period to be accomplished by one man. (3.) Those
   who insist that the antichrist here predicted, is an individual man,
   are forced to admit that what is said in 2 Thessalonians ii. 7 ("He who
   now letteth, will let, until he be taken out of the way") is to be
   understood of a power. It is generally understood of the Roman power.
   Luthardt understands it of the moral power which sustains the right,
   and therefore is opposed to the reckless disregard of all law, which is
   one of the characteristics of Antichrist. It is true that he supposes
   that reference is also made to one of the guardian or protecting angels
   spoken of by the prophet Daniel. But such an angel is not to be "taken
   out of the way." And there is nothing in the context or in Paul's
   writings anywhere to justify the assumption that reference is here had
   to any angelic personage.

   The second question is, Whether the antichrist here described is an
   ecclesiastical or civil power; whether it is to arise in the Church or
   in the world. The considerations which are in favour of the former of
   these assumptions are, --

   1. That the designations "man of sin" and "son of perdition" have a
   religious import, and are more appropriate to an ecclesiastical than to
   a worldly power or potentate.

   2. Antichrist was to have the seat of his power in the "temple of God."
   It is there he sits. This seems clearly to indicate that it is an
   ecclesiastical usurping, tyrannical, and persecuting power, that is
   here depicted. By the temple of God in this passage is generally
   understood the Church which is so often elsewhere called, and
   especially by Paul, God's temple. Some, however, suppose that the
   reference is to the literal temple in Jerusalem; but this supposes,
   (a.) That the Jews are to be restored to their own land. (b.) That they
   are to be restored as Jews, or unconverted, and that the temple is to
   be there rebuilt. (c.) That the Thessalonians knew all this and would
   understand the Apostle as referring to the temple made with hands;
   which is to the last degree improbable.

   3. His coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs
   and lying wonders. This is not the way in which worldly potentates gain
   their power; they rely on force. But this is the way, as though traced
   by the pen of history rather than by the pencil of prophecy, in which
   the papacy has attained and maintained its fearful ascendancy in the
   world. Its power has been achieved mainly by fraud, "by the
   deceivableness of unrighteousness;" by forged documents and false
   pretences, by claiming that Peter was made primate over the whole
   Church and the vicar or plenipotentiary of Christ on earth; that he was
   the bishop of Rome; that his successors in that office were his
   successors in that primacy; and that as the vicar of Christ he was
   superior to all earthly potentates, not merely as the spiritual is
   above the temporal, but as lord of the conscience, authorized to decide
   what was right and what was wrong for them to do in all their relations
   as men and as rulers; which is a claim of absolute dominion. This,
   however, is a small matter so far as it concerns the things of this
   world. It was to the mass of the people of little moment whether their
   absolute sovereign was a bishop or a prince; whether he resided at Rome
   or in Paris, whether his authority extended over one nation or over all
   nations. It is the false claim of the papacy to have supreme authority
   over the faith of men, to decide for them what they must believe on the
   pain of eternal perdition, that is the most fearful power ever assumed
   by sinful men. To this is to be added the false claim to the power to
   forgive sin. This is, as we have seen, a twofold power, answering to
   the twofold penalty attached to sin, namely, the eternal penalty as a
   violation of the divine law, and the penances still due after the
   remission of the eternal penalty, as satisfactions to divine justice.
   The former can be obtained only through the intervention or absolution
   of the priest; and the latter can be imposed or remitted at the
   discretion of the Church. This includes power over purgatory, the pains
   of which are represented as frightful and of indefinite duration. These
   pains the pope and his subordinates falsely claim the power to
   alleviate or remit. These claims have no parallel in the history of the
   world. If such pretensions as these do not constitute the power which
   makes them Antichrist, then nothing more remains. Any future antichrist
   that may arise must be a small affair compared to the papacy.

   Then again, the Apostle tells us, these portentous claims, these
   unrighteous deceits, were to be supported by "signs and lying wonders."
   These have seldom, if ever, been appealed to by worldly powers to
   support their pretensions. They ever have been and still are among the
   chief supports of the papacy. There is not a false doctrine which it
   teaches, or a false assumption which it makes, which is not sustained
   by "lying wonders." Its whole history is a history of apparitions of
   the Virgin Mary or of saints and angels; and of miracles of every
   possible description from the most stupendous to the most absurd. It
   has ever acted on the principle "populus vult decipi," and that it in
   right to deceive them for their own good, or, the good of the Church.
   The whole system, so far as it is distinctive, [840] is a system of
   falsehood, or false pretensions, supported by deceit.

   4. Antichrist is to be a persecuting power. Is not this true of the
   papacy? It has been drunk with the blood of the saints. It not only
   persecutes, but it justifies persecution, and avows to this day its
   purpose to enforce its dominion by the rack and the stake wherever it
   has the power. This is involved in its justification of the past, and
   in its making it a duty to suppress every form of religion but that of
   Rome. The thirty years' war in Germany; the persistent attempts to
   exterminate the Piedmontese; the massacres by the Duke of Alva in the
   Netherlands; the horrors of the inquisition in Spain; the dragonnades
   and the massacre of St. Bartholomew in France, over which Te Deums were
   sung in Rome, show that the people of God can hardly have more to
   suffer under any future antichrist than they have already suffered, and
   perhaps have yet to suffer, under the papacy.

   5. Antichrist, according to the Apostle, was to oppose and exalt
   himself above all that is called God or is worshipped; "so that he, as
   God, sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."
   This is true of no worldly power. It was not true of Antiochus
   Epiphanes, who is regarded as the type whence the prophetic portrait of
   Antichrist was drawn. It was not true of any of the Roman emperors.
   Some of them allowed themselves to be enrolled among the thousand gods
   of the Pantheon; but this falls very far short of the description here
   given. It is, however, all true of the papacy, and it is true of no
   other power which has yet appeared upon earth. Paul does not concern
   himself with theories, but with facts. It is not that the popes openly
   profess to be superior to God; or, that in theory they claim to be more
   than men. It is the practical operation of the system which he
   describes. The actual facts are first, that the popes claim the honour
   that is due to God alone; secondly, that they assume the powers which
   are his exclusive prerogatives; and thirdly, that they supersede the
   authority of God, putting their own in its place. It is thus they exalt
   themselves above God.

   They assume the honour which belongs to God not merely by claiming to
   be the vicars of Christ on earth, and by allowing themselves to be
   addressed as Lord and God, but by exacting the submission of the
   reason, the conscience, and the life, to their authority. This is the
   highest tribute which a creature can render the Creator; and this the
   popes claim to be their due from all mankind. They claim divine
   prerogatives as infallible teachers on all questions of faith and
   practice, and as having the power to forgive sin. And they exalt their
   authority above that of God by practically setting aside his word, and
   substituting their decrees and what they put forth as the teachings of
   the Church. It is a simple and undeniable fact that in all countries
   under the effective dominion of the pope, the Scriptures are
   inaccessible to the people, and the faith of the masses reposes not on
   what the Bible teaches, but on what the Church declares to be true.

   Even such a writer as John Henry Newman, in an essay written before his
   formal adhesion to the Church of Rome, uses such language as the
   following: The question is, "Has Christ, or has He not, appointed a
   body representative of Him in earth during his absence?" This question
   he answers in the affirmative, and says, "Not even the proof of our
   Lord's divinity is plainer than that of the Church's commission. Not
   even the promises to David or to Solomon more evidently belong to
   Christ, than those to Israel, or Jerusalem, or Sion, belong to the
   Church. Not even Daniel's prophecies are more exact to the letter, than
   those which invest the Church with powers which Protestants consider
   Babylonish. Nay, holy Daniel himself is in no small measure employed on
   this very subject. He it is who announces a fifth kingdom, like a stone
   cut out without hands,' which broke in pieces and consumed' all former
   kingdoms, but was itself to stand forever' and to become a great
   mountain,' and to fill the whole earth.' He it is also who prophesies
   that the Saints of the most High shall take the kingdom and possess the
   kingdom forever.' He saw in the night visions and behold one like to
   the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient
   of Days, and there was given Him dominion and glory and a kingdom, that
   all people, nations, and languages should serve Him.' Such too is
   Isaiah's prophecy, Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of
   the Lord from Jerusalem, and He shall judge among the nations and
   rebuke many people.' Now Christ Himself was to depart from the earth.
   He could not then in his own person be intended in these great
   prophecies; if He acted it must be by delegacy." [841] According to the
   Romanists, therefore, these prophecies, relating to Christ and his
   kingdom, refer to the papacy. It is the stone cut out of the mountain
   without hands, which is to break in pieces and consume all other
   kingdoms; which is to stand forever; which is to fill the whole earth,
   to which is given dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people,
   nations, and languages should serve. If this be not to put itself in
   the place of God, it is hard to see how the prophecies concerning
   Antichrist can ever be fulfilled.

   No more conclusive argument to prove that the papacy is Antichrist,
   could be constructed, than that furnished by Dr. Newman, himself a
   Romanist. According to him the prophecies respecting the glory, the
   exaltation, the power, and the universal dominion of Christ, have their
   fulfilment in the popes. But who is Antichrist, but the man that puts
   himself in the place of Christ; claiming the honour and the power which
   belong to God manifest in the flesh, for himself? Whoever does this is
   Antichrist, in the highest form in which he can appear.

   6. Another argument to prove that the Antichrist described by the
   Apostle is an ecclesiastical power is that his appearance is the
   consequence of a great apostasy. That the apostasy spoken of is a
   defection from the truth is plain from the Scriptural usage of the term
   (Acts xxi. 21), and from the connection in which it here occurs. When
   God brought the heathen upon the people as conquerors, in punishment of
   their idolatry, their sufferings were a judicial consequence of their
   apostasy, but it cannot be said that the power of Chaldean or Egyptian
   oppressors was the fruit of their defection from the truth. In this
   case, however, Antichrist is represented as the ultimate development of
   the predicted apostasy. If a simple minister should claim to be a
   priest, and then one priest assume dominion over many priests, and then
   one prelate over other prelates, and then one over all, and then that
   one claim to be the ruler of the whole world as vicar of Christ,
   clothed with his authority, so that the prophecy that all peoples,
   nations, and languages should serve the Son of Man, is fulfilled in
   him, then indeed we should have a regular development, from the first
   step to the. last. Bishop Ellicott, though believing Antichrist to be
   "one single personal being, as truly man as He whom he impiously
   opposes," and that he is to be hereafter revealed, still admits that
   Antichrist is to be "the concluding and most appalling phenomenon" of
   the great apostasy. But if so, he must be an ecclesiastical, and not a
   worldly power.

   7. Again the Apostle says that "the mystery of iniquity doth already
   work." That is, the principles and spirit had already begun to manifest
   themselves in the Church, which were to culminate in the revelation of
   the Man of Sin. How could this be said of a person who was to be a
   worldly prince, appearing outside of the Church, separated, not only
   chronologically by ages from the apostolic age, but also logically,
   from all the causes then in operation. If Antichrist is to be a single
   person, concentrating in himself all worldly power as a universal
   monarch, to appear shortly before the end of the world, as is assumed
   by so many expounders of prophecy, it is hard to see how he was to be
   the product of the leaven already working in the times of the Apostles.

   If however, as Protestants have so generally believed, the papacy is
   the Antichrist which the Apostle had in his prophetic eye, then this
   passage is perfectly intelligible. The two elements of which the papacy
   is the development are the desire of preeminence or lust of power, and
   the idea of a priesthood, that is, that Christian ministers are
   mediators whose intervention is necessary to secure access to God, and
   that they are authorized to make atonement for sin; to which was added
   the claim to grant absolution. Both these elements were at work in the
   apostolic age. The papacy is the product of the transfer of Jewish and
   Pagan ideas to the Christian system. The Jews had a high priest, and
   all the ministers of the sanctuary were sacrificing priests. The Romans
   had a "Pontifex Maximus" and the ministers of religion among them were
   priests. Nothing was more natural and nothing is plainer as a
   historical fact than that the assumption of a priestly character and
   functions by the Christian ministry, was one of the earliest
   corruptions of the Church. And nothing is plainer than that to this
   assumption the power of the papacy is in a large measure to be
   attributed. And as to the desire of preeminence, we know that there
   was, even among the twelve, a contention who should be the greatest.
   The Apostle John (3 Epistle 9) speaks of Diotrephes, "who loveth to
   have the preeminence;" and in all the Epistles there is evidence of the
   struggle for ascendancy on the part of unworthy ministers and teachers.
   The leaven of iniquity, therefore, was at work in the apostolic age,
   which concentrated by degrees into the portentous system of the papacy.

   8. According to this view, the difficult passage in verses 6 and 7
   admits of an easy interpretation. The Apostle there says: "Now ye know
   what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time. For the
   mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let,
   until he be taken out of the way." There was, therefore, at that time
   an obstacle which prevented the development of the Man of Sin, and
   would continue to present it, as long as it remained as it then was. It
   is to be noticed that Paul says, "Now ye know what withholdeth." How
   could the Thessalonians know to what he referred? only from the
   Apostle's instructions, or from the nature of the case. The fact
   however is that they did know, and, therefore, it is probable that
   knowledge was communicated to others, and was not likely to be soon
   forgotten. This consideration gives the more weight to the almost
   unanimous judgment of the early fathers that the obstacle to the
   development of Antichrist was the Roman empire. While that continued in
   its vigour it was impossible that an ecclesiastic should become the
   virtual sovereign of the world. It is a historical fact that the
   conflict between the Emperors and the Popes for the ascendancy, was
   continued for ages, and that as the power of the former decreased that
   of the latter increased.

   On the assumption that the Antichrist of which Paul speaks in his
   Epistle to the Thessalonians, is a powerful worldly monarch hereafter
   to appear, these verses, the 6th and 7th, present the greatest
   difficulty. The causes which are to bring such a monarch into the
   possession of his power were not then in operation; there was then no
   obstacle to his manifestation so obvious as to be generally known to
   Christians, and the removal of which was to be followed at once by his
   revelation. Even on the assumption that the obstacle of which the
   Apostle speaks, was not the Roman empire, but rather the regard to law
   and order deeply fixed in the public mind, which stood in the way of
   the revelation of the Man of Sin, this difficulty is scarcely lessened.
   How could the Thessalonians have known that? How foreign to their minds
   must have been the thought that a regard for law must be taken out of
   the way before the lawless one could appear. It seems plain that the
   early fathers were right in their interpretation of the Apostle's
   language; and that he meant to say that the appearance of
   ecclesiastical claimants to universal dominion, was not possible until
   the Roman empire was effectually broken.

   According to Paul's account, Antichrist was to arise in the Church. He
   was to put forth the most exorbitant claims; exalt himself above all
   human authority; assume to himself the prerogatives of God, demanding a
   submission due only to God, and virtually setting aside the authority
   of God, and substituting his own in its place. These assumptions were
   to be sustained by all manner of unrighteous deceits, by signs, and by
   lying wonders. This portrait suits the papacy so exactly, that
   Protestants at least have rarely doubted that it is the Antichrist
   which the Apostle intended to describe.

   Dr. John Henry Newman says, that if Protestants insist on making the
   Church of Rome Antichrist, they thereby make over all Roman Catholics,
   past and present, "to utter and hopeless perdition." [842] This does
   not follow. The Church of Rome is to be viewed under different aspects;
   as the papacy, an external organized hierarchy, with the pope, with all
   his arrogant claims, at its head; and also as a body of men professing
   certain religious doctrines. Much may be said of it in the one aspect,
   which is not true of it in the other. Much may be said of Russia as an
   empire that cannot be said of all Russians. At one time the first
   Napoleon was regarded by many as Antichrist; that did not involve the
   belief that all Frenchmen who acknowledged him as emperor, or all
   soldiers who followed him as their leader, were the sons of perdition.
   That many Roman Catholics, past and present, are true Christians, is a
   palpable fact. It is a fact which no man can deny without committing a
   great sin. It is a sin against Christ not to acknowledge as true
   Christians those who bear his image, and whom He recognizes as his
   brethren. It is a sin also against ourselves. We are not born of God
   unless we love the children of God. If we hate and denounce those whom
   Christ loves as members of his own body, what are we? It is best to be
   found on the side of Christ, let what will happen. It is perfectly
   consistent, then, for a man to denounce the papacy as the man of sin,
   and yet rejoice in believing, and in openly acknowledging, that there
   are, and ever have been, many Romanists who are the true children of
   God.

   Admitting that the Apostle's predictions refer to the Roman pontiffs,
   it does not follow that the papacy is the only antichrist. St. John
   says there are many antichrists. Our Lord says many shall come in his
   name, claiming in one form or another his authority, and endeavouring
   to take his place by dethroning him. The Apostle John tells us this "is
   the last time" (1 John ii. 18) in which many antichrists are to appear.
   This "last time" extends from the first to the second advent of Christ.
   This long period lay as one scene before the minds of the prophets. And
   they tell what was given them to see, not as though they were writing a
   history, and unfolding events in their historical order, but as
   describing the figures which they saw, as it were, represented on the
   same canvass. As Isaiah describes the redemption from Babylon and the
   redemption by the Messiah as though they were contemporary events, so
   Joel, in almost the same sentence, connects the effusion of the spirit
   which attended the first advent of Christ with the great elemental
   changes which are to attend his second coming. How long the period
   between the first and second advents of the Son of God is to be
   protracted is unrevealed. It has already lasted nearly two thousand
   years, and, for what we know, may last two thousand more. As this long
   period, crowded with great events, was presented as a whole to the
   minds of the prophets, it is not surprising that, under the guidance of
   the Holy Spirit, one should fix on one prominent feature in the scene,
   and others upon another. Under the divine guidance granted to these
   holy seers, there could be no error and no contradiction, but there
   could hardly fail to be great variety. It would not, therefore,
   invalidate the account given of Paul's description of Antichrist, if it
   should be found to differ in some respects from the antichrists of
   Daniel and of the Apocalypse.

   The Antichrist of Daniel.

   The reader of the prophecies of Daniel has, at least in many cases, the
   advantage of a divine interpretation of his predictions. The prophet
   himself did not understand the import of his visions, and begged to
   have them explained to him; and his request was, in a measure, granted.
   Thus in the seventh chapter we read: "I saw in my vision by night, and
   behold, . . . . four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one
   from another. The first was like a lion; . . . . a second like to a
   bear; another like a leopard; (and) a fourth beast dreadful and
   terrible, and strong exceedingly, . . . . and it had ten horns . . . .
   And behold there came up among them another little horn, before whom
   there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and,
   behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth
   speaking great things."

   These beasts were, as the explanation states, the symbols of four
   kingdoms, the Babylonish, the Medo-Persian, the Greek, and the Roman.
   This last was to be divided into ten kingdoms. That kings in this
   prophecy mean kingdoms, not individuals, but an organized community
   under a king, is plain from the nature of the predictions and from the
   express declaration of the prophet; for he says, in verse 17, that the
   four beasts are four kings; and in verse 23, that the fourth beast is
   the fourth kingdom. King and kingdom, therefore, are interchanged as of
   the same iport, After, or in the midst of these ten kingdoms signified
   by the ten horns, there was to arise another kingdom or power
   symbolized by the little horn. Of this power it is said: (1.) That it
   was to be of a different kind from the others. Perhaps, as they were
   civil or worldly kingdoms, this was to be ecclesiastical. (2.) He was
   to gain the ascendancy over the other powers; at least three of them
   were to be plucked up by the roots. (3.) He was to speak great things,
   or be arrogant in his assumptions. (4.) He was to set himself against
   God; speaking "great words against the Most High." (5.) He was to
   persecute the saints; prevail against them and wear them out; and they
   shall be given into his hands. (6.) This antichristian power was to
   continue until the judgment, i.e., "until the Ancient of Days came, and
   judgment was given to the saints of the Most High." (Dan. vii. 22.) In
   all these particulars the Antichrist of Daniel answers to the
   description given by St. Paul in 2 Thessalonians. In one point,
   however, they appear to differ. According to Daniel, the power of
   Antichrist was to last, or at least his persecution of the saints, only
   "a time and times and the dividing of a time;" that is, three years and
   a half. (Compare Rev. xiii. 5, and xi. 2, 3.) This is the
   interpretation generally adopted. Calvin adopts the principle that in
   the prophecies definite periods of time are used for periods of
   indefinite duration. In his Commentary on Daniel he makes the little
   horn spoken of in the seventh chapter to be Julius Cæsar, and says:
   "Qui annum putant hic notari per tempus, falluntur meo judicio . . . .
   Annus sumetur figurate pro tempore aliquo indeterminato." [843] He
   significantly says: "In numeris non sum Pythagoricus." [844]

   There are two answers to this difficulty. The word antichrist may be a
   generic term, as it seems to have been used by St. John, not referring
   exclusively to any one individual person, or to any one organization,
   but to any and every antichristian power, having certain
   characteristics. So that there may be, as the Apostle says, many
   Antichrists. Hence Daniel may describe one, and Paul another. Secondly,
   the same power, retaining all its essential characteristics, may change
   its form. If republican France, during the first revolution, was an
   antichristian nation, it did not necessarily change its character when
   it became an empire; and what was, or might have been, said of it in
   prophecy under the one form, might not have answered to what it was
   under the other form. During the Middle Ages, bishops were sometimes
   princes and warriors. A prophetic description of them, while giving
   their general characteristics suited to both their ecclesiastical and
   worldly functions, might say some things of them as warlike princes
   which did not belong to them as bishops. However, we do not pretend to
   be experts in matters of prophecy; our object is simply to state what
   Paul said of the Antichrist which he had in view, and what Daniel said
   of the Antichrist which he was inspired to describe.

   In the eleventh chapter of Daniel, from the 36th verse to the end,
   there is a passage which is commonly understood of Antichrist, because
   what is there said is not true of Antiochus Epiphanes, to whom the
   former part of the chapter is referred, and is true of Antichrist as
   described in other places in the Scriptures. It is not true of
   Antiochus Epiphanes that he abandoned the gods of his fathers. On the
   contrary, his purpose was to force all under his control, the Jews
   included, to worship those gods. What is said in verse 36 is in
   substance what Paul says, in 2 Thessalonians ii. 4, of the Man of Sin.
   Daniel says that "the king," whom he describes, "shall do according to
   his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every
   god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and
   shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is
   determined shall be done." This exalting himself "above all that is
   called god" is the prominent characteristic of Antichrist as he is
   elsewhere presented in Scripture.

   The Antichrist of the Apocalypse.

   The Apocalypse seems to be a summing up and expansion of all the
   eschatological prophecies of the Old Testament, especially of those of
   Ezekiel, Zechariah and Daniel. The same symbols, the same forms of
   expression, the same numbers, the same cycle of events, occur in the
   New Testament predictions, that are found in those of the Old. Everyone
   knows that commentators differ not only in their interpretation of the
   details, but even as to the whole structure and design of the book of
   Revelation. Some regard it as a description in oriental imagery of
   contemporaneous events; others as intended to set forth the different
   phases of the spiritual life of the Church; others as designed to
   unfold the leading events in the history of the Church and of the world
   in their chronological order; others again assume that it is a series,
   figuratively speaking, of circles; each vision or series of visions
   relating to the same events under different aspects; the end, and the
   preparation for the end, being presented over and over again; the great
   theme being the coming of the Lord, and the triumph of his Church.
   [845]

   The most commonly accepted view of the general contents of the book by
   those who adopt the chronological method is that so clearly presented
   in the admirable little work of Dr. James M. Macdonald (now of
   Princeton, New Jersey). [846] According to this view, the introduction
   is contained in chapters i.-iii.; part second relates the Jewish
   persecutions, and the destruction of that power, in chapters iv.-xi.
   14, part third relates the Pagan persecutions, and the end of the Pagan
   persecuting power, in chapters xi. 15-xiii. 10; part fourth relates the
   Papal persecutions and errors, and their end, in chapters xiii.
   11-xix.; and part fifth relates the latter day of glory, the battle of
   Gog and Magog, the final judgment, and the heavenly state, in chapters
   xx.-xxii.

   Luthardt may be taken as a representative of the advocates of the
   theory that the historical sequence of events is not designed to be set
   forth in the Apocalypse. The three works of the Apostle John contained
   in the New Testament, the Gospel, the Epistles, and the Apocalypse,
   according to Luthardt, form a beautiful, harmonious whole; as faith,
   love, and hope mingle into one, so do these writings of St. John,
   though each has its characteristic; faith is prominent in the Gospel,
   love in the Epistles, and hope in the Apocalypse. The theme of the Book
   of Revelation is, "Behold, He comes." Luthardt admits that commentators
   differ greatly as to their views of its meaning, and that, at first, it
   appears very full of enigmas; but he adds, [847] "Whoever is familiar
   with the ancient prophecies, and gives himself with loving confidence
   to this book, will soon find the right way, which will lead him safely
   through all its labyrinths." This is the experience of every
   commentator so far as he himself is concerned, however he may fail to
   satisfy his readers that his way is the right one. The main principle
   of Luthardt's exposition is, "That the Revelation of John does not
   contemplate the events of history, whether of the Church or of the
   world. It contemplates the end. We find that the antagonism of the
   Church and the world, and the issue of the conflict are its contents;
   the coming of Christ is its theme. The events of history preceding the
   consummation are taken up only so far as they are connected with the
   final issue. This consummation is not chronologically unfolded, but is
   ever taken up anew, in order to lead us by a new way to the end." [848]
   One thing is certain, namely, that the Apocalypse contains the series
   of predictions common to all the prophets; the defections of the people
   of God; persecutions of their enemies; direful judgments on the
   persecutors; and the final triumph and blessedness of the elect. Under
   different forms, this is the burden of all the disclosures God has seen
   fit to make of the fate of his Church here on earth and this is the
   burden of the Apocalypse. According to Luthardt, the first vision i.
   9-iii. 22, concerns the present state of the Church; the second vision,
   iv. 1-viii. 1, concerns God and the world; the third vision, viii.
   2-xi. 19, concerns the judgment of the world and the consummation of
   covenant fellowship with God; the fourth vision, xii.-xiv. concerns the
   Church and the antichristian world power; this contains the vision of
   the woman, which brought forth the man child; and in xii. 18-xiii. 18,
   Antichrist and the false prophet; and in xiv. the Church of the end,
   and the judgment of the antichristian world; and the fifth vision,
   xv.-xxii. concerns the outpouring of wrath upon the world and the
   redemption of the Church.

   It is characteristic of the Apocalypse that it takes up and expands the
   eschatological predictions of the earlier portions of Scripture. What
   in the Old Testament or in the Epistles of the New Testament, is set
   forth under one symbol and in the concrete, is in the Apocalypse
   presented under two or more symbols representing the constituent
   elements of the whole. Thus the Antichrist is predicted in Daniel under
   the symbol of "the little horn," and in Paul's Epistle to the
   Thessalonians under the title of the Man of Sin. Antichrist, as thus
   portrayed, includes an ecclesiastical and a worldly element; an
   apostate Church invested with imperial, worldly power. In the
   Apocalypse these two elements are represented as separate and united; a
   woman sitting on a beast with ten horns. The woman is the apostate
   Church; the beast is the symbol of the world-power by which it is
   supported. The destruction of the one, therefore, does not involve the
   destruction of the other. According to the prediction in the eighteenth
   chapter, the kings of the earth, wearied with the arrogance and
   assumption of the apostate Church, shall turn against it, waste, and
   consume it; that is, despoil it of its external power and glory. The
   destruction of Babylon, therefore, here predicted, is understood by
   that diligent student of prophecy, Mr. D. N. Lord, not as implying the
   overthrow of the Papacy, but its "denationalization" and spoliation.
   [849]

   Throughout the Scriptures the relation between God and his people is
   illustrated by that of a husband to his wife; apostasy from God,
   therefore, is in the ancient prophets called adultery. In the
   Revelation, the Church, considered as faithful, is called the woman; as
   apostate, the adulteress or harlot; and as glorified, the bride, the
   Lamb's wife. It is in accordance with the analogy of Scripture that the
   harlot spoken of in chapters xvii. and xviii. is understood to be the
   apostate Church. Of this woman it is said: (1.) That she sits on many
   waters. This is explained in xvii. 15, of her wide spread dominion:
   "The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples,
   and multitudes, and nations, and tongues." (2.) That she seduced the
   nations into idolatry; making the inhabitants of the earth drunk with
   the wine of her fornication. (3.) That she is sustained in her
   blasphemous assumption of divine prerogatives and powers by the kings
   and princes of the earth. She is seen sitting on a scarlet-coloured
   beast, full of the names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten
   horns. In verse 12, these ten horns are said to be ten kings, i.e., in
   the language of prophecy, ten kingdoms. (4.) That she takes rank among
   and above the kings and princes of the earth. She is "arrayed in purple
   and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and
   pearls." (5.) That her riches are above estimate. This is dwelt upon at
   length in the eighteenth chapter. (6.) That she is a persecuting power,
   "drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the
   martyrs of Jesus." (7.) That the claims of this persecuting power, as
   appears from Revelation xiii. 3, 14, are to be sustained by lying
   wonders. "He doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from
   heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell
   on the earth by those miracles which he hath power to do in the sight
   of the beast." We find, therefore, in this description all the traits
   which in Daniel and the Epistle to the Thessalonians are ascribed to
   the Man of Sin, or, ho antikeimenos, the Antichrist. It matters not
   what this power may be called. "Wheresoever the carcass is, there will
   the eagles be gathered together." Any man; any institution; any
   organized power which answers to this prophetic description, comes
   within the prophetic denunciations here recorded. [850] Neither does it
   matter what is to happen after this judgment on the mystical Babylon.
   Should another Antichrist arise, essentially worldly in his character,
   as so many anticipate, who shall attain universal dominion, and set
   himself against God and his Christ with more blasphemous assumptions,
   with a more malignant hatred of the Church, and a more demoniacal
   spirit than any of his predecessors, this would not at all disprove the
   correctness of the interpretation given above of St. John's predictions
   concerning Babylon. On this point, Maitland says: "The two great powers
   whose names stand foremost in prophecy come into historical contact at
   a single point. Where Babylon ends, Antichrist begins: the same ten
   kings that destroy the first, give their power to the second. When the
   ten kings shall have burnt Rome, so complete will be the ruin, that no
   sign of life or habitation will again be found in her. Here, then, is a
   decisive landmark; Rome is still standing, therefore, Antichrist has
   not yet come: we are still in the times of Babylon, whether tasting or
   refusing her golden cap." In this view, that is, in assuming that the
   Scriptural prophecies respecting Antichrist, have not their full
   accomplishment in any one anti-christian power or personage
   exclusively, many of the most distinguished eschatologists, as Auberlen
   and Luthardt, substantially agree. The ancient prediction that Japhet
   should dwell in the tents of Shem, had its fulfilment every time the
   descendants of the latter participated in the temporal or spiritual
   heritage of the children of the former; and had its final and great
   accomplishment in the sons of Japhet sharing the blessings of
   redemption, which were to be realized in the line of Shem. In like
   manner the predictions concerning Antichrist may have had a partial
   fulfilment in Antiochus Epiphanes, in Nero and Pagan Rome, and in the
   papacy, and, it may still have a fulfilment in some great
   anti-christian power which is yet to appear. So much, at least, is
   clear, in the time of Paul there was in the future a great apostasy and
   an antichristian, arrogant persecuting power, which has been realized,
   in all its essential characteristics, in the papacy, whatever may
   happen after Antichrist, in that form, is utterly despoiled and trodden
   under foot. [851]

   Roman Catholic Doctrine of Antichrist.

   The general opinion in the early Church was that Antichrist was a man
   of Satanic spirit endowed with Satanic power who should appear before
   the second coming of Christ. Jerome says, in his Commentary on Daniel:
   "Let us say what all ecclesiastical writers have handed down, namely,
   that at the end of the world, when the Roman empire is destroyed, there
   will be ten kings who will divide the Roman world amongst them; and
   there will arise an eleventh little king, who will subdue three of the
   ten kings, that is, the king of Egypt, of Africa, and of Ethiopia, as
   we shall hereafter show. And on these being slain the seven others will
   also submit. And behold,' he says, in the ram were the eyes of a man.'
   This is said that we may not suppose him to be a devil or demon, as
   some have thought, but a man in whom Satan will dwell utterly and
   bodily. And a mouth speaking great things,' for he is the man of sin,
   the son of perdition, who sitteth in the temple of God, making himself
   as God.'" [852]

   Substantially the same view prevailed during the Middle Ages. Some
   however of the theologians of the Latin Church saw that the development
   of the Man of Sin was to take place in the Church itself and be
   connected with a general apostasy from the faith. They were therefore
   sufficiently bold to teach that the Church of Rome was to fall away,
   and that the Papacy or some individual pontiff was to become the
   Antichrist spoken of in Scripture. The abbot Joachim of Floris (died
   1202), a Franciscan, put himself in opposition to the worldly spirit of
   the Church of his time, and his followers, called "Spirituales," came
   to denounce the Church of Rome as the mystical Babylon of the
   Apocalypse. This was done with great boldness by John Peter of Oliva
   (died 1297), whose works were formally condemned as "blasphemous and
   heretical." Among the passages thus condemned are the following: "The
   woman here stands for the people and empire of Rome, both as she
   existed formerly in a state of Paganism, and as she has since existed,
   holding the faith of Christ, though by many crimes committing harlotry
   with this world. And, therefore, she is called a great harlot; for,
   departing from the faithful worship, the true love and delights of her
   Bridegroom, even Christ her God, she cleaves to this world, its riches
   and delights; yea, for their sake she cleaves to the devil, also to
   kings, nobles, and prelates, and to all other lovers of this world."
   "She saith in her heart, that is, in her pride, I sit a queen: -- I am
   at rest; I rule over my kingdom with great dominion and glory. And I am
   no widow: -- I am not destitute of glorious bishops and kings." [853]

   Not only the poets Dante and Petrarch denounced the corruptions of the
   Church of Rome, but down to the time of the Reformation that Church was
   held up by a succession of theologians or ecclesiastics, as the Babylon
   of the Apocalypse which was to be overthrown and rendered desolate.

   When the Reformers with one voice pronounced the same judgment, and,
   making little distinction between Babylon and Antichrist, held up the
   Papacy as the antichristian power predicted by Daniel, by St. Paul, and
   by St. John, the Romanists laid out their strength in defending their
   Church from this denunciation. Bellarmin, the great advocate of the
   cause of Romanism, devotes an extended dissertation to the discussion
   of this subject, which constitutes the third book of his work, "De
   Romano Pontifice." The points that he assumes are: First, that the word
   "Antichrist" cannot mean, as some Protestants thought, "substitute or
   vicar" of Christ, but an opponent of Christ. In this all parties are
   now agreed. Second, that Antichrist is "unus homo," and not "genus
   hominum." The Magdeburg Centuriators [854] said: "Docent [Apostoli]
   Antichristum non fore unam aliquam tantum personam, sed integrum
   regnum, per falsos doctores in templo Dei, hoc est in Ecclesia Dei
   præsidentes, in urba magna, quæ habet regnum super reges terræ id est,
   in Romana civitate, et imperio Romano, opera diaboli, et fraude, et
   deceptione comparatum." This view Bellarmin undertakes to refute,
   controverting the arguments of Calvin and Beza in its support. In this
   opinion also the leading Protestant interpreters of the present day, as
   above stated, agree. According to the views already advanced, there may
   be hereafter a great antichristian power, concentrated in an individual
   ruler, who will be utterly destroyed at the coming of the Lord, and at
   the same time the belief may be maintained that the Antichrist
   described by Daniel and St. Paul is not a man, but an institution or
   organized power such as a kingdom or the papacy.

   The third position assumed by Bellarmin is that the Antichrist is still
   future. In this way he endeavours to make it plain that the papacy is
   not Antichrist. But, as just said, even if an Antichrist, and even the
   Antichrist kat' exochen, is yet to come, that would not prove that the
   papacy is not the power predicted by the Apostle as the Man of Sin, and
   the mystical Babylon as predicted in the Apocalypse.

   Bellarmin says that the Holy Spirit gives us six signs of Antichrist,
   from which it is plain that he has not yet appeared. Two of these signs
   precede his coming, the universal proclamation of the Gospel, and the
   utter destruction of the Roman Empire, two are to attend it, namely,
   the preaching of Enoch and Elias, and persecutions so severe as to
   cause the cessation of all public worship of God; and two are to follow
   his appearance; his utter destruction after three years and a half; and
   the end of the world. The passages on which he relies to prove that
   Enoch and Elias are to come and oppose themselves to Antichrist, and to
   preserve the elect, are Malachi iv., Ecclesiasticus xliv. and xlviii.,
   Matthew xvii. 11 (Jesus said, "Elias truly shall first come and restore
   all things"), and Revelation xi. 3, where the appearance of the two
   witnesses, who were to prophesy two thousand two hundred and sixty
   days, is foretold. As modern evangelical interpreters agree with
   Bellarmin in so many other points, so they agree with him in teaching
   that there is to be a second appearance of Elias, before the second
   advent of Christ. Luthardt understands Matthew xvi. 11 as predicting
   such reappearance of the Old Testament prophet. He was to be one, and
   Moses the other of the two witnesses spoken of in Revelation xi. 3. Of
   course, says Luthardt, Elias and Moses are to reappear in the sense in
   which Elias appeared in the person of John the Baptist. [855]

   Fourthly, according to Bellarmin, Antichrist is to be a Jew, and
   probably of the tribe of Dan. He is to claim to be the Messiah, and
   this claim is to be recognized by the Jews. In virtue of his
   Messiahship he sets himself against Christ, and puts himself in his
   place, and arrogates the reverence, the obedience, the universal
   dominion and the absolute authority, which rightfully belong to the
   Lord Jesus Christ. The seat of his dominion is to be Jerusalem. In the
   Temple restored in that city, he is to take his seat as God, and exalt
   himself above all that is called God. He is called "the little horn,"
   because the Jews are comparatively a small nation. But he is to subdue
   one kingdom after another until his dominion as a worldly sovereign
   becomes absolutely universal. The authority urged for this view is
   principally that of the fathers, many of whom taught that Antichrist
   was to be a Jew of the tribe of Dan. Appeal was made by those fathers
   as by their followers to Genesis xlix. 17, where it is said, "Dan shall
   be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the
   horse-heels, so that his rider shall fall backward." And also to
   Revelation vii., because in the enumeration of the tribes from which
   the hundred and forty and four thousand were sealed, the name of Dan is
   omitted. Bellarmin argues that Antichrist is to be a Jew from John v.
   43: "I am come in my Father's name and ye (Jews) receive me not: if
   another shall come in his own name, him ye (Jews) will receive." That
   is, will receive as the Messiah; but the Jews, as Bellarmin argues,
   would never receive as the Messiah any one who was not himself a Jew.
   The principal Scriptural ground of the opinion that Antichrist is to be
   a Jew is founded on Revelation xi. 8, where the seat of his dominion is
   said to be the great city "where also our Lord was crucified." In
   answer to this argument it may be said, first, that admitting that the
   literal Jerusalem is to be the seat of the kingdom of Antichrist, it
   does not follow that either he or his kingdom is to be Jewish. Many
   interpreters hold that the Jews, instead of being the supporters of
   Antichrist, are to be the principal objects of his malice, and that it
   is by persecuting and oppressing them that he is to get possession of
   their holy city and profane their temple far more atrociously than it
   was profaned by Antiochus Epiphanes. And secondly, interpreters so
   different as Hengstenberg and Mr. David N. Lord, agree in understanding
   the predictions in Revelation xi. to refer not to the literal Jerusalem
   and its Temple, but to that of which they were the symbols. The New
   Jerusalem is the symbol of the purified and glorified Church; the city
   where our Lord was crucified, the symbol of the worldly and
   nationalized Church. [856]

   Fifthly, as to the doctrine of Antichrist, everything follows, from the
   assumption that he claims to be Christ. In claiming to be the Messiah
   predicted by the prophets, he is to claim to be the only object of
   worship. That he is to admit of no other God, whether true or false,
   nor of any idols, Bellarmin infers from 2 Thessa1onians ii. 2, "He
   opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or is
   worshipped." "Certum est," says Bellarmin, "Antichristi persecutionem
   fore gravissimam et notissimam; ita ut cessent omnes publicæ religionis
   ceremoniæ et sacrificia . . . . [Daniel xii. docet] Antichristum
   interdictdurum omnem divinum cultum, qui in ecclesiis Christianorum
   exercetur." [857] Thus also Stapleton says: "Pelli sane potent in
   desertam ecclesia, regnante Antichristi, et illo momento temporis in
   deserta, id est, in locis abitis, in speluncis, in latibulis quo sancti
   se recipient, non incommode quæretur ecclesia." [858] During the reign
   of Antichrist, according to the notes to the Romish version of the New
   Testament on 2 Thessalonians ii., "The external state of the Romish
   Church, and the public intercourse of the faithful with it, may cease.
   Yet the due honour and obedience towards the Roman see, and the
   communion of heart with it, and the secret practice of that communion,
   and the open confession thereof, if the occasion require, shall not
   cease." Again on verse 4th it is said, "The great Antichrist who must
   come towards the world's end, shall abolish all other religions, true
   and false; and put down the blessed sacrament of the altar, wherein
   consisteth principally the worship of the true God, and also all idols
   of the Gentiles." "The oblation of Christ's blood," it is said, "is to
   be abolished among all the nations and churches in the world."

   Finally, concerning the kingdom and wars of Antichrist, the Roman
   cardinal teaches, (1.) That from small beginnings, he is by fraud and
   deceit, to attain the kingdom of the Jews. (2.) That he is to subdue
   and take possession of the three kingdoms of Egypt, Libya, and
   Ethiopia. (Dan. xi.) (3.) That he is then to reduce to subjection the
   other seven kingdoms spoken of by the prophet; and (4.) That with an
   innumerable army, he shall make for a time successful war against all
   Christians in every part of the world, and finally be overthrown and
   utterly destroyed, as described in the twentieth chapter of Revelation.

   From this review it appears that the doctrine of the Romish theologians
   concerning Antichrist, agrees with that of a large body of modern
   Protestant writers in the following points: (1.) That he is to be an
   individual, and not a corporation, or "genus hominum." (2.) That he is
   to be a worldly potentate. (3.) That he is to attain universal
   dominion. (4.) That he is to be, in character, godless and reckless,
   full of malignity against Christ and his people. (5.) That by his
   seductions and persecutions he is to succeed for a time in almost
   banishing true religion from the world. (6.) That his reign is to be
   brief.

   The principal difference between the early Protestants and the modern
   evangelical interpreters, is, that the former identify Babylon and
   Antichrist; that is, they refer to one and the same power the
   prophecies of Daniel referring to the little horn; the description
   given by the Apostle in 2 Thessalonians ii.; and the account of the
   beast in chapter xiii. of the Apocalypse and that given in chapter
   xvii. Whereas, the moderns for the most part distinguish between the
   two. The papacy they regard as set forth under the symbol of Babylon;
   and Antichrist, as a worldly potentate, under the beast which came up
   out of the abyss. [859]

   The great truth set forth in these prophecies is, that there was future
   in the time, not only of Daniel, but also of the Apostles, a great
   apostasy in the Church; that this apostasy would be Antichristian (or
   Antichrist), ally itself with the world and become a great persecuting
   power; and that the two elements, the ecclesiastical and the worldly,
   which enter into this great Antichristian development, will, sometimes
   the one and sometimes the other, become the more prominent; sometimes
   acting in harmony, and sometimes opposed one to the other; and,
   therefore, sometimes spoken of as one, and sometimes as two distinct
   powers. Both, as united or as separate, are to be overtaken with a
   final destruction when the Lord comes. So much is certain, that any and
   every power, be it one or more, which answers to the description given
   in Daniel vii. and xi. and in 2 Thessalonians ii. is Antichrist in the
   Scriptural sense of the term.

   According, then, to the common faith of the Church, the three great
   events which are to precede the second advent of Christ, are the
   universal proclamation of the Gospel or the conversion of the Gentile
   world; the national conversion of the Jews; and the appearance of
   Antichrist.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [840] This qualification is necessary. Papists of course hold the
   truths of natural religion; and many of the distinguishing doctrines of
   the Gospel. This is to be acknowledged. We are not to deny that truth
   is truth, because held by Romanists; nor are we to deny, that where
   truth is, there may be its fruits. While condemning Papacy, Protestants
   can, and do joyfully admit that there are among Romanists such godly
   men as St. Bernard, Fénélon, and Pascal, and doubtless thousands more
   known only unto God.

   By Carl August Auberlen, Dr. Phil., Licentiate and Professor
   Extraordinarius of Theology in Basil. Edinburgh, 1856. Auberlen says,
   on page 859: "The interpretation of the Apocalypse may be reduced to
   three grand groups. First, the church-historical view regards the
   Revelations as a prophetic compendium of Church history." This was the
   early Church view. Its principal representative in Germany is Bengel.
   It is generally adopted by the British and French interpreters. To this
   class belong Elliot's Horæ Apocalypticæ, or a Commentary on the
   Apocalypse, Critical and Historical, second edition, London; 1846; four
   volumes; and the work of Gaussen of Geneva, entitled Daniel le
   Prophéte. The second class includes the modern German interpreters,
   who, denying any real prediction of the future, confine the views of
   Daniel and John to their contemporary history. To this class belong
   Ewald, De Wette, Lücke, and others. The third group includes those who
   admit the divine inspiration of the prophecies and acknowledge the
   prediction of even minute events, but deny that the Apocalypse was
   designed to be a detailed history of the future. "Its object is to
   represent the great epochs and leading principal powers in the
   development of the kingdom of God viewed in its relation to the
   world-kingdoms." (p. 361.) To this class Auberlen himself belongs, and
   he has carried out the theory with singular clearness and ability. His
   work is excellently translated by the Rev. Adolph Saphir.

   neither is it only the Roman Catholic Church, to the exclusion of
   another, but all churches and every church, ours included, namely, all
   Christendom that is without the Spirit and life of our Lord Jesus,
   which calls itself Christian and has neither Christ's mind nor Spirit."
   While giving the prophecy this wide scope, Auberlen, nevertheless,
   adds, "The Roman Catholic Church is not only accidentally and de
   facto,' but in virtue of its very principle a harlot; she has the
   lamentable distinction of being the harlot kat' exochen, the metropolis
   of whoredom, the mother of harlots (Rev. vii. 5); it is she, who, more
   than others, boasts of herself; I sit a queen, and am no widow, and
   shall see no sorrow (xviii. 7), whereas the evangelical (Protestant)
   Church is, according to her principle and fundamental creed, a chaste
   woman; the Reformation was a protest of the woman against the harlot."

CHAPTER IV.

  THE CONCOMITANTS OF THE SECOND ADVENT.

   THE events which according to the common doctrine of the Church are to
   attend the second coming of Christ, are first, the general resurrection
   of the dead; second, the final judgment; third, "the end of the world;"
   and fourth, the consummation of the kingdom of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The General Resurrection.

   That there is to be a general resurrection of the just and of the
   unjust, is not, among Christians, a matter of doubt. Already in the
   book of Daniel xii. 2, it is said, "Many of them that sleep in the dust
   of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame
   and everlasting contempt. And they that be wise shall shine as the
   brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness,
   as stars for ever and ever." This prediction our Lord repeats without
   any limitation. "Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the
   which all that are it the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come
   forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and
   they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." (John v.
   28, 29.) Again: "When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all
   the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his
   glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations." (Matt. xxv. 31,
   32.) Paul, in his speech before Felix (Acts xxiv. 15), avowed it as his
   own faith and that of his fathers that "there shall be a resurrection
   of the dead, both of the just and unjust." John (Rev. xx. 12, 13) says:
   "I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were
   opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the
   dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books,
   according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in
   it, and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them."

   The Time of this General Resurrection.

   The uniform representation of Scripture on this subject is that this
   general resurrection is to take place "at the last day," or, at the
   second coming of Christ. The same form of expression is used to
   designate the time when the people of Christ are to rise, and the time
   when the general resurrection is to occur. The Bible, if the doubtful
   passage Revelation x. 4-6 be excepted, never speaks of any other than
   one resurrection. The dead, according to the Scriptures, are to rise
   together, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting
   contempt. When Christ comes, all who are in their graves shall come
   forth, some to the resurrection of life, and others to the resurrection
   of damnation. When in 1 Thessalonians iv. 16, it is said, "The dead in
   Christ shall rise first," it does not mean that there are to be two
   resurrections, one of those who are in Christ, and the other of those
   who are not in Him. The Apostle is speaking of a different subject. He
   comforts the Thessalonians with the assurance, that their friends who
   sleep in Jesus shall not miss their part in the glories of the second
   advent. Those then alive should not prevent, i.e., precede, those who
   were asleep; but, the dead in Christ should rise before those then
   living should be changed; and then both should be caught up to meet the
   Lord in the air. The parallel passage is in 1 Corinthians xv. 51, 52,
   "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in
   the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall
   sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
   changed."

   In 1 Corinthians xv. 23, 24, the Apostle, when speaking of the
   resurrection, says: "Every man in his own order: Christ the first
   fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then cometh the
   end." This passage is often understood to teach that the resurrection
   takes place in the following order: (1.) That of Christ. (2.) That of
   his people. (3.) Then that of the rest of mankind. And as the
   resurrection of Christ and that of his people are separated by a long
   interval; so the resurrection of the people of God and the general
   resurrection may also be separated by an interval of greater or less
   duration. This interpretation supposes that the word "end," as here
   used, means the end of the resurrection. To this, however, it maybe
   objected, (1.) That it is opposed to the constant "usus loquendi" of
   the New Testament. The "end," when thus used, always elsewhere means
   the end of the world. In 1 Peter iv. 7, it is said: "The end of all
   things is at hand." Matthew xxiv. 6, "The end is not yet;" verse 14,
   "Then shall the end come." So in Mark xiii. 7, Luke xxi. 9. In all
   these passages the "end" means the end of the world. (2.) The
   equivalent expressions serve to explain the meaning of the term. The
   disciples asked our Lord, "What shall be the sign of Thy coming and of
   the end of the world?" In answer to that question Christ said that
   certain things were to happen, but, "the end is not yet;" and
   afterwards, "then cometh the end." (Matt. xxiv. 3, 6, 14.) The same
   expression occurs in the same sense, Matthew xiii. 39, xxviii. 20, and
   elsewhere. (3.) What immediately follows in verse 24, seems decisive in
   favour of this interpretation. The end spoken of is when Christ shall
   have delivered up his kingdom; that is, when the whole work of
   redemption shall have been consummated. (4.) It is further to be
   remarked that in 1 Corinthians xv. Paul does not make the slightest
   reference to the resurrection of the wicked, from the beginning to the
   end of the chapter. The whole concerns the resurrection of believers.
   That was what the errorists in Corinth denied; and that was what the
   Apostle undertook to prove to be certain and desirable. Christ
   certainly rose from the dead; so all his people shall rise; but each in
   his order; first, Christ, then they who are Christ's; then comes the
   end; the end of all things. To make this refer to another and general
   resurrection, would be to introduce a subject entirely foreign to the
   matter in hand.

   Meyer, although he makes telos in the 24th verse refer to the
   resurrection, nevertheless says [860] "That it is the constant doctrine
   of the New Testament (leaving the Apocalypse out of view), that with
   the coming of Christ the finis hujus sæculi' is connected, so that the
   Second Advent is the termination of the ante-messianic, and the
   commencement of the future world-period."

   Luthardt says, [861] "Then, not before the resurrection, . . . comes
   the end; the end, not of the resurrection, that is the resurrection of
   others than believers, but the absolute end; the end of history."
   Whether the end of all things is to follow the resurrection of
   believers immediately, or long afterwards, is, in his view, a different
   question. He admits that the common view is that the coming of Christ,
   the general resurrection of the dead, the general judgment, the end of
   the world, and the new heavens and new earth, are to occur
   contemporaneously. His own view is different.

   That the New Testament does teach that the general resurrection is to
   occur at the time of the Second Advent appears: --

   1. From such passages as the following; In the passage in Daniel,
   quoted above, it is said, that the righteous and the wicked are to rise
   together; the one to life, the other to shame and everlasting contempt.
   This passage our Lord reiterates, saying that "the hour is coming, in
   the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall
   come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life;
   and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation."
   (John v. 28, 29.) In Matthew xxv. 31, 32, it is said, that when the Son
   of Man shall appear in his glory all nations shall stand before him.
   The same is said in Revelation xx. 12, 13. In 2 Thessalonians i. 7-10,
   it is taught that when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, it
   will be to take vengeance on those who obey not the Gospel, and to be
   glorified in all them that believe. In all these passages the
   resurrection of the righteous is declared to be contemporaneous with
   that of the wicked.

   2. There is another class of passages which teach that the resurrection
   of the righteous is to take place at "the last day," and, therefore,
   not a thousand years before that event. Thus Martha, speaking of her
   brother Lazarus, said, "I know that he shall rise again in the
   resurrection at the last day." (John xi. 24.) Our Lord, in John vi. 39,
   says that it is the Father's will "that of all which He hath given me,
   I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day."
   This declaration is repeated in verses 40, 44, 54, comp. xii. 48: "The
   word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day." It
   is true that the expressions "the last time," "the last day," "the end
   of days," "the end of the world," are often used very indefinitely in
   Scripture. They often mean nothing more than "hereafter." But this is
   not true with the phrase en te eschate hemera as used in these
   passages. "In the last day," is a known and definite period. It is to
   be remembered also that what is predicted to happen on "the last day,"
   is elsewhere said to take place when Christ shall appear in his glory.

   3. A third class of passages teach that the resurrection of the saints
   is to take place at the day of judgment and in connection with that
   event. According to the common representations of Scripture, when
   Christ shall come the second time, the dead are to rise, all nations
   are to be judged, and the present order of things is to cease. The
   heavens are to retain Christ, "until the time of restitution of all
   things." (Acts iii. 21.) This apokatastasis "die Wiederherstellung
   aller Dinge in ihren frühern vollkommnern Zustand," [862] the
   restoration of all things to their original perfect condition. "This
   consummation may be called a restitution,' in allusion to a circle
   which returns into itself, or more probably because it really involves
   the healing of all curable disorder and the restoration to communion
   with the Deity of all that He has chosen to be so restored. Till this
   great cycle has achieved its revolution, and this great remedial
   process has accomplished its design, the glorified body of the risen
   and ascended Christ not only may, but must, as an appointed means of
   that accomplishment, be resident in heaven, and not on earth." [863]

   The general resurrection is represented as connected with the final
   judgment, in Matthew xxiv. 30, 31, and xxv. 31-46, 2 Thessalonians i.
   7-10, and elsewhere. On this point Dr. Julius Müller says: "It is the
   plain doctrine of Scripture that the general resurrection of the dead
   contemporaneous with the transfiguration of believers then living on
   earth is to occur at the end of the world (or of history), at the
   reappearance of Christ for judgment and for the glorification of his
   kingdom. . . . . With this consummation of Christ's kingdom, and the
   therewith connected apolutrosis tou somatos hemon apo tes douleias tes
   phthoras, the Apostle, in the profound passage, Romans viii. 19-23,
   sets forth, as also connected with these events, the renovation of the
   nature of the earth and its exaltation to a participation in the glory
   of the children of God. As the body of man stands in intimate relation
   with nature, . . . . it is scarcely possible to form any idea of the
   resurrection of the body . . . . without assuming a corresponding
   exaltation of the external world as the theatre of his new life. This
   renovation of nature, the new heavens and the new earth, takes for
   granted, according to the Apostle, the destruction of the world as it
   now is." [864] With these views, which accord with the common doctrine
   of the Church, Lange avows his entire agreement. [865]

   The only passage which seems to teach that there is to be a first and
   second resurrection of the body, the former being confined to martyrs
   and more or fewer of the saints, and the latter including "the rest of
   the dead," is Revelation xx. 4-6. It must be admitted that that
   passage, taken by itself, does seem to teach the doctrine founded upon
   it. But --

   1. it is a sound rule in the interpretation of Scripture that obscure
   passages should be so explained as to make them agree with those that
   are plain. It is unreasonable to make the symbolic and figurative
   language of prophecy and poetry the rule by which to explain the simple
   didactic prose language of the Bible. It is no less unreasonable that a
   multitude of passages should be taken out of their natural sense to
   make them accord with a single passage of doubtful import.

   2. It is conceded that the Apocalypse is an obscure book. This almost
   every reader knows from his own experience; and it is proved to be
   true, the few who imagine it to be plain to the contrary
   notwithstanding, by the endless diversity of interpretations to which
   it has been subjected. This diversity exists not only between
   commentators of different classes, as rationalistic and orthodox, but
   between those of the same class, and even of the same school. This
   remark, which applies to the whole book, applies with special force to
   the passage under consideration.

   3. The Bible speaks of a spiritual, or figurative, as well as of a
   literal resurrection. This figure is used both in reference to
   individuals and in reference to communities. The sinner, dead in
   trespasses and sins, is said to be quickened and raised again in Christ
   Jesus. (Rom. vi. and Eph. ii.) Whole communities when elevated from a
   state of depression and misery, are in prophetic language said to be
   raised from the dead. (Rom. xi. 15; Is. xxvi. 19.) "Thy dead men shall
   live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye
   that dwell in dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth
   shall cast out the dead." (Ez. xxxvii. 12.) "I will open your graves,
   and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the
   land of Israel." More than this, Elias is said to have lived again in
   John the Baptist; and, according to a common interpretation, the two
   witnesses spoken of in the Apocalypse are Moses and Elias, who are to
   rise not in person, but as represented by men filled with the same
   spirit, endued with similar gifts, and called to exercise the same
   offices. It would, therefore, not be inconsistent with the analogy of
   prophecy if we should understand the Apostle as here predicting that a
   new race of men were to arise filled with the spirit of the martyrs,
   and were to live and reign with Christ a thousand years. According to
   Hengstenberg, the Apostle saw the souls of the martyrs in heaven. There
   they were enthroned. This was their first resurrection. "There can be
   no doubt," he says, "that by the first resurrection we are here
   primarily to understand that first stage of blessedness." [866]

   4. John does not say that the bodies of the martyrs are to be raised
   from the dead. He says: "I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for
   the witness of Jesus." The resurrection of the dead is never thus
   spoken of in Scripture. There is a sense in which the martyrs are said
   to live again, but nothing is said of their rising again from their
   graves. The first resurrection may be spiritual, and the second
   literal. There may be a time of great prosperity in the Church, in
   which it will be a great blessing to participate. It is said that there
   is no force in this argument, as the Apostle does not speak of a
   resurrection of souls. He simply says he saw the souls of the martyrs;
   as in chapter vi. 9, it is said: "I saw under the altar the souls of
   them that were slain for the word of God." The prophet, according to
   xx. 4, first saw the martyrs in the state of the dead, and then he saw
   them alive. The argument, however, is not founded merely on the use of
   the word "souls," but on the fact that the resurrection of the dead is
   never spoken of in the Scriptures in the way in which the living again
   of the martyrs is here described.

   5. The common millenarian doctrine is, that there is to be a literal
   resurrection when Christ shall come to reign in person upon the earth,
   a thousand years before the end of the world, and that the risen saints
   are to dwell here and share with Christ in the glories of his reign.
   But this seems to be inconsistent with what is taught in 1 Corinthians
   xv. 50. Paul there says: "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and
   blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption
   inherit incorruption." It is here expressly asserted that our bodies as
   now constituted are not adapted to the state of things which shall
   exist when the kingdom of God is inaugurated. We must all be changed.
   From this it follows that the spiritual body is not adapted to our
   present mode of existence; that is, it is not suited or designed for an
   earthly kingdom. Luthardt admits this. He admits that the renovated, or
   transfigured, body of necessity supposes a renovated earth. He admits
   also that when the bodies of believers are thus changed they are to be
   caught up from the earth, and are to dwell with Christ in heaven. When
   Christ appears, his people are to appear with Him in glory. Bengel, and
   after him others, endeavour to reconcile these admissions with the
   theory of an earthly kingdom of glory, by assuming that risen saints
   are, to rule this kingdom, not from the literal Jerusalem, but from
   heaven. This, however, is to introduce an extra-scriptural and
   conjectural idea.

   6. It has already been said, when speaking of the restoration of the
   Jews to their own land, that this whole theory of a splendid earthly
   kingdom is a relic of Judaism, and out of keeping with the spirituality
   of the Gospel. [867]

   All this is said with diffidence and submission. The interpretation of
   unfulfilled prophecy experience teaches is exceedingly precarious.
   There is every reason to believe that the predictions concerning the
   second advent of Christ, and the events which are to attend and follow
   it, will disappoint the expectations of commentators, as the
   expectations of the Jews were disappointed in the manner in which the
   prophecies concerning the first advent were accomplished.

   § 2. The Final Judgment.

   The Scriptures abound in passages which set forth God as the moral
   ruler of men; which declare that He will judge the world in
   righteousness. The Bible represents Him as the judge of nations and of
   individuals; as the avenger of the poor and the persecuted. It abounds
   also in promises and in threatenings, and in illustrations of the
   righteous judgments of God. Nothing, therefore, is plainer than that
   men in this world are subject to the moral government of God. Besides
   this, the Bible also teaches that there is a future state of reward and
   punishment, in which the inequalities and anomalies here permitted
   shall be adjusted. According to some, this is all that the Bible
   teaches on the subject. What is said of the punishment of the wicked
   and of the reward of the righteous is to be understood in this general
   way. This is the doctrine of the common school of Rationalists. [868]
   Bretschneider [869] admits, however, that reason has nothing to object
   to the Church doctrine on this subject properly understood.

   A second view of the last judgment assumes it to be a process now m
   progress. In the Old Testament the Messianic period is spoken of as the
   "last day," "the last time," "the end of days," "the end of the world,"
   and is represented as a time of conflict and of judgment. The Jews
   expected that when the Messiah came, the severest judgments would fall
   upon the heathen, and that the chosen people would be greatly exalted
   and blessed. This was the day of judgment. Those who give substantially
   the same interpretation to the Old Testament prophecies, hold that the
   day of judgment covers the whole period between the first and second
   advents of Christ.

   A third doctrine is that the world in its progress works out all
   possible manifestations of God, so that according to the stereotyped
   dictum of Schelling, Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht; the
   history of the world is the judgment of the world. Premillenarians use
   precisely the same words, although not in the same philosophical sense.
   With them "to judge" is to reign; and when Christ comes to establish
   his personal reign upon earth, the last judgment will begin, and "the
   judgment of God is the administration of the government of God." [870]

   A fourth theory may be mentioned. There are certain immutable laws,
   either independent, as some say, of the will of God, or dependent on
   his voluntary constitution, which secure that the righteous shall be
   happy and the wicked miserable; and this is all that either reason or
   Scripture, properly understood, teaches of rewards and punishment.

   A fifth doctrine is that the day of judgment is a protracted future
   dispensation, as just mentioned, to commence with the second advent of
   Christ, and to continue during the thousand years of his personal reign
   upon the earth. This theory is connected with the doctrine of the
   pre-millenial advent of Christ.

   The Church Doctrine.

   By the Church doctrine is meant that doctrine which is held by the
   Church universal; by Romanists and Protestants in the West, and by the
   Greeks in the East. That doctrine includes the following points: --

   1. The final judgment is a definite future event (not a protracted
   process), when the eternal destiny of men and of angels shall be
   finally determined and publicly manifested. That this is the doctrine
   of the Bible, is proved by such passages as the following: Matthew xi.
   24, "It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of
   judgment, than for thee;" Matthew xiii. 30, "Let both grow together
   until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the
   reapers, Gather ye together first the taxes, and bind them in bundles
   to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn;" verse 39, "The
   harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are the angels;" verse
   49, "So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
   forth, and sever the wicked from among the just;" John xii. 48, "The
   word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day;"
   Acts xviii. 31, God "hath appointed a day in the which He will judge
   the world in righteousness;" Romans ii. 5, "The day of wrath and
   revelation of the righteous judgment of God;" and 1 Corinthians iv. 5,
   "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come." It is true that
   the word "day" in Scripture is often used for an indefinite period; as
   "the day of the Lord," is the time of the Lord. And, therefore, it does
   not follow from the use of this word, that the judgment is to be
   commenced and ended in the apace of twenty-four hours. Nevertheless,
   the way in which the word is used in this connection, and the
   circumstances with which the judgment is connected, show that a
   definite and limited period, and not a protracted dispensation, is
   intended by the term. The appearance of Christ, the resurrection of the
   dead, and the gathering of the nations, are not events which are to be
   protracted through years or centuries.

   2. Christ is to be the judge. John v. 22, 23, "The Father judgeth no
   man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son; that all men should
   honour the Son, even as they honour the Father;" verse 27, "And hath
   given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of
   Man." Peter, in Acts x. 34-43, says that God "anointed Jesus of
   Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power;" had "raised" Him from the
   dead "and shewed him openly," and "commanded us to preach unto the
   people, and to testify that it is He which was ordained of God to be
   the Judge of quick and dead." Paul, in his speech on Mars Hill, tells
   the Athenians that God "hath appointed a day, in the which He will
   judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom He hath ordained;
   whereof He hath given assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised
   Him from the dead." (Acts xvii. 31.) And in 2 Corinthians v. 10, he
   says, "We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ." Our Lord
   says that He will say to the wicked, "Depart from me, ye that work
   iniquity." (Matt. v. 28; Luke xiii. 27.) In all the graphic
   descriptions gives in the New Testament of the process of the final
   judgment, Christ is represented as acting as the judge. On this point
   it is to be observed: (1.) That He is set forth as acting on his own
   authority; and not merely as the "Bevollmächter," or plenipotentiary of
   God. Everywhere in the New Testament, our responsibility is said to be
   to Him. We are to stand before his judgment-seat. He will say, "Depart
   from me, ye cursed." It is He, who is to bring every secret thing into
   judgment. (2.) He is qualified thus to sit in judgment on men and
   angels; because He is omniscient, and infinite in justice and mercy.
   (3.) It is especially appropriate that the man Christ Jesus, God
   manifest in the flesh, should be the judge of all men. He has this
   authority committed to Him because He is the Son of man; because,
   although in the form of God, and thinking it no robbery to be equal
   with God, He humbled Himself to be found in fashion as a man. This is
   part of his exaltation, due to Him because He consented to become
   obedient unto death. It is meet that He who stood condemned at the bar
   of Pilate, should sit enthroned on the seat of universal judgment. It
   is a joy and ground of special confidence to all believers, that He who
   loved them and gave Himself for them, shall be their judge on the last
   day.

   3. This judgment is to take place at the second coming of Christ and at
   the general resurrection. Therefore it is not a process now in
   progress; it does not take place at death; it is not a protracted
   period prior to the general resurrection. A few of the passages bearing
   on this point are the following: In the parable of the wheat and the
   tares (Matt. xiii. 37-43), already referred to, we are taught that the
   final separation between the righteous and the wicked is to take place
   at the end of the world, when the Son of Man shall send forth his
   angels to gather out of his kingdom all things that offend. This
   implies that the general resurrection, the second advent, and the last
   judgment, are contemporaneous events. The Bible knows nothing of three
   personal advents of Christ: one at the time of the incarnation; a
   second before the millennium; and a third to judge the world. He who
   came in the flesh, is to come a second time without sin unto salvation.
   Matthew xvi. 27, "The Son of Man shall come in the glory of his Father,
   with his angels; and then He shall reward every man according to his
   works." Matthew xxiv. 29-35, teaches that when the sign of the Son of
   Man appears in the heavens, all the tribes of the earth shall mourn,
   and the elect shall be gathered in Matthew xxv. 31-46 sets forth the
   whole process of the judgment. When the Son of Man shall come in his
   glory, all nations shall be gathered before Him, and He shall separate
   them as a shepherd divideth the sheep from the goats; and then shall He
   say to those on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father; and to
   those on the left, Depart from me, ye cursed. 1 Corinthians iv. 5,
   "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will
   bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest
   the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of
   God." When Christ comes, the general judgment is to occur. In 2
   Thessalonians i. 7-10, it is taught that when the Lord Jesus Christ
   shall be revealed from heaven, it will be for the double purpose of
   taking vengeance on them that know not God, and of being glorified in
   all them that believe. In 2 Timothy iv. 1, it is said: The Lord Jesus
   Christ "shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his
   kingdom." In the fifteenth chapter of First Corinthians, the Apostle
   expressly teaches that corruption cannot inherit incorruption, that our
   present vile bodies must be changed before they can enter the kingdom
   of God; and this change from the natural to the spiritual, from mortal
   to immortal, is to take place at the last trump; and in Philippians
   iii. 20, 21, he says it is to occur when Christ comes from heaven, who
   shall fashion our bodies like unto his own glorious body. In all these
   different ways it is taught that the general judgment is to take place
   at the second coming of Christ.

   4. The persons to be judged are men and angels. In several passages
   already quoted it is said that Christ is to come to judge "the quick
   and the dead;" in others it is said, "all nations are to stand before
   Him;" in others, that "we must all appear before the judgment-seat of
   Christ ;" in others again it is said that "He will render to every man
   according to his works." This judgment, therefore, is absolutely
   universal; it includes both small and great; and all the generations of
   men. With regard to the evil angels, it is said that God "delivered
   them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment." (2 Pet.
   ii. 4.) Satan is said to be the God of this world. The conflict in
   which believers are engaged in this life, is with principalities and
   powers and spiritual wickedness in heaven, en tois epouraniois. This
   conflict is to continue until the Second Advent, when Satan and his
   angels are to be cast into the pit.

   The older theologians speculated on the manner in which the judgment is
   to be arranged, so as to admit of the countless millions of human
   beings who shall have lived from the beginning of the world to the
   final consummation being so congregated as to be all gathered before
   the throne of the Son of Man. The common answer to that difficulty was
   that the throne is to be so exalted and so glorious as to be visible,
   as are the sun and moons from a large part of the earth's surface at
   the same time. These, however, are questions about which we need give
   ourselves no concern; these descriptions of the judgment are designed
   to teach us moral truths, and not the physical phenomena by which the
   solemn adjudication on the destiny of men is to be attended.

   5. The ground or matter of judgment is said to be the "deeds done in
   the body," men are to be judged "according to their works;" "the
   secrets of the heart" are to be brought to light. God's judgment will
   not be founded on the professions, or the relations of men, or on the
   appearance or reputation which they sustain among their fellows, but on
   their real character and on their acts, however secret and covered from
   the sight of men those acts may have been. God will not be mocked and
   cannot be deceived; the character of every man will be clearly
   revealed. (1.) In the sight of God. (2.) In the sight of the man
   himself. All self deception will be banished. Every man will see
   himself as he appears in the sight of God. His memory will probably
   prove an indelible register of all his sinful acts and thoughts and
   feelings. His conscience will be so enlightened as to recognize the
   justice of the sentence which the righteous judge shall pronounce upon
   him. All whom Christ condemns will be self-condemned. (3.) There will
   be such a revelation of the character of every man to all around him,
   or to all who know him, as shall render the justice of the sentence of
   condemnation or acquittal apparent. Beyond this the representations of
   Scripture do not require us to go.

   Besides these general representations of Scripture that the character
   and conduct of men is the ground on which the final sentence is to be
   pronounced, there is clear intimation in the Word of God, that, so far
   as those who hear the Gospel are concerned, their future destiny
   depends on the attitude which they assume to Christ. He came to his
   own, and his own received Him not; but to as many as received Him, to
   them gave He power to become the sons of God. He is God manifest in the
   flesh; He came into the world to save sinners; all who receive Him as
   their God and Saviour, are saved; all who refuse to recognize and trust
   Him, perish. They are condemned already, because they have not believed
   in the name of the only begotten Son of God. He that believeth on the
   Son hath everlasting life; he that believeth not the Son shall not see
   life; but the wrath of God abideth on him. Whosoever shall confess me
   before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
   But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my
   Father which is in heaven. When the Jews asked our Lord, What shall we
   do that we might work the works of God? his answer was, "This is the
   work of God, that ye believe on him whom He hath sent." In the solemn
   account given of the last judgment in Matthew xxv. 31-46, the inquest
   concerns the conduct of men towards Christ. And the Apostle says, If
   any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be Anathema Maranatha.
   The special ground of condemnation, therefore, under the Gospel is
   unbelief; the refusal to receive Christ in the character in which He is
   presented for our acceptance.

   6. Men are to be judged according to the light which they have
   severally enjoyed. The servant that knew his Lord's will, and did it
   not, shall be beaten with many stripes; but he that knew it not, shall
   be beaten with few stripes. "For unto whomsoever much is given, of him
   shall be much required." Our Lord says that it shall be more tolerable,
   in the day of judgment, for Tyre and Sidon, than for the men of his
   generation. Paul says that the heathen are inexcusable, because that
   when they knew God, they glorified him not as God; and he lays down the
   principle that they who sin without law, shall be judged without law;
   and that they who have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law.

   7. At the judgment of the last day the destiny of the righteous and of
   the wicked shall be unalterably determined. Each class shall be
   assigned to its final abode. This is taught in the solemn words: "These
   shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life
   eternal."

   How far the descriptions of the process of the last judgment, given in
   the Bible, are to be understood literally, it is useless to inquire.
   Two things are remarkable about the prophecies of Scripture, which have
   already been accomplished. The one is that the fulfilment has, in many
   cases, been very different from that which a literal interpretation led
   men to anticipate. The other is, that in some cases they have been
   fulfilled even to the most minute details. These facts should render us
   modest in our interpretation of those predictions which remain to be
   accomplished; satisfied that what we know not now we shall know
   hereafter.

   § 3. The End of the World.

   The principal passages of Scriptures relating to the final consummation
   or the end of the world, are the following: Psalm iii. 25, 26, "Of old
   hast thou laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the
   work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all
   of them shall wax old as a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
   them, and they shall be changed." Isaiah li. 6, "Lift up your eyes to
   the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall
   vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment."
   Isaiah lxv. 17, "Behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth: and the
   former shall not be remembered nor come into mind." Luke xxi. 33,
   "Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away."
   Romans viii. 19-21, "The earnest expectation of the creature (ktisis,
   creation) waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the
   creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of
   him who hath subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself
   also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the
   glorious liberty of the children of God." 2 Peter iii. 6-13, "The world
   that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: but the heavens
   and earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved
   unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly
   men. . . . . The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in
   the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the
   elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the works
   that are therein shall be burned up. . . . . Nevertheless we, according
   to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
   righteousness." Revelation xx. 11, "I saw a great white throne, and Him
   that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and
   there was found no place for them." Revelation xxi. 1, "I saw a new
   heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were
   passed away; and there was no more sea."

   Remarks.

   1. These passages are not to be understood as predicting great
   political and moral revolutions. It is possible that some of them might
   bear that interpretation; but others are evidently intended to be
   understood in a more literal sense. This is especially the case with 2
   Peter iii. 6-13, in which the Apostle contrasts the destruction of the
   world by the waters of the deluge with the destruction by fire which is
   still future. If the fact be established that the Scriptures anywhere
   clearly predict the destruction of the world at the last day, that fact
   becomes a rule for the interpretation of the more doubtful passages.
   There is nothing in this predicted destruction of our earth out of
   analogy with the course of nature. Stars once clearly visible in the
   firmament, after a brief period of unusual splendour, have disappeared;
   to all appearance they have been burnt up. Scientific men tell us that
   there is abundant evidence that the earth was once in a state of
   fusion; and there are causes in operation which are adequate to reduce
   it to that state again, whenever God sees fit to put them unto
   operation.

   2. The destruction here foretold is not annihilation. (a.) The world is
   to be burnt up; but combustion is not a destruction of substance. It is
   merely a change of state or condition. (b.) The destruction of the
   world by water and its destruction by fire are analogous events; the
   former was not annihilation, therefore the second is not. (c.) The
   destruction spoken of is elsewhere called a palingenesia, regeneration
   (Matt. xix. 28); an apoka tastasis, a restoration (Acts iii. 21); a
   deliverance from the bondage of corruption (Rom. viii. 21). The Apostle
   teaches that our vile bodies are to be fashioned like unto the glorious
   body of Christ, and that a similar change is to take place in the world
   we inhabit. There are to be new heavens and a new earth, just as we are
   to have new bodies. Our bodies are not to be annihilated, but changed.
   (d.) There is no evidence, either from Scripture or experience, that
   any substance has ever been annihilated. If force be motion, it may
   cease; but cessation of motion is not annihilation, and the common idea
   in out day, among men of science, is that no force is ever lost; it is,
   as they say, only transformed. However this may be, it is a purely
   gratuitous assumption that any substance has ever passed out of
   existence. In all the endless and complicated changes which have been
   going on, from the beginning, in our earth and throughout the universe,
   nothing, so far as known, has ever ceased to be. Of course He who
   creates can destroy; the question, however, concerns the purpose, and
   not the power of God; and He has never, either in his word or in his
   works, revealed his purpose to destroy anything He has once created.

   Many of the old theologians, especially among the Lutherans, understood
   the Bible to teach the absolute annihilation of our world. Schmid [871]
   states as the Lutheran doctrine that the world is to be reduced to
   nothing (in Nichts sich auflösen). He quotes Baier, Hollaz, and
   Quenstedt in support of this view. Quenstedt [872] says: "Forma
   consummationis hujus non in nuda qualitatum immutatione, alteratione
   seu innovatione, sed in ipsius substantiæ mundi totali abolitione et in
   nihilum reductione consistit." Gerhard [873] takes the same view:
   "Formam consummationis dicimus fore non nudam qualitatum alterationem,
   sed ipsius substantiæ abolitionem, adeoque totalem annihilationem, ut
   sic terminus a quo consummationis sive destructionis sit esse,'
   terminus vero ad quem non esse' sive nihil." He admits, however, that
   many of the fathers and Luther himself were on the other side. He
   quotes Irenæus, Cyril of Jerusalem, Jerome, Augustine, and Chrysostom,
   as in favour of mutation and against annihilation. Luther was wont to
   say: "The heavens have their work-day clothes on; hereafter they will
   have on their Sunday garments." Most of the Reformed theologians
   generally oppose the idea of annihilation. Turrettin certainly does.
   [874] One of his questions is: "Qualis futuris sit mundi interitus? An
   per ultimam conflagrationem sit annihilandus, an instaurandus et
   renovandus?" He argues throughout in favour of the latter.

   3. The subject of the change which is to take place at the last day is
   not the whole material universe, but our earth and what pertains to it.
   (a.) It is true the Bible says: "Heaven and earth are to pass away,"
   and by heaven and earth the Scriptures often mean the universe; and it
   would therefore be consistent with the language of Scripture to hold
   that the whole universe is to be changed at the last day. It was
   natural that this interpretation should be put upon the language of the
   Bible so long as our earth was regarded as the central body of the
   universe and sun, moon, and stars as subordinate luminaries, intended
   simply for the benefit of the inhabitants of our world. "Wenn der
   Tanz," says Strauss, [875] "zu Ende ist, bläst der Wirth die Lichter
   aus." The case however assumes a different aspect when we know that our
   earth and even our solar system is a mere speck in the immensity of
   God's works. It is one of the unmistakable evidences of the divine
   origin of the Scriptures, that they are written on such a high level
   that all the mutations of human science take place beneath them without
   ever coming into collision with their teachings. They could be read by
   those who believed that the sun moves round the earth, without their
   convictions being shocked by their statements; and they can be read by
   us who know that the earth moves round the sun, with the same
   satisfaction and confidence. Whether the heaven and earth which are to
   pass away are the whole material universe, or only our earth and its
   atmospheric heavens, the language of the Scripture leaves undecided.
   Either view is perfectly consistent with the meaning of the words
   employed. The choice between the two views is to be determined by other
   considerations. (b.) The à priori probability is overwhelming in favour
   of the more limited interpretation. Anything so stupendous as the
   passing away of the whole universe as the last act of the drama of
   human history would be altogether out of keeping. (c.) The Bible
   concerns man. The earth was cursed for his transgression. That curse is
   to be removed when man s redemption is completed. The ktisis that was
   made subject to vanity for man's sin, is our earth; and our earth is
   the ktisis which is to be delivered from the bondage of corruption. The
   change to be effected is in the dwelling-place of man. (d.) According
   to the Apostle Peter, it is the world which once was destroyed by
   water, that is to be consumed by fire. But although the predictions of
   Scripture concern only our earth, it does not follow that the material
   universe is to last forever. As it is not from eternity, it probably
   will not last forever. It may be only one of the grand exhibitions of
   the wonderful working of God in the field of infinite space, and in the
   course of unending ages.

   4. The result of this change is said to be the introduction of a new
   heavens and a new earth. This is set forth not only in the use of these
   terms, but in calling the predicted change "a regeneration," "a
   restoration," a deliverance from the bondage of corruption and an
   introduction into the glorious liberty of the Son of God. This earth,
   according to the common opinion, that is, this renovated earth, is to
   be the final seat of Christ's kingdom. This is the new heavens; this is
   the New Jerusalem, the Mount Zion in which are to be gathered the
   general assembly and church of the first-born, which are written in
   heaven; the spirits of just men made perfect; this is the heavenly
   Jerusalem; the city of the living God; the kingdom prepared for his
   people before the foundation of the world.

   5. It is of course, in itself, no matter of interest what portion of
   space these new heavens and new earth are to occupy, or of what
   materials they are to be formed. As the resurrection bodies of
   believers are to be human bodies they must have a local habitation,
   although it be one not made with hands eternal in the heavens. All we
   know about it is that it will be glorious, and adapted to the spiritual
   bodies which those in Christ are to receive when He comes the second
   time unto salvation.

   § 4. The Kingdom of Heaven.

   In the account given of the final judgment in Matthew xxv. 31-46, we
   are told that the King shall "say to those on his right hand, Come, ye
   blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom we prepared for you from the
   foundation of the world."

   1. In the Old Testament it was predicted that God would set up a
   kingdom, which was to be universal and everlasting.

   2. Of this kingdom the Messiah was to be the head. He is everywhere in
   the Old Testament set forth as a king. (See Gen. xlix. 10; Num. xxiv.
   17; 2 Sam. vii. 16; Is. ix. 6, 7; xi.; lii.; liii.; Mich. iv.; and
   Psalms ii.; xlv.; lxxii.; and cx.)

   3. It is called, for obvious reasons, in the Scriptures, indifferently,
   the kingdom of God, the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of the Son of
   Man (Matt. xiii. 41) and the kingdom of heaven.

   4. It is described in the prophets in the most glowing terms, in
   figures borrowed partly from the paradisiacal state of men, and partly
   from the state of the theocracy during the reign of Solomon.

   5. This kingdom belongs to Christ, not as the Logos, but as the Son of
   Man, the Theanthropos; God manifest in the flesh.

   6. Its twofold foundation, as presented in the Bible, is the possession
   on the part of Christ of all divine attributes, and his work of
   redemption. (Heb. i. 3; Phil. ii. 6-11.) It is because He being equal
   with God, "humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the
   death of the cross," that "God also hath highly exalted Him, and given
   Him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every
   knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things
   under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
   is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." All power in heaven and earth
   has been given into his hands; and all things, ta panta, the universe,
   put under his feet. Even the angels are his ministering spirits, sent
   by Him to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation.

   7. This messianic or mediatorial kingdom of Christ, being thus
   comprehensive, is presented in different aspects in the Word of God.
   Viewed as extending over all creatures, it is a kingdom of power,
   which, according to 1 Corinthians xv. 24, He shall deliver up to God
   even the Father, when his mediatorial work is accomplished. Viewed in
   relation to his own people on earth it is the kingdom of grace. They
   all recognize Him as their absolute proprietor and sovereign. They all
   confide in his protection, and devote themselves to his service. He
   rules in them and reigns over them, and subdues all their and his
   enemies. Viewed in relation to the whole body of the redeemed, when the
   work of redemption is consummated, it is the kingdom of glory, the
   kingdom of heaven, in the highest sense of the words. In this view his
   kingdom is everlasting. His headship over his people is to continue
   forever, and his dominion over those whom He has purchased with his
   blood shall never end.

   8. As this kingdom is thus manifold, so also it is, in some of its
   aspects, progressive. It is represented in Scripture as passing through
   different stages. In prophecy it is spoken of as a stone cut out
   without hands, which became a great mountain and filled the whole
   earth. In Daniel vii. 14, it is said of the Messiah that to Him "there
   was given dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations,
   and languages, should serve Him." So, too, in Psalm ii. 8, it is
   written of Him, "Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for the
   inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession;
   in Psalm lxxii. 11, "All nations shall serve Him;" verse 17, "All
   nations shall call Him blessed;" in Psalm lxxxvi. 9, "All nations whom
   thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall
   glorify thy name;" in Isaiah xlix. 6, "I will also give thee for a
   light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of
   the earth;" in Habakkuk ii. 14, "The earth shall be filled with the
   knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea;" and
   in Malachi i. 11, "From the rising of the sun even unto the going down
   of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles." The Scriptures
   abound with passages of similar import. It is not only asserted that
   the kingdom of Christ is to attain this universal extension by slow
   degrees, but its gradual progress is illustrated in various ways. Our
   Lord compares his kingdom to a grain of mustard-seed, which is indeed
   the least of all seeds, but when it is grown it is the greatest among
   herbs; and to heaven which a woman took, and hid in three measures of
   meal, till the whole was leavened.

   9. Although God has always had a kingdom upon earth, yet the kingdom of
   which the prophets speak began in its messianic form when the Son of
   God came in the flesh. John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, came
   preaching that the kingdom of God was at hand. Our Lord Himself, it is
   said, went from village to village, preaching the kingdom of God. (Luke
   iv. 43; viii. 1.) When asked by Pilate whether He was a king, he
   "answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and
   for this cause came I into the world." (John xviii. 37). The Apostles
   wherever they went "testified the kingdom of God." (Acts xxviii. 23.)
   Their business was to call upon men to receive the Lord Jesus as the
   Christ, the anointed and predicted Messiah or king of his people, and
   to worship, love, trust and obey Him as such. They were, therefore,
   accused of acting contrary to "the decrees of Cæsar, saying that there
   is another king, one Jesus." (Acts xvii. 7.) Men are exhorted to seek
   first the kingdom of God, as a present good. It is compared to a pearl
   or treasure, for which it were wise for a man to sacrifice everything.
   Every believer receives Christ as his king. Those who receive Him in
   sincerity constitute his kingdom, in the sense in which the loyal
   subjects of an earthly sovereign constitute his kingdom. Those who
   profess allegiance to Christ as king constitute his visible kingdom
   upon earth. Nothing, therefore, can be more opposed to the plain
   teaching of the New Testament, than that the kingdom of Christ is yet
   future and is not to be inaugurated until his second coming. This is to
   confound its consummation with its commencement.

   10. As to the nature of this kingdom, our Lord Himself teaches us that
   it is not of this world. It is not analogous to the kingdoms which
   exist among men. It is not a kingdom of earthly splendour, wealth, or
   power. It does not concern the civil or political affairs of men,
   except in their moral relations. Its rewards and enjoyments are not the
   good things of this world. It is said to consist in "righteousness, and
   peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost." (Rom. xiv. 17.) Christ told his
   hearers, "The kingdom of God is within you." The condition of admission
   into that kingdom is regeneration (John iii. 5), conversion (Matt.
   xviii. 3), holiness of heart and life, for the unrighteous shall not
   inherit the kingdom of God; nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
   nor extortioners (1 Cor. vi. 9, 10; Gal. v. 21; Eph v. 5).

   11. This kingdom, in the interval between the first and second advents
   of Christ, is said to be like a field in which the wheat and tares are
   to grow together until the harvest, which is the end of the world. Then
   "the Son of Man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out
   of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and
   shall east them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and
   gnashing of teeth. Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in
   the kingdom of their Father." (Matt. xiii. 41-43.) Experience concurs
   with Scripture in teaching that the kingdom of Christ passes through
   many vicissitudes; that it has its times of depression and its seasons
   of exaltation and prosperity. About this in the past, there can be no
   doubt. Prophecy sheds a sufficiently clear light on the future to teach
   us, not only that this alternation is to continue to the end, but, more
   definitely, that before the second coming of Christ there is to be a
   time of great and long continued prosperity, to be followed by a season
   of decay and of suffering, so that when the Son of Man comes he shall
   hardly find faith on the earth. It appears from passages already quoted
   that all nations are to be converted; that the Jews are to be brought
   in and reingrafted into their own olive-tree; and that their
   restoration is to be the occasion and the cause of a change from death
   unto life; that is, analogous to the change of a body mouldering in the
   grave to one instinct with joyous activity and power. Of this period
   the ancient prophets speak in terms adapted to raise the hopes of the
   Church to the highest pitch. It is true it is difficult to separate, in
   their descriptions, what refers to "this latter day of glory" from what
   relates to the kingdom of Christ as consummated in heaven. So also it
   was difficult for the ancient people of God to separate what, in the
   declarations of their prophets, referred to the redemption of the
   people from Babylon from what referred to the greater redemption to be
   effected by the Messiah. In both cases enough is plain to satisfy the
   Church. There was a redemption from Babylon, and there was a redemption
   by Christ; and in like manner, it is hoped, there is to be a period of
   millenial glory on earth, and a still more glorious consummation of the
   Church in heaven. This period is called a millennium because in
   Revelation it is said to last a thousand years, an expression which is
   perhaps generally understood literally. Some however think it means a
   protracted season of indefinite duration, as when it is said that one
   day is with the Lord as a thousand years. Others, assuming that in the
   prophetic language a day stands for a year, assume that the so-called
   millennium is to last three hundred and sixty-five thousand years.
   During this period, be it longer or shorter, the Church is to enjoy a
   season of peace, purity, and blessedness such as it has never yet
   experienced.

   The principal reason for assuming that the prophets predict a glorious
   state of the Church prior to the second advent, is, that they represent
   the Church as being thus prosperous and glorious on earth. But we know
   that when Christ comes again the heavens and earth are to pass away,
   and that no more place will be found for them. The seat of the Church,
   after the second coming, is not to be the earth, but a new heavens and
   a new earth. As therefore the Scriptures teach that the kingdom of
   Christ is to extend over all the earth; that all nations are to serve
   Him; and that all people shall call Him blessed; it is to be inferred
   that these predictions refer to a state of things which is to exist
   before the second coming of Christ. This state is described as one of
   spiritual prosperity; God will pour out his Spirit upon all flesh;
   knowledge shall everywhere abound; wars shall cease to the ends of the
   earth, and there shall be nothing to hurt or destroy in all my holy
   mountain, saith the Lord. This does not imply that there is to be
   neither sin nor sorrow in the world during this long period, or that
   all men are to be true Christians. The tares are to grow together with
   the wheat until the harvest. The means of grace will still be needed;
   conversion and sanctification will be then what they ever have been. It
   is only a higher measure of the good which the Church has experienced
   in the past that we are taught to anticipate in the future. This
   however is not the end. After this and after the great apostasy which
   is to follow, comes the consummation.

   The Consummation.

   12. When Christ comes again it will be to be admired in all them that
   believe. Those who are then alive will be changed, in the twinkling of
   an eye; their corruptible shall put on incorruption, and their mortal
   shall put on immortality. Those who are in the graves shall hear the
   voice of the Son of Man and come forth to the resurrection of life,
   their bodies fashioned like into the glorious body of the Son of God.
   Thus changed, both classes shall be ever with the Lord.

   The place of the final abode of the righteous is sometimes called a
   house; as when the Saviour said: "In my Father's house are many
   mansions" (John xiv. 2); sometimes "a city which hath foundations,
   whose builder and maker is God." (Heb. xi. 10.) Under this figure it is
   called the new or heavenly Jerusalem, so gorgeously described in the
   twenty-first chapter of the Apocalypse. Sometimes it is spoken of as "a
   better country, that is an heavenly" (Heb. xi. 16); a country through
   which flows the river of the water of life, and "on either side of the
   river was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits,
   and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for
   the healing of the nations. And there shall be no more curse: but the
   throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall
   serve Him: and they shall see his face, and his name shall be in their
   foreheads. And there shall be no night there: and they need no candle,
   neither light of the sun, for the Lord God giveth them light: and they
   shall reign for ever and ever." (Rev. xxii. 2-5.) Sometimes the final
   abode of the redeemed is called a "new heavens and a new earth." (2
   Pet. iii. 13.)

   As to the blessedness of this heavenly state we know that it is
   inconceivable: "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered
   into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that
   love Him." (1 Cor. ii. 9.)


   "We know not, O we know not,

   What joys await us there;

   What radiancy of glory,

   What bliss beyond compare."

   We know however: (1.) That this incomprehensible blessedness of heaven
   shall arise from the vision of God. This vision is beatific. It
   beatifies. It transforms the soul into the divine image; transfusing
   into it the divine life, so that it is filled with the fulness of God.
   This vision of God is in the face of Jesus Christ, in whom dwells the
   plenitude of the divine glory bodily. God is seen in fashion as a man;
   and it is this manifestation of God in the person of Christ that is
   inconceivably and intolerably ravishing. Peter, James, and John became
   as dead men when they saw his glory, for a moment, in the holy mount.
   (2.) The blessedness of the redeemed will flow not only from the
   manifestation of the glory, but also of the love of God; of that love,
   mysterious, unchangeable, and infinite, of which the work of redemption
   is the fruit. (3.) Another element of the future happiness of the
   saints is the indefinite enlargement of all their faculties. (4.)
   Another is their entire exemption from all sin and sorrow (5.) Another
   is their intercourse and fellowship with the high intelligences of
   heaven; with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, and all the
   redeemed. (6.) Another is constant increase in knowledge and in the
   useful exercise of all their powers. (7.) Another is the secure and
   everlasting possession of all possible good. And, (8.) Doubtless the
   outward circumstances of their being will be such as to minister to
   their increasing blessedness.

   § 5. The Theory of the Pre-millennial Advent.

   The common doctrine of the Church stated above, is that the conversion
   of the world, the restoration of the Jews, and the destruction of
   Antichrist are to precede the second coming of Christ, which event will
   be attended by the general resurrection of the dead, the final
   judgment, the end of the world, and the consummation of the Church. In
   opposition to this view the doctrine of a pre-millennial advent of
   Christ has been extensively held from the days of the Apostles to the
   present time. [876] According to this view, (1.) The nations are not to
   be converted, nor are the Jews to be restored to their standing in the
   Church, until the second coming of Christ. (2.) His advent is to be
   personal and glorious. (3.) He will establish Himself in Jerusalem as
   the head of a visible, external kingdom. (4.) When He comes, the
   martyrs, as some say, or, as others believe, all who sleep in Jesus,
   shall be raised from the dead and associated with Him in this earthly
   kingdom. (5.) The Jews are to be converted, restored to their own land,
   invested with special honours and prerogatives, and made the
   instruments of the conversion of the world. (6.) This kingdom is to be
   one of great splendour, prosperity, and blessedness, and is to continue
   a thousand years; which, however, as stated above, is understood in
   different senses. (7.) After the expiration of the millennium, the
   general resurrection of the dead, the end of the world, and the final
   consummation of the Church are to occur. Such are the general features
   of the scheme which., with many modifications as to details, is known
   as the pre-millenial advent theory.

   The leading objections to this doctrine have been already presented in
   the discussions of the several topics included under the general head
   of eschatology. They may be summarily stated as follows: --

   1. It is a Jewish doctrine. The principles adopted by its advocates in
   the interpretation of prophecy, are the same as those adopted by the
   Jews at the time of Christ; and they have led substantially to the same
   conclusions. The Jews expected that when the Messiah came He would
   establish a glorious earthly kingdom at Jerusalem; that those who had
   died in the faith should be raised from the dead to share in the
   blessings of the Messiah's reign; that all nations and peoples on the
   face of the whole earth should be subject to them; and that any nation
   that did not serve them should be destroyed. All the riches and honours
   of the world were to be at their disposal. The event disappointed these
   expectations; and the principles of prophetic interpretation on which
   those expectations were founded were proved to be incorrect.

   2. This theory is inconsistent with the Scriptures, inasmuch as it
   teaches that believers only are to rise from the dead when Christ
   comes; whereas the Bible declares that when He appears all who are in
   the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have
   done good unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil
   unto the resurrection of damnation.

   3. The Bible teaches that when Christ comes all nations shall appear at
   his bar for judgment. This theory teaches that the final judgment will
   not occur until after the millennium. It may be said that the judgment
   is to commence at the second advent and continue during the reign of a
   thousand years. But the general judgment cannot occur before the
   general resurrection, and as the general resurrection, according to
   this theory, is not to take place until after the millennium, so
   neither can the general judgment.

   4. The Scriptures teach that when Christ comes the second time without
   sin unto salvation, then the Church shall enter on its everlasting
   state of exaltation and glory. Those in Christ who have departed this
   life shall be raised from the dead and be clothed with their spiritual
   bodies, and those who are alive shall be changed in a moment, and thus
   they shall be ever with the Lord. According to this theory, instead of
   heaven awaiting the risen saints, they are to be introduced into a mere
   worldly kingdom. [877]

   5. It is inconsistent with all the representations given of the glory
   and blessedness of departed saints, to assume that at the resurrection
   they are to be brought down to a lower state of existence, degraded
   from heaven to earth. The millennium may be a great advance on the
   present state of the Church; but, exalt it as you may, it is far below
   heaven. This argument bears, at least, against the patristic doctrine
   of the millennium.

   6. The view presented by pre-millennarians of the kingdom of Christ on
   earth is, in many respects, inconsistent with the Scriptural account of
   its nature. (a.) It is to be a worldly kingdom. (b.) Its blessedness is
   to consist largely in worldly prosperity. Although the modern advocates
   of the doctrine have eliminated the grosser elements included in the
   theory of many of the fathers on this subject, nevertheless the
   essential earthly character of the kingdom remains. Men are not to be
   like the angels. Births and deaths are to go on, not only during the
   millennium, but without end. Not that the glorified believers who have
   been raised from the dead are to marry and be given in marriage, but
   the race of men is to continue indefinitely to increase in the future
   as it has increased in the past. [878] (c.) The Bible teaches that the
   distinction between the Jews and Gentiles is abolished in the kingdom
   of Christ. This theory teaches that after the second advent that
   distinction is to continue and to be made greater than ever before. The
   temple at Jerusalem is to be rebuilt; the sacrifices restored; and all
   the details of the Mosaic ritual, as described in Ezekiel, again
   introduced. (d.) The Bible teaches that after the end of the world, as
   described in 2 Peter iii. 10 and in the Apocalypse, there are to be a
   new heavens and a new earth. This theory teaches the "earth's eternal
   perpetuity." [879] "The dissolving fires of which Peter speaks," we are
   told, "are for the perdition of ungodly men;' and not for the utter
   depopulation and destruction of the whole world Men and nations will
   survive them and still continue to live in the flesh." [880]

   7. This theory disparages the Gospel. "The more common opinion," says
   Dr. McNeile, "is, that this is the final dispensation, and that by a
   more copious outpouring of the Holy Spirit it will magnify itself, and
   swell into the universal blessedness predicted by the prophets,
   carrying with it Jews and Gentiles, even the whole world, in one
   glorious flock under one shepherd, Jesus Christ the Lord. This is
   reiterated from pulpit, press, and platform. It is the usual climax of
   missionary exhortation, or rather missionary prophecy." [881] "The
   universal prevalence of religion hereafter to be enjoyed," says Mr.
   Brooks, "is not to be effected by any increased impetus given by the
   present means of evangelizing the nations, but by a stupendous display
   of Divine wrath upon all the apostate and ungodly." [882] Wrath,
   however, never converted a single soul, and never will. "The
   Scriptures," according to Mr. Tyso, "do state the design of the Gospel,
   and what it is to effect; but they never say it is to convert the
   world. Its powers have been tried for eighteen hundred years, and it
   has never yet truly converted one nation, one city, one town, nor even
   a single village." [883] In the work of Rev. David Brown on the Second
   Advent, [884] abundant evidence is advanced from the writings of Mr.
   Brooks, Dr. McNeile, and the Rev. Mr. Bickersteth, to show that those
   gentlemen teach that the Scriptures "are to be superseded" in the
   millennium. Other means, probably, as they say, other revelations are
   to be made for the salvation of men. Any theory which thus disparages
   the gospel of the grace of God must be false. Christ's commission to
   his Church was to preach the Gospel to every creature under heaven;
   Paul says, the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation; that, though
   a stumbling block to the Jew and foolishness to the Greek, it is the
   wisdom of God and the power of God; that it has pleased God by the
   foolishness of preaching to save them that believe; and he plainly
   teaches (Rom. x. 11-15) that there is no other means of salvation.
   Wrath, judgments, displays of visible glory, and miracles are not
   designed for the conversion of souls, nor are they adapted to that end.

   8. Another objection to the pre-millennial theory is the want of
   consistency in its advocates and the conflicting conclusions to which
   they come. They profess to adopt the principle of literal
   interpretation. They interpret literally the prophecies relating to the
   return of the Jews to their own land; which promise to them as a nation
   dominion over all the other nations of the earth, the rebuilding of the
   Temple and the restoration of the Temple-service, the greatest worldly
   prosperity, and even the everlasting perpetuity of their nation in the
   highest state of blessedness here on earth and "in the flesh." Yet they
   are forced to abandon their literalism when they come to the
   interpretation of the prophecies which predict that all the nations of
   the earth are to go up to Jerusalem every month, and even on every
   Sabbath. And more than this, they go to the extreme of figurative or
   spiritual interpretation in explaining the prophecies which refer to
   the end of the world. The Apostle Peter says in express terms: "The
   heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt
   with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall
   be burned up." This they deny. They say that it is only certain nations
   who are to be destroyed; that the earth is not to be depopulated; that
   the final conflagration will produce less change or injury than the
   deluge did. [885]

   The utmost confusion also prevails in the views of pre-millennarians as
   to the nature of the kingdom of Christ. According to one view Christ
   and his risen and glorified saints are to dwell visibly on the earth
   and reign for a thousand years; according to another, the risen saints
   are to be in heaven, and not on earth my more than the angels now are;
   nevertheless the subjects of the first resurrection, although dwelling
   in heaven, are to govern the earth; according to another it is the
   converted Jewish nation restored to their own land, who are to be the
   governors of the world; according to another, the Bible divides men
   into three classes: the Gentiles, the Jews, and the Church of God. The
   prophecies relating to the millennium are understood to refer to the
   relative condition of the Jews and Gentiles in this world, and not to
   the risen and glorified believers. Another view seems to be, that this
   earth, changed no more by the fires of the last day than it was by the
   waters of the deluge, is to be the only heaven of the redeemed. Dr.
   Cumming and Dr. Seiss say they wish no better heaven than this earth
   free from the curse and from sin. The latter says: [886] "My faith is,
   that these very hills and valleys shall yet be made glad with the songs
   of a finished redemption, and this earth yet become the bright,
   blessed, and everlasting homestead of men made glorious and immortal in
   body and in soul." Still another view is that there are two heavens,
   one here and one above; two Jerusalems, both to continue forever, the
   one on earth and the other in heaven; the one made with hands, the
   other without hands; both glorious and blessed, but the earthly far
   inferior to the heavenly; they are like concentric circles, one within
   the other; both endless. Men will continue forever, on earth, living
   and dying; happy but not perfect, needing regeneration and
   sanctification; and, when they die, will be translated to the kingdom
   which is above.

   It seems therefore that the torch of the literalist is an "ignis
   fatuus," leading those who follow it, they know not whither. Is it not
   better to abide by the plain doctrinal teaching of the Bible, rather
   than to trust to the uncertain expositions of unfulfilled prophecies?
   What almost all Christians believe is: (1.) That all nations shall be
   converted unto God. Jesus shall reign from the rising to the setting of
   the sun. (2.) That the Jews shall be reingrafted into their own
   olive-tree and acknowledge our Lord to be their God and Saviour. (3.)
   That all Antichristian powers shall be destroyed. (4.) That Christ
   shall come again in person and with great glory; the dead shall be
   raised, those who have done good unto the resurrection of life, those
   who have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation; and, (5.) That
   the righteous clothed in their glorified bodies shall then inherit the
   kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world; and the
   wicked be consigned to their final doom.

   Did the Apostles expect the Second Advent in their Day?

   The simple facts on this subject are: (1.) That the coming of the
   Messiah and the establishment of his kingdom was the great object of
   expectation and desire for the people of God from the beginning of the
   world. It was the great subject of prophecy and promise under the old
   dispensation. The ancient saints are described (as Christians now are)
   as those who were constantly hoping for the coming of the Lord. (Eph.
   ii. 12; Acts xxvi. 6, 7.) The dying thief said: "Lord, remember me,
   when thou comest into thy kingdom." The last question put to our Lord
   by his disciples was: "Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the
   kingdom to Israel." (2.) As the Messiah came at first as a man of
   sorrows, to make Himself a sacrifice for sin, He promised to come a
   second time without sin unto salvation, to raise the dead and to gather
   all his people into his everlasting home. His second coming therefore
   was to Christians what his first coming was to the Old Testament
   saints; the constant object of expectation and desire. (3.) As the time
   of the second advent was unrevealed either to men or angels, the early
   Christians hoped it might occur in their day. The Apostles themselves
   no doubt at first cherished that expectation. (4.) To the Apostle Paul,
   however, it was revealed that the day of the Lord was not to come until
   a great apostasy had occurred. (5.) Nevertheless as the Apostolic
   Christians did not know how long that apostasy was to continue, their
   constant prayer was, O Lord come quickly. The Apostles continued to
   hold up the second advent as an impending event, the moral impression
   of which ought to be to raise the affections of the people from the
   world and fix them on the things unseen and eternal. Those who urge the
   fact that the New Testament writers speak of the day of the Lord as at
   hand, and exhort believers to watch and pray for his advent, as a proof
   that the Apostles believed that it might occur at once, that no events
   then future must come to pass before Christ came, forget that what
   inspired men said God said. If God, who knew that Christ was not to
   come for at least eighteen centuries after his ascension, could say to
   his people: "The day of the Lord is at hand." "Watch therefore, for ye
   know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh," then
   that language was appropriate even on the assumption that those who
   used it knew that the second advent was not to occur for thousands of
   years; for a thousand years are with God as one day, and one day as a
   thousand years. The Church waited four thousand years for the fist
   advent; we may be content to wait God's time for the second. [887]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [876] There recently appeared in the Presbyterian, a series of articles
   signed "Twisse," understood to be from the pen of the Rev. Dr. Duffield
   of Princeton, New Jersey, designed to sustain the doctrine of the
   pre-millennial advent of Christ, and especially to disprove "the
   doctrine of a millennial era of universal righteousness and peace on
   earth before" the second coming of Christ. The arguments summarily
   stated by the writer as the following: "(1.) Were the doctrine true, it
   would undoubtedly be prominent in the New Testament, and especially in
   the Apostolical Epistles. The fact is, it is not only just prominent,
   but, so far as we are informed, the advocates of the doctrine do not
   pretend to find in the Epistles the slightest allusion to it. (2.) The
   uniform and abundant teaching of the New Testament as to the condition
   of the Church and of the world during the present dispensation -- that
   is, until the advent -- forbid the expectation of such a millennium.
   (3.) The advent itself, not the millennium, is prominently presented in
   the New Testament as the blessed hope' of the Church, and is uniformly
   referred to as an event near at hand, ever imminent, to be looked for'
   with longing expectation. (4.) The Saviour's repeated command to watch'
   for his coming, because we know not the hour,' is inconsistent with the
   idea of a millennium intervening. (5.) The New Testament teaches
   repeatedly and unequivocally that the advent and the manifestation of
   the Messianic kingdom are to be synchronous events. (6.) The Apostolic
   Church, under the instruction of those holy men who spoke and wrote as
   they were moved by the Holy Ghost, was millennarian. (7.) The Church,
   for two centuries immediately succeeding the Apostles was millennarian.
   (8.) The doctrine of a millennium before the advent is not to be found
   in the standards of any of the Churches of the Reformation; by several
   it is expressly repudiated. It is a modern novelty, suggested but one
   hundred and fifty years ago by Whitby, and avowedly as a new
   hypothesis.'"

   [877] It is true that pre-millennialists differ very much on this
   point. The common opinion in the early Church was that the risen saints
   are to live and reign a thousand years with Christ on earth; but some
   say that the glorified believers are to be in heaven; others, that they
   are to appear from time to time on earth, as Christ did, during the
   forty days which intervened between his resurrection and ascension; and
   others appear to teach that glorified saints are to rule over
   unglorified humanity without being revealed to those over whom they
   reign.

   [878] See passages cited from distinguished millennarians on this point
   in Rev. David Brown's Christ's Second Coming, pp. 167-173. Mr. David N.
   Lord devotes to this subject two chapters of his book on The Coming and
   Reign of Christ. New York, 1858. He says (p. 151), that the Scriptures
   teach that the earth is "to continue forever, and that mankind are
   forever to occupy it, and multiply in an endless succession of
   generations; and that it is to be the scene of Christ's everlasting
   kingdom and reign." He argues this from the covenant made from Noah;
   from the promise made to Abraham that his seed should forever possess
   the land of Canaan; and from the promise made to David that his seed
   should sit on his throne and reign forever. This perpetuity of the
   human race on the earth and in the flesh, he considers one of the most
   clearly revealed purposes of God concerning the family of man. Instead
   of the number of the redeemed being nearly made up, he holds that they
   are to go on multiplying through all eternity.

   [887] Millennarians are not consistent in urging the objection
   considered in the text, as some at least of their own number teach that
   important events yet future must occur before the establishment of
   Christ's kingdom. For example, Rev. John Cox, Minister of the Gospel,
   Woolwich, in his Thoughts on the Coming and Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, devotes the third chapter of that work to prove that the entire
   destruction of the Papacy, of Mohammedanism, and of the tyrannical
   kingdoms of the world, and the restoration of the Jews to their own
   land, must precede the kingdom of Christ. See The Literalist, vol. v.
   p. 26 ff. The Literalist is a collection, in five octavo volumes, of
   the publications of the leading English pre-millennarians. Published by
   Orrin Rogers, Philadelphia, 1840 and 1841.

   § 6. Future Punishment.

   Our Lord in his account of the final judgment says, that the wicked
   shall go away into everlasting punishment; but the righteous into life
   eternal.

   The sufferings of the finally impenitent, according to the Scriptures,
   arise: (1.) From the loss of all earthly good. (2.) From exclusion from
   the presence and favour of God. (3.) From utter reprobation, or the
   final withdrawal from them of the Holy Spirit. (4.) From the consequent
   unrestrained dominion of sin and sinful passions. (5.) From the
   operations of conscience. (6.) From despair. (7.) From their evil
   associates. (8.) From their external circumstances; that is, future
   suffering is not exclusively the natural consequences of sin, but also
   includes positive inflictions. (9.) From their perpetuity.

   There seems to be no more reason for supposing that the fire spoken of
   in Scripture is to be literal fire, than that the worm that never dies
   is literally a worm. The devil and his angels who are to suffer the
   vengeance of eternal fire, and whose doom the finally impenitent are to
   share, have no material bodies to be acted upon by elemental fire. As
   there are to be degrees in the glory and blessedness of heaven, as our
   Lord teaches us in the parable of the ten talents, so there will be
   differences as to degree in the sufferings of the lost: some will be
   beaten with few stripes, some with many.

   The Duration of Future Punishment.

   On this subject the following opinions have been held: --

   1. It is assumed that the design of punishment is reformation, and that
   it is effective to that end. The time will, therefore, come when all
   sinful creatures, whether men or angels, shall be purged from all
   corruption, and restored to the image and favour of God. This was the
   doctrine of Origen in the early Church. Other restorationists rest
   their hope of the ultimate salvation of all men, not on the purifying
   effect of suffering, but on the efficacy of the death of Christ. If He
   died for all, they infer, all will be saved.

   2. Others hold that future punishment is only hypothetically
   everlasting. That is, the wicked will suffer forever if they continue
   to sin forever. But, if the Spirit continues to strive with men m the
   world to come, or, as others believe, if plenary ability belongs to the
   very nature of a rational creature, then we may assume that some,
   perhaps many, perhaps all, in the course of ages, will repent and turn
   unto God and live.

   3. Others again teach that the sufferings of the impenitent are only
   relatively endless; that is, it will forever be true that their
   condition will be inferior to what it would have been had they been
   better men.

   4. Others hold that the life promised to the righteous is immortality,
   and that the death threatened against the wicked is the extinction of
   life, or, the cessation of conscious existence. The soul will die in
   the future world, just as the body dies here. It ceases to act; it
   ceases to feel; it ceases to be. This death of the soul is called
   eternal, because life is never to be restored. The punishment of the
   wicked is, therefore, in a sense, everlasting. It is a final and
   everlasting forfeiture of all good. Thus Cicero [888] calls death
   "sempiternum malum," and Lucretius [889] speaks of a "mors immortalis."
   This second death may be very painful and protracted. The finally
   impenitent, may, and doubtless will, suffer for a longer or shorter
   period, and to a less or greater degree, before the final extinction of
   their being. And thus there shall be a future retribution, answering
   all the ends of justice. [890]

   5. The common doctrine is, that the conscious existence of the soul
   after the death of the body is unending; that there is no repentance or
   reformation in the future world; that those who depart this life
   unreconciled to God, remain forever in this state of alienation, and
   therefore are forever sinful and miserable. This is the doctrine of the
   whole Christian Church, of the Greeks, of the Latins, and of all the
   great historical Protestant bodies.

   It is obvious that this is a question which can be decided only by
   divine revelation. No one can reasonably presume to decide how long the
   wicked are to suffer for their sins upon any general principles of
   right and wrong. The conditions of the problem are not within our
   grasp. What the infinitely wise and good God may see fit to do with his
   creatures; or what the exigencies of a government embracing the whole
   universe and continuing throughout eternal ages, may demand, it is not
   for such worms of the dust as we are, to determine. If we believe the
   Bible to be the Word of God, all we have to do is to ascertain what it
   teaches on this subject, and humbly submit.

   1. It is an almost invincible presumption that the Bible does teach the
   unending punishment of the finally impenitent, that all Christian
   churches have so understood it. There is no other way in which this
   unanimity of judgment can be accounted for. To refer it to some
   philosophical speculation which had gained ascendancy in the Church,
   such as the dualism of good and evil as two coeternal and necessary
   principles, or the Platonic doctrine of the inherent immortality and
   indestructible nature of the human soul, would be to assign a cause
   altogether inadequate to the effect. Much less can this general consent
   be accounted for on the ground that the doctrine in question is
   congenial to the human mind, and is believed for its own sake, without
   any adequate support from Scripture. The reverse is the case. It is a
   doctrine which the natural heart revolts from and struggles against,
   and to which it submits only under stress of authority. The Church
   believes the doctrine because it must believe it, or renounce faith in
   the Bible and give up all the hopes founded upon its promises. There is
   no doctrine in support of which this general consent can be pleaded,
   which can be shown not to be taught in the Bible. The doctrines of the
   Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the personality of the Holy Spirits
   the sinfulness of men, and others of a like kind, are admitted to be
   Scriptural even by those who do not believe them. The argument now
   urged, does not suppose the Church to be infallible; nor that the
   authority of the Church is the ground of faith; it only assumes that
   what the great body of the competent readers of a plain book take to be
   its meaning, must be its meaning.

   It is unreasonable to account for the general reception of the doctrine
   in question on the ground of church authority. It was universally
   received before the external Church arrogated to itself the right to
   dictate to the people of God what they must believe and it continued to
   be received when, at the Reformation, the authority of the Church was
   repudiated, and the Scriptures were declared to be the only infallible
   rule of faith and practice. Any man, therefore, assumes a fearful
   responsibility who sets himself in opposition to the faith of the
   Church universal.

   2. It is admitted that the doctrine of the perpetuity of the future
   punishment of the wicked was held by the Jews under the old
   dispensation, and at the time of Christ. Neither our Lord nor his
   Apostles ever contradicted that doctrine. They reproved the false
   teachers of their day for doctrinal errors on many points, but they
   never corrected their faith in this doctrine. They never teach anything
   inconsistent with it. Their recorded instructions give no ground for a
   belief either of the final restoration of all rational creatures to the
   favour of God, or of the annihilation of the wicked. The passages which
   are appealed to by Universalists in support of their doctrine admit of
   a natural and simple interpretation in harmony with the general
   teaching of the Bible on this subject. For example, in Ephesians i. 10,
   it is said to be the purpose of God to bring into one harmonious whole
   (or, as it is expressed in Colossians i. 20, to reconcile unto Himself)
   all things, i.e., all, who are in heaven and who are on earth. The
   question is, who, or what are the all, who are to be reconciled unto
   God? This question must be answered by a reference to the nature of the
   thing spoken of, and to the analogy of Scripture. It cannot mean
   absolutely "all things," the whole universe, including sun, moon, and
   stars, for they are not susceptible of reconciliation to God. For the
   same reason it cannot mean all sensitive creatures, including
   irrational animals. Nor can it mean all rational creatures, including
   the holy angels; for they do not need reconciliation. Nor can it mean
   all fallen rational creatures, for it is expressly taught, Hebrews ii.
   16, that Christ did not come to redeem fallen angels. Nor can it mean
   all men, for the Bible teaches elsewhere that all men are not
   reconciled to God; and Scripture cannot contradict Scripture; for that
   would be for God to contradict Himself. The "all" intended is the "all"
   spoken of in the context; the whole body of the people of God; all the
   objects of redemption.

   Restorationists appeal also to Romans v. 18: "As by the offence of one
   judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the
   righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification
   of life." This is made to mean, that as all men are condemned for
   Adam's offence, so all men are justified for the righteousness of
   Christ. The same interpretation is put upon the parallel passage in 1
   Corinthians xv. 22: "As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be
   made alive." In both these passages, however, the "all" is necessarily
   limited by the context. It is the all who are in Adam, that die; and
   the all who are in Christ, that are made alive. Restorationists limit
   the word to all men, or to all fallen creatures, in obedience to what
   they suppose to be the analogy of Scripture; and this is all that is
   done by the orthodox. The only question is, What do the Scriptures
   elsewhere teach? If they clearly teach that all men and fallen angels
   are to be saved, then these passages must be interpreted accordingly;
   but if they teach that all men are not saved, then these passages
   cannot be understood to assert the contrary. Of themselves they decide
   nothing. They may be understood in two ways; which is their real
   meaning depends on what is taught elsewhere.

   The same remark may be made in reference to other passages which
   Universalists rely upon. Thus in 1 Corinthians xv. 25, it is said that
   Christ "must reign, until He hath put all enemies under his feet." This
   may mean that He must reign until all sin and misery are banished from
   the universe; but this is not its necessary meaning, for Satan may be
   subdued without being either converted or annihilated. In like manner,
   in 1 Timothy ii. 4, it is said God "will have all men to be saved;" if
   the word will, thelei, here means to purpose, then the passage teaches
   that all men shall ultimately be certainly saved. But if the word means
   here what it does in Matthew xxvii. 43, to have complacency in, (ei
   thelei auton,) then it teaches only what the Bible everywhere else
   teaches, namely, that God is love; that He delights not in the death of
   sinners. It is to pervert, and to misinterpret the Word of God, to make
   one passage contradict another simply because the language used admits
   of an explanation which brings them into conflict. The question is not,
   What certain words may mean? but, What were they intended to mean as
   used in certain connections?

   If Christ and his Apostles did not teach that all men are to be saved,
   neither did they teach that the wicked are to be annihilated Mr.
   Constable, in his work above referred to, lays down the principle that
   the language of the Scriptures, especially of the New Testament, is to
   be interpreted according to the "usus loquendi" of the Greek writers.
   We are to go to our classical dictionaries to learn the meaning of the
   words they use. From this principle he infers that as the word zoe,
   life, in ordinary Greek, means continued existence, and thanatos,
   death, the cessation of existence, such is their meaning in the
   Scriptures. Therefore, when in the Bible eternal life is promised to
   the righteous, immortality is promised to them; and when eternal death
   is threatened against the wicked, annihilation is declared to be their
   doom. A Greek-speaking people, he says, could attach no other meaning
   to such language. In like manner as the words which we translate to
   destroy, or cause to perish, mean to blot out of existence, the
   inference is that when the wicked are said to be destroyed, or to
   perish, it can only mean that they are annihilated.

   On this it may be remarked, --

   1. That the rule of interpretation here laid down is obviously
   incorrect, and its application would reduce the doctrines of the Bible
   to the level of heathenism. If Greek words as used in Scripture express
   no higher ideas than on the lips of Pagans, then we can have only the
   thoughts of Pagans in the Bible. On this principle, how could the
   Gospel be preached to heathen? to the Hindoos, for example, if they
   were forbidden to attach to the words God, sin, repentance, and a holy
   life, no other ideas than those suggested by the corresponding terms of
   their own language? The Bible, so far as written in Greek, must be
   understood as Greek. But the "usus loquendi" of every language varies
   more or less in different ages, and as spoken by different tribes and
   nations. Every one admits that Hellenistic Greek has a usage
   distinguishing it from the language of the classics. The language of
   the Bible must explain the language of the Bible. It has a "usus
   loquendi" of its own. It is, however, not true that the words life and
   death (zoe, and thanatos) are in any language used only in the limited
   sense which Mr. Constable's argument would assign to them. When the
   poet said, "dum vivimus vivamus," he surely did not mean to say, while
   we continue to exist, let us continue to exist.' The Scriptures written
   in the language of men use words as men are accustomed to use them,
   literally or figuratively, and in senses suited to the nature of the
   subjects to which they are applied. The word life means one thing when
   used of plants, another when used of animals, and another when spoken
   of in reference to the soul of man. The death of a plant is one thing,
   the death of an immortal soul is something entirely different. That the
   words life and death are not confined to the limited sense in which
   annihilationists would take them, hardly needs to be proved. The
   Scriptures everywhere recognize the distinction, in reference to men,
   between animal, intellectual, and spiritual life. A man may have the
   two former and be destitute of the latter. God quickens those dead in
   trespasses and sins; that is, he imparts spiritual life to those who
   are in the full vigour of their animal and intellectual being.
   Therefore we are told that the favour of God is life; that to know God
   is eternal life; that to be spiritually minded is life and that to be
   carnally minded is death. The Apostle tells the Colossians: "Ye are
   dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God." He says to the
   Galatians: "I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me." Those who
   "live in pleasure" are said to be "dead while they live." No one
   believes that the word life in such Scriptural phrases as "the bread of
   life," "the water of life," "the tree of life," "the crown of life,"
   means only continued existence. The word, when used of the soul of man,
   means not only conscious being, but a normal state of being in the
   likeness, fellowship, and enjoyment of God. And in like manner the word
   death, when spoken of the soul, means alienation or separation from
   God; and when that separation is final it is eternal death. This is so
   plain that it never has been doubted, except for the purpose of
   supporting the doctrine of the annihilation of the wicked.

   2. The same remark applies to the use of the words destroy and perish.
   To destroy is to ruin. The nature of that ruin depends on the nature of
   the subject of which it is predicated. A thing is ruined when it is
   rendered unfit for use; when it is in such a state that it can no
   longer answer the end for which it was designed. A ship at sea,
   dismasted, rudderless, with its sides battered in, is ruined, but not
   annihilated. It is a ship still. A man destroys himself when he ruins
   his health, squanders his property, debases his character, and renders
   himself unfit to act his part in life. A soul is utterly and forever
   destroyed when it is reprobated, alienated from God, rendered a fit
   companion only for the devil and his angels. This is a destruction a
   thousandfold more fearful than annihilation. The earnestness with which
   the doctrine of the unending punishment of the wicked is denounced by
   those who reject it, should convince them that its truth is the only
   rational solution of the fact that Christ and his Apostles did not
   condemn it.

   3. But Christ and the Apostles not only failed to correct the teachings
   of the Jews of their day concerning the everlasting punishment of the
   wicked, but they themselves also taught that doctrine in the most
   explicit and solemn manner. It is asserted affirmatively that future
   punishment is everlasting; in the negative form that it can never end;
   that there is in the future world an impassable gulf between the
   righteous and the wicked; and that there are sins which can never be
   forgiven either in this life or in the life to come. Thus if words can
   teach this doctrine it is taught in the Bible from the beginning to the
   end. In the Old Testament, the prophet says (Is. xxxiii. 14): "The
   sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites;
   who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall
   dwell with everlasting burnings." In Isaiah lxvi. 24 it is said of
   those who should be excluded from the new heavens and the new earth
   which the prophet had predicted, "that their worm shall not die,
   neither shall their fire be quenched." "Hell," however, "is of both
   worlds, so that in the same essential sense, although in different
   degrees, it may be said both of him who is still living but accursed,
   and of him who perished centuries ago, that his worm dieth not and his
   fire is not quenched." [891] The prophet Daniel (xii. 2) says of the
   wicked, that they "shall awake . . . . to shame and everlasting
   contempt." In Luke iii. 17 it is said that Christ shall "gather the
   wheat into his garner; but the chaff He will burn with fire
   unquenchable." In Mark ix. 42-48 our Lord says that it is better "to
   enter into life maimed, than, having two hands, to go into hell, into
   the fire that never shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, and
   the fire is not quenched." These awful words fell three times, in one
   discourse, from the lips of mercy, to give them the greater effect.
   Christ wept over Jerusalem. Why did He not avert its doom? Simply
   because it would not have been right. So He may weep over the doom of
   the impenitent wicked; and yet leave them to their fate. It is no more
   possible that the cup should pass from their lips than that it should
   have been taken from the trembling hand of the Son of God himself. The
   latter spectacle was far more appalling in the eyes of angels than the
   lake of fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

   The Judge on the last day, we are told, will say to those on the left
   hand: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire." "And these
   shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life
   eternal." The same word is used in both clauses; the wicked are to go
   eis kolasin aionion; and the righteous eis zoen aionion; it must have
   the same sense in both. (Matt. xxv. 41, 46.) In John iii. 36 it is
   said: "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that
   believeth not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth
   on him." Paul teaches us in 2 Thessalonians i. 9 that when Christ comes
   the wicked "shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the
   presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." Jude (verse 6)
   says that the angels which kept not their first estate are "reserved in
   everlasting chains under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day.
   Even as Sodom and Gomorrah . . . . are set forth for an example,
   suffering the vengeance of eternal fire." Of apostates, he says (verses
   12, 13) there is reserved for them "the blackness of darkness forever."
   In Revelation xiv. 9-11, those who worship the beast and his image or
   receive his mark, shall "be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
   presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the
   smoke of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever: and they have no
   rest day nor night." Nearly the same words are repeated in chapters
   xix. 1-3, 20; xx. 10.

   It is objected to the argument founded on these passages that the word
   "everlasting" is sometimes used in Scripture of periods of limited
   duration. In reference to this objection it may be remarked, (1.) That
   the Hebrew and Greek words rendered in our version eternal, or
   everlasting, mean duration whose termination is unknown. When used in
   reference to perishable things, as when the Bible speaks of "the
   everlasting hills," they simply indicate indefinite existence, that is,
   existence to which there is no known or assignable limit. But when used
   in reference to that which is either in its own nature imperishable, or
   of which the unending existence is revealed, as the human soul or in
   reference to that which we have no authority from other sources to
   assign a limit to, as the future blessedness of the saints, then the
   words are to be taken in their literal sense. If. because we sometimes
   say we give a man a thing forever, without intending that he is to
   possess it to all eternity, it were argued that the word forever
   expresses limited duration, every one would see that the inference was
   unfounded. If the Bible says that the sufferings of the lost are to be
   everlasting, they are to endure forever, unless it can be shown either
   that the soul is not immortal or that the Scriptures elsewhere teach
   that those sufferings are to come to an end. No one argues that the
   blessedness of the righteous will cease after a term of years, because
   the word everlasting is sometimes used of things which do not continue
   forever. Our Lord teaches that the punishment of the wicked is
   everlasting, in the same sense that the blessedness of the saints is
   everlasting. (2.) It is to be remembered, that admitting the word
   "everlasting" to be ever so ambiguous, the Bible says that the worm
   never dies, and the fire is never quenched. We have therefore the
   direct assertion of the word of God that the sufferings of the lost are
   unending. All the modes of expression used to set forth the perpetuity
   of the salvation of believers and the everlasting duration of the
   kingdom of Christ, are employed to teach the perpetuity of the future
   punishment of the wicked. If that doctrine, therefore, be not taught in
   the Scriptures, it is difficult to see how it could be taught in human
   language.

   4. A fourth argument on this subject is drawn from passages in which
   the doctrine is implied, although not directly asserted. This includes
   those passages which teach that there is no repentance, no forgiveness,
   no change of state in the future world. This is done, for example, in
   our Lord's parable of the rich man and Lazarus, in which He teaches
   that there is no possibility of passing from hell to heaven. So, also,
   we are taught that those who die in sin remain sinful forever. And our
   Lord says, it would be better for a man had he never been born, than
   that he should incur the guilt of offending any of the little ones who
   believe on Him. This, at least, is conclusive against the doctrine of
   universal salvation; for if, after any period of suffering, an eternity
   of happiness awaits a man, his being born is an unspeakable blessing.

   Rationalists say that it is very impolitic for Christians to represent
   the everlasting punishment of the wicked as a doctrine of the Bible.
   This is undoubtedly true. And so Paul felt that it was very impolitic
   to preach the doctrine of the Cross. He knew that doctrine to be a
   stumbling-block to the Jew and foolishness to the Greek. He knew that
   had he preached the common sense doctrine of salvation by works, the
   offence of the cross would have ceased. Nevertheless, he knew that the
   doctrine of Christ crucified was the wisdom of God and the power of God
   unto salvation. He knew that it was not his business to make a Gospel,
   but to declare that Gospel which had been taught Him, by the revelation
   of Jesus Christ. It would be well if all who call themselves
   Christians, should learn that it is not their business to believe and
   teach what they may think true or right, but what God in his Holy Word
   has seen fit to reveal.

   Objections.

   It is urged that it cannot be consistent with the justice of God to
   inflict a really infinite penalty on such a creature as man. It is very
   obvious to remark on this subject: --

   1. That we are incompetent judges of the penalty which sin deserves. We
   have no adequate apprehension of its inherent guilt, of the dignity of
   the person against whom it is committed, or of the extent of the evil
   which it is suited to produce. The proper end of punishment is
   retribution and prevention. What is necessary for that end, God only
   knows; and, therefore, the penalty which He imposes on sin is the only
   just measure of its ill desert.

   2. If it be inconsistent with the justice of God that men should perish
   for their sins, then redemption is not a matter of grace, or undeserved
   mercy. Deliverance from an unjust penalty, is a matter of justice.
   Nothing, however, is plainer from the teaching of Scripture, and
   nothing is more universally and joyfully acknowledged by all
   Christians, than that the whole plan of redemption, the mission, the
   incarnation, and the sufferings and death of the Son of God for the
   salvation of sinners, is a wonderful exhibition of the love of God
   which passes knowledge. But if justice demand that all men should be
   saved, then salvation is a matter of justice; and then all the songs of
   gratitude and praise from the redeemed, whether in heaven or on earth,
   must at once cease.

   3. It is often said that sin is an infinite evil because committed
   against a person of infinite dignity, and therefore deserves an
   infinite penalty. To this it is answered, that as sin is an act or
   state of a finite subject, it must of necessity be itself finite. Men
   are apt to involve themselves in contradictions when they attempt to
   reason about the infinite. The word is so vague and so comprehensive,
   and our ideas of what it is intended to express are so inadequate, that
   we are soon lost when we seek to make it a guide in forming our
   judgments. If the evil of a single sin, and that the smallest, lasts
   forever, it is in one sense an infinite evil, although in comparison
   with other sins, or with the whole mass of sin ever committed, it may
   appear a mere trifle. The guilt of sin is infinite in the sense that we
   can set no limits to its turpitude or to the evil which it is adapted
   to produce.

   4. Relief on this subject is sought from the consideration that as the
   lost continue to sin forever they may justly be punished forever. To
   this, however, it is answered that the retributions of eternity are
   threatened for the sins done in the body. This is true; nevertheless;
   it is also true, first, that sin in its nature is alienation and
   separation from God; and as God is the source of all holiness and
   happiness, separation from Him is of necessity the forfeiture of all
   good; secondly, that this separation is from its nature final and
   consequently involves endless sinfulness and misery. It is thus final,
   unless on the assumption of the undeserved and supernatural
   intervention of God as in the case of the redemption of man; and
   thirdly, it is also true that from the nature of the case "the carnal
   mind is death." Degradation and misery are inseparably connected with
   sin. As long as rational creatures are sinful, they must be degraded
   and miserable. There is no law of nature more immutable than this. If
   men do not expect God to reverse the laws of nature to secure their
   exemption from wanton transgression of those laws, why should they
   expect Him to reverse the still more immutable laws of our moral
   constitution and of his moral government? The doom of the fallen angels
   teaches us that one act of rebellion against God is fatal, whether we
   say that all they have suffered since, and all they are to suffer
   forever, is the penalty of that one act, or the inevitable consequence
   of the condition into which that one act brought them, makes no
   difference.

   The Goodness of God.

   A still more formidable objection is drawn from the goodness of God. It
   is said to be inconsistent with his benevolence that He should allow
   any of his creatures to be forever miserable. The answer to this is: --

   1. That it is just as impossible that God should do a little wrong as a
   great one. If He has permitted such a vast amount of sin and misery to
   exist in the world, from the fall of Adam to the present time, how can
   we say that it is inconsistent with his goodness, to allow them to
   continue to exist? How do we know that the reasons, so to speak, which
   constrained God to allow his children to be sinful and miserable for
   thousands of years, may not constrain Him to permit some of them to
   remain miserable forever? If the highest glory of God and the good of
   the universe have been promoted by the past sinfulness and misery of
   men, why may not those objects be promoted by what is declared to be
   future?

   2. We have reason to believe, as urged in the first volume of this
   work, and as often urged elsewhere, that the number of the finally lost
   in comparison with the whole number of the saved will be very
   inconsiderable. Our blessed Lord, when surrounded by the innumerable
   company of the redeemed, will be hailed as the "Salvator Hominum," the
   Saviour of Men, as the Lamb that bore the sins of the world.

   3. It should constrain us to humility, and to silence on this subject,
   that the most solemn and explicit declarations of the everlasting
   misery of the wicked recorded in the Scriptures, fell from the lips of
   Him, who, though equal with God, was found in fashion as a man, and

   for our salvation.

       Tametsi enim philosophice loquendo supra coelos locus non est; quia
       tamen corpus Christi, ut fert humani corporis natura et modus,
       finitum est et coelo, ut loco, continetur, necesse est a nobis
       tanto locorum intervallo distare, quanto coelum abest a terra.

     * [1719]Actus fidei ordinatur ad objectum voluntatis, quod est bonum,

       bonum divinum, est proprium objectum charitatis: et ideo charitas
       dicitur forma fidei, in quantum per charitatem actus fidei
       perficitur et formatur.
     * [1720]Ad hunc modum ita discerne, longe aliam rem esse baptismum,
       atque omnes alias aquas: non naturalis essentiæ gratia, sed quod
       huic aliquid præstantioris rei adjungitur. Ipse enim Deus baptismum
       suo honestat nomine, suaque virtute confirmat. Eam ob rem non
       tantum naturalis aqua, sed etiam divina, coelestis, sancta et
       salutifera aqua, quocunque alio laudis titulo nobilitari potest,
       habenda et dicenda est; hocque non nisi verbi gratia, quod coeleste
       ac sanctum verbum est, neque a quoquam satis ampliter, digne et
       cumulate laudari potest, siquidem omnem Dei virtutem et potentiam
       in se habet comprehensam. Inde quoque baptismus suam accipit
       essentiam, ut sacramenti appellationem mereatur, quemadmodum
       sanctus etiam docet Augustinus: Accedit, inquit, verbum ad
       elementum, et fit sacramentum, hoc est, res sancta et divina.

       addito verbo Dei est baptismus, hoc est, salutaris aqua gratiæ et
       vitæ, et lavacrum regenerationis in Spiritu Sancto, sicut Paulus

       Christi loco adoravit: nos enim reliquias quidem honoramus, et
       osculamur ut sacra pignora patronorum nostrorum: sed nec adoramus
       ut Deum nec invocamus ut sanctos, sed minore cultu veneramur, quam

       ceteras omnes relinquere, ac priorem tantum justæ et legitimæ

       præpostera sua hypothesi de justificatione morali. Sed quæritur, Ad
       quid imputatio ista fiat? An ad justificationem et vitam, ut nos
       pertendimus, An vero tantum ad gratiæ internæ et justitiæ
       inhærentis infusionem, ut illi volunt; Id est, an ita imputentur et
       communicentur nobis merita Christi, ut sint causa meritoria sola
       nostræ justificationis, nec ulla alia detur justitia propter quam
       absolvamur in conspectu Dei; quod volumus; An vero ita imputentur,
       ut sint conditiones causæ formalis, id. justitiæ inhærentis, ut ea
       homo donari possit, vel causæ extrinsecæ, quæ mereantur infusionem
       justitiæ, per quam justificatur homo; ut ita non meritum Christi
       proprie, sed justitia inhærens per meritum Christi acquisita, sic

       consequentium nostrorum operum, dignitatis, aut meriti. Ille enim
       donat atque imputat nobis justitiam obedientiæ Christi; propter eam
       justitiam a Deo in gratiam recipimur et justi reputamur.
     * [1757]Credimus, sicut antea dictum est, tam in coena quam in
       baptismo, Deum nobis reipsa, id est, vere et efficaciter donare
       quicquid ibi sacramentaliter figurat, ac proinde cum signis
       conjungimus veram possessionem ac fruitionem ejus rei, quæ ita
       nobis offertur. Itaque affirmamus eos qui ad sacram mensam Domini
       puram fidem tanquam vas quoddam afferunt, vere recipere quod ibi
       signa testificantur, nempe corpus et sanguinem Jesu Christi, non
       minus esse cibum ac potum animæ, quam panis et vinum sunt corporis
       cibus.
     * [1758]Credo, imo scio omnia sacramenta, tam abesse ut gratiam
       conferant, ut ne adferant quidem aut dispensent. . . . . Dux autem
       vel vehiculum Spiritui non est necessarium, ipse enim est virtus et
       latio qua cuncta feruntur, non qui ferri opus habeat: neque id
       unquam legimus in scripturis sacris, quod sensibilia, qualia
       sacramenta sunt, certo secum ferrent Spiritum, sed si sensibilia
       unquam lata sunt cum Spiritu, jam Spiritus fuit qui tulit, non
       sensibilia. Sic cum ventus vehemens ferretur, simul adferebantur
       linguæ venti virtute, non ferebatur ventus virtute linguarum.

       sepulcra, et oculis, et manibus membrisque omnibus captis, in
       pristinum statum restitutis, mortuis ad vitam revocatis, ex
       corporibus hominum ejectis demoniis? quæ non audisse, ut multi, non
       legisse, ut plurimi gravissimi viri, sed vidisse, testes
       locupletissimi sancti Ambrosius et Augustinus litteris prodiderunt.
       Quid multa? si vestes, sudaria, si umbra sanctorum, priusquam e
       vita migrarent, depulit morbos, viresque restituit, quis tandem
       negare audeat, Deum per sacros cineres, ossa, ceterasque sanctorum
       reliquias eadem mirabiliter efficere? Declaravit id cadaver illud,

       inhærere non possunt: relinquitur, ut supra omnem naturæ ordinem

     * [1763]Cum baptismus ob eam rem expetendus sit, ut Christum
       induamus, et cum eo conjungamur, plane constat, merito a sacra
       ablutione rejiciendum esse, cui in vitiis et peccatis perseverare
       propositum est; præsertim vero, quia nihil eorum, quæ ad Christum,
       et Ecclesiam pertinent, frustra suscipiendum est: inanemque
       baptismum, si justitiæ, et salutis gratiam spectemus, in eo futurum
       esse, satis intelligimus, qui secundum carnem ambulare, non
       secundum Spiritum cogitat: etsi, quod ad sacramentum pertinet,
       perfectam ejus rationem sine ulla dubitatione consequitur, si modo,
       cum rite baptizatur, in animo habeat id accipere, quod a sancta
       Ecclesia administratur.
     * [1764]Cum dicimus Christi justitiam ad justificationem nobis
       imputari, et nos per justitiam illam imputatam justos esse coram
       Deo, et non per justitiam ullam quæ nobis inhæreat; Nihil aliud
       volumus, quam obedientiam Christi Deo Patri nomine nostro
       præstitam, ita nobis a Deo donari, ut vere nostra censeatur, eamque
       esse unicam et solam illam justitiam propter quam, et cujus merito,
       absolvamur a reatu peccatorum nostrum, et jus ad vitam obtinemus;
       nec ullam in nobis esse justitiam, aut ulla bona opera, quibus
       beneficia tanta promereamur, quæ ferre possint severum judicii
       divini examen, si Deus juxta legis suæ rigorem nobiscum agere
       vellet nihil nos illi posse opponere, nisi Christi meritum et
       satisfactionem, in qua sola, peccatorum conscientia territi, tutum
       adversus iram divinam perfugium, et animarum nostrarum pacem
       invenire possumus.
     * [1765]Cum hodie hoc Dei verbum per prædicatores legitime vocatos
       annunciatur in ecclesia, credimus ipsum Dei verbum annunciari, et a
       fidelibus recipi, neque aliud Dei verbum fingendum vel coelitus
       esse expectandum. . . . . Agnoscimus interim, Deum illuminare posse
       homines etiam sine externo ministerio, quos et quando velit: id
       quod ejus potentiæ est. Nos autem loquimur de usitate ratione
       instituendi homines, et præcepto et exemplo tradita nobis a Deo.
     * [1766]Cum homo ad Dei imaginem sit factus, æquum est, ut, qui Dei
       imaginem violavit et destruxit, occidatur, cum Dei imagini injuriam
       faciens, ipsum Deum, illius auctorem, petierit.
     * [1767]Cum vero multo etiam seriora secula plena sint testimoniis
       ejus rei, nescio qua ratione moti quidam id donum ad prima tantum
       tempora restringant; quibus ut uberiorem fuisse miraculorum copiam,
       ad jacienda tanti ædificii fundementa contra vim mundi, facile
       concedo, ita cum illis expirasse hanc Christi promissionem cur
       credamus non video. Quare si quis nunc etiam gentibus Christi
       ignaris (illis enim proprie miracula inserviunt 1 Cor. xiv. 22
     * [1768]Cur, inquiunt, nunc illa miracula, quæ prædicatis facta esse,
       non fiunt? Possem quidem dicere, necessaria fuisse priusquam
       crederet mundus, ad hoc ut crederet mundus.

       est regnum Dei, et sunt in foedere Dei, cur itaque non daretur eis
       signum foederis Dei?
     * [1770]Damnamus totum populum scholasticorum doctorum, qui docent,

       operato, sine bono motu utentis. Hæc simpliciter Judaica opinio
       est, sentire, quod per ceremoniam justificemur, sine bono motu
       cordis, hoc est, sine fide. . . . . At sacramenta sunt signa
       promissionum. Igitur in usu debet accedere fides. . . . . Loquimur
       hic de fide speciali, quæ præsenti promissioni credit, non tantum
       quæ in genere credit Deum esse, sed quæ credit offerri remissionem
       peccatoram.
     * [1771]Damnant Anabaptistas qui improbant baptismum puerorum et
       affirmant pueros sine baptismo salvos fieri.
     * [1772]De Coena Domini docent, quod corpus et sanguis Christi vere
       adsint et distribuantur vescentibus in Coena Domini, et improbant
       secus docentes.
     * [1773]De baptismo docent, quod sit necessarius ad salutem, quodque
       per baptismum offeratur gratia Dei; et quod pueri sint baptizandi,
       qui per baptismum oblati Deo recipiantur in gratiam Dei. Damnant
       Anabaptistas, qui improbant baptismum puerorum et affirmant pueros
       sine baptismo salvos fieri.
     * [1774]De carnis etiam nostræ immortalitate securos nos reddat,
       siquidem ab immortali ejus carne jam vivificatur et quodammodo ejus
       immortalitate communicat.
     * [1775]De causa meritoria justificationis hominis coram Deo, sive de
       ea re, quæ a Deo ad justitiam imputatur
     * [1776]De ordine ecclesiastico docent, quod nemo debeat in ecclesia
       publice docere, aut sacramenta administrare, nisi rite vocatus.
     * [1777]De sacramento altaris sentimus, panem et vinum in Coena esse
       verum corpus et sanguinem Christi, et non tantum dari et sumi a
       piis, sed etiam impiis christianis.
     * [1778]De transubstantione subtilitatem sophisticam nihil curamus,
       qua fingunt, panem et vinum relinquere et amittere naturalem suam
       substantiam, et tantum speciem et colorem panis, et non verum panem
       remanere. Optime enim cum sacra Scriptura congruit, quod panis
       adsit et maneat, sicut Paulus ipse nominat Panis quem frangimus.
       Et: Ita edat de pane.
     * [1779]De usu sacramentorum docent, quod sacramenta instituta sint,
       non modo ut sint notæ professionis inter homines, sed magis ut sint
       signa et testimonia voluntatis Dei erga nos, ad excitandam et
       confirmandam fidem in his, qui utuntur, proposita. Itaque utendum
       est sacramentis ita, ut fides accedat, quæ credat promissionibus,
       quæ per sacramenta exhibentur et ostenduntur.
     * [1780]Decimus articulus approbatus est, in quo confitemur, nos
       sentire, quod in Coena Domini vere et substantialiter adsint corpus
       et sanguis Christi, et vere exhibeantur cum illis rebus, quæ
       videntur, pane et vino, his, qui sacramentum accipiunt.
     * [1781]Declarat tamen hæc ipsa Sancta Synodus, non esse suæ
       intentionis comprehendere in hoc decreto, ubi de peccato originali
       agitur, beatam, et immaculatam Viriginem Mariam, Dei genetricem;
       sed observandas esse constitutiones felicis recordationis Xysti
       papæ IV., sub poenis in eis constitutionibus contentis, quas
       innovat.
     * [1782]Defectus charitatis, quod videlicet non faciamus opera nostra
       tanto fervore dilectionis, quanto faciemus in patria, defectus
       quidem est, sed culpa et peccatum non est. . . . . Unde etiam
       charitas nostra, quamvis comparata ad charitatem beatorum sit
       imperfecta, tamen absolute perfecta dici potest.
     * [1783]Defectus charitatis, quod videlicet non faciamus opera nostra
       tanto fervore dilectionis, quanto faciemus in patria, defectus
       quidem est, sed culpa, et peccatum non est. Unde etiam charitas
       nostra, quamvis comparata ad charitatem beatorum sit imperfecta,
       tamen absolute perfecta dici potest.
     * [1784]Deinde et pro defunctis sanctis patribus et episcopis, et
       omnibus generatim, qui inter nos vita functi sunt, oramus, maximum
       hoc credentes adjumentum illis animabus fore, pro quibas oratio
       defertur, dum sancta et tremenda coram jacet victima
     * [1785]Deiparæ Virginis Mariæ, angelorum, et sanctorum sunt imagines
       adorandæ (id est in honore habendæ, as it reads in the margin) tum
       corpora, et reliquiæ quævis.
     * [1786]Descendit et lavit in Jordane septies
     * [1787]Deus non judicat hominum justitiam esse perfectam, imo eam
       judicat esse imperfectam; sed justitiam, quam imperfectam judicat,
       gratiose accipit ac si perfecta esset.
     * [1788]Deus panem vivificum misit, qui de coelo descendit, nempe
       Jesum Christum: is nutrit et sustentat vitam fidelium spiritualem,
       si comedatur, id est, applicetur et recipiatur Spiritu per fidem.
     * [1789]Dicimus igitur ad sacramenta proprie sic dicta duo potissimum
       requiri, videlicet verbum et elementum, juxta vulgatum illud
       Augustini: Accedit verbum ad elementum, et fit sacramentum.'
       Fundamentum hujus adsertionis ex ipsa natura et fine sacramentorum
       pendet, cum enim sacramenta id, quid in verbo evangelii prædicatur,
       externo elemento vestitum sensibus ingerere debeant, ex eo sponte
       sequitur, quod nec verbum sine elemento, nec elementum sine verbo
       constituat sacramentum. Per verbum intelligitur primo mandatum
       atque institutio divina, per quam elementum . . . . . separatur ab
       usu communi, et destinatur usui sacramentali; deinde promissio
       atque ea quidem evangelio propria, per sacramentum adplicanda et
       obsignanda. Per elementum non quodvis, sed certum et verbo
       institutionis expressum accipitur.
     * [1790]Difficile Deo non est moleculas omnes ad corpus aliquod
       spectantes, etiam post innumeros transitus ex uno in aliud
       colligere. Hæc mutatio seu transitus accidentalis est, minime vere
       essentialis, ut ex physiologia ac zoobiologia constat universa.
     * [1791]Dilucide exprimit, se non ea justitia contentum, quæ nobis
       obedientia et sacrificio mortis Christi parta est, fingere nos
       substantialiter in Deo justos esse tam essentia quam qualitate
       infusa. . . . . Substantialem mixtionem ingerit, qua Deus se in nos
       transfundens, quasi partem sui faciat. Nam virtute Spiritus sancti
       fieri, ut coalescamus cum Christo, nobisque sit caput et nos ejus
       membra, fere pro nihilo ducit, nisi ejus essentia nobis misceatur.
     * [1792]Divortiis
     * [1793]Dixit: Sic tamen quasi per ignem,' ut salus hæc non sine
       poena sit: . . . . estendit salvum illum quidem futurum; sed poenas
       ignis passurum, ut per ignem purgatus fiat salvus, et non sicut
       perfidi æterno igne in perpetuum torqueatur.
     * [1794]Docemus, "baptismum esse quidem ordinarium initiationis
       sacramentum et regenerationis medium omnibus omnino etiam fidelium
       liberis ad regenerationem et salutem necessarium; interim tamen in
       casu privationis sive impossibilitatis salvari liberos
       Christianorum per extraordinariam et peculiarem dispensationem
       divinam."
     * [1795]Docent [Apostoli] Antichristum non fore unam aliquam tantum
       personam, sed integrum regnum, per falsos doctores in templo Dei,
       hoc est in Ecclesia Dei præsidentes, in urba magna, quæ habet
       regnum super reges terræ id est, in Romana civitate, et imperio
       Romano, opera diaboli, et fraude, et deceptione comparatum.
     * [1796]Docere autem oportet, Christum nomen esse Dei, et hominis,
       unius scilicet personæ, in qua divina, et humana natura conjuncta
       sit, quare utramque substantiam, et quæ utriusque substantiæ
       consequentia sunt, divinitatem, et totam humanam naturam, quæ
       exanima, et omnibus corporis partibus, et sanguine etiam constat,
       complectitur: quæ omnia in sacramento esse credendum est, nam cum
       in coelo tota humanitas divinitati, in una persona, et hypostasi
       conjuncta sit, nefas est suspicari, corpus, quod in sacramento
       inest, ab eadem divinitate sejunctum esse.
     * [1797]Domina
     * [1798]Ea est pretii natura, ut sui valore aut æstimatione alterum
       moveat ad concedendam rem, aut jus aliquod, puta impunitatem.
     * [1799]Ea pecunia, quæ in judiciuin venit in litibus, sacramentum a
       sacro.
     * [1800]Ea quæ sunt supra naturam, sola fide tenemus. Quod autem
       credimus, auctoritati debemus. Unde in omnibus asserendis sequi
       debemus naturam rerum, præter ea, quæ auctoritate divina traduntur,
       quæ sunt supra naturam.
     * [1801]Ejusmodi vota hodie quoque nobis in usu esse possunt, quoties
       nos Dominus vel a clade aliqua, vel a morbo difficili, vel ab alio
       quovis discrimine eripuit. Neque enim a pii hominis officio tunc
       abhorret, votivam oblationem, velut sollenne recognitionis
       symbolum, Deo consecrare: ne ingratus erga ejus benignitatem
       videatur.
     * [1802]Est gratiosa æstimatio, seu potius acceptatio justitiæ nostræ
       imperfectæ (quæ, si Deus rigide nobiscum agere vellet, in judicio
       Dei nequaquam consistere posset) pro perfecta, propter Jesum
       Christum.
     * [1803]Est gratiosa æstimatio, seu potius acceptatio justitiæ nostræ
       imperfectæ pro perfecta, propter Jesum Christum.
     * [1804]Est hoc sacramentum poenitentiæ lapsis post baptismum ad
       salutem necessarium, ut nondum regeneratis ipse baptismus.
     * [1805]Est itaque [fides] talis actus, qui, licet in se spectatus
       perfectus nequaquam sit, sed in multis deficiens, tamen a Deo,
       gratiosa et liberrima voluntate, pro pleno et perfecto acceptatur,
       et propter quem Deus homini gratiose remissionem peccatoram et vitæ
       æternæ premium conferre vult.
     * [1806]Est tamen notandum, cum dicimus, non debere peti à sanctis,
       nisi ut orent pro nobis, nos non agere de verbis, sed de sensu
       verborum; nam quantum ad verba, licet dicere, S. Petre miserere
       mihi, salva me, aperi mihi aditum coeli: item, da mihi sanitatem
       corporis, da patientiam, da mihi fortitudinem.
     * [1807]Estne Baptismus ad salutem omnibus necessarius?
     * [1808]Et Elisæum qui semel et iterum suscitavit, dum viveret, et
       post mortem: vivus resurrectionem per suam ipsius animam operatus
       est, ut autem non animæ solum justorum honorarentur, sed crederetur
       etiam in justorum corporibus jacere vim, projectus in monumentum
       Elisæi mortuus prophetæ corpus attingens, vitam concepit, 4 Kin.
       iv. 13
     * [1809]Et erit sepulcrum ejus gloriosum
     * [1810]Et quamvis in honorem et memoriam sanctorum nonnullas
       interdum missas ecclesia celebrare consueverit; non tamen illis
       sacrificium offerri docet, sed Deo soli, qui illos coronavit; unde
       nec sacerdos dicere solet, offero tibi sacrificium Petre, vel
       Paule; sed Deo de illorum victoriis gratias agens, eorum patrocinia
       implorat, ut ipsi pro nobis intercedere dignentur in coelis, quorum
       memoriam facimus in terris.
     * [1811]Et sicut nostram terrenam imperialem potentiam, sic ejus
       (Petri) sacrosanctam Romanam Ecclesiam decrevimus veneranter
       honorari, et amplius quam nostrum imperium terrenumque thronum,
       sedem sacratissimam b. Petri gloriose exaltari: tribuentes ei
       potestatem et gloriæ dignitatem, atque vigorem et honorificentiam
       imperialem. Unde ut pontificalis apex non vilescat, sed magis quam
       imperii dignitas, gloria et potentia decoretur, ecce tam palatium
       nostrum, ut prædictum est, quam Romanam urbem, et omnes Italiæ, seu
       occidentalium regionum provincias, loca et civitates præfato
       beatissimo Pontifici nostro Sylvestro, universali papæ, contradimus
       atque relinquimus: et ab eo et a successoribus ejus per hanc
       divalem nostram, et pragmaticum constitutum decernimus disponenda,
       atque juri sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ concedimus permansura.
     * [1812]Etsi expetendum quam maxime esset, ut Græci, qui sunt in
       sacris ordinibus constituti, castitatem non secus ac Latini
       servarent. Nihilominus, ut eorum clerici, subdiaconi, diaconi et
       presbyteri uxores in eorum ministerio retineant, dummodo ante
       sacros ordines, virgines, non viduas, neque corruptas duxerint,
       Romana non prohibet Ecclesia. Eos autem, qui viduam vel corruptam
       duxerunt, vel ad secunda vota, prima uxore mortua, convolarunt, ad
       subdiaconatum, diaconatum et presbyteratum promoveri omnino
       prohibemus.
     * [1813]Ex Opere Operato
     * [1814]Ex opere operato
     * [1815]Ex quibus hoc colligitur sacramenta dari in testimonium
       publicum ejus gratiæ, quæ cuique privato prius adest. . . . . Ob
       hanc causam sacramenta, quæ sacræ sunt cerimoniæ (accedit enim
       verbum ad elementum et fit sacramentum), religiose colenda, hoc est
       in precio habenda, et honorifice tractanda sunt, ut enim gratiam
       facere non possunt, Ecclesiæ tamen nos visibiliter sociant, qui
       prius invisibiliter sumus in illam recepti, quod cum simul cum
       promissionis divinæ verbis in ipsorum actione pronunciatur ac
       promulgatur, summa religione suscipiendum est.
     * [1816]Ex quo refellitur Lutheri blasphemia, qui in libro de
       abolenda Missa dicit, Deo non majorem curam esse de sepulcro
       Domini, quam de bobus.
     * [1817]Exponendum erit, hujus sacramenti virtute nos non solum a
       malis, quæ vere maxima dicenda sunt, liberari, verum etiam eximiis
       bonis augeri. Animus enim noster divina gratia repletur, qua justi,
       et filii Dei effecti, æternæ quoque salutis heredes instituimur.
     * [1818]Extra eorum [sacramentorum] usum fidelibus constat, quæ illic
       figuratur veritas. Sic baptismo abluta sunt Pauli peccata, quæ jam
       prius abluta erant. Sic idem baptismus Cornelio fuit lavacrum
       regenerationis, qui tamen jam Spiritu Sancto donatus erat. Sic in
       coena se communiat Christus, qui tamen et prius se nobis
       impertierat et perpetuo manet in nobis.
     * [1819]Extra eorum usum fidelibus constat, quæ illic figuratur
       veritas.
     * [1820]Falsum est Catholicos non habere pro obice incredulitatem:
       omnes enim Catholici requirunt necessario in adultis actualem
       fidem, et sine ea dicunt neminem justificari.
     * [1821]Fatemur talia esse signa hæc exteriora, ut Deus per illa
       Sancti sui Spiritus virtute, operetur, ne quicquam ibi frustra
       nobis significetur.
     * [1822]Fides
     * [1823]Fides est conditio in nobis et a nobis requisita, ut
       justificationem consequamur. Est itaque talis actus, qui, licet in
       se spectatus perfectus nequaquam sit, sed in multis deficiens,
       tamen a Deo gratiosa et liberrima voluntate pro pleno et perfecto
       acceptatur et propter quem Deus homini gratiose remissionem
       peccatorum et vitæ æternæ præmium conferre vult.
     * [1824]Fides est virtus qua creduntur quæ non videntur.
     * [1825]Fides qua dicitur [creditur?], si cum caritate sit, virtus
       est, quia caritas ut ait Ambrosius mater est omnium virtutum, quæ
       omnes informat, sine qua nulla vera virtus est.
     * [1826]Fides subjectiva est persuasio de veritate rei, alterius
       testimonio nixa, quomodo fides illa generatim descripta, scientiæ
       et conjecturæ opponitur. . . . . Dividitur . . . . in fidem
       divinam, quæ nititur testimonio divino, et humanam, quæ fundata est
       in testimonio humano fide accepto.
     * [1827]Fides vera nunquam sola est, quin caritatem et spem semper
       secum habeat.
     * [1828]Forma consummationis hujus non in nuda qualitatum
       immutatione, alteratione seu innovatione, sed in ipsius substantiæ
       mundi totali abolitione et in nihilum reductione consistit.
     * [1829]Formam consummationis dicimus fore non nudam qualitatum
       alterationem, sed ipsius substantiæ abolitionem, adeoque totalem
       annihilationem, ut sic terminus a quo consummationis sive
       destructionis sit esse,' terminus vero ad quem non esse' sive
       nihil.
     * [1830]Gratiæ promissione opus est, qua nobis testificetur se
       propitium esse Patrem: quando nec aliter ad eum appropinquare
       possumus, et in eam solam reclinare cor hominis potest. . . . .
       Nunc justa fidei definitio nobis constabit, si dicamus esse divinæ
       erga nos benevolentiæ firmam certamque cognitionem, quæ gratuitæ in
       Christo promissionis veritate fundata, per Spiritum Sanctum et
       revelatur mentibus nostris et cordibus obsignatur.
     * [1831]Gratiam, vero, quæ naturalem illum amorem perficeret, et
       indissolubilem unitatem confirmaret, conjugesque sanctificaret,
       ipse Christus, venerabilium sacramentorum institutor, atque
       perfector, sua nobis passione promeruit.
     * [1832]Hæc autem, quæ nobis imputatur, non est Christi justitia; nus
       quam enim Scriptura docet, Christi justitiam nobis imputari; sed
       tantum fidem nobis imputari in justitiam, et quidem propter
       Christum.
     * [1833]Hæc porro veritas est corollarium dogmatis de
       transubstantione; panis enim et vinum per consecrationem
       convertuntur in illud Christi corpus et sanguinem, qui in coelis
       est, et in eodem statu glorioso; jam vero corpus illud inseparabile
       est a sanguine, anima et divinitate, et e converso pariter sanguis
       separari nequit a corpore, anima, et divinitate, ergo sub quavis
       specie totus Christus præsens fiat necesse est.
     * [1834]Habet communis catholicorum omnium sententia, opera bona
       justorum vere, ac proprie esse merita, et merita non cujuscunque
       præmii, sed ipsius vitæ æternæ.
     * [1835]Habet communis catholicorum omnium sententia, opera bona
       justorum vere, ac proprie esse merita, et merita non cujuscunque
       premii, sed ipsius vitæ æternæ.
     * [1836]Habita est ratio rectissima charitatis, ut homines quibus
       esset utilis atque honesta concordia, diversarum necessitudinum
       vinculis necterentur; nec unus in uno multas haberet, sed singulæ
       spargerentur in singulos; ac sic ad socialem vitam diligentius
       colligandam plurimæ plurimos obtinerent.
     * [1837]Hanc Dei gratiam esse initium, progressum ac perfectionem
       omnis boni, atque id eo quidem usque ut ipse homo regenitus absque
       hac præcedentia, sen adventitia excitante, consequente et
       cooperante gratia, neque boni quid cogitare, velle, aut facere
       possit, neque etiam ulli malæ tentatione resistere; adeo quidem ut
       omnia bona opera, quæ excogitare possumus, Dei gratiæ in Christo
       tribuenda sint; quod vero modum operationis illius gratiæ, illa non
       irresistibilis; de multis enim dicitur eos Spiritui Sancto
       resistere, Act. vii. 51
     * [1838]Hic actus fidei non rerum evidentia aut causarum et
       proprietatum notitia, sed Dei dicentis infallibili auctoritate.
     * [1839]Hic articulus, de justitia fidei, præcipuus est (ut Apologia
       loquitur) in tota doctrina Christiana, sine quo conscientiæ
       perturbatæ nullam veram et firmam consolationem habere, aut
       divitias gratiæ Christi recte agnoscere possunt. Id D. Lutherus suo
       etiam testimonio confirmavit, cum inquit: Si unicus his articulus
       sincerus permanserit, etiam Christiana Ecclesia sincera, concors et
       sine omnibus sectis permanet: sin vero corrumpitur, impossibile
       est, ut uni errori aut fanatico spiritui recte obviam iri possit.
     * [1840]Hic autem, quod ad finem proximum attinet, diversitas
       occurrit, respectu subjectorum diversorum. Nam infantibus quidem
       æque omnibus per baptismum primum confertur et obsignatur fides,
       per quam meritum Christi illis applicetur: Adultis vero illis
       tantum, qui fidem ex verbo conceperunt ante baptismi susceptionem,
       baptismus eam obsignat et confirmat.
     * [1841]Hic præcipuus fidei cardo vertitur, ne quas Dominus offert
       misericordiæ promissiones, extra nos tantum veras esse arbitremur,
       in nobis minime: sed ut potius eas intus complectendo nostras
       faciamus. . . . . In summa, vere fidelis non est nisi qui solida
       persuasione Deum sibi propitium benevolumque patrem esse persuasus,
       de ejus benignitate omnia sibi pollicetur: nisi qui divinæ erga se
       benevolentiæ promissionibus fretus, indubitatam salutis
       expectationem præsumit.
     * [1842]Hinc apparet, quam nihil signa sint, nisi fidei exercendæ
       mnemosuna
     * [1843]Hoc argumentum, si quid probat, probat justitiam actualem non
       esse perfectam: non autem probat, justitiam habitualem, qua
       formaliter justi sumus, . . . . non esse ita perfectam, ut
       absolute, simpliciter, et proprie justi nominemur, et simus. Non
       enim formaliter justi sumus opere nostro, sed opere Dei, qui simul
       maculas peccatorum tergit, et habitum fidei, spei, et caritatis
       infundit. Dei autem perfecta sunt opera. . . . . Unde parvuli
       baptizati, vere justi sunt, quamvis nihil operis fecerint.
     * [1844]Hoc modo non tantum refutatur Papistarum commentum de
       transubstantione, sed crassa omnia figmenta atque futiles argutiæ,
       quæ vel coelesti ejus gloriæ detrahunt vel veritati humanæ naturæ
       minus sunt consentaneæ. Neque enim minus absurdum judicamus,
       Christus sub pane locare vel cum pane copulare, quam panem
       transubstantiare in corpus ejus.
     * [1845]Hoc primum tradere oportet, peccatum sive a primis parentibus
       origine contractum, sive a nobis commissum, quamvis etiam adeo
       nefarium sit, ut ne cogitari quidem posse videatur, admirabili
       hujus sacramenti virtute remitti, et condonari.
     * [1846]Hominem vero salutarem fidem a se ipso non habere, nec vi
       liberi sui arbitrii, quandoquidem in statu defectionis et peccati
       nihil boni, quandoquidem vere bonum est, quale quid est fides
       salutaris, ex se possit cogitare, vel facere: sed necessarium esse
       eum a Deo in Christo per Spiritum Sanctum regigni et renovari
       mente, affectibus, seu voluntate et omnibus facultatibus, ut
       aliquid boni possit intelligere, cogitare, velle et perficere. Ev.
       Joann. xv. 5
     * [1847]Homines non singulis quibusdam recte factis operibusque
       operatis, nec propter meritum quoddam iis attribuendum, sed sola
       vera fide, i.e
     * [1848]Hominis autem nondum renati intellectus et voluntas tantum
       sunt subjectum convertendum, sunt enim hominis spiritualiter mortui
       intellectus et voluntas, in quo homine Spiritus Sanctus
       conversionem et renovationem operatur, ad quod opus hominis
       convertendi voluntas nihil confert, sed patitur, ut Deus in ipsa
       operetur, donec regeneretur. Postea vero in aliis sequentibus bonis
       operibus Spiritui Sancto cooperatur, ea faciens, quæ Deo grata
       sunt.
     * [1849]Hujus justificationis causæ sunt, finalis quidem, gloria Dei
       et Christi, ac vita æterna: efficiens vero, misericors Deus, qui
       gratuito abluit et sanctificat, signans et ungens Spiritu
       promissionis sancto, . . . . meritoria autem dilectissimus
       unigenitus suus, Dominus noster, Jesus Christus, qui, cum essemus
       inimici, propter nimiam caritatem, qua dilexit nos, sua sanctissima
       passione in ligno crucis nobis justificationem [i.e
     * [1850]Hujus sacrificii eam vim esse, parochi docebunt, ut non solum
       immolanti, et sumenti prosit, sed omnibus etiam fidelibus, sive
       illi nobiscum in terris vivant, sive jam in Domino mortui, nondum
       plane expiati sint. Neque enim minus ex Apostolorum certissima
       traditione, pro his utiliter offertur, quam pro vivorum peccatis,
       poenis, satisfactionibus, ac quibusvis calamitatibus, et angustiis.
     * [1851]Id indicant hæc verba: Pro vobis datur; et: effunditur in
       remissionem peccatorum. Nempe nobis per verba illa in sacramento
       remissio peccatorum, vita, justitia et salus donentur. Ubi enim
       remissio peccatorum est, ibi est et vita et salus.
     * [1852]Idcirco approbamus Lactantii veteris, scriptoris sententiam,
       dicentis, Non est dubium, quin religio nulla est, ubicunque
       simulachrum est.
     * [1853]Idem effectus est verbi et ritus, sicut præclare dictum est
       ab Augustino, sacramentum esse verbum visibile, quia ritus oculis
       accipitur, et est quasi pictura verbi, idem significans, quod
       verbum. Quare idem est utriusque effectus.
     * [1854]Igitur ut intelligamus, quid sit opus operatum, notandum est,
       in justificatione, quam recipit aliquis, dum percipit sacramenta,
       multa concurrere; nimirum ex parte Dei, voluntatem utendi illa re
       sensibili; ex parte Christi, passionem ejus; ex parte ministri
       potestatem, voluntatem, probitatem; ex parte suscipientis
       voluntatem, fidem, et poenitentiam; denique ex parte sacramenti
       ipsam actionem externam, quæ consurgit, ex debita applicatione
       formæ et materiæ. Cæterum ex his omnibus id, quod active, et
       proxime atque instrumentaliter efficit gratiam justificationis, est
       sola actio illa externa, quæ sacramentum dicitur, et hæc vocatur
       opus operatum, accipiendo passive (operatum) ita ut idem sit
       sacramentum conferre gratiam ex opere operato, quod conferre
       gratiam ex [vi] ipsius actionis sacramentalis a Deo ad hoc
       institutæ, non ex merito agentis vel suscipientis.
     * [1855]Illi qui ponunt quod sacramenta non causant gratiam, nisi per
       quandam concomitantiam ponunt quod in sacramento non sit aliqua
       virtus, quæ operetur ad sacramenti effectum, est tamen virtus
       divina sacramento assistens, quæ sacramentalem effectum operatur.
     * [1856]Imagines porro Christi, Deiparæ Virginis, et aliorum
       sanctorum, in templis præsertim habendas, et retinendas; eisque
       debitum honorem, et venerationem impertiendam; non quod credatur
       inesse aliqua in eis divinitas, vel virtus, propter quam sint
       colendæ; vel quod ab eis sit aliquid petendum; vel quod fiducia in
       imaginibus sit figenda; veluti olim fiebat a gentibus, quæ in
       idolis spem suam collocabant; sed quoniam honos, qui eis exhibetur
       refertur ad prototypa, quæ illæ representant: ita ut per imagines,
       quas osculamur, et coram quibus caput aperimus, et procumbimus,
       Christum adoremus; et sanctos, quorum illæ similitudinem gerunt,
       veneremur.
     * [1857]Impossibile est, ut res aliqua externa fidem hominis internam
       confirmet et stabiliat.
     * [1858]In coena domini naturale ac substantiale istud corpus
       Christi, quo et hic passus est et nunc in coelis ad dexteram patris
       sedet, non naturaliter atque per essentiam editur, sed
       spiritualiter tantum. . . . . Spiritualiter edere, corpus Christi,
       nihil est aliud quam spiritu ac mente niti misericordia et bonitate
       Dei per Christum. . . . . Sacramentaliter edere corpus Christi, cum
       proprie volumus loqui, est, adjuncto sacramento, mente ac spiritu
       corpus Christi edere.
     * [1859]In eo errant quam maxime, quod velint redemtionis pretium per
       omnia equivalens esse debere miseriæ illi, e qua redemtio fit:
       redemtionis pretium enim constitui solet pro libera æstimatione
       illius, qui captivum detinet, non autem solvi pro captivi
       merito. . . . . Ita pretium, quod Christus persolvit, juxta Dei
       Patris æstimationem persolutum est.
     * [1860]In eo qui credit, duo sunt, apprehensio et judicium, sive
       assensus: sed apprehensio non est fides, sed aliud fidem præcedens.
       Possunt enim infideles apprehendere mysteria fidei. Præterea,
       apprehensio non dicitur proprie notitia. . . . . Mysteria fidei,
       quæ rationem superant, credimus, non intelligimus, ac per hoc fides
       distingintur contra scientiam, et melius per ignorantiam, quam per
       notitiam definitur.
     * [1861]In numeris non sum Pythagoricus.
     * [1862]In renatis nihil odit Deus, quia nihil est damnationis iis,
       qui vere consepulti sunt cum Christo per baptisma in mortem: qui
       non secundum carnem ambulant, sed veterem hominem exuentes, et
       novum, qui secundum Deum creatus est, induentes, innocentes,
       immaculati, puri, innoxii, ac Deo dilecti effecti sunt.
     * [1863]In sacramentis novæ legis non per se requiritur, quod homo se
       disponat: ergo per ipsum sacramentum disponitur.
     * [1864]In summa, quicquid Deus in nobis facit et operatur, tantum
       externis istius modi rebus et constitutionibus operari dignatur.
     * [1865]Indebitum

       child is in imminent peril, baptize it in utero
     * [1867]Infantibus baptismus principaliter est medium ordinarium
       regenerationis et mundationis a peccatis, etc. Secundario autem
       sigillum justitiæ et fidei confirmatio; adultis credentibus
       baptismus principaliter præstat usum obsignationis ac
       testificationis de gratia Dei, huiothesia
     * [1868]Infantibus quidem æque omnibus per baptismum primum confertur
       et obsignatur fides, per quam meritum Christi applicatur. Adultis
       vero illis tantum, qui fidem ex verbo conceperunt ante baptismi
       susceptionem, baptismus eam obsignat et confirmat.
     * [1869]Inferi
     * [1870]Intellige ut credas
     * [1871]Interrogatus, quid baptismus sit? ita responde: non esse
       prorsus aquam simplicem, sed ejusmodi, quæ verbo et præcepto Dei
       comprehensa, et illi inclusa sit, et per hoc sanctificata ita ut
       nihil aliud sit, quam Dei seu divina aqua.
     * [1872]Invocandi sunt [angeli eorum]; quod et perpetuo Deum
       intuentur et patrocinium salutis nostræ, sibi delatum, libentissime
       suscipiunt.
     * [1873]Ipsi duplicem faciunt fidem, informem et formatam, hanc
       pestilentissimam et satanicam glossam non possum non vehementer
       detestari.
     * [1874]Ista fratres dicuntur sacramenta, quia in eis aliud videtur,
       aliud intelligitur. Quod videtur speciem habet corporalem, quod
       intelligitur, fructum habet spiritualem.
     * [1875]Itaque utendum est sacramentum ita, ut fides accedat, quæ
       credat promissionibus, quæ per sacramenta exhibentur et
       ostenduntur. Damnant igitur illos, qui docent, quod sacramenta, ex
       opere operato justificent, nec docent fidem requiri in usu
       sacramentorum, quæ credat remitti peccata.
     * [1876]Ite, missa est
     * [1877]Jam vero sacramenta gratiam, quam significant, continere,
       eamque conferre virtute sibi insita, seu ex opere operato,
       Scripturæ, patres, constansque Ecclesiæ sensus traditionalis
       luculentissime docent.
     * [1878]Jus dispensandi sacramenta Deus concredidit ecclesiæ, quæ
       exsecutionem aut exercitium hujus juris, observandi ordinis et
       euschemosunes
     * [1879]Justificare hoc loco (Rom. v. 1
     * [1880]Justificare significat Apostolo in disputatione de
       justificatione, peccata remittere, a culpa et poena absolvere, in
       gratiam recipere, et justum pronunciare. Etenim ad Romanos dicit
       apostolus, Deus est, qui justificat, quis ille, qui condemnet?'
       opponuntur justificare et condemnare. . . . . Etenim Christus
       peccata mundi in se recepit et sustulit, divinæque justitiæ
       satisfecit. Deus ergo propter solum Christum passum et
       resuscitatum, propitius est peccatis nostris, nec illa nobis
       imputat, imputat autem justitiam Christi pro nostra: ita ut jam
       simus non solum mundati a peccatis et purgati, vel sancti, sed
       etiam donati justitia Christi, adeoque absoluti a peccatis, morte
       vel condemnatione, justi denique ac hæredes vitæ æternæ. Proprie
       ergo loquendo, Deus solus nos justificat, et duntaxat propter
       Christum justificat, non imputans nobis peccata, sed imputans ejus
       nobis justitiam.
     * [1881]Justificari significat hic non ex impio justum effici, sed
       usu forensi justum pronuntiari.
     * [1882]Justificatio . . . non est sola peccatorum remissio, sed et
       sanctificatio, et renovatio interioris hominis per voluntariam
       susceptionem gratiæ, et donorum, unde homo ex injusto fit justus,
       et ex inimico amicus, ut sit heres secundum spem vitæ æternæ.
     * [1883]Justificatio . . . . non est sola peccatorum remissio, sed et
       sanctificatio, et renovatio interioris hominis per voluntariam
       susceptionem gratiæ et donorum. . . . . Quanquam nemo possit esse
       justus, nisi cui merita passionis Domini nostri Jesu Christi
       communicantur: id tamen in hac impii justificatione fit, dum
       ejusdem sanctissimæ passionis merito per Spiritum Sanctum caritas
       Dei diffunditur in cordibus eorum, qui justificantur, atque ipsis
       inhæret.
     * [1884]Justificatio est actio Dei, quam Deus pure pute in sua ipsius
       mente efficit, quia nihil aliud est, quam volitio aut decretum, quo
       peccata remittere, et justitiam imputare aliquando vult iis, qui
       credunt, id est, quo vult poenas, peccatis eorum promeritas, iis
       non infligere, eosque tanquam justos tractare et premio afficere.
     * [1885]Justificatio est actus forensis, quo Deus, sola gratia
       ductus, peccatori, propter Christi meritum fide apprehensum,
       justitiam Christi imputat, peccata remittit, eumque sibi
       reconciliat.
     * [1886]Justitia enim actualis, quamvis aliquo modo sit imperfecta,
       propter admixtionem venalium delictorum, et egeat quotidiana
       remissione peccati, tamen non propterea desinit esse vera justitia,
       et suo etiam quodam modo perfecta.
     * [1887]Lex Dei credentibus bona opera ad eum modum præscribit, ut
       simul, tanquam in speculo, nobis commonstret, ea omnia in nobis in
       hac vita adhuc imperfecta et impura esse

       fideles diligenter instruant, docentes eos, sanctos, una cum
       Christo regnantes, orationes suas pro hominibus Deo offerre; bonum,
       atque utile esse suppliciter eos invocare; et ob beneficia
       impetranda a Deo per filium ejus Jesus Christum, Dominum nostrum,
       qui solus noster redemptor et salvator est, ad eorum orationes,
       opem auxiliumque confugere: illos vero, qui negant sanctos, æterna
       felicitate in coelo fruentes, invocandos esse; aut qui asserunt,
       vel illos pro hominibus non orare; vel eorum, ut pro nobis etiam
       singulis orent, invocationem esse idolatriam; vel pugnare cum verbo
       Dei; adversarique honori unius mediatoris Dei et hominum Jesu
       Christi; vel stultum esse in coelo regnantibus voce, vel mente
       supplicare; impie sentire.
     * [1893]Manducare et bibere ista certe non efficiunt, sed illa verba,
       quæ hic ponuntur: Pro vobis datur, et: Effunditur in remissionem
       peccatorum; quæ verba sunt una cum corporali manducatione caput et
       summa hujus sacramenti. Et qui credit his verbis, ille habet, quod
       dicunt, et sicut sonant, nempe remissionem peccatorum.
     * [1894]Matrimonium est viri, et mulieris maritalis conjunctio inter
       legitimas personas, individuam vitæ consuetudinem retinens.
     * [1895]Maxima virtus maxime justificat. Dilectio est maxima virtus.
       Ergo maxime justificat.
     * [1896]Mendacium efficiosum peccatum venale est, per se, quia in eo
       gravis deordinatio non apprehenditus.
     * [1897]Mendacium officiosum dicitur, quod committitur solum causa
       utilitatis propriæ vel alienæ: v. g. quis dicit, se non habere
       pecunias, ne iis spolietur a militibus.
     * [1898]Missa
     * [1899]Nam pro defunctis quibusdam, vel ipsius Ecclesiæ, vel
       quorumdam piorum exauditur oratio: sed pro his quorum in Christo
       regeneratorum nec usque adeo vita in corpore male gesta est ut tali
       misericordia judicentur digni non esse, nec usque adeo bene, ut
       talem misercordiam reperiantur necessariam non habere. Sicut etiam
       facta resurrectione mortuorum non deerunt quibus post poenas, quas
       patiuntur spiritas mortuorum, impertiatur misericordia, ut in ignem
       non mittantur æternum. Neque enim de quibusdam veraciter diceretur,
       quod non eis remittatur neque in hoc sæculo, neque, in futuro, nisi
       essent quibus, etsi non in isto, tamen remittetur in futuro.
     * [1900]Natus est Dei filius: non pudet quia pudendum est. Et mortuus
       est Dei filius: prorsus credibile est, quia ineptum est. Et
       sepultus, resurrexit: certum est, quia impossibile est.
     * [1901]Ne itaque ex eo, quod nunc signa non fiunt, argumentum ducas
       tunc etiam non fuisse. Etenim tunc utiliter fiebant, et nunc
       utiliter non fiunt.

       imperator omnium deus.
     * [1904]Nec vero baptismo nostro plus tribuere fas est, quam ipse
       alibi circumcisioni tribuit, quum vocat sigillum justitiæ fidei.'

       servi Zwinglius et Oecolampadius, verbulum in ea sententia
       mutarent.
     * [1906]Necessarium est homini accipere per modum fidei non solum ea,
       quæ sunt supra rationem: sed etiam ea, quæ per rationem cognosci
       possunt. Et hoc propter tria, Primo quidem, ut citius homo ad
       veritatis divinæ cognitionem perveniat. . . . . Secundo, ut
       cognitio Dei sit communior. Multi enim in studio scientiæ proficere
       non possunt. . . . . Tertio modo proptor certitudinem. Ratio enim
       humana in rebus divinis est multum deficiens.
     * [1907]Nemo autem dubitat mentiri eum qui volens falsum enuntiat
       causa fallendi: quapropter enuntiationem falsam cum voluntate ad
       fallendum prolatam, manifestum est esse mendacium.
     * [1908]Nempe eadem illa infinita virtus, quæ essentialiter, per se
       et independenter in Deo est, et per quam Deus nomines illuminat et
       convertit, verbo communicata est: et tanquam verbo communicata,
       divina tamen, hic spectari debet.
     * [1909]Nequaquam concedendum est, infantes, qui baptizantur, vel
       sine fide esse, vel in aliena fide baptizari. . . . . Aliena quidem
       vel parentum vel offerentium fides, parvulos ad Christum in
       baptismo adducit Marc. x. 13
     * [1910]Neque enim hoc sacramentum in substantiam nostram, ut panis,
       et vinum, mutatur; sed nos quodam modo in ejus naturam convertimur:
       ut recte illud D. Augustini ad hunc locum transferri possit
     * [1911]Neque sacramenta hilum proficere sine Spiritu Sancti virtute.
     * [1912]Nihilo splendidius de illis Apostolus quam de his loquitur,
       quum docet patres eandem nobiscum spiritualem escam manducasse; et
       escam illam Christum interpretatur.
     * [1913]Nimis autem longum est, convenienter disputare de varietate
       signorum, quæ cum ad res divinas pertinent, sacramenta appellantur.
     * [1914]Nobis inferi non nuda cavositas, nec subdivalis aliqua mundi

     * [1917]Non enim Deus verborum tantum actuumque nostrorum discussor
       et judex, sed etiam propositi ac destinationis inspector
       est. . . . . Ille tamen intimam cordis inspiciens pietatem, non
       verborum sonum, sed votum dijudicat voluntatis, quia finis, operis
       et affectus considerandus est perpetrantis.
     * [1918]Non fides, de qua loquimur, assentit alicui, nisi quia est a
       Deo revelatum.
     * [1919]Non justificant signa, ut Apostolus ait, Circumcisio nihil
       est: ita baptismus nihil est. Participatio mensæ Domini nihil est:
       sed testes sunt kai sphragides
     * [1920]Non liberari potest ecclesia a servitute laicorum, nisi
       liberentur clerici ab uxoribus.
     * [1921]Non licet a sanctis petere, ut nobis tanquam auctores
       divinorum beneficiorum, gloriam, vel gratiam aliaque ad
       beatitudinem media concedunt.
     * [1922]Non multo post Apostoli mortem exorti sunt Encratitæ (qui
       nomen sibi a continentia indiderunt) Taciani; Cathari; Montanus cum
       sua secta, et tandem Manichæi, qui ab esu carnium et conjugio
       abhorrerent, et tanquam res profanas damnarent. . . . . Excipiunt
       [Papistæ] se Encratitis et Manichæis esse dissimiles, quia non
       simpliciter usum conjugii et carnium interdicunt, sed certis tantum
       diebus cogunt ad carnis abstinentiam, solos autem monachos et
       sacerdotes cum monialibus ad votum coelibatus cogunt. Verum
       hæc. . . . . nimis frivola est excusatio. Nam sanctimoniam nihilo
       minus in his rebus locant; deinde falsum et adulterinum Dei cultum
       instituunt: postrema conscientias alligant necessitati, a qua
       debebant esse liberæ.
     * [1923]Non negamus recta nos fide caritateque sincera Christo
       spiritualiter conjungi; sed nullam nobis conjunctionis rationem
       secundum carnem cum illo esse, id profecto pernegamus, idque a
       divinis Scripturis omnino alienam dicimus.
     * [1924]Non quæritur, An fides sit scientia, quæ habeat evidentiam:
       Sic enim distinguitur a scientia, quæ habet assensum certum et
       evidentem, qui nititur ratione clara et certa, et ab opinione, quæ
       nititur ratione tantum probabili; ubi fides notat assensum certum
       quidem, sed inevidentem, qui non ratione, sed testimonio divino
       nititur.
     * [1925]Non quod dignitate meæ fidei Deo placeam, sed quod sola
       satisfactio, justitia ac sanctitas Christi, mea justitia sit coram
       Deo. Ego vero eam non alia ratione, quam fide amplecti, et mihi
       applicare queam.
     * [1926]Non solum sanctos Christi loco adorant, sed etiam eorum ossa,
       vestes, calceos, et simulacra
     * [1927]Non tollit efficaciam sacramenti error ministri circa
       ecclesiam, sed do fectus intentionis.
     * [1928]Nonus articulus approbatus est, in quo confitemur, quod
       baptismus sit necessarius ad salutem, et quod pueri sint
       baptizandi, et quod baptismus puerorum non sit irritus, sed
       necessarius et efficax ad salutem.
     * [1929]Nos non de modo fidei sumus solliciti, sed in illa
       simplicitate acquiescimus, quod infantes vere credant.
     * [1930]Nos præter illam fidem [fidem generalem] requirimus, ut
       credat sibi quisque remitti peccata.
     * [1931]Nota, Apostolum permittere hoc casu non tantum thori
       divortium sed etiam matrimonii; ita ut possit conjux fidelis aliud
       matrimonium inire.
     * [1932]Nullibi docet Scriptura justitiam Christi nobis imputari. Et
       id absurdum est. Nemo enim in se injustus aliena justitia potest
       esse formaliter justus, non magis, quam aliena albedine Æthiops
       esse albus.
     * [1933]Nullum unquam exstitisse pii hominis opus, quod, si severo
       Dei judicio examinaretur, non esset damnabile.
     * [1934]Nuoit genero socrus. . . . . O mulieris incredibile et præter
       hanc unam in omni vita inauditum!
     * [1935]O quoties ego ipso in eremo constitutus in illa vasta
       solitudine, quæ exusta solis ardoribus, horridum monachis præstat
       habitaculum, putavi me Romanis interesse deliciis. . . . . Ille
       igitur ego, qui ob Gehennæ metum tali me carcere ipse damnaveram,
       scorpiorum tantum socius et ferarum, sæpe choris intereram
       puellarum. Pallebant ora jejuniis, et mens desideriis æstuabat in
       frigido corpore, et ante hominem sua jam in carne præmortuum, sola
       libidinum incendia bulliebant.
     * [1936]Obsignantur hæc omnia baptismo. Nam intus regeneramur,
       purificamaur, et renovamur a Deo per Spiritum Sanctum: foris autem
       accipimus obsignationem maximorum donorum, in aqua, qua etiam
       maxima illa beneficia representantur, et veluti oculis nostris
       conspicienda proponuntur.
     * [1937]Officiosum autem et jocosum sunt ex genere suo peccatum
       veniale.
     * [1938]Omnes horribiliter errant. Primo, quia verbum justificare
       tantum pro justum reputare et pronunciare intelligunt, atque
       interpretantur, et non pro eo, quod est, reipsa et in veritate
       justum efficere. Deinde etiam in hoc quod nullam differentiam
       tenent inter redemptionem et justificationem, quum tamen magna
       differentia sit, sicut vel inde intelligi sit, quod homines furem a
       suspendio redimere possunt, bonum et justum efficere non possunt.
       Porro etiam in hoc, quod nihil certe statuere possunt, quid tandem
       justitia Christi sit, quam per fidem in nobis esse, nobisque
       imputari oporteat. Ac postremo errant omnium rudissime etiam in
       hoc, quod divinam naturam Christi a justificatione separant, et
       Christum dividunt atque solvunt, id quod haud dubie execrandi
       Satanæ opus est.
     * [1939]Omnes hujus dicti capaces esse negans, significat electionem
       non esse positam in manu nostra, acsi de re nobis subjecta esset
       consultatio. Si quis utile sibi esse putat uxore carere, atque ita
       nullo examine habito, coelibatus legem sibi edicit, longe fallitur.
       Deus enim, qui pronuntiavit bonum esse, ut viro adjutrix sit
       mulier, contempti sui ordinis poenam exiget: quia nimium sibi
       arrogant mortales, dum se a coelesti vocatione eximere tentant.
       Porro non esse omnibus liberum, eligere utrum libuerit, inde probat
       Christus, quia speciale sit continentiæ donum: nam quum dicit, non
       omnes esse capaces, sed quibus datum est, clare demonstrat non
       omnibus esse datum.
     * [1940]Omnia non legitima nec rite concepta, ut apud Deum nihili
       sunt, sic nobis irrita esse debere.
     * [1941]Omnium dogmatum firmitas pendet ab auctoritate præsentis
       ecclesiæ.
     * [1942]Oportet, quod virtus salutifera a divinitate Christi per ejus
       humanitatem in ipsa sacramenta derivetur. . . . . Sacramenta
       ecelesiæ specialiter habent virtutem ex passione Christi, cujus
       virtus quodammodo nobis copulatur per susceptionem sacramentorum.
     * [1943]Ordo sacer et sacramentum divinitus institutum, quo tribuitur
       potestas consecrandi corpus et sanguinem Domini, nec non remittendi
       et retinendi peccata.
     * [1944]Ossa, nervi, et quæcumque ad hominis perfectionem pertinent.
     * [1945]Poena enim omnis propositum habet bonum commune.
     * [1946]Poena purgatorii," says the angelic Doctor,See Aquinas, Summa
     * [1947]Poenas infligere, aut a poenis aliquem liberare, quem punire
       possis, quod justificare vocat Scriptura, non est nisi rectoris,
       qua talis primo et per se: ut, puta, in familia patris; in
       republica regis, in universo Dei. . . . . Unde sequitur, omnino hic
       Deum considerandum, ut rectorem.
     * [1948]Peccata venalia per se tam esse minuta et levia, ut non
       adversentur perfectioni caritatis, nec impedire possint perfectam
       et absolutam legis obedientiam: utpote quæ non sint ira Dei et
       condemnatione, sed venia digna, etiamsi Deus cum illis in judicium
       intret.
     * [1949]Peccatores, te rogamus audi nos; Ut sanctam Ecclesiam
       piissima conservare digneris, Ut justis gloriam, peccatoribus
       gratiam impetrare digneris, Ut navigantibus portum, infirmantibus
       sanitatem, tribulatis consolationem, captivis liberationem,
       impetrare digneris, Ut famulos et famulas tuas tibi devote
       servientes, consolare digneris, Ut cunctum populum Christianum
       filii tui pretioso sanguine redemptum, conservare digneris, Ut
       cunctis fidelibus defunctis, eternam requiem impetrare digneris, Ut
       nos exaudire digneris, Mater Dei, Filia Dei, Sponsa Dei, Mater
       carissima, Domina nostra, miserere, et dona nobis perpetuam pacem.
     * [1950]Pelli sane potent in desertam ecclesia, regnante Antichristi,
       et illo momento temporis in deserta, id est, in locis abitis, in
       speluncis, in latibulis quo sancti se recipient, non incommode
       quæretur ecclesia.
     * [1951]Per D. N. J. C. gratiam, quæ in baptismo confertur, reatus
       originalis peccati remittitur, ac tollitur totum id, quod veram et
       propriam peccati rationem habet.
     * [1952]Placuit picturas in ecclesia esse non debere; ne quod colitur
       et adoratur in parietibus depingatur.
     * [1953]Poena originalis peccati est carentia visionis Dei, actualis
       vero poena peccati est gehennæ perpetuæ cruciatus.
     * [1954]Ponendo quod sacramentum est instrumentalis causa gratiæ,
       necesse est simul ponere, quod in sacramento sit quædam virtus
       instrumentalis ad inducendum sacramentalem effectum. . . . . Sicut
       virtus instrumentalis acquiritur instrumento, ex hoc ipso quod
       movetur ab agente principali, ita et sacramentum consequitur
       spiritualem virtutem ex benedictione Christi et applicatione
       ministri ad usum sacramenti.
     * [1955]Populus vult decipi
     * [1956]Porro ne impingamus in ipso limine (quod fieret si de re
       incognita disputationem ingrediremur) primum explicemus quid sibi
       velint istæ loquutiones, Hominem coram Deo justificari, Fide
       justificari, vel operibus. Justificari coram Deo dicitur qui
       judicio Dei et censetur justus, et acceptus est ob suam justitiam:
       siqui dem ut Deo abominabilis est iniquitas, ita nec peccator in
       ejus oculis potest invenire gratiam, quatenus est peccator, et
       quamdiu talis censetur. Proinde ubicunque peccatum est, illic etiam
       se profert ira et ultio Dei. Justificatur autem qui non loco
       peccatoris, sed justi habetur, eoque nomine consistit coram Dei
       tribunali, ubi peccatores omnes corruunt. Quemadmodum si reus
       innocens ad tribunal æqui judicis adducatur, ubi secundum
       innocentiam ejus judicatum fuerit, justificatus apud judicem
       dicitur: sic apud Deum justificatur, qui numero peccatorum
       exemptus, Deum habet suæ justitiæ testem et assertorem.
       Justificari, ergo, operibus ea ratione dicetur, in cujus vita
       reperietur ea puritas ac sanctitas quæ testimonium justitiæ apud
       Dei thronum mereatur: seu qui operum suorum integritate respondere
       et satisfacere illius judicio queat. Contra, justificabitur ille
       fide, qui operum justitia exclusus, Christi justitiam per fidem
       apprehendit, qua vestitus in Dei conspectu non ut peccator, sed
       tanquam justus apparet. Ita nos justificationem simpliciter
       interpretamur acceptionem, qua nos Deus in gratiam receptos pro
       justos habet. Eamque in peccatorum remissione ac justitiæ Christi
       imputatione positam ease dicimus.
     * [1957]Potest dividi mendacium, in quantum habet rationem culpæ,
       secundum ea quæ aggravant, vel diminuunt culpam mendacii ex parte
       finis intenti. Aggravat autem culpam mendacii, si aliquis per
       mendacium intendat alterius nocumentum: quod vocatur mendacium
       perniciosum. Diminuitur autem culpa mendacii, si ordinetur ad
       aliquod bonum, vel delectabile, et sic est mendacium jocosum: vel
       utile, et sic est mendacium officiosum, quo intenditur juvamentum
       alterius, vel remotio nocumenti. Et secundum hoc dividitur
       mendacium in tria prædicta.
     * [1958]Præsertim vero tollenda est quælibet localis præsentiæ
       imaginatio. Nam quum signa hic in mundo sint, oculis cernantur,
       palpentur manibus: Christus quatenus homo est, non alibi quam in
       coelo, nec aliter quam mente et fidei intelligentia quærendus est.
       Quare perversa et impia superstitio est, ipsum sub elementis hujus
       mundi includere.
     * [1959]Præsertim vero tollenda est quælibet localis præsentiæ
       imaginatio. Nam quum signa hic in mundo sint, oculis cernuntur,
       palpentur manibus: Christus quatenus homo est, non alibi quam in
       coelo, nec aliter quam mente et fidei intelligentia quærendus est.
       Quare perversa et impia superstitio est, ipsum sub elementis hujus
       mundi includere.
     * [1960]Præter hæc justo Dei judicio relinquimus omnes curiosas,
       sannis virulentis tinctas, et blasphemas quæstiones, quæ honeste,
       pie et sine gravi offensione recitari nequeunt, aliosque sermones,
       quando de supernaturali et coelesti mysterio hujus sacramenti
       crasse, carnaliter, capernaitice, et plane abominandis modis,
       blaspheme, et maximo cum ecclesiæ offendiculo, Sacramentarii
       loquuntur.
     * [1961]Præter superiorem manducationem spiritualem, est et
       sacramentalis manducatio corporis Domini, qua fidelis non tantum
       spiritualiter et interne participat vero corpore et sanguine
       Domini, sed, foris etiam accedendo ad mensam Domini, accipit
       visibile corporis et sanguinis Domini sacramentum.
     * [1962]Præterea sedulo docemus, Deum non promiscue vim suam exerere
       in omnibus qui sacramenta recipiunt, sed tantum in electis. Nam
       quemadmodum non alios in fidem illuminat, quam quos preordinavit ad
       vitam: ita arcana Spiritus sui virtute efficit, ut percipiant
       electi quæ offerunt sacramenta.
     * [1963]Prima sententia, sive propositio. Imagines Christi, et
       sanctorum venerandæ sunt, non solum per accidens, vel improprie,
       sed etiam per se proprie, ita ut ipsæ terminent venerationem ut in
       se considerantur, et non solum ut vicem gerunt exemplaris.
     * [1964]Prima, quod imago non sit ullo modo in se colenda, sed solum
       coram imagine colendum exemplar.
     * [1965]Primum quia cum alii mediatores præter Christum quæruntur,
       collocatur fiducia in alios, obruitur tota notitia Christi, idque
       res ostendit. Videtur initio mentio sanctorum, qualis est in
       veteribus orationibus, tolerabili consilio recepta esse. Postea
       secuta est invocatio, invocationem prodigiosi et plus quam ethnici
       abusus secuti sunt. Ab invocatione ad imagines ventum est, hæ
       quoque colebantur, et putabatur eis inesse quædam vis, sicut Magi
       vim inesse fingunt imaginibus signorum coelestium certo tempore
       sculptis.
     * [1966]Primum, mors Christi nos justificat, dum per eam excitatur
       caritas in cordibus nostris, qua justi efficimur: deinde quod per
       eandem exstinctum est peccatum; quo nos captivos distinebat
       diabolus, ut jam non habeat unde nos damnet.
     * [1967]Principaliter competit summo Pontifici; non tamen nisi ex
       rationabili causa, quia dispensat in jure alieno: competit etiam
       jure ordinario Episcopis, non Parochis. Requirit autem hæc
       dispensatio potestatem jurisdictionis majoris.
     * [1968]Proinde Jesum Christum mundi servatorem pro omnibus et
       singulis mortuum esse, atque ita quidem, ut omnibus per mortem
       Christi reconciliationem et peccatorum remissionem impetravit: ea
       tamen conditione, ut nemo illa remissione peccatorum re ipsa
       fruatur, præter hominem fidelem, et hoc quoque secundum Evang.
       Joann. iii. 16
     * [1969]Proinde meminerint lectores, fuisse me de monachismo potius
       quam de monachis loquutum, et ea vitia notasse, non quæ in paucorum
       vita hærent, sed quæ ab ipso vivendi instituto separari nequeunt.
     * [1970]Proinde, qui in solennibus Coenæ verbis, Hoc est corpus meum,
       Hic est sanguis meus: præcise literalem, ut loquuntur, sensum
       urgent, eos tanquam præposteros interpretes repudiamus. Nam extra
       controversiam ponimus, figurate accipienda esse, ut esse panis et
       vinum dicantur id quod significant. Neque vero novum hoc aut
       insolens videri debet, ut per metonymiam ad signum transferatur rei
       figuratæ nomen, quum passim in Scripturis ejusmodi locutiones
       occurrant: et nos sic loquendo nihil asserimus, quod non apud
       vetustissimos quosque et probatissimos Ecclesiæ scriptores extet.
     * [1971]Prorsus credibile est, quia ineptum est; . . . . certum est,
       quia impossibile est.
     * [1972]Prudentia quoque hoc nomine rectorem ad poenam incitat.
       Augetur præterea causa puniendi, ubi lex aliqua publicata est, quæ
       poenam minatur. Nam tunc omissio poenæ ferme aliquid detrahit de
       legis authoritate apud subditos.
     * [1973]Pura et vera doctrina nostrarum Ecclesiarum de Sacra Coena.
       (1.) Quod verba Christi: Accipite et comedite, hoc est corpus meum:
       Bibite, hic est sanguis meus simpliciter, et secundum literam,
       sicut sonant, intelligenda sint. (2.) Quod in sacramento duæ res
       sint, quæ exhibentur et simul accipiuntur: una terrena, quæ est
       panis et vinum; et una coelestis, quæ est corpus et sanguis
       Christi. (3.) Quod hæc unio, exhibitio et sumptio fiat hic inferius
       in terris, non superius in coelis. (4.) Quod exhibeatur et
       accipiatur verum et naturale corpus Christi, quod in cruce
       pependit, et verus ac naturalis sanguis, qui ex Christi latere
       fluxit. (5.) Quod corpus et sanguis Christi non fide tantum
       spiritualiter, quod etiam extra coenam fieri potest, sed cum pane
       et vino oraliter, modo tamen imperscrutabill, et supernaturali,
       illic in coena accipiantur, idque in pignus et certificationem
       resurrectionis nostrorum corporum ex mortuis. (6.) Quod oralis
       perceptio corporis et sanguinis Christi non solum fiat a dignis,
       verum etiam ab indignis, qui sine poenitentia et vera fide
       accedunt; eventu tamen diverso. A dignis enim percipitur ad
       salutem, ab indignis autem ad judicium.
     * [1974]Quæ enim justitia nostra dicitur, quia per eam nobis
       inhærentem justificamur; illa eadem Dei est, quia a Deo nobis
       infunditur per Christi meritum.
     * [1975]Quæ igitur fidei sunt, non sunt tentanda probare nisi per
       auctoritates his, qui auctoritates suscipiunt. Apud alios vero
       sufficit defendere non esse impossibile quod prædicat fides
     * [1976]Qualis futuris sit mundi interitus? An per ultimam
       conflagrationem sit annihilandus, an instaurandus et renovandus?
     * [1977]Quam vere in sacra coena præsens est res terrena, panis et
       vinum: tam vere etiam præsens res coelestis, corpus et sanguis
       Christi: proinde credimus, docemus et confitemur in eucharistiæ
       sacramento veram, realem et substantialem corporis et sanguinis
       Christi præsentiam, exhibitionem, manducationem et bibitionem, quæ
       præsentia non est essentialis conversio panis in corpus et vini in
       sanguinem Christi, quam transubstantionem vocant, neque est
       corporis ad panem, ac sanguinis ad vinum extra usum coenæ localis
       aut durabilis, neque est panis et corporis Christi personalis unio,
       qualis est divinæ et humanæ naturæ in Christo unio, neque est
       localis inclusio corporis in panem, neque est impanatio, neque est
       incorporatio in panem, neque est consubstantio, qua panis cum
       corpore Christi, et vinum cum ipsius sanguine in unam massam
       physicam coalescat: neque est naturalis inexistentia, neque
       delitescentia corpusculi sub pane, neque quidquam hujusmodi carnale
       aut physicum; sed est præsentia et unio sacramentalis, quæ ita
       comparata est, ut juxta ipsius salvaroris nostri, veracis,
       sapientis, et omnipotentis institutionem, pani benedicto tanquam
       medio divinitus ordinato corpus: et vino benedicto tanquam medio
       itidem divinitus ordinato, sanguis Christi modo nobis
       incomprehensibili uniatur, ut cum illo pane corpus Christi una
       manducatione sacramentali et cum illo vino sanguinem Christi una
       bibitione sacramentali in sublimi mysterio sumamus, manducemus ac
       bibamus. Breviter non apousian
     * [1978]Quamvis [Christus] nunc sit in coelis, ibidem etiam mansurus
       donec veniat mundum judicaturus: credimus tamen, eum arcana et
       incomprehensibili Spiritus sui virtute per fidem apprehensa, nos
       nutrire et vivificare sui corporis et sanguinis substantia. Dicimur
       autem hoc spiritualiter fieri, non ut efficaciæ et veritatis loco
       imaginationem aut cogitationem supponamus, sed potius, quoniam hoc
       mysterium nostræ cum Christo coalitionis tam sublime est, ut omnes
       nostros sensus totumque adeo ordinem naturæ superet: denique
       quoniam sit divinum ac coeleste, non nisi fide percipi ac
       apprehendi potest.
     * [1979]Quamvis baptismus sit fidei et resipiscentiæ sacramentum,
       tamen cum una cum parentibus posteritatem etiam illorum in ecclesia
       Deus recenseat, affirmamus, infantes sanctis parentibus natos, esse
       ex Christi authoritate baptizandos.
     * [1980]Quamvis peccata in baptismo remittantur, es tamen prorsus non
       tolli, aut radicitus evelli, sed quodam modo abradi, ita ut
       peccatorum radices animo infixæ adhuc remaneant.
     * [1981]Quanquam itaque effectus Verbi divini prædicati nonnunquam
       impediatur, efficacia tamen ipsa, seu virtus intrinseca a verbo
       tolli et separari non potest. Et ita per accidens fit inefficax,
       non potentiæ defectu, sed malitiæ motu, quo ejus operatio
       impeditur, quo minus effectum suum assequatur.
     * [1982]Quanquam solus Deus sit orandus, ut vel gratiam vel gloriam
       nobis donet; sanctos nihilominus viros orare expedit, ut illorum
       precibus et meritis, nostræ orationes sortiantur effectum.
     * [1983]Quantum ad me pertinet, juro, sed quantum mihi videtur, magna
       necessitate compulsus.
     * [1984]Quantum ad prima credibilia, quæ sunt articuli fidei, tenetur
       homo explicite credere. Quantum autem ad alia credibilia non
       tenetur homo explicite credere, sed solum implicite, vel in
       præparatione animi, in quantum paratus est credere quidquid divina
       Scriptura continet.
     * [1985]Quare hoc? Ideo, quod verba illic extant et hæc dant nobis.
       Siquidem propterea a Christo jubeor edere et bibere, ut meum sit,
       mihique utilitatem afferat, veluti certum pignus et arrhabo, imo
       potius res ipsa, quam pro peccatis meis, morte et omnibus malis
       ille opposuit et oppignoravit. Inde jure optimo cibus animæ
       dicitur, novum hominem alens atque fortificans.
     * [1986]Quare in hoc nobis est, constanter perseverandum, quod Deus
       non velit nobiscum aliter agere, nisi per vocale verbum et
       sacramenta, et quod, quidquid sine verbo et sacramentis jactatur,
       ut spiritus, sit ipse diabolus. Nam Deus etiam Mosi voluit apparere
       per rubum ardentem et vocale verbum. Et nullus propheta, sive
       Elias, sive Elisæus, Spiritum sine decalogo sive verbo vocali
       accepit.
     * [1987]Quare rei summam ita simplicissime complectere, hanc
       videlicet baptismi virtutem, opus, fructum et finem esse, ut
       homines salvos faciat. Nemo enim in hoc baptizatur, ut princeps
       evadat, verum sicut verba sonant, ut salvus fiat. Cæterum salvum
       fieri scimus nihil aliud esse, quam a peccati, mortis et diaboli
       tyrannide liberari, in Christi regnum deferri, ac cum eo immortalem
       vitam agere.
     * [1988]Quarta propositio. Imago per se, et proprie non est adoranda
       eodem cultu, quo ipsum exemplar, et proinde nulla imago est
       adoranda cultu latriæ per se, et proprie.
     * [1989]Qui Christum dicunt ubique ut hominem, Christum dicunt non
       hominem, dum enim dico ubique, dico Deum, qui solus est in coelo et
       in terra. Similiter cum dico subjectum legi, dico hominem. Qui ergo
       Christum subjectum legi negant, negant ipsum esse hominem.
     * [1990]Qui a nuptiarum conjunctione legibus omnino exclusi sunt, ii
       matrimonium inire non possunt; neque, si ineant, ratum est, exempli
       enim gratia: qui intra quartum gradum propinquitate conjuncti sunt,
       puerque ante decimum quartum annum, aut puella ante duodecimum, quæ
       ætas legibus constituta est, ad matrimonii justa foedera ineunda
       apti esse non possunt.
     * [1991]Qui annum putant hic notari per tempus, falluntur meo judicio
       . . . . Annus sumetur figurate pro tempore aliquo indeterminato.
     * [1992]Qui crediderit et baptizatus fuerit, salvus erit. Hoc est:
       sola fides personam dignam facit, ut hanc salutarem et divinam
       aquam utiliter suscipiat. Cum enim hoc in verbis una cum aqua nobis
       offeratur et proponatur, non alia ratione potest suscipi, quam ut
       hoc ex animo credamus. Citra fidem nihil prodest baptismus, tametsi
       per sese coelestis et inæstimabilis thesaurus esse negari non
       possit.
     * [1993]Qui defuncta uxore alteram jam coelebs inducit, nihilominus
       unius uxoris maritus censeri debet. Non enim eligendum docet qui
       fuerit maritus unius uxoris, sed qui sit.
     * [1994]Qui fit ut vivamus Christi fide? quia nos dilexit, et se
       ipsum tradidit pro nobis. Amor, inquam, quo nos complexus est
       Christus, fecit ut se nobis coadunaret. Id implevit morte sua nam
       se ipsum tradendo pro nobis, non secus atque in persona nostra
       passus est. . . . . Neque parum energiæ habet pro me: quia non
       satis fuerit Christum pro mundi salute mortuum reputare, nisi sibi
       quisque effectum ac possessionem hujus gratiæ privatim vindicet.
     * [1995]Qui potest aqua tam magnas res efficere?
     * [1996]Qui potest corporalis illa manducatio tantas res efficere?
     * [1997]Qui sit: non autem, Qui fuerit
     * [1998]Qui uxorem repudiat, quasi dimidiam sui partem a seipso
       avellit. Hoc autem minime patitur natura, ut corpus suum quisque
       discerpat.
     * [1999]Qui vero verbi Dei et doctrinæ Evangelicæ purificationem
       spreverit, tristibus et poenalibus purificationibus semetipsum
       reservat, ut iguis gehennæ in cruciatibus purget, quem nec
       apostolica doctrina nec evangelicus sermo purgavit.
     * [2000]Quia fides affert Spiritum Sanctum, et parit novam vitam in
       cordibus, necesse est, quod pariat spirituales motus in cordibus.
       Et qui sint illi motus, ostendit propheta, cum ait: Dabo legem meam
       in corda eorum.' Postquam igitur fide justificati et renati sumus,
       incipimus Deum timere, diligere, petere, et expectare ab eo
       auxilium. . . . . Incipimus et diligere proximos, quia corda habent
       spirituales et sanctos motus. Hæc non possunt fieri, nisi postquam
       fide justificati sumus et renati accipimus Spiritum
       Sanctum. . . . . Profitemur igitur, quod necesse est, inchoari in
       nobis et subinde magis magisque fieri legem. Et complectimur simul
       utrumque videlicet spirituales motus et externa bona opera. Falso
       igitur calumniantur nos adversarii, quod nostri non doceant bona
       opera, cum ea non solum requirant, sed etiam ostendant, quomodo
       fieri possint.
     * [2001]Quibus modis potest cessare obligatio juramenti promissorii?
     * [2002]Quibus verbis justificationis impii descriptio insinuatur, ut
       sit translatio ab eo statu, in quo homo nascitur filius primi Adæ,
       in statum gratiæ et adoptionis filiorum Dei, per secundum Adam
       Jesum Christum, salvatorem nostrum: quæ quidem translatio post
       evangelium promulgatum sine lavacro regenerationis, aut ejus voto
       fieri non potest.
     * [2003]Quicunque e vita turpi, qua poenas sibi contraxit, ad
       virtutem emerserit, is eadem proportione, qua jam in virtutis
       studio progressus fuerit, in gratiam cum Deo reversus, ab eodem
       præmiis dignus judicabitur.
     * [2004]Quicunque negat, parvulos per baptismum Christi a perditione
       liberari, et salutem percipere posse; anathema sit.
     * [2005]Quid ergo Athenis et Hierosolymis? quid Academiæ et Ecelesiæ?
       quid hæreticis et Christianis? Nostra institutio de portica
       Solomonis est, qui et ipse tradiderat: Dominum in simplicitate
       cordis esse quærendum. Viderint qui Stoicum, et Platonicum, et
       Dialecticum, Christianissimum protulerunt. Nobis curiositate opus
       non est post Christum Jesum, nec inquisitione post Evangelium. Cum
       credimus, nihil desideramus ultra credere. Hoc enim prius credimus,
       non esse quod ultra credere debeamus. . . . . Cedat curiositas
       fidei, cedat gloria saluti. Certe aut non obstrepant, aut quiescant
       adversus regulam. Nihil ulta scire, omnia scire est.
     * [2006]Quid est fides
     * [2007]Quid est sacramentum altaris? Responsio. Sacramentum altaris
       est verum corpus et verus sanguis Domini nostri Jesu Christi, sub
       pane et vino, nobis Christianis ad manducandum ac bibendum ab ipso
       Christo institutum. Quid vero prodest, sic comedisse et bibisse?
       Responsio. Id indicant nobis hæc verba: Pro vobis datur; et:
       Effunditur in remissionem peccatorum. Nempe quod nobis per verba
       illa in sacramento remissio peccatorum, vita, justitia et salus
       donentur. Ubi enim remissio peccatorum est, ibi est et vita et
       salus. Qui potest corporalis illa manducatio tantas res efficere?
       Responsio. Manducare et bibere ista certe non efficiunt, sed illa
       verba, quæ hic ponuntur: Pro vobis datur, et: Effunditur in
       remissionem peccatorum; quæ verba sunt una cum corporali
       manducatione caput et summa hujus sacramenti. Et qui credit his
       verbis, ille habet, quod dicunt, et sicut sonant, nempe remissionem
       peccatorum.
     * [2008]Quid est sacramentum? Externa divinæ erga nos benevolentiæ
       testificatio, quæ visibili signo spirituales gratias figurat, ad
       obsignandos cordibus nostris Dei promissiones, quo earum veritas
       melius confirmetur. . . . . Vim efficaciamque sacramenti non in
       externo elemento inclusam esse existimas, sed totam a Spiritu Dei
       manare? Sic sentio: nempe, ut virtutem suam exerere Domino
       placuerit per sua organa, quem in finem ea destinavit.
     * [2009]Quid vero prodest, sic comedisse et bibisse?
     * [2010]Quidquid in aliis scientiis invenitur veritati hujus scientiæ
       [sacræ doctrinæ] repugnans, totum condemnatur ut falsum.
     * [2011]Quin etiam illud pro certo constat, Christi corpus et
       sanguinem nequaquam rem otiosam et infrugiferam esse posse, quæ
       nihil fructus aut utilitatis afferat.
     * [2012]Quinque ex causis provenire, quod aliquid non sit apta
       materia voti; 1º. quia est impossibile; 2º. quia est necessarium;
       3º. quia est illicitum; 4º. quia est indifferens vel inutile; 5º.
       quia non est bonum melius.
     * [2013]Quinta conclusio, Cultus, qui per se, proprie debetur
       imaginibus, est cultus quidam imperfectus, qui analogice et
       reductive pertinet ad speciem ejus cultus, qui debetur exemplari.
     * [2014]Quod autem carnis suæ esu et sanguinis potione, quæ hic
       figurantur, Christus animas nostras per fidem Spiritus sancti
       virtute pascit, id non perinde accipiendum, quasi fiat aliqua
       substantiæ vel commixtio vel transfusio: sed quoniam ex carne semel
       in sacrificium oblata et sanguine in expiatione effuso vitam
       hauriamus.
     * [2015]Quod autem carnis suæ esu et sanguinis potione, quæ hic
       figurantur, Christus animas nostras per fidem Spiritus sancti
       virtute pascit, id non perinde accipiendum, quasi fiat aliqua
       substantiæ vel commixtio vel transfusio: sed quoniam ex carne semel
       in sacrificium oblata et sanguine in expiationem effuso vitam
       hauriamus.
     * [2016]Quod baptismus puerorum non sit irritus, sed necessarius et
       efficax ad salutem.
     * [2017]Quod deinde prosequimur, fidelibus spiritualium bonorum
       effectum quæ figurant sacramenta, extra eorum usum constare, quando
       et quotidie verum esse experimur et probatur Spirituræ testimoniis,
       mirum est si cui displiceat.
     * [2018]Quod si charitas est forma fidei, et fides non justificat
       formaliter, nisi ab ipsa caritate formata certe multo magis
       charitas ipsa justificat. . . . . Fides quæ agitur, ac movetur,
       formatur, et quasi animatur per dilectionem. . . . . Apostolus
       Paulus . . . . explicat dilectionem formam esse extrinsecam fidei
       non intrinsecam, quæ det illi, non ut sit, sed ut moveatur.
     * [2019]Quod verbum Dei non est falsum, aut mendax.
     * [2020]Quodsi expenderent illud Pauli, Corde creditur ad justitiam
       (Rom. x. 10
     * [2021]Ratio [cur rectori relaxare legem talem non liceat, nisi
       causa aliqua accedat, si non necessaria, certe sufficiens'] . . . .
       est, quod actus ferendi aut relaxandi legem non sit actus absoluti
       dominii, sed actus imperii, qui tendere debeat ad boni ordinis
       conservationem.
     * [2022]Reatus
     * [2023]Recte Apologia Augustanæ confessionis dicit, eundem esse
       effectum, eandem virtutem, seu efficaciam, et verbi et
       sacramentorum, quæ sunt sigilla promissionum. . . . . Sicut igitur
       Evangelium est potentia Dei ad salutem omni credenti: non quod
       magica quædam vis characteribus, syllabis, aut sono verborum
       inhæreat, sed quia est medium, organon seu instrumentum, per quod
       Spiritus Sanctus efficax est, proponens, offerens, exhibens,
       distribuens et applicans meritum Christi, et gratiam Dei, ad
       salutem omni credenti: ita etiam sacramentis tribuitur vis et
       efficacia: non quod in sacramentis extra sen præter meritum
       Christi, misericordiam Patris, et efficaciam Spiritus Sancti,
       quærenda sit gratia ad salutem; sed sacramenta sunt causæ
       instrumentales ita, quod per illa media seu organa, Pater vult
       gratiam suam exhibere, donare, applicare: Filius meritum suum
       communicare credentibus: Spiritus Sanctus efficaciam suam exercere,
       ad salutem omni credenti.
     * [2024]Redemtionis pretium constitui solet pro libera æstimatione
       illius, qui captivum detinet.
     * [2025]Rejicimus errorem eorum qui fingunt, Deum in conversione et
       regeneratione hominis substantiam et essentiam veteris Adami, et
       præcipue animam rationalem penitus abolere, novamque anima
       essentiam ex nihilo, in illa conversione et regeneratione creare.
     * [2026]Rejicimus non modo gentium idola, sed et Christianorum
       simulachra. Tametsi enim Christus humanam assumpserit naturam, non
       ideo tamen assumpsit, ut typum præferret statuariis atque
       pictoribus. . . . . Et quando beati spiritus et divi coelites, dum
       hic viverent, omnem cultum sui averterunt, et statuas oppugnarunt,
       cui verisimile videatur divis coelestibus et angelis suas placere
       imagines, ad quas genua flectunt homines, detegunt capita, allisque
       prosequuntur honoribus?
     * [2027]Reliquæ sanctorum refertæ multis mendaciis, ineptis et
       fatuitatibus. Canum et equorum ossa ibi sæpe reperta sunt.
     * [2028]Rem esse sensibus subjectam, quæ ex Dei institutione
       sanctitatis et justitiæ tum significandæ, tum efficiendæ vim habet.
     * [2029]Renovatio fit non quoad essentiam ut deliravit Illyricus, sed
       quoad qualitates inhærentes.
     * [2030]Restat, ut dicamus, Deum gratiam suam per sacramenta nobis
       exhibere, non eam actu per illa conferendo; sed per illa tanquam
       signa clara ac evidentia eam repræsentando et ob oculos ponendo non
       eminus aut sub figuris quibusdam tanquam multo post futuram, sed
       tanquam præsentem: ut ita in signis istis tanquam in speculo
       quodam, exhibitionem iliam gratiæ, quam Deus nobis concessit, quasi
       conspiciamus. Estque hæc efficacia nulla alia quam objectiva, quæ
       requirit facultatem cognitivam rite dispositam, ut apprehendere
       possit illud, quod signum objective menti offert. Hinc videmus,
       quomodo sacramenta in nobis operentur, nimirum tanquam signa
       repræsentantia menti nostræ rem cujus signa sunt. Neque alia in
       illis quæri debet efficacia.
     * [2031]Sacramenta Dei sunt prædicare, benedicere ac confirmare,
       communionem reddere, visitare infirmos, orare.
     * [2032]Sacramenta Judæorum in signis fuere diversa: in re quæ
       significatur, paria, diversa specie visibili, paria virtute
       spirituali.
     * [2033]Sacramenta cum dicimus, externas ecclesiæ ceremonias seu
       ritus illos sacros ac solennes intelligimus, quibus veluti
       foederalibus signis ac sigillis visibilibus Deus gratiosa beneficia
       sua, in foedere præsertim evangelico promissa, non modo nobis
       repræsentat et adumbrat, sed et certo modo exhibet atque obsignat:
       nosque vicissim palam publiceque declaramus ac testamur, nos
       promissiones omnes divinas vera, firma atque obsequiosa fide
       amplecti, et beneficia ipsius jugi et grata semper memoria
       celebrare velle.
     * [2034]Sacramentum
     * [2035]Sacramentum æs significat, quod poenæ nomine penditur, sive
       eo quis interrogatur sive contenditur.
     * [2036]Sacramentum dicitur conferre gratiam ex opere operato, ita
       quod ex eo ipso, quod opus illud, puta sacramentum, exhibitur, nisi
       impediat obex peccati mortalis, gratia confertur utentibus, sic
       quod præter exhibitionem signi foris exhibiti non requiritur bonus
       motus seu devotio interior in suscipiente.
     * [2037]Sacramentum enim sine re sacramenti sumenti mors est: res
       vero sacramenti, etiam, præter sacramentum, sumenti vita æterna
       est.
     * [2038]Sacramentum est invisibilis gratiæ visibilis forma.
     * [2039]Sacramentum hoc magnum est
     * [2040]Sacramentum novæ legis, quo significatur conjunctio Christi
       cum Ecclesia, et gratia confertur ad sanctificandam viri et
       mulieris legitimam conjunctionem, ad uniendos arctius conjugum
       animos, atque ad prolem pie sancteque in virtutis officiis et fide
       christiana instituendam.
     * [2041]Salvator Hominum
     * [2042]Sancti non sunt immediati intercessores nostri apud Deum, sed
       quidquid a Deo nobis impetrant, per Christum impetrant.
     * [2043]Sancti orant pro nobis saltem in genere, secundum Scripturas.
     * [2044]Sancti qui regnant cum Christo, pro nobis orant, non solum in
       genere, sed etiam in particulari.
     * [2045]Sanctorum animas, sicut etiam angelos, mira quadam celeritate
       naturæ, quodammodo esse ubique; et per se audire preces
       supplicantium.
     * [2046]Sanctorum quoque martyrum, et aliorum cum Christo viventium
       sancta corpora, quæ viva membra fuerunt Christi, et templum
       Spiritus Sancti, ab ipso ad æternam vitam suscitanda, et
       glorificanda, a fideibus veneranda esse; per quæ multa beneficia a
       Deo hominibus præstantar: ita ut affirmantes, sanctorum reliquiis
       venerationem, atque honorem non deberi; vel eas, aliaque sacra
       monumenta a fidelibus inutiliter honorari; atque eorum opis
       impetrandæ causa sanctorum memorias frustra frequentari; omnino
       damnandos esse; prout jampridem eos damnavit, et nunc etiam damnat
       ecclesia.
     * [2047]Sanctos videre in Deo omnia a principio suæ beatitudinis, quæ
       ad ipsos aliquo modo pertinent, et proinde etiam orationes nostras
       ad se directas.
     * [2048]Sanctum crucis lignum testatur, quod ad hodiernum usque diem
       apud nos conspicitur, ac per eos qui fide impellente ex eo frusta
       decerpunt orbem fere totum hinc jam opplevit.
     * [2049]Scholasticum autem illud dogma, quo tam longum discrimen
       inter veteris ac novæ Legis sacramenta notatur, perinde acsi illa
       non aliud quam Dei gratiam adumbrarint, hæc vero præsentem
       conferant, penitus explodendum est. Siquidem nihilo splendidius de
       illis Apostolus quam de his loquitur, quum docet patres eandem
       nobiscum spiritualem escam manducasse: et escam illam Christum
       interpretatur (1 Cor. x. 3
     * [2050]Sciendum, quando dicimus, nos fide justificari, nos non
       excludere opera, quæ fides exigit et tanquam foecunda mater
       producit; sed ea includere.
     * [2051]Scriptura autem, quem de fidei justitia loquitur, longe alio
       nos ducit: nempe ut ab intuitu operum nostrorum aversi, in Dei
       misericordiam ac Christi perfectionem, tantum respiciamus. . . . .
       Hic est fidei sensus, per quem peccator in possessionem venit suæ
       salutis, dum ex Evangeli doctrina agnoscit Deo se reconciliatum:
       quod intercedente Christi justitia, impetrata peccatorum
       remissione, justificatus sit: et quanquam Spiritu Dei regeneratus,
       non in bonis operibus, quibus incumbit, sed sola Christi justitia
       repositam sibi perpetuam justitiam cogitat.
     * [2052]Secunda opinio est, quod idem honor debeatur imagini ut
       exemplari, et proinde Christi imago sit adoranda cultu latriæ,
       Beatæ Mariæ cultu hyperduliæ, sanctorum aliorum, cultu duliæ.
     * [2053]Secunda propositio. Quantum ad modum loquendi præsertim in
       concione ad populum, non est dicendum imagines ullas adorari debere
       latria, sed e contrario non debere sic adorari.
     * [2054]Sed an illi ipsi negligentia sua initium sui esse in Christo
       deserere non possint, et præsentem mundum iterum amplecti, a sancta
       doctrina ipsis semel tradita deficere, conscientiæ naufragium
       facere, a gratia excidere; penitus ex sacra Scriptura esset
       expendum, antequam illud cum plena animi tranquillitate et
       plerophoria
     * [2055]Sed cum ceterarum rerum cognitio, quæ hactenus expositæ sunt,
       fidelibus utillissima habenda sit, tum vero nihil magis necessarium
       videri potest, quam ut doceantur, omnibus hominibus baptismi legem
       a Domino præscriptam esse, ita ut, nisi per baptismi gratiam Deo
       renascantur, in sempiternam miseriam, et interitum a parentibus,
       sive illi fideles, sive infideles sint, procreentur.
     * [2056]Sed unus etiam atque idem sacerdos est Christus dominus, nam
       ministri, qui sacrificium faciunt, non suam, sed Christi personam
       suscipiunt, cum ejus corpus et sanguinem conficiunt, id quod et
       ipsius consecrationis verbis ostenditur, neque enim sacerdos
       inquit, Hoc est corpus Christi, sed, Hoc est corpus meum:' personam
       videlicet Christi domini gerens, panis, et vini substantiam, in
       veram ejus corporis, et sanguinis substantiam convertit.
     * [2057]Seligat ex tota sua vita sanctus Dei servus, quod in ejus
       cursu maxime eximium se putabit edidisse, bene revolvat singulas
       partes: deprehendet procul dubio alicubi quod carnis putredinem
       sapiat, quando numquam ea est nostra alacritas ad bene agendum quæ
       esse debet, sed in cursu retardando multa debilitas. Quanquam non
       obscuras esse maculas videmus, quibus respersa sint opera
       sanctorum, fac tamen minutissimos esse nævos duntaxat: sed an
       oculos Dei nihil offendent, coram quibus ne stellæ quidem puræ
       sunt? Habemus, nec unum a sanctis exire opus, quod, si in se
       censeatur, non mereatur justam opprobrii mercedem.
     * [2058]Si [Protestantes hoc] solum vellent, nobis imputari Christi
       merita, quia [a Deo] nobis donata sunt, et possumus ea [Deo] Patri
       offere pro peccatis nostris, quoniam Christus suscepit super se
       onus satisfaciendi pro nobis, nosque Deo Patri reconciliandi, recta
       esset eorum sententia.
     * [2059]Si conjugium instituit Deus in communem humani generis
       salutem, licet quædem minus grata secum trahat, non ideo protinus
       spernendum est. Discamus ergo, si quid in Dei beneficiis nobis non
       arridet, non tam lauti esse ac morosi, quin reverenter illis
       utamur. Præsertim nobis in sancto conjugio cavenda est hæc
       pravitas: nam quia multis molestiis implicitum est, semper conatus
       est Satan odio et infamia gravare, ut homines ab eo subduceret. Et
       Hieronymus nimis luculentum maligni perversique ingenii specimen in
       eo edidit, quod non tantum calumniis exagitat sacrum illum et
       divinum vitæ ordinem, sed quascunque potest ex profanis auctoribus
       loidorias
     * [2060]Si enim Deo cultus reliquiarum non placeret, cur ipse servis
       suis corpora sanctorum, quæ latebant, ostenderet?
     * [2061]Si id efficere propositum eis fuerit, quod ecclesia Catholica
       in eo administrationis genere efficit.
     * [2062]Si omnes consentiunt, ego non dissentio.
     * [2063]Si quis dixerit Ecclesiam non potuisse constituere
       impedimenta, matrimonium dirimentia, vel in iis constituendis
       errasse; anathema sit.
     * [2064]Si quis dixerit baptismum liberum esse, hoc est non
       necessarium ad salutem; anathema sit.
     * [2065]Si quis dixerit in sacrosancto eucharistiæ sacramento
       remanere substantiam panis, et vini, una cum corpore et sanguine
       Domini nostri, Jesu Christi, negaveritque mirabilem illam et
       singularem conversionem totius substantiæ panis in corpus, et
       totius substantiæ vini in sanguinem, manentibus duntaxat speciebus
       panis, et vini, quam quidem conversionem catholica ecclesia
       aptissime transubstantionem appellat; anathema sit.
     * [2066]Si quis dixerit sacramenta novæ legis non continere gratiam,
       quam significant; aut gratiam ipsam non ponentibus obicem non
       conferre; quasi signa tantum externa sint acceptæ per fidem gratiæ,
       vel justitiæ, et notæ quædam Christianæ professionis, quibus apud
       homines discernuntur fideles ab infidelibus; anathema sit.
     * [2067]Si quis dixerit, Christianos omnes in verbo, et omnibus
       sacramentis administrandis habere potestatem; anathema sit.
     * [2068]Si quis dixerit, Christum, in eucharistia exhibitum,
       spiritualiter tantum manducari, et non etiam sacramentaliter, et
       realiter; anathema sit.
     * [2069]Si quis dixerit, amissa per peccatum gratia, simul et fidem
       semper amitti, aut fidem, quæ remanet, non esse veram fidem, licet
       non sit viva; aut eum, qui fidem sine caritate habet, non esse
       Christianum; anathema sit.
     * [2070]Si quis dixerit, blasphemiam irrogari sanctissimo Christi
       sacrificio, in cruce peracto, per missæ sacrificium; aut illi per
       hoc derogari; anathema sit.
     * [2071]Si quis dixerit, cæremonias, vestes, et externa signa, quibus
       in missarum celebratione ecclesia catholica utitur, irritabula
       impietatis esse, magis quam officia pietatis; anathema sit.
     * [2072]Si quis dixerit, canones missæ errores continere, ideoque
       abrogandum; anathema sit.
     * [2073]Si quis dixerit, clericos in sacris ordinibus constitutos,
       vel regulares, castitatem solemniter professos, posse matrimonium
       contrahere, contractumque validum esse, non obstante lege
       ecclesiastica, vel voto: et oppositum nil aliud esse, quam damnare
       matrimonium; posseque omnes contrahere matrimonium, qui non
       sentiunt se castitatis, etiam si eam voterint, habere donum;
       anathema sit; cum Deus id recte petentibus non deneget, nec
       patiatur nos supra id, quod possumus, tentari.
     * [2074]Si quis dixerit, ecclesiæ Romanæ ritum, quo summissa voce
       pars canonis, et verba consecrationis proferuntur, damnandum esse;
       aut lingua tantum vulgari missam celebrari debere; aut aquam non
       miscendam esse vino in calice offerendo, eo quod sit contra Christi
       institutionem; anathema sit.
     * [2075]Si quis dixerit, ecclesiam errare, cum docuit et docet, juxta
       evangelicam et apostolicam doctrinam, propter adulterium alterius
       conjugum matrimonii vinculum non posse dissolvi; et utrumque, vel
       etiam innocentem, qui causam adulterio non dedit, non posse, altero
       conjuge vivente, aliud matrimonium contrahere; moecharique eum,
       qui, dimissa adultera, aliam duxerit, et eam, quæ, dimisso
       adultero, alii nupserit; anathema sit.
     * [2076]Si quis dixerit, hominis justificati bona opera ita esse dona
       Dei, ut non sint etiam bona ipsius justificati merita; aut ipsum
       justificatum bonis operibus, quæ ab eo per Dei gratiam et Jesu
       Christi meritum, cujus vivum membrum est, fiunt, non vere mereri
       augmentum gratiæ, vitam æternam, et ipsius vitæ æternæ, si tamen in
       gratia decesserit, consecutionem, atque etiam gloriæ augmentum;
       anathema sit.
     * [2077]Si quis dixerit, hominis justificati bona opera ita esse dona
       Dei, ut non sint etiam bona ipsius justificati merita; aut ipsum
       justificatum bonis operibus, quæ ab eo per Dei gratiam, et Jesu
       Christi meritum cujus vivum membrum est, fiunt, non vere mereri
       augmentum gratiæ, vitam æternam, et ipsius vitæ æternæ, si tamen in
       gratia decesserit, consecutionem, atque etiam gloriæ augmentum;
       anathema sit.
     * [2078]Si quis dixerit, illis verbis, Hoc facite in meam
       commemorationem;' Christum non instituisse Apostolos sacerdotes;
       aut non ordinasse, ut ipsi, aliique sacerdotes offerent corpus, et
       sanguinem suum; anathema sit.
     * [2079]Si quis dixerit, imposturam esse, missas celebrare in honorem
       sanctorum, et pro illorum intercessione, apud Deum obtinenda, sicut
       ecclesia intendit; anathema sit.
     * [2080]Si quis dixerit, in ministris, dum sacramentis conficiunt, et
       conferunt, non requiri intentionem saltem faciendi, quod facit
       ecclesia; anathema sit.
     * [2081]Si quis dixerit, in missa non offerri Deo verum, et proprium
       sacrificium; aut quod offerri non sit aliud, quam nobis Christum ad
       manducandum dari; anathema sit.
     * [2082]Si quis dixerit, in sancto eucharistiæ sacramento Christum,
       unigenitum Dei filium, non esse cultu latriæ, etiam externo,
       adorandum; atque ideo nec festiva peculiari celebritate venerandum;
       neque in processionibus, secundum laudabilem, et universalem
       ecclesiæ ritum, et consuetudinem, solemniter circumgestandum, vel
       non publice, ut adoretur, populo proponendum, et ejus adoratores
       esse idololatras; anathema sit.
     * [2083]Si quis dixerit, in tribus sacramentis, baptismo scilicet
       confirmatione, et ordine, non imprimi characterem in anima, hoc est
       signum quoddam spirituale et indelebile, unde ea iterari non
       possunt; anathema sit.
     * [2084]Si quis dixerit, in tribus sacramentis, baptismo scilicet,
       confirmatione, et ordine, non imprimi characterem in anima, hoc est
       signum quoddam spirituale, et indelebile, unde ea iterari non
       possunt; anathema sit.
     * [2085]Si quis dixerit, missæ sacrificium tantum esse laudis, et
       gratiarum actionis, aut nudum commemorationem sacrificii in cruce
       peracti, non autem propitiatorium; vel soli prodesse sumenti; neque
       pro vivis, et defunctis, pro peccatis, poenis, satisfactionibus, et
       aliis necessitatibus offerri debere; anathema sit.
     * [2086]Si quis dixerit, missas, in quibus solus sacerdos
       sacramentaliter communicat, illicitas esse, ideoque abrogandas;
       anathema sit.
     * [2087]Si quis dixerit, non dari gratiam per hujusmodi sacramenta
       semper, et omnibus, quantum est ex parte Dei, etiam si rite ea
       suscipiant, sed aliquando, et aliquibus anathema sit.
     * [2088]Si quis dixerit, non licere sacerdoti celebranti seipsum
       communicare; anathema sit.
     * [2089]Si quis dixerit, non licere sacram eucharistiam in sacrario
       reservari, sed statim post consecrationem adstantibus necessario
       distribuendam, aut non licere, ut illa ad infirmos honorifice
       deferatur; anathema sit.
     * [2090]Si quis dixerit, per sacram ordinationem non dari Spiritum
       Sanctum, ac proinde frustra episcopos dicere: Accipe Spiritum
       Sanctum; aut per eam non imprimi characterem; vel eum, qui sacerdos
       semel fuit, laicum rursus fieri posse; anathema sit.
     * [2091]Si quis dixerit, peracta consecratione, in admirabili
       eucharistiæ sacramento non esse corpus, et sanguinem Domini nostri
       Jesu Christi, sed tantum in usu dum sumitur, non autem ante, vel
       post; et in hostiis, seu particulis consecratis, quæ post
       communionem reservantur, vel supersunt, non remanere verum corpus
       Domini; anathema sit.
     * [2092]Si quis dixerit, presbyteros Ecclesiæ, quos B. Jacobus
       adducendos esse infirmum inunguendum hortatur, non esse sacerdotes
       ab Episcopo ordinatos, sed ætate seniores, in quavis communitate;
       ob idque proprium extremæ unctionis ministrum non esse solum
       sacerdotem; anathema sit.
     * [2093]Si quis dixerit, sacram infirmorum unctionem non conferre
       gratiam, nec remittere peccata, nec alleviare infirmos; sed jam
       cessasse, quasi olim tantum fuerit gratia curationum; anathema sit.
     * [2094]Si quis dixerit, solam fidem esse sufficientem præparationem
       ad sumendum sanctissimæ eucharistiæ sacramentum, anathema sit. Et
       ne tantum sacramentum indigne atque ideo in mortem, condemnationem
       sumatur, statuit, atque declaret ipsa sancta synodus, illis, quos
       conscientia peccati mortalis gravat, quantumcunque etiam se
       contritos existiment, habita copia confessoris, necessario
       præmittendam esse confessionem sacramentalem. Si quis autem
       contrarium docere, prædicare, vel pertinaciter asserere, seu etiam
       publice disputando defendere præsumpserit eo ipso excommunicatus
       existat.
     * [2095]Si quis dixerit, statum conjugalem anteponendum esse statui
       virginitatis, vel coelibatus, et non esse melius, et beatius manere
       in virginitate aut coelibatu, quam jungi matrimonio: anathema sit.
     * [2096]Si quis dixerit, vel præcipuum fructum sanctissimæ
       eucharistiæ esse remissionem peccatorum, vel ex ea non alios
       effectus provenire; anathema sit.
     * [2097]Si quis in quolibet bono opere justum saltem venaliter
       peccare dixerit . . . . anathema sit.
     * [2098]Si quis negaverit, confessionem sacramentalem vel institutam,
       vel ad salutem necessariam esse jure divino; aut dixerit, modum
       secreti confitendi soli sacerdoti, quem Ecclesia catholica ab
       initio semper observavit, et observat, alienum esse ab institutione
       et mandato Christi, et inventum esse humanum; anathema sit.
     * [2099]Si quis negaverit, in sanctissimæ eucharistiæ sacramento
       contineri vere, realiter, et substantialiter corpus et sanguinem
       una cum anima, et divinitate Domini nostri, Jesu Christi, ac
       proinde totum Christum, sed dixerit tantummodo esse in eo, ut in
       signo, vel figura aut virtute; anathema sit.
     * [2100]Si quis negaverit, in venerabili sacramento eucharistiæ sub
       unaquaque specie, et sub singulis cujusque speciei partibus,
       separatione facta, totum Christum contineri; anathema sit.
     * [2101]Si quis negaverit, omnes, et singulos Christi fideles
       utriusque sexus, cum ad annos discretionis pervenerint, teneri
       singulis annis, saltem in paschate, ad communicandum, juxta
       præceptum sanctæ matris ecclesiæ; anathema sit.
     * [2102]Si quis parvulos recentes ab uteris matrum baptizandos negat,
       etiam si a baptizatis parentibus orti; aut dicit in remissionem
       quidem peccatorum eos baptizari, sed nihil ex Adam trahere
       originalis peccati, quod regenerationis lavacro necesse sit expiari
       ad vitam æternam consequendam.. . . . . anathema sit.
     * [2103]Si quis per Jesu Christi Domini gratiam; quæ in baptismate
       confertur, reatum originalis peccati remitti negat, aut etiam
       asserit, non tolli totum id, quod veram, et propriam peccati
       rationem habet; sed illud dicit tantum radi, aut non imputari:
       anathema sit. In renatis enim nihil odit Deus, quia nihil est
       damnationis iis qui vere consepulti sunt cum Christo per baptisma
       in mortem: qui non secundum carnem ambulant, sed veterem hominem
       exuentes, et novum, qui secundum Deum creatus est, induentes,
       innocentes, immaculati, puri, innoxii, ac Deo dilecti effecti sunt,
       heredes quidem Dei, coheredes autem Christi, ita ut nihil prorsus
       eos ab ingressu coeli remoretur.
     * [2104]Si sacramenta vocamus ritus, qui habent mandatum Dei, et
       quibus addita est promissio gratiæ, facile est judicare, quæ sint
       proprie sacramenta. Nam ritus ab hominibus instituti non erunt hoc
       modo proprie dicta sacramenta. Non est enim auctoritatis humanæ,
       promittere gratiam. Quare signa sine mandato Dei instituta, non
       sunt certa sigua gratiæ, etiamsi fortasse rudes docent, aut
       admonent aliquid.
     * [2105]Sic ergo dicendum est, quod imagini Christi in quantum est
       res quædam (puta lignum vel pictum) nulla reverentia exhibetur;
       quia reverentia nonnisi rationali naturæ debetur. Relinquitur ergo
       quod exhibeatur ei reverentia solum, in quantum est imago: et sic
       sequitur, quod eadem reverentia exhibeatur imagini Christi et ipsi
       Christo. Cum ergo Christus adoretur adoratione latriæ, consequens
       est, quod ejus imago sit adoratione latriæ adoranda.
     * [2106]Sicut enim circumcisio etiam parvulorum in V. T. fuit
       signaculum justitiæ fidei, ita, quia in N. T. infantes baptizati
       Deo placent, et salvi sunt, non possunt, nec debent inter infideles
       rejici, sed recte annumerantur fidelibus.
     * [2107]Sicut igitur homo, qui corporaliter mortuus est, seipsum
       propriis viribus præparare aut accommodare non potest, ut vitam
       externam recipiat: ita homo spiritualiter in peccatis mortuus,
       seipsum propriis viribus ad consequendam spiritualem et coelestem
       justitiam et vitam præparare, applicare, aut vertere non potest,
       nisi per Filium Dei a morte peccati liberetur et vivificetur.
     * [2108]Signum quoddam spirituale et indelebile in anima impressum.
       Qui eo insigniti sunt, deputantur ad recipienda vel tradenda aliis
       ea, quæ pertinent ad cultum Dei.
     * [2109]Sola fide in Jesum Christum, adeo ut licet mea me conscientia
       accuset, quod adversus omnia mandata Dei graviter peccaverim, nec
       ullum eorum servaverim, adhæc etiamnum ad omne malum propensus sim,
       nihilominus tamen (modo hæc beneficia vera animi fiducia
       amplectar), sine ullo meo merito, ex mera Dei misericordia, mihi
       perfecta satisfactio, justitia, et sanctitas Christi, imputetur ac
       donetur; perinde ac si nec ullum ipse peccatum admisissem, nec ulla
       mihi labes inhæreret; imo vero quasi eam obedientiam, quam pro me
       Christus præstitit, ipse perfecte præstitissem.
     * [2110]Solam esse habitualem justitiam, per quam formaliter justi
       nominamur, et sumus: justitiam vero actualem, id est, opera vere
       justa justificare quidem, ut sanctus Jacobus loquitur, cum ait cap.
       2 ex operibus hominem justificari, sed meritorie, non formaliter.
     * [2111]Spiritus Sanctus (quem non omnibus promiscue sacramenta
       advehunt, sed quem Dominus peculiariter suis confert) is est qui
       Dei gratias secum affert, qui dat sacramentis in nobis locum, qui
       efficit ut fructificent.
     * [2112]Status conversionis aut regenerationis
     * [2113]Summa sit, non aliter animas nostras carne et sanguine
       Christi pasci, quam panis et vinum corporalem vitam tuentur et
       sustinent. Neque enim aliter quadraret analogia signi, nisi
       alimentum suum animæ in Christo reperirent: quod fieri non potest,
       nisi nobiscum Christus vere in unum coalescat nosque reficiat
       carnis suæ esu et sanguinis potu. Etsi autem incredibile videtur,
       in tanta locorum distantia penetrare ad nos Christi carnem, ut
       nobis sit in cibum, meminerimus, quantum supra sensus omnes nostros
       emineat arcana Spiritus sancti virtus et quam stultum sit, ejus
       immensitatem modo nostro velle metiri. Quod ergo mens nostra non
       comprehendit, concipiat fides, Spiritum vere unire, quæ locis
       disjuncta sunt. Jam sacram illam carnis et sanguinis sui
       communicationem, qua vitam suam in nos transfundit Christus non
       secus acsi in ossa et medullas penetraret, in coena etiam testatur
       et obsignat; et quidem non objecto inani aut vacuo signo, sed
       efficaciam Spiritus sui illic proferens, qua impleat quod
       promittit.
     * [2114]Sunt enim qui manducare Christi carnem, et sanguinem ejus
       bibere, uno verbo definiunt, nihil esse aliud, quam in Christum
       ipsum credere. Sed mihi expressius quiddam ac sublimius videtur
       voluisse docere Christus in præclara illa concione, ubi carnis suæ
       manducationem nobis commendat: nempe vera sui participatione nos
       vivificari, quam manducandi etiam ac bibendi verbis ideo
       designavit, ne, quam ab ipso vitam percipimus, simplicii cognitione
       percipi quispiam putaret. Quemadmodum enim non aspectus, sed esus
       panis corpori alimentum sufficit, ita vere ac penitus participem
       Christi animam fieri convenit, ut ipsius virtute in vitam
       spiritualem vegetetur. Interim vero hanc non aliam esse, quam fidei
       manducationem fatemur, ut nulla alia fingi potest. Verum hoc inter
       mea et isotrum verba interest, quod illis manducare est duntaxat
       credere: ego credendo manducari Christi carnem, quia fide noster
       efficitur, eamque manducationem fructum effectamque esse fidei
       dico.
     * [2115]Sunt enim sacramenta signa, ac symbola visibilia rerum
       internarum et invisibilium, per quæ, ceu per media, Deus ipse
       virtute Spiritus Sancti in nobis operatur. Itaque signa illa minime
       vana sunt, ant vacua: nec ad nos decipiendos aut frustrandos
       instituta.
     * [2116]Sunt qui manducare Christi carnem, et sanguinem ejus bibere,
       uno verbo definiunt, nihil esse aliud, quam in Christum ipsum
       credere. Sed mihi expressius quiddam ac sublimius videtur voluisse
       docere Christus . . . . nempe vera sui participatione nos
       vivificari. . . .Quemadmodum enim non aspectus sed esus panis
       corpori alimentum sufficit, ita vere ac penitus participem Christi
       animam fieri convenit, ut ipsius virtute in vitam spiritualem
       vegetetur.
     * [2117]Sunt sacramenta symbola mystica, vel ritus sancti, aut sacræ
       actiones, a Deo ipso institutæ, constantes verbo suo, signis, et
       rebus significatis, quibus in ecclesia summa sua beneficia, homini
       exhibita, retinet in memoria, et subinde renovat, quibus item
       promissiones suas obsignat, et quæ ipse nobis interius præstat,
       exterius repræsentat, ac veluti oculis contemplanda subiicit,
       adeoque fidem nostram, Spiritu Dei in cordibus nostris operante,
       roborat et auget: quibus denique nos ab omnibus aliis populis et
       religionibus separat, sibique soli consecrat et obligat, et quid a
       nobis requirat, significat.
     * [2118]Tenebræ stupefecerunt me
     * [2119]Tenendum est certissimum hoc fundamentum, quod justificare
       sit vocabulum forense, notetque in Scriptura actum judicis, quo
       causam alicujus in judicio justam esse declarat; sive eum a
       crimine, cujus postulatus est, absolvat (quæ est genuina, et maxime
       propria vocis significatio), sive etiam jus ad hanc, vel illam rem
       ei sententia addicat, et adjudicet.
     * [2120]Terminum localis præsentiæ esse ambiguum. Corpus Christi
       præsens esse dicimus in illo loco, in quo celebratur coena, sed
       modo locali et circumscriptivo præsens esse negamus. Si præsentiam
       localem sensu posteriori intelligunt habent nos sibi consentientes;
       si priori, repugnamus.
     * [2121]Tertia opinio versatur in medio, estque eorum, qui dicunt,
       ipsas imagines in se, et proprie honorari debere, sed honore
       minori, quam ipsum exemplar, et proinde nullam imaginem adorandam
       esse cultu latriæ.
     * [2122]Tertia propositio. Si de re ipsa agatur, admitti potest,
       imagines posse coli improprie, vel per accidens, eodem genere
       cultus, quo exemplar ipsum colitur.
     * [2123]Totum hanc periodum. Declarat-innovat,' omnes fere editiones
       ante Romanas omittunt.
     * [2124]Tribus in rebus ab hæreticis Catholici dissentiunt; Primum,
       in objecto fidei justificantis, quod hæretici restringunt ad solam
       promissionem misericordiæ specialis, Catholici tam late patere
       volunt, quam late patet verbam. . . . Deinde in facultate et
       potentia animi quæ sedes est fidei. Siquidem illi fidem collocant
       in voluntate [seu in corde] cum fiduciam esse definiunt; ac per hoc
       eam cum spe confundunt. Fiducia enim nihil est aliud, nisi spes
       roborata. . . . Catholici fidem in intellectu sedem habere docent.
       Denique, in ipso actu intellectus. Ipsi enim per notitiam fidem
       definiunt, nos per assensum. Assentimur enim Deo, quamvis ea nobis
       credenda proponat, quæ non intelligimus.
     * [2125]Una est vera et sola causa tuendi coelibatus, ut opes
       commodius administrentur et splendor ordinis retineatur.
     * [2126]Unanimi consensu, docemus et confitemur. . . . . quod homo
       peccator coram Deo justificetur, hoc est, absolvatur ab omnibus
       suis peccatis et a judicio justissimæ condemnationis, et adoptetur
       in numerum filiorum Dei atque hæres æternæ vitæ scribatur, sine
       ullis nostris meritis, aut dignitate, et absque ullis
       præcedentibus, præsentibus, aut sequentibus nostris operibus, ex
       mera gratia, tantummodo propter unicum meritum, perfectissimam
       obedientiam, passionem acerbissimam, mortem et resurrectionem
       Domini nostri, Jesu Christi, cujus obedientia nobis ad justitiam
       imputatur.
     * [2127]Unde constat et aliam quamlibet, extra conjugium, societatem
       coram ipso [Deo] maledictam esse; et illam ipsam conjugalem in
       necessitatis remedium esse ordinatam, ne in effrenem libidinem
       proruamus. . . . . Jam quum per naturæ conditionem et accensa post
       lapsum libidine, mulieris consortio bis obnoxii simus, nisi quos
       singulari gratia Deus inde exemit; videant singuli quid sibi datum
       sit. Virginitas, fateor, virtus est non contemnenda: sed quoniam
       aliis negata est, allis nonnisi ad tempus concessa, qui ab
       incontinentia vexantur, et superiores in certamine esse nequeunt ad
       matrimonii subsidium se conferant, ut ita in suæ vocationis gradu
       castitatem colant.
     * [2128]Unde ista tanta virtus aquæ, ut corpus tangat, et cor abluat,
       nisi faciente verbo: non quia dicitur, sed quia creditur.
     * [2129]Uno verbo poenitentiam interpretor regenerationem, cujus non
       alius est scopus nisi ut imago Dei, quæ per Adæ transgressionem
       foedata et tantum non obliterata fuerat, in nobis reformetur. . . .
       Atque hæc quidem instauratio non uno momento, vel die, vel anno
       impletur, sed per continuos, imo etiam lentos interdum profectus
       abolet Deus in electis suis carnis corruptelas.
     * [2130]Unum itaque et idem sacrificium esse fatemur, et haberi
       debet, quod in missa peragitur, et quod in cruce oblatum est:
       quemadmodum una est et eadem hostia Christus, videlicet Dominus
       noster, qui se ipsum in ara crucis semel tantummodo cruentum
       immolavit. Neque enim cruenta, et incruenta hostia, duæ sunt
       hostiæ, sed una tantum, cujus sacrificium, postquam Dominus ita
       præcepit, Hoc facite in meam commemorationem,' in eucharistia
       quotidie instauratur.
     * [2131]Ut autem rectius et perspicacius intelligatur, quomodo caro
       et sanguis Christi sint cibus et potus fidelium, percipianturque a
       fidelibus ad vitam æternam, paucula hæc adjiciemus. Manducatio non
       est unius generis. Est enim manducatio corporalis, qua cibus in os
       percipitur ab homine, dentibus atteritur, et in ventrem
       deglutitur. . . . . Est et spiritualis manducatio corporis Christi,
       non ea quidem, qua existimemus cibum ipsum mutari in spiritum, sed
       qua, manente in sua essentia et proprietate corpore et sanguine
       Domini, ea nobis communicantur spiritualiter, utique non corporali
       modo, sed spirituali, per Spiritum Sanctum, qui videlicet ea, quæ
       per carnem et sanguinem Domini pro nobis in mortem tradita, parata
       sunt, ipsam inquam remissionem peccatorum, liberationem, et vitam
       æternam, applicat et confert nobis, ita ut Christus in nobis vivat,
       et nos in ipso vivamus, efficitque ut ipsum, quo talis sit cibus et
       potus spiritualis noster, id est, vita nostra, vera fide
       percipiamus. . . . . Et sicut oportet cibum in nosmetipsos edendo
       recipere, ut operetur in nobis, suamque in nobis efficaciam exerat,
       cum extra nos positus, nihil nobis prosit: ita necesse est nos fide
       Christum recipere, ut noster fiat, vivatque in nobis, et nos in
       ipso. . . . . Ex quibus omnibus claret nos, per spiritualem cibum,
       minime intelligere imaginarium, nescio quem, cibum, sed ipsum
       Domini corpus pro nobis traditum, quod tamen percipiatur a
       fidelibus, non corporaliter, sed spiritualiter per fidem. . . . .
       Fit autem hic esus et potus spiritualis, etiam extra Domini coenam,
       quoties, aut ubicunque homo in Christum crediderit. Quo fortassis
       illud Augustini pertinet, Quid paras dentem et ventrem? crede, et
       manducasti.
     * [2132]Ut iis nobis [Christus] testificatur, quam vere accipimus et
       tenemus manibus nostris hoc sacramentum, illudque ore comedimus
       (unde et postmodum vita hæc nostra sustentatur), tam vere etiam nos
       fide (quæ animæ nostræ est instar et manus et oris) recipere verum
       corpus et verum sanguinem Christi, in animis nostris, ad vitam
       spiritualem in nobis fovendam. . . . . Dicimus itaque id quod
       comeditur esse ipsissimum Christi corpus naturale, et id quod
       bibitur verum ipsius sanguinem: at instrumentum seu medium quo hæc
       comedimus et bibimus non est os corporeum, sed spiritus ipse
       noster, idque per fidem.
     * [2133]Ut unus homo haberet alteram sororem, alteram uxorem, alteram
       consobrinam, alterum patrem, alterum avunculum, alterum socerum,
       alteram matrem, alteram amitam, alteram socrum: atque ita se non in
       paucitate coarctatum, sed latius atque numerosius propinquitatibus
       crebris vinculum sociale diffunderet.

     * [2136]Verbo Dei virtus divina non extrinsecus in ipso usu demum,
       accedit, sed . . . . in se et per se, intrinsice ex divina
       ordinatione et communicatione, efficacia et vi conversiva et
       regeneratrice præditum est, etiam ante et extra omnem usum.
     * [2137]Verbum Dei non agit solum persuasiones morales, proponendo
       nobis objectum amabile; sed vero, reali, divino et ineffabili
       influxu potentiæ suæ gratiosæ.
     * [2138]Vere sunt sacramenta, baptismus, Coena Domini, absolutio, quæ
       est sacramentum poenitentiæ. Nam hi ritus habent mandatum Dei et
       promissionem gratiæ, quæ est propria Novi Testamenti.
     * [2139]Verum observemus, fidei sedem non in cerebro esse, sed in
       corde: neque vero de eo contenderim, qua in parte corporis sita sit
       fides: sed quoniam cordis nomen pro serio et sincero affectu fere
       capitur, dico firmam esse et efficacem fiduciam, non nudam tantum
       notionem.
     * [2140]Virgo Dei genitrix, Angeli, et Sancti religiose coli debent,

       adest ob aliquam evagationem mentis, tamen paulo ante adfuit et in
       virtute illius sit operatio.
     * [2142]Vocabulum justificationis in hoc negotio significat justum
       pronuntiare, a peccatis et æternis peccatorum suppliciis absolvere,
       propter justitiam Christi, quæ a Deo fidei imputatur.
     * [2143]Vocabulum regenerationis interdum in eo sensu accipitur, ut
       simul et remissionem peccatorum (quæ duntaxat propter Christam
       contingit) et subsequentem renovationem complectatur, quam Spiritus
       Sanctus in illis, qui per fidem justificati sunt, operatur,
       quandoque etiam solam remissionem peceatorum, et adoptionem in
       filios Dei significat. Et in hoc posteriore usu sæpe multumque id
       vocabulam in Apologia Confessionis ponitur. Verbi gratia, cum
       dicitur: Justificatio est regeneratio. . . . Quin etiam
       vivificationis vocabulum interdum ita accipitur, ut remissionem
       peccatorum notet. Cum enim homo per fidem (quam quidem solus
       Spiritus Sanctus operatur) justificatur, id ipsum revera est quædam
       regeneratio, quia ex filio iræ fit filius Dei, et hoc modo e morte
       in vitam transfertur. . . . Deinde etiam regeneratio sæpe pro
       sanctificatione et renovatione (quæ fidei justificationem sequitur)
       usurpatur. In qua significatione D. Lutherus hac voce, tum in libro
       de ecelesia et conciliis, tum alibi etiam, multum usus est.
     * [2144]Voluntas, fides, et poenitentia in suscipiento adulto
       necessario requiruntur, ut dispositiones ex parte subjecti, non ut
       causæ activæ: non enim fides et poenitentia efficiunt gratiam
       sacramentalem, neque dant efficaciam sacramento; sed solum tollunt
       obstacula quæ impedirent, ne sacramenta suam efficaciam exercere
       possent; unde in pueris, ubi non requiritur dispositio, sine his
       rebus fit justificatio.

     * [2479]"On voit," says Cardinal Gousset in the place referred to,
       "que le signe eucharistique est un signe qui a la vertu de produire
       la grace; mais il n'a cette vertu que par l'institution de Jesus
       Christ."
     * [2480]C'est un feinte innocente et pleine d'amour, par laquelle
       Jésus-Christ veut éprouver la foi de ses disciples. Ainsi en usent

       mais particulièrement (lorsqu'elle est comparés avec la foi) de
       celles où l'esprit humain peut atteindre naturellement, sans être
       aidé des lumières de la foi.
     * [2483]Le sacrement de l'eucharistie n'est point nécessaire au
       salut, d'une necessité de moyen; on peut être sauvé sans avoir reçu
       la communion. La raison, c'est que se sacrement n'a point été
       institué comme moyen de conférer la première grace sanctifiante ou
       de remettre le péché mortel, ce qui est réservé aux sacrements de
       baptême et de pénitence.
