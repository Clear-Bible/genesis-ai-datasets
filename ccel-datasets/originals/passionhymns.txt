FOREWORD

   My friend Mr. Pilcher's Passion-Hymns of Iceland finds at least one
   deeply interested welcomer in myself. From early youth till now the
   great northern island, with its natural wonders, its population of
   hardy and educated peasants and fishermen, and its practical retention,
   through a thousand years, of its ancient speech, has had for me a
   peculiar fascination. To be thus introduced to the spiritual life of
   Iceland, as embodied in and fostered by its hymnody, is no common
   delight accordingly. That delight, I am confident, will be shared by a
   large circle of readers.

   To the believer whose anchor-hold is settled for life and death at the
   foot of his Redeemer's Cross, it is cheering indeed to see in these
   beautiful English renderings, by a scholar whose sympathies are
   complete with the faith and hope of the Norse psalmists, how Icelandic
   hearts have in the past beat true to the Gospel of Calvary, and how
   they do so still in these days so often troubled by alien thinking.

   The Introduction is rich throughout in historical and biographical
   interest, and greatly helps the reader to a true appreciation of the
   hymns, full as these are, in their setting, of the air and landscape of
   Iceland.

PREFACE

   This book represents what is, I believe, practically a pioneer attempt
   to do some such work in the field of Icelandic Hymnology as that
   already done so admirably in the Latin, Greek, and German fields.

   Icelandic sacred song is worthy of study, as well for its own sake, as
   because it is the flower of the spiritual life of a people and of a
   church so nearly akin to our own, and yet situated in such a different
   environment. The closeness of this relationship is not often realized.
   Iceland was largely colonized by Norse settlers from our islands as
   well as from Norway. Even the Celtic element was not absent from the
   blood of the new nation. The greatest of Icelandic Sagas, Njáls Saga,
   is simply "Neil's Saga." And the Icelandic language itself, so
   unintelligible to us now, was spoken over half England a thousand years
   ago by the Norsemen, spoken, too, by some of our Kings. It is our
   language that has changed, not theirs. The modern Icelander still
   speaks what is practically the tongue of the Sagas.

   The Icelandic Church may claim our interest, as one of those Lutheran
   Churches which possess the allegiance of so large a part of the
   Teutonic Race, Churches closely connected with our own Royal Family,
   Churches whose history, at the period of the Reformation, was entwined
   with that of the Church of England.

   But while the Icelandic people are thus closely related to ourselves,
   under what vastly differing conditions have they passed the thousand
   and odd years of their national life! Inhabiting "Ultima Thule" itself
   (a land containing some of the wildest and weirdest scenery on the
   globe), speaking the most northern of civilized languages, and forming
   the far-flung outpost of Europe to the north-west, this people have
   braved the rigours of a sub-arctic climate, and survived the loneliness
   of isolation, the wasting of famine, the violence of volcanic action.
   The life of such a people has an interest of its own to all. The
   hymnologist asks, "What type of sacred song did such a life develop?"

   The story of the hymns of Iceland centres largely round two names, that
   of Hallgrim Petursson in the seventeenth century, and that of Bishop
   Valdimar Briem at the present day. Not that either of these singers
   stands alone, but each towers above his contemporaries in the domain of
   sacred song, as Mont Blanc over the neighbouring Aiguilles. The
   majority of the present translations are made from the hymns of these
   two writers.

   I hope that the translations from Hallgrim Petursson will give some
   idea of his peculiar power. I have chosen passages which illustrate his
   method of drawing comfort from special incidents of our Lord's Passion,
   passages which illustrate the prayers with which his hymns abound
   (prayers which have a wonderful power of haunting the memory), and also
   one passage which will give an example of his bursts of praise--a
   stanza often sung by itself in Iceland as a doxology.

   From the hymns of Bishop Valdimar Briem I have chosen those which seem
   to me interesting by their originality, or by their fulness of
   reference to Nature, although a selection made on such a principle will
   scarcely represent the ordinary devotional simplicity of Icelandic
   hymns.

   I have closed this collection with a translation of the hymn written by
   Matthías Jochumsson on the occasion of the thousandth anniversary of
   the landing of the first settlers--an occasion marked by the gift to
   the island of the privilege of "Home Rule" from the King of Denmark.
   The hymn well mirrors the feelings of the people emerging from a period
   of struggle and isolation into the dawning brightness of a freer and a
   wider life.

   I am aware that my translations may appear to Icelandic eyes somewhat
   too paraphrastic, at least in certain parts. But I venture to think
   that, upon the whole, this is inevitable. I have always tried to make
   as good an English hymn as I could, and to do this the Icelandic
   original must at times be treated with some freedom. The reasons for
   this English scholars of Icelandic will understand. The great majority
   of the translations are in the same, or very nearly the same, metres as
   their prototypes.

   Only portions of the long hymns of Hallgrim Petursson have been
   translated. This is true also of some of the other hymns.

   As to the anglicizing of Icelandic names, I have used my judgment in
   each case.

   I should like to suggest Gounod's tune, "Redemption," as suitable to
   the "Easter Hymn"; Barnby's tune, "St. Sylvester," for "The Divine
   Guest"; and the old chorale, "Attolle Paulum," for the two stanzas on
   "Our Lord's Cry from the Cross." The "Whitsuntide Hymn" goes well to a
   Danish tune by Bergreen, one of the few modern tunes in the Icelandic
   Hymn Book which really please English ears.

   I should like to call particular attention to the longer translations
   from Hallgrim Petursson, especially to the Hymn on the Stream from Our
   Lord's Wounded Side, as representing some of his best work. From the
   Hymns of Bishop Valdimar Briem, I would select, in addition to those
   already mentioned, "The Voices of Creation," "The Good Shepherd," and
   "Labourers in the Vineyard."

   I have used the eleventh edition of the Icelandic Sálmabók," and the
   edition of the "Passíusálmar," edited by Jónas Jónsson in 1907. The
   whole of these books I have gone over, as well as the hymns of the
   Icelandic Sunday School Hymn Book, published in Winnipeg, choosing
   those hymns for translation which made a personal appeal to me. I have
   also, besides the invaluable dictionaries of Zoëga, made use of Grímur
   Thomsen's edition of the Works of Hallgrim Petursson; of the article on
   Hallgrim Petursson appearing in the first number of the Icelandic
   Paper, Bjarmi; of Matthías Jochumsson's "Ljothmæli"; of Vigfusson and
   Powell's "Icelandic Prose Reader"; of Annandale's, "The Faroes and
   Iceland"; and of Collingwood and Stefansson's, "The Saga-steads of
   Iceland."

   I most gladly acknowledge the encouragement and help which I have
   received from friends, and especially the unfailing kindness of the
   Rev. Jón Bjarnason, D.D., Pastor of the leading Icelandic Church in
   Winnipeg. Not only have I gathered much information from various
   numbers of the Icelandic Church Paper, Sameiningin, of which he is
   Editor, and received valuable knowledge by correspondence, but I have
   had the privilege of being his guest at Winnipeg, when he put at my
   disposal his unique library, as well as his own profound knowledge of
   Icelandic Literature.

   If these translations from the hymns of Iceland are able to draw out
   the brotherly interest of English-speaking Christians towards that
   Church and people, whose best spirits are fighting the battle against
   twentieth-century rationalism and materialism without the encouragement
   which we derive from our numbers, and without the inspiration of our
   unique constructive and devotional religious literature, I shall not
   have worked in vain.

INTRODUCTION
     __________________________________________________________________

  HALLGRIM PETURSSON

   Nearly two hundred and fifty years ago, in a lonely Icelandic
   farm-house a leper lay dying. Outside the doors of the cottage Nature
   was lavish in her gifts of beauty. To the west the waters of the
   Whalefirth widened towards the Greenland Sea and the sunset. To the
   east they narrowed into a girdle of hill and fell, forming a
   land-locked bay, scene of exploits told in one of the Sagas of long
   ago. But within the cottage all was bare and comfortless. The membrane
   of the primitive window rattled in the autumn wind, while on the wooden
   locker-bed, built into the wall of the house, amidst the heart-breaking
   squalor of his disease, the leper lay dying. But look! his lips are
   moving, and, as we listen, we hear him pour forth in his beautiful
   language a hymn bright with the deathless hope of Christ's Gospel, glad
   with the assurance of a speedy release from the bondage of corruption
   into the glorious liberty of the children of God. It was the man's
   swan-song. Not long afterwards, by the quiet hand of death, he gained
   his heart's desire.

   Such must have been, as in imagination we reconstruct the scene from
   the knowledge at our disposal, the passing of Hallgrim Petursson, the
   sacred singer of Iceland. It was a notable example of the victory of
   the spirit over the flesh, of the triumph of the Christian in his hour
   of deepest physical need. Small wonder that this was the man who out of
   his poverty left to his countrymen one of the most precious legacies
   which they have ever received--those Passion-Hymns, which Iceland
   hearts will cherish, as a poet of their own has said, "as long as the
   sun shines upon the cold Jokull."

   Hallgrim Petursson was born in the year 1614. His youth was cast in one
   of the stirring periods of Icelandic history. The breath of the
   Reformation was breathing upon the dead bones and waking them to life.
   Odd Gottskalksson had published his Icelandic New Testament in 1540,
   six years before the death of Luther--a version of which Gudbrand
   Vigfusson could write: "It is well worthy to stand by the side of that
   of Tyndal or Luther, and higher praise could hardly be given to it."
   Bishop Gudbrand of Holar had brought out his complete edition of the
   Icelandic Bible in 1584, and was issuing hymns and other religious
   literature from his press. It was in this bracing atmosphere that
   Hallgrim spent his early years, his father being sexton of the
   Cathedral at Holar. Here doubtless were sown in the boy's heart those
   seeds which later were to bear such abundant fruit.

   But the harvest was not yet. Possibly owing to some youthful
   indiscretion, the young Hallgrim was sent from the school at Holar to
   Copenhagen. Here, in the great city, the boy's talents were in imminent
   danger of being lost. But divine providence was watching over him.
   Brynjolf Sveinsson, later to become one of the most famous of Icelandic
   Bishops, found him in a blacksmith's shop, and with quick eye
   discerning the gold beneath the grime, put him again to school.

   His education in Copenhagen was continued until an event occurred which
   was to cast its influence over his whole life. It was in the year 1627,
   the year of Bishop Gudbrand's death, that four ships from North Africa,
   three of them being corsairs from Algiers, fell upon the defenceless
   coast of Iceland. The main attack was delivered upon the Island of
   Heimaey, the chief of the Westman group. The wanton and inhuman
   atrocities committed by the pirates so burnt themselves into the memory
   of the unfortunate inhabitants, that Mr. Nelson Annandale relates that
   during his six weeks' stay at Heimaey in the year 1898 he heard almost
   daily of the raid. Between three and four hundred persons were taken
   captives chiefly by the Algerians, and sold as slaves in the market at
   Algiers. Many suffered great cruelty, largely in the form of
   persecution for their faith. They were "chained in insupportable
   positions, beaten on the hands and faces, exposed naked in public
   places, and again beaten until they lost the power of speech." At
   length, however, an Icelander was allowed to carry a petition to the
   King of Denmark, asking for 1,200 rix-dollars as a ransom price for the
   surviving captives. A subscription was raised in Iceland, to which the
   King of Denmark himself largely contributed. This was paid over in due
   course, and in 1637, ten years after the raid, thirty-four survivors
   out of the hundreds taken were set at liberty.

   Some of these people broke their homeward journey at Copenhagen, and
   here it is that Hallgrim Petursson again comes into the story. During
   their enforced sojourn in North Africa, these survivors seem to have
   become more or less infected with Mohammedanism, or at least to have
   let a part of their Christian faith slip away into the limbo of
   forgetfulness. It was necessary to remedy this state of things, and to
   do so an Icelander, learned in Christian truth, but resident at
   Copenhagen, was needed. Hallgrim Petursson, now a distinguished
   theological student, fulfilled these conditions, and was forthwith
   appointed by the authorities to be the religious instructor of his
   rescued compatriots.

   Among the captives was a lady, Gudrid by name, who by her beauty had
   already attracted the attention of the son of the Dey of Algiers. The
   young prince had even wished to marry her. This, of course, could not
   be tolerated, and the source of temptation was sent out of the country
   among the other ransomed slaves. Gudrid thus became a member of the
   group which was confided to the pastoral care of Hallgrim Petursson. It
   was perhaps not unnatural that he in his turn should become a captive
   to those charms which had already proved too potent for the Algerian
   Prince. Such was the infatuation of the unfortunate man, that although
   Gudrid had been a married woman in Iceland before the raid, and
   although, for all that was known to the contrary, her husband was still
   living there, Hallgrim determined to leave Copenhagen and to sail back
   to Iceland with Gudrid. Upon their arrival in that country they
   remained together, and at length, hearing of the husband's death, were
   married.

   This conduct was the great blot upon Hallgrim's life. He did not go
   unpunished. The sweet fruit became bitter in his mouth. The Mohammedan
   leanings of his wife were through long years a pain and grief to his
   sensitive nature. Nor did his conscience keep silence.


   "Lord, I have sown the seed of sin;

   Hideous have my transgressions been."

   So he sings in one of his Passion-Hymns, and it has been thought that
   the words bear a special reference to this episode of his career. This
   sin may have been in a sense the beata culpa, which, with its attendant
   remorse, drove him to the Cross for that gift of pardon and renewal, of
   which he was afterwards to sing so peerlessly to his countrymen.

   Hallgrim Petursson was ordained in 1644 and was in 1650 appointed to
   the parish of Saurby on the Whalefirth in the south-west of Iceland.
   Here he gave himself largely to the exercise of his poetic gift,
   writing much religious verse; and it was here that, inspired by the
   example of Paul Gerhardt in Germany and of Kingo in Denmark, he
   achieved his greatest work in the composition of the immortal
   Passion-Hymns. They appeared in the year 1659, a first copy of the
   manuscript being sent to the daughter of that Bishop Brynjolf Sveinsson
   who had formerly befriended him in Copenhagen. But the singer of
   Christ's Passion was soon himself to pass through a very furnace of
   affliction. He contracted the dread disease of leprosy. This he bore
   with exemplary fortitude, and passed away after a lingering illness in
   the glory of an unclouded hope. He died at Ferstikla near the parsonage
   of Saurby in the year 1674.

   The Passion-Hymns are fifty in number. They tell the story of Christ's
   sufferings from the moment when the Master sang the Pascal Hymn with
   His disciples in the Upper Room until the military watch was set and
   the seal made fast upon His tomb. Each hymn consists, as a rule, of
   from fifteen to twenty stanzas. The poet begins by paraphrasing the
   biblical narrative of that incident in the Passion Story with which he
   is about to deal. He thus accomplishes what is achieved in Oratorio by
   the recitative. He then passes on to meditation, exhortation, prayer or
   praise. The hymns were written to be sung, generally speaking, to
   German chorales of the sixteenth century. With these tunes of stately
   dignity they naturally blend. To sing them to lighter modern airs would
   jar on the ear as a kind of sacrilege. In fact, to fully appreciate the
   hymns, it is necessary to hear them sung to these slow and majestic
   melodies from the times of Luther, which give free play and scope to
   the beauty of the Icelandic vowel sounds.

   In former days it was the custom in the scattered farm-houses of
   Iceland to sing the Passion-Hymns through during Lent. This custom is
   still to some extent observed, as, for instance, in the chief Icelandic
   Church in Winnipeg. Nor can a better preparation for Good Friday, the
   "Long Fast Day," as it is called by the Icelanders, be well imagined.
   The practice however is not as universal as it was, partly owing to the
   indifference which pervades so much of the modern world, and partly
   through the prevalence of views in recent years, which, as an Icelandic
   clergyman has pointed out, "must make the Passion-Hymns of Hallgrim
   Petursson die upon the lips." It is however still true to say that this
   singer of the Cross is the outstanding poet of his people. His hymns
   have been called "The flower of all Icelandic poetry." He is still sung
   and quoted with reverence and with affection. He holds his position, we
   might almost say, as the Shakespeare or the Milton of his native land.

   If we seek the reasons for the spell which the Passion-Hymns have cast
   over the heart of Iceland for nearly two centuries and a half, we shall
   not have to look far for an answer. It is true that the range of
   thought is not wide, that the style is sometimes almost irritatingly
   didactic, and that the charm of colouring from nature through metaphor
   or simile is conspicuous only by its absence. The Passion-Hymns
   possess, however, one mighty secret. In exquisite Icelandic the poet
   dwells upon the benefits procured for sinful man by Christ's Passion.
   He isolates (and surely we may forgive him for doing so) each
   particular suffering which the Redeemer underwent, and shows the gain
   wrought for man thereby. Was Christ left alone in His hour of need? It
   was that we might never be forsaken. Was Christ clothed in a robe of
   mockery? It was that we might be arrayed in a robe of glory. Was Christ
   hounded to death with the cry of "Crucify Him?" It was that heaven and
   earth might over us call "peace." Were Christ's feet pierced? It was
   that the sins of our wayward feet might be forgiven. Was Christ's side,
   as Adam's, opened? It was that His Bride, the Church, in that healing
   stream of Water and of Blood, might be born. The Passion of Christ is
   the adoring poet's theme. Now in homely teaching, now in pathetic
   prayer, now in rapturous praise, he "placards" Christ Crucified before
   his countrymen. He raised, as it were, a mighty crucifix of song over
   Iceland, and thither, for nearly two centuries and a half, the weary
   and the heavy laden have turned their eyes. He sang the theme of the
   ages, and his song has become immortal.

   Matthías Jochumsson, the leading poet of modern Iceland, has written a
   beautiful ode to commemorate the bicentenary of Hallgrim Petursson's
   death. He therein speaks of him as "the David of this land of Jokulls."
   He calls him a light "who lightened two centuries." He tells us that
   from the time when the child first says his prayers at his mother's
   knee, until the day when as an old man he turns him to his last sleep,
   it is Hallgrim's hymns which have power to soothe and to heal. And when
   Matthías Jochumsson is describing in another poem the passing of
   Gudbrand Vigfusson, the great Icelander of Oxford, he pictures him
   lying with the Havamal^[45][1] at his head, Heimskringla at his breast,
   but the Passion-Hymns at his heart. That is their secret. The
   Passion-Hymns have spoken to the heart of Iceland.

   ^[46][1]Readers of Longfellow's "Saga of King Olaf," in the "Tales from
   a Wayside Inn," will need no explanation of these terms.

  THE MODERN ICELANDIC HYMN BOOK AND BISHOP VALDIMAR BRIEM

   The present Hymn Book of the Icelandic Lutheran Church appeared first
   in the year 1886. It is the fourth in order since the Reformation.
   First came the Grallari (from the Latin "Graduale") of 1594--a book
   which maintained its position as the official Icelandic Church Book for
   two centuries. The Evangelisk-Kristileg Sálmabók followed in 1801, a
   work of a mildly rationalistic type. In 1871 a new hymn book appeared,
   which was an improvement on its predecessor. At last in 1886 the
   present book was authorized, a book which won immediate recognition as
   a vast improvement on all its predecessors, a book which, speaking
   generally, contains what was best in them with much admirable new
   material besides.

   On examination one remarkable feature is revealed. The book contains
   650 hymns. Of this entire number, two men alone are responsible for
   353, Helgi Hálfdánarson for 211, and Bishop Valdimar Briem for 142.
   Each of these two writers makes his characteristic contribution. The
   work of the former consisted in making available for the Icelandic
   Church, flowers culled from the wider field of Lutheran Hymnology.
   Helgi Hálfdánarson excelled as a translator. Not only did he translate
   hymns, untranslated into Icelandic before, but he retranslated hymns,
   faulty versions of which had appeared in the previous Icelandic Hymn
   Books. The present book owes an immense debt to this work of his.

   The characteristic contribution, on the other hand, of Bishop Valdimar
   Briem lies in his original hymns. Of these the book contains 106, and
   they may be said to form its most outstanding feature. It was through
   these hymns mainly that the new book achieved its immediate popularity.
   The editor of Sameiningin wrote: "Icelandic sacred poetry has been
   raised to new honour. For that our people have chiefly Valdimar Briem
   to thank." Valdimar Briem takes his place beside Hallgrim Petursson.

   This pastor-poet's outward life has been uneventful. Born at Grund,
   near the Eyjafjörthur, in 1848, he was sent at the age of ten (being
   one of a large family) to live with an uncle. In 1863 he entered the
   Latin School at Reykjavik, and in 1870 was transferred to the
   Theological College. He was ordained priest in 1873. Subsequently he
   was appointed to Stórinúpur, a little country charge about fifteen
   miles to the north-west of the famous volcano of Hekla, and there he
   still lives and writes, although raised recently to the episcopal rank.
   His output has been immense. He has published two volumes of "Bible
   Songs" (a collection of metrical pictures of biblical events), a volume
   of translations from the Psalms, a metrical paraphrase of the Book of
   Job, as well as hymns and many occasional poems. It is however in his
   hymns that he makes his chief appeal. As the Icelandic Hymn Book is
   scanned, it is they which first catch the eye and invite translation.

   And wherein lies their power? Not least in the wonderful music which
   the poet makes, playing on the instrument of his exquisitely musical
   language. His verses also live with the charm of nature, the grim charm
   of Icelandic nature. The long dark winter days, the biting frost, the
   barren surf-beaten coast, the blocking snow-drifts and the rushing
   torrents, have all left their impress on his hymns, as well as the fair
   Icelandic flowers, the summer sunlight, and the snow-capped mountain
   peaks. In this connection it is interesting to notice how often a kind
   of Christian melancholy sounds in these poems. Death and sorrow are
   mentioned more frequently than life and service, though always the
   heavenly hope shines through to lighten the darkness.

   Our author's special strength however lies in his original treatment of
   the parables and miracles of Our Lord. In this he excels. Is he writing
   on the parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard? He is not content to
   think of different men being called at different hours, but his voice
   rings out, "Remember that God calls you in baptism, in youth, in
   manhood, and in old age." Is he treating of the scene on the Mount of
   Transfiguration? He allegorizes it into a picture of the present
   prayer-life of the soul. Does he sing of the miracle at Cana? His hymn
   is an invitation to the Divine Guest to come into our hearts, there to
   transform sin into holiness. So noticeable is this feature of Bishop
   Briem's writing, that in the section of the Icelandic Hymn Book in
   which are grouped hymns on Christ's "Life and Teaching," those bearing
   the signature "V. B." vastly preponderate over those of any other
   Icelandic author.

   Perhaps we might fitly describe his chief work by saying that as
   Hallgrim Petursson was the singer of Our Lord's Death and Passion, so
   Valdimar Briem has sung of His Life.

GETHSEMANE

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   7.7.7.7.7.7


   Jesus in Gethsemane

   Bowed with mortal strife I see:

   Conscience stings me, for I know

   'Twas my sin constrained Him so:

   All that weight of agony

   God's Son underwent for me.


   Lo! my sin doth heavier lie

   E'en than earth and sea and sky:

   Jesus in His Father's name

   Bears this universal frame;

   Yet the Word of God falls low,

   When He bears sin's weight of woe.


   Thus Thou givest me, Lord, Thy peace;

   Comfort which can never cease:

   Greater that paid ransom's worth

   Unto God than heaven and earth:

   By Thine agony I win

   Certain pardon for my sin.

THE BONDS OF CHRIST

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   8.6.8.6 D


   Jesus, the Son of God, was bound

   That I might go forth free;

   He, chafed with cruel fetters, found

   Unbounded grace for me:

   Around His wrists the cords of pain

   Harsh, agonizing, lay:

   From me in that dread hour sin's chain

   Unfastened fell away.


   Lord, let the bonds that bound Thee hold

   Me bound in bondage pure,

   Kept mid temptations manifold,

   Shut from the world's allure;

   That so my will, untrammelled, free,

   Whiles here I dwell below,

   May aye Thy ready servant be.

   This boon, dear Lord, bestow!
     __________________________________________________________________

"THIS IS YOUR HOUR"

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   8.6.8.6


   Lo! now is the accepted time!

   Heed thou God's call to-day!

   E'en while we sing salvation's hour

   Glides noiselessly away.


   Give heed, for that one hour misused

   Thine endless doom decides;

   On Him, who such salvation spurns,

   The wrath of God abides.


   More dread the punishment must fall

   When mercy's day is o'er,

   Upon that man with whom God's love

   Most patiently forbore.


   Take heed unto thyself, my soul;

   To hoard thy sin relent;

   Behold yon quickly westering sun;

   Delay no more; repent.


   Perchance the hour of grace divine

   This night may pass away.

   Dear pardoning Lord, we leave our sin,

   We come to Thee, to-day.

THE WAY OF THE CROSS

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   7.6.7.6 D


   The pathway of Thy Passion

   To follow I desire;

   Out of my weakness fashion

   A character of fire.

   When the weak will sinks failing,

   And flesh starts back afraid,

   Before the dread Cross quailing,

   Lord, grant Thy Spirit's aid.
     __________________________________________________________________

"THE LORD TURNED AND LOOKED UPON PETER"

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   6.6.8.6


   Whene'er in act or word,

   Slighting Thy warning grace,

   Like Peter, I deny Thee, Lord,

   Toward me turn Thy face.


   Yea, Master, turn and look

   On me in love untold:

   Cast that same searching glance, which broke

   The Apostle's heart of old;


   Until with weeping eyes

   I gaze toward Thy heaven:

   Then, Saviour, speak the word, "Arise!

   Arise, restored, forgiven!"
     __________________________________________________________________

THE RECOMPENSE

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   8.6.8.6 D


   E'er since beneath God's open sky

   The wounded Saviour came,

   From Pilate's hall led forth to die

   Upon the Cross of Shame,

   For me the road has open lain

   To God's bright halls of day;

   The barrier of my sin Christ's pain

   For ever bore away.

A FATHER'S PRAYER

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   7.7.7.7.7.7


   Jesus, Lord, remember me;

   Ease my hour of mortal strife:

   Let my children find in Thee

   Guidance through this earthly life:

   Write, with those dear names I love,

   My name in Thy Book above.
     __________________________________________________________________

A PRAYER

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   8.8.8.8.8.8


   My life I draw, Lord, from Thy Death;

   Thy Cross my comfort perfecteth.

   O let Thy Passion's mighty power

   Work in my bosom from this hour,

   And crucify me, Lord, that I

   To Thee may live, to sin may die.
     __________________________________________________________________

"MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?"

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   8.7.8.7.8.8.7


   Forsaken of God on Calvary

   The Saviour Christ hung dying,

   That I might ne'er forsaken be,

   While on His death relying:

   Yea, for the sake of His lone cry,

   With ready ear the Lord Most High

   Will aye regard my crying.


   When from earth's light I pass away,

   Sight, hearing, sense declining,

   Father, recall Thy Son's dismay,

   For Thy felt presence pining;

   And by that cry from Calvary's tree

   Thy countenance uplift on me,

   With gracious welcome shining.
     __________________________________________________________________

A DOXOLOGY

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   10.10.10.10 D


   Thou art, O Christ, the everlasting Son!

   Thou, by Thy Death, for sinful man a share

   In Thy divine inheritance hast won,

   And made him with Thyself, God's Son, co-heir,--

   Thyself, the One Begotten of God's love!

   Therefore let all the sons of men upraise

   To Thee, God's Son, an anthem of high praise,

   Through endless days, in earth and heaven above.

"THERE SHALL BE A FOUNTAIN OPENED FOR SIN AND FOR UNCLEANNESS" (Zech. xiii.
1.)

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   9.8.9.8.9.8


   Beneath the Cross of Jesus kneeling,

   Dawns on my soul the endless day;

   There, deeper than all tides of feeling,

   Doth God His boundless grace display;

   Thence flow the mystic waves of healing;

   There all my stains are washed away.


   God wrought for man, His love forth-shewing,

   When Moses smote the rock of old;

   And, lo, through Israel's camp on-flowing,

   Out brake the longed-for flood, and rolled,

   New strength, new joy, new life bestowing,

   On lips that quaffed it, pure and cold.


   God wrought for man, mankind redeeming,

   When Christ was pierced by Roman spear,

   And, o'er the thirsty world down-streaming,

   Forth gushed a fountain, cool and clear,

   Till souls, beside those waters gleaming,

   Forgot in joy sin's desert drear.


   Beside that well for aye abiding,

   New strength, new joy, new life I gain;

   Within that cleft securely hiding,

   No care can cark, no sorrow stain;

   Here rests the blissful soul confiding,

   Here faith the healing draught can drain.


   Lord, let my heart, this gift receiving,

   Beat one glad anthem to Thy praise;

   And may the stream, Thy pierced heart leaving

   Refresh and heal me all my days:

   Thus by Thy blood my life retrieving,

   A psalm of endless thanks I'll raise.

GOD'S GARDEN

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   8.8.8.8.8.8


   Behold God's Garden! Resting here

   Soft sleep till dawn God's children dear.

   Whene'er thou passest by this place

   Breathe low a fervent prayer for grace.

   Death ponder; then, with hope up-borne,

   Think on the Resurrection Morn.

THE ICELANDIC BURIAL HYMN

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   7.6.7.6 D


   I know that my Redeemer

   Lives crowned upon the throne;

   Lord over earth and heaven

   He saves, and He alone;

   He conquered death by dying

   Upon the accursed tree,

   And from His death sprang glorious

   Eternal life for me.


   Christ conquered death by dying--

   Jesu, Thy mortal pain

   O'erthrew the King of Terrors

   And brake the captive's chain.

   What though this earthly body

   Obey Death's dread behest?

   The soul soars free rejoicing

   To mansions of the blest.


   I think upon my Saviour,

   I trust His power to keep,

   His mighty arm enfolds me

   Awaking and in sleep.

   Christ is my rock, my courage;

   Christ is my soul's true life;

   And Christ (my still heart knows it)

   Will bear me through the strife.


   Thus in Christ's name I'm living;

   Thus in Christ's name I'll die;

   I'll fear not though life's vigour

   From Death's cold shadow fly.

   O Grave, where is thy triumph?

   O Death, where is thy sting?

   "Come when thou wilt, and welcome!"

   Secure in Christ I sing.

HALLGRIM PETURSSON'S DEATH-BED HYMN

   Hallgrim Petursson (1614-1674)

   10.10.10.10


   Come, Lord, Thyself with Thine abounding grace;

   Mine utmost depth of need Thine eyes can trace:

   Thou, Lord, through life's long way my Guard and Guide;

   Let not Thy pilgrim's last tired footsteps slide.


   Upon my sight dark dawns the rising day;

   Faint fall the sounds of earth, and far away:

   None, none can aid; by death's lone, narrow door,

   I pass beyond man's help for evermore.


   None, none can aid but Thou, Almighty Lord;

   I stay me on Thine everlasting Word;

   Let earth decay, heaven's far-flung glories pale,

   Jehovah's plighted word can never fail.


   Within the Eternal Arms I sink to rest,

   Washed in the stream that flowed from Jesus' breast:

   The life Thou gavest, Father, now defend;

   Into Thine Hands my spirit I commend.


   Let the last psalm my dying voice can raise,

   Extol Thy loving-kindness, hymn Thy praise:

   Let the first notes my wakening lips can frame

   Amid the eternal glory, laud Thy Name.


   First, midst, and last, through that unclouded day,

   I would my Saviour's boundless grace display,

   And swell the anthems of the ransomed host,

   Adoring Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

THE VOICES OF CREATION

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   7.6.7.6 D


   How glorious is God's greatness!

   How marvellous God's might!

   To this the world bears witness

   In wonders day and night;

   In form of flower and snowflake,

   In morn's resplendent birth,

   In afterglow at even,

   In sky and sea and earth!


   Each tiny floweret whispers

   The great Life-giver's name;

   The mighty mountain masses

   His majesty proclaim;

   The hollow vales are hymning

   God's shelter for His own;

   The snow-capped peaks are pointing

   To God's almighty throne.


   The ocean's vast abysses

   In one grand psalm record

   The deep mysterious counsels

   And mercy of the Lord;

   The ice-cold waves of winter

   Are thundering on the strand,

   "E'en grief's chill stream is guided

   By God's all-gracious hand."


   The starry hosts are singing

   Through all the light-strewn sky,

   Of God's eternal Temple

   And Palace-courts on high.

   When, in these outer chambers,

   Such glory gilds the gloom,

   What the transcendent brightness

   Of God's own Presence Room!

AN AUTUMN HYMN^[47][2]

   Kaspar Johannes Boye (1791-1853)

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   8.6.8.6


   Full soon will fall the winter rain,

   Soon fade the green hill-side;

   With all thy glory, fare thee well,

   Thou radiant summer-tide.


   Full soon will wail the winter wind,

   Soon fail the flowers that blow;

   Let autumn blight the buds of earth,

   The flower of Hope doth grow!


   What though the sunlight wane? ne'er wanes

   The grace of Christ the Lord;

   Amid the gathering gloom shines on

   God's everlasting Word.


   Though leaf may wither, floweret fade,

   Though tiny grass blade pale;

   Our hearts can trust a surer truth--

   God's love shall never fail.


   Though winter chill each struggling herb,

   My gladness ne'er can cease;

   From Bethlehem calls a voice, "To you

   Is born the Prince of Peace."


   Upon my fairest trees of hope

   Lies cold a robe of snow;

   But from the Tree where Jesus died

   The Living Waters flow.


   Though fade the grass on hill and dale,

   Though ice bind stream and fell;

   My faith in Him shall never fail,

   Who burst the bonds of Hell.


   Good hope of everlasting spring

   His Church the Saviour gave.

   Rejoice! Rejoice! The Life Himself

   Is risen from the grave!

   ^[48][2]The Icelandic of Bishop Valdimar Briem is based on a Danish
   hymn by Kaspar Johannes Boye.

GOD'S BOOK OF NATURE

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   10.10.10.10


   This wondrous world, my God, a book I deem,

   Wherein the Author's heavenly glories shine:

   The petals of the wayside flowers meseem

   Its pages, pencilled o'er by hand divine.


   The sun that soars above the eastern deep

   Toward the realms celestial beckoneth me;

   The glowing orb, which westering sinks to sleep,

   Tells of eternal rest and peace with Thee.


   Within my breast fair spring's life-laden wind

   Kindles new hope in Thine abounding grace;

   The gathering gloom of autumn bids me find

   Within Thy sheltering arms my hiding place.


   The countless stars which gleam athwart the sky,

   Speak of Thine eyes which sleep not day nor night;

   While at my feet the earth-born flowers reply,

   "We live our lowly lives within God's sight."


   Grant me, dear Lord, to scan Thy works, until

   My heart their soothing ministry doth own.

   What though Thy might the flesh with awe instil?

   The spirit yearns to Thine all-gracious throne.

THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   10.10.10.10.10.10


   Oft in death's shadowy vale, like screen of night,

   Before life's Sun the driving cloud-mists blow;

   No way lies open to the halls of light,

   The passes stand deep blocked by drifted snow;

   Lord, ever let Thy heavens unclouded shine;

   Lighten Thy pilgrim's eyes with light divine.


   Oft in the narrow rock-girt paths of life,

   The weary will would fail, the strength would flee;

   I stagger weakened by the unceasing strife,

   Fainting I fall, unless Thou succour me:

   What time the o'erburdened spirit dreads defeat,

   O champion her, Thou heavenly Paraclete.


   Oft mid the noisy tumult of the world

   No more I hear the angels' healing song,

   Only the torrents' threatening roar, where hurled

   In rapids time's swift stream is borne along:

   Lord, o'er the surge of waters rude and wild,

   Grant me to hear Thy call, "My child! My child!"


   When o'er mine eyelids steals the long last sleep,

   Thy face's unveiled glory would I see;

   The weary flesh seeks rest in slumber deep,

   With might, O let my spirit strengthened be.

   Earth's voices fade; deep mid the peace of heaven,

   Speak, Lord, the assuring words, "Arise, forgiven!"

THE LAND BEYOND THE SEA

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   8.7.8.7 D


   I stand by the lonely breakers

   And gaze o'er the misty sea,

   Which wrapt in the clouds of winter

   Is heaving sullenly:

   'Tis a shore where gaunt Need reigneth,

   And Woe with her freezing breath;

   For the shore is the shore of the dying,

   And the sea is the sea of death.


   But far o'er the dim horizon

   There lieth a land that is fair;

   The sun with his gorgeous colours

   Is painting the cloud-banks there:

   There, robing the green hill-shoulders,

   The golden flowerets grow;

   And the fruit-trees' cloaks of blossom

   In the spicy breezes blow.


   Girt round with a mystic glory

   Fair palaces I behold,

   With many a sculptured pillar,

   With many a tower of gold;

   The hosts of the saved, resplendent

   In glistering white array,

   Mid rapture untold are thronging

   Those corridors of day.


   In silence I yearn as I listen

   To the far-off chime of bells:

   How nobly the voice of worship

   Through the heavenly Temple swells!

   I hark to the shout of the victors,

   I list to the angels' lays,

   As they sing to the Lord of Glory

   Grand anthems of endless praise.


   Speak! Is this a baseless fabric

   Reared high by the dreams of man?

   Nay! Nay! tis the fair fulfilment

   Of God's everlasting plan.

   Sure speaks the eternal promise,

   Sure works the almighty grace,

   Till the strife-men^[49][3] of earth are marshalled

   Triumphant before God's face.

   ^[50][3]"Strife-men" is a literal rendering of the Icelandic word
   meaning "soldiers."

THE DIVINE GUEST

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   8.6.8.6 D


   O Thou who madest water wine

   At Cana's festal board,

   Remember me, great Guest Divine,

   And speak the mighty word;

   The sin that taints life's mingled cup

   Transform to Christian grace;

   And for just anger, Lord, lift up

   The shining of Thy face.


   Thy time, O Christ, is not yet come

   Heaven's rapture to bestow;

   But grant that, exiled here from home,

   My heart may thither go:

   The earth-renewing sunshine sleeps

   Till winter's storms be passed;

   And so Thy wisdom, Saviour, keeps

   The good wine till the last.


   If Thou should'st deign my guest to be,

   Full well may I rejoice;

   Each anxious festal want shall flee

   Thine all-creating voice.

   Come sup with me on earth, dear Lord,

   Where tears with gladness blend,

   That I may join Thy heavenly board

   In bliss that knows no end.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE DIVINE PILOT

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   8.6.8.6 D


   When winds far-blown from realms of pain

   Lash sorrow's storm-waves high,

   Thou deemest, tossed on life's rough main,

   That death looms threatening by:

   Thou callest, "Christ, whose voice once curbed

   With power the raging deep,

   Where is Thy might? All-undisturbed

   Thou liest, O Lord, asleep."


   What though He seem to sleep? yea, e'en

   To slight thine anguished cries?

   Yield not to gaunt despair; serene

   Against the danger rise.

   He sleeps not. Nay! 'tis we that sleep:

   Untouched by slumber's power

   He watches. Would that we could keep

   Such watch with Him one hour!


   Behold Him rise in majesty!

   Shame on thy faithless fears!

   He stays the wind, He stills the sea,

   From off the rocks He steers.

   So watch, for 'tis Thy Lord's command,

   Thyself in calm or strife;

   For hard the task, and weak the hand,

   And short the course of life.


   Give heed to watch, give heed to pray,

   But scorn thy guilty fear,

   Though mighty billows night and day

   Their threatening crests uprear.

   What if untracked before thy face

   The watery wastes expand?

   The helm, through God's abounding grace,

   Lies in thy Saviour's hand.


   Midst black confusion of the storm,

   Midst moan of winds, He hears;

   And ever at the stern His Form,

   Majestic, God-like steers;

   Till onward past death's ice-bound strand,

   Where pain's wild breakers foam,

   He guides thee to that Blessed Land,

   Anchored in endless home.
     __________________________________________________________________

THE HOLY MOUNT

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   11.6.11.6 D


   What though this weary earth-born flesh lie fettered

   In prison-house of night?

   The spirit rises heavenward, upward ranging

   Toward the realms of light:

   Up to the ray-crowned peak her Lord she follows,

   With sin-purged eyes to scan

   From that clear height the fair far-spreading vistas

   Of God's redeeming plan.


   Yea, though the flesh, far-sundered from the dawning,

   Mid shades of death here lie,

   The soul upon the mount of faith ascending

   In prayer to heaven draws nigh.

   So high that hill that in the darkling distance

   Earth's troubles fade away;

   Close, close at hand the high things and the holy

   Stand forth in fair array.


   Far, far below, down in the earth-girt valley,

   Night broods upon the clod.

   Look up! along the mountain crest is breaking

   The glad sunrise of God.

   There hidden things are plain; there, vision-gifted,

   The eye may pierce the gloom

   Which curtains time and space, yea, rend the blackness

   That shrouds the unanswering tomb.


   On earth insistent sing the siren voices

   Which lure to carnal ease:

   There reigns the silence of a dream, the stillness

   Of the eternal peace.

   Time's voices fade; in awe I hear the beating

   Of God's great heart of love;

   While on my breast the dews of healing quiet

   Steal softly from above.


   So on the mountain summit, domed in glory,

   My pilgrim tent I'll raise:

   'Tis good for me, thus close to God abiding,

   To dwell through endless days;

   To catch some beams of that divine effulgence

   There from Christ's face outpoured,

   Until my face transfigured glow reflecting

   The glory of the Lord.


   Then, when death comes, a cloud of mystic brightness

   O'ershadowing shall draw near:

   Within its folds soft calling, "My beloved,"

   The Saviour's voice I'll hear.

   Yea, though death's chill mist shroud life's flowery valley,

   It hath no power to affright:

   I raise mine eyes, and near me Jesus only

   Stands in immortal light.

THE GOOD SHEPHERD

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   7.6.7.6 D


   Good Shepherd, Thou who gavest

   Thy life upon the Cross,

   A sacrifice to save us

   From sin's eternal loss,

   Grant us in dear remembrance

   Thy wondrous gift to keep,

   Bought by Thy blood and numbered,

   Saviour, among Thy sheep.


   Sure stands our steadfast comfort,

   For Thou our Shepherd art;

   With this bright faith no sorrow

   Can overwhelm the heart;

   Thou leadest forth Thy people

   Where living waters flow;

   With fruits celestial feedest

   On Calvary's Tree that grow.


   What though the wolf would drive us

   Far from this blissful ground?

   The Lord with arm of glory

   Doth compass us around;

   And over stream and mountain,

   Whene'er self-willed we roam,

   The Shepherd on His shoulders

   Rejoicing bears us home.


   One day in God's new heavens,

   Jerusalem above,

   Their Guide the sheep will follow,

   Drawn on with cords of love,

   Through life's immortal pastures,

   Through raptures all untold,

   One flock for everlasting,

   One Shepherd, and one fold.

THE PHARISEE AND THE PUBLICAN

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   8.8.8.8.8.8


   Unto God's House in olden day

   Two men together went to pray;

   This for his right deeds sought reward,

   That for mere mercy low implored.

   When in Thine House to Thee I cry,

   Lord, whether of the twain am I?


   Ofttimes I kneel, a Pharisee

   In sinful self-complacency,

   Though nought I have, and all I owe:

   Thy pardon, gracious Lord, bestow,

   And grant that humbler mind which stayed

   Far off in temple courts, and prayed.


   I dare not lift mine eyes on high

   To search the glories of the sky;

   But, seated on Thy throne of light,

   Thou, Lord, canst pierce this earthly night;

   Thine eyes can count each contrite tear,

   No sigh but finds Thy listening ear.


   My breast I smite in sorrow sore,

   And lo! I knock at Mercy's door:

   Be each unlocked--my breast to Thee,

   Thy Kingdom's boundless realm to me:

   So make my heart, from sin washed pure,

   Thy Kingdom, Lord, for evermore.

LABOURERS IN THE VINEYARD

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   7.6.7.6.8.8


   What time life's early morning

   Is purpling in thy sky,

   And on thy brow lies glistening

   With glory from on high

   The font's fresh dew, Thy Lord doth say,

   "Go! In my Vineyard work to-day."


   At the third hour, when gorgeous

   The sun of youth doth rise,

   And life's entrancing glamour

   Allures thy wondering eyes,

   Remember! Still He calleth thee

   To tend His Vineyard faithfully.


   At noon when all-reluctant

   The hard-pressed toilers work,

   Hark! Still that Voice is calling;

   One task thou dar'st not shirk--

   To make that vine-row wondrous fair,

   Which He hath trusted to thy care.


   At the last hour He calleth,

   When westering sinks life's sun,

   And sable twilight falleth

   E'er half the task be done:

   While the last fading day-beams shine

   Toil on! toil on in strength divine.


   At night the Lord His workmen

   Himself doth homeward lead:

   Each wins the self-same wages,

   Eternal life the meed.

   God! 'Tis Thy gift, not our reward!

   All merit flows from Christ the Lord!

A WHITSUNTIDE HYMN

   Valdimar Briem (1848-1930)

   11.10.11.10 D


   Lord, let Thy Spirit, from earthly passion weaning,

   Lead me along Thy will's all-holy way,

   To find, by faith on Jesus' bosom leaning,

   'Mid trial, doubt, and need, in Him my stay.


   Lord, let Thy Spirit, Thy Word's deep wealth unsealing,

   Lighten mine eyes with truth's celestial fire;

   In life, in death, the narrow path revealing

   Towards the Promised Land of our desire.


   Lord, let Thy Spirit, new love, new life bestowing,

   Create a holy heart my breast within;

   That I, into my Saviour's likeness growing,

   May bear His image through a world of sin.


   Lord, let Thy Spirit, each idol form down-tearing,

   Cast from my soul the thoughts, the sins that stain;

   Within those walls a temple meet preparing,

   Where Jesus evermore may dwell, and reign.

THE SUMMER GIFT^[51][4]

   Björn Halldórsson (1821-1882)

   7.6.7.6 D


   Let Thy summer gift, O Lord,

   Pardon be, and peace and power:

   Sun of Life Divine, abroad

   All Thy healing radiance shower.


   This world's sun before our eyes

   Chases far cold winter's night:

   Jesu, Sun of Grace, arise;

   Shed on us Thy heavenly light.

VESPER HYMN^[53][5]

   Páll Jónsson

   7.6.7.6 D


   On the wings of light declining

   Sinks the westering sun to sleep:

   Lord, alike in dark or shining,

   Thy pure eyes their vigil keep.

   Let Thy light, which faileth never,

   Round me shine, though day depart;

   And, though night prevaileth, ever

   Flood the chambers of my heart.

   ^[54][5]After the Icelandic of Páll Jónsson, A.D. 1889.

AN EVENING HYMN^[55][6]

   Arnór Jónsson

   7.6.7.6 D


   The sun sinks o'er the western sea,

   Swift fades the light of day;

   Thus ends another stage for me

   Of life's soon travelled way.


   Whether athwart the eastern skies,

   With morning glories strown,

   A new-born day for me shall rise,

   God knows, and God alone.


   Enough for me to know that life

   Moves to its certain goal,

   And that the hour of mortal strife

   My Father's hands control.


   Enough to feel (and so in peace

   To rest, dear Lord, I go);

   Thy care for me can never cease,

   Thy love ne'er weary grow.


   Father of love, to Thee we bow;

   Do Thou in mercy keep

   Our land, our home in peace, as now

   We lay us down to sleep.

   ^[56][6]After the Icelandic of Arnór Jónsson, A.D. 1853.

AN EASTER HYMN^[57][7]

   Helgi Hálfdánarson (1826-1894)

   7.6.7.6 D


   Death is dead, the true Life liveth!

   O'er the portals of the grave

   Life's great Sun bright-shining giveth

   Light our darkened souls to save:

   Christ arisen bursts our prison;

   See His triumph-banners wave.


   Life's own King on Calvary dying

   Wins a crown of life for me;

   E'en the grave to Him complying

   Flowers in life abundant free;

   Death's chill sadness changed to gladness--

   This the Easter victory!


   He who rose from death all-glorious

   Soon will gather to His side

   Those who sleep in Him, victorious

   By the blood His wounds supplied;

   Flesh and spirit, through His merit,

   Reunited, glorified.


   Jesu, death's Destroyer, make me

   Day by day to die with Thee;

   Thus, with Thee arising, take me

   Thine through all the days to be--

   Thine for ever, faithless never--

   This my prayer unceasingly.

   ^[58][7]After the Icelandic of Helgi Hálfdánarson.

AN EVENING INTERCESSION^[59][8]

   Matthías Jochumsson

   7.6.7.6 D


   O Lord, my soul's true Sun, to rest

   Day's orb is sinking in the West;

   As earth's light fades, upon my sight

   Let dawn Thy everlasting light.


   Come breathe on us a holy peace;

   Bid every haunting fear to cease;

   Our sin-sick spirits heal, and aid

   Thy servants in Thine image made.


   Dear Saviour, seek each wandering child,

   Lost on the snow-waste bare and wild,

   Until he taste, no more to roam,

   The warm love of the Father's home.


   Thou knowest, Lord, each secret need;

   The hungry from Thy bounty feed;

   Spare hearts too weak to conquer wrong,

   And in Thy strength, O make them strong.


   On all who stray with blinded sight

   Mid heathen darkness day and night,

   Uplift the shining of Thy face,

   And show them Jesus' throne of grace.


   O let Thy light with power imbue

   Each withered soul to flower anew;

   Thy spirit grant mid earthly strife,

   Blest earnest of eternal life.

   ^[60][8]After the Icelandic of Matthías Jochumsson.

ICELANDIC MILLENNIAL HYMN^[61][9]

   Matthías Jochumsson (1835-1920)

   7.6.7.6 D


   God of our land, our father's God, receive

   The hymn we raise to Thine all-holy name.

   Thy crown the ministering ages weave

   Of suns celestial, galaxies of flame.

   To Thee one day is as a thousand years,

   A thousand years to Thee are but a day,

   A flower of endless time, bedewed with tears,

   Which glorifies its God, and fades away--

   Our thousand years,

   A flower of endless time, bedewed with tears,

   Which glorifies its God and fades away.


   God of our Iceland, now with burning heart

   We offer Thee this sacrifice of praise;

   From age to age Thou, Lord, our Father art;

   Our holy anthem unto Thee we raise:

   To Thee, as now are told our thousand years,

   We sing, for other refuge have we none:

   To Thee our voices lift, midst falling tears,

   Great Shaper of our lot, whilst ages run.

   Our thousand years!

   Midst gloom of morning twilight, lo! our tears,

   Lit with the glory of the rising sun.


   God of our land, our father's God, behold!

   We are but fading flower and withering grass;

   If Thou be not our light and life, to mould,

   After spring's transient gleam, we fade and pass.

   Be, Lord, each morn a spring of endless life;

   Our Captain midst the battle of the day;

   At eve our heavenly resting place from strife,

   The Leader of Thy people's pilgrim way.

   Our thousand years!

   Increase the nation! Wipe away all tears!

   We join the Host of God towards the day!

   Robert Scott, Paternoster Row, London, E.C.

   ^[62][9]After the Icelandic of Matthías Jochumsson.
