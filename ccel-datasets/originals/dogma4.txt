  THE DOCTRINE OF THE HOMOUSIA OF THE SON OF GOD WITH GOD HIMSELF. [2]

   Is the Divine which appeared on the earth and has made its presence
   actively felt, identical with the supremely Divine that rules heaven
   and earth? Did the Divine which appeared on the earth enter into a
   close and permanent union with human nature, so that it has actually
   transfigured it and raised it to the plane of the eternal? These two
   questions necessarily arose out of the combination of the incarnation
   of the Logos and the deification of the human nature (See Vol. III., p.
   289 ff.) Along with the questions, however, the answers too were given.
   But it was only after severe conflicts that these answers were able to
   establish themselves in the Church as dogmas. The reasons of the delay
   in their acceptance have been partly already indicated in Vol. III.,
   pp. 167 ff. and will further appear in what follows. In the fourth
   century the first question was the dominant one in the Church, and in
   the succeeding centuries the second. We have to do with the first to
   begin with. It was finally answered at the so-called Second OEcumenical
   Council, 381, more properly in the year 383. The Council of Nicæa (325)
   and the death of Constantine (361) mark off the main stages in the
   controversy.

   their editions, and those of Tillemont form the basis of the more
   recent works also, and so far they have not been surpassed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   1. FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTROVERSY TO THE COUNCIL OF NICÆA.

   At the great Oriental Council which met at Antioch about the year 268,
   the Logos doctrine was definitely accepted, while the "Homoousios" on
   the other hand was rejected. [3] The most learned man whom the East at
   that time possessed, Lucian (of Samosata) took up the work of the
   excommunicated metropolitan, Paul of Samosata. First educated at the
   school of Edessa, where since the days of Bardesanes a free and
   original spirit had prevailed, then a follower of Paul, he got from the
   latter his dislike to the theology of "the ancient teachers", and with
   this he united the critical study of the Bible, a subject in which he
   became a master. He founded in Antioch an exegetical-theological school
   which, during the time of the three episcopates of Domnus, Timäus and
   Cyril, was not in communion with the Church there, but which
   afterwards, shortly before the martyrdom of Lucian, made its peace with
   the Church.

   This school is the nursery of the Arian doctrine, and Lucian, its head,
   is the Arius before Arius. Lucian started from the Christology of Paul,
   but, following the tendency of the time, and perhaps also because he
   was convinced on exegetical grounds, he united it with the Logos
   Christology, and so created a fixed form of doctrine. [4] It is
   probable that it was only gradually he allowed the Logos doctrine to
   have stronger influence on the Adoptian form. This explains why it was
   not till towards the end of his life that he was able to bridge over
   his differences with the Church. He was revered by his pupils both as
   the teacher par excellence, and in his character as ascetic; his
   martyrdom, which occurred in the year 311 or 312, increased his
   reputation. The remembrance of having sat at the feet of Lucian was a
   firm bond of union amongst his pupils. After the time of persecution
   they received influential ecclesiastical posts. [5] There was no longer
   anything to recall the fact that their master had formerly been outside
   of the Church. These pupils as a body afterwards came into conflict
   more or less strongly with the Alexandrian theology. So far as we know,
   no single one of them was distinguished as a religious character; but
   they knew what they wanted; they were absolutely convinced of the truth
   of their school-doctrine, which had reason and Scripture on its side.
   This is what characterises the school. At a time when the Church
   doctrine was in the direst confusion, and was threatening to disappear,
   and when the union of tradition, Scripture, and philosophical
   speculation in the form of dogma had been already called for, but had
   not yet been accomplished, this school was conscious of possessing an
   established system of doctrine which at the same time permitted
   freedom. This was its strength. [6]

   The accounts of Lucian's Christology which have been handed down are
   meagre enough, still they give us a sufficiently clear picture of his
   views. God is One; there is nothing equal to Him; for everything
   besides Him is created. He has created the Logos or Wisdom--who is to
   be distinguished from the inner divine Logos--out of the things that
   are not (ex ouk onton), and sent him into the world. [7] This Logos has
   taken a human body though not a human soul, and accordingly all the
   feelings and spiritual struggles of Christ are to be attributed to the
   Logos. Christ has made known the Father to us, and by being man and by
   his death has given us an example of patience. This exhausts his work,
   by means of which--for so we may complete the thought--he, constantly
   progressing, has entered into perfect glory. It is the doctrine of Paul
   of Samosata, but instead of man it is a created heavenly being who here
   becomes "Lord". Lucian must have put all the emphasis on the "out of
   the things that are not" (ex ouk onton) and on the "progress"
   (prokope). The creaturehood of the Son, the denial of his co-eternity
   with the Father, and the unchangeableness of the Son achieved by
   constant progress and constancy, constitute the main articles in the
   doctrine of Lucian and his school. Just because of this he refuses to
   recognise in the Son the perfectly equal image of the ousia or
   substance of the Father (Philost. II. 15). [8] There can be no doubt as
   to the philosophy to which Lucian adhered. He worked with the means
   supplied by the critical and dialectic philosophy of Aristotle,
   although indeed his conception of God was Platonic, and though his
   Logos doctrine had nothing in common with the teaching of Aristotle.
   His opponents have expressly informed us that his pupils turned to
   account the Aristotelian philosophy. [9] If one recollects that in the
   third century the Theodotian-Adoptian Christology was founded by the
   help of what was supplied by Aristotelianism, and that the Theodotians
   were also given to the critical study of the Bible, [10] the connection
   between Arianism and Adoptianism thus becomes clear. It is incorrect to
   trace the entire opposition between the Orthodox and the Arians to the
   opposition between Platonism and Aristotelianism, incorrect if for no
   other reason because a strong Platonic element is contained in what
   they possess in common--namely, the doctrine of God and of the Logos;
   but it is correct to say that the opposition cannot be understood if
   regard is not had to the different philosophical methods employed. [11]
   In Lucian's teaching Adoptianism is combined [12] with the doctrine of
   the Logos as a creature (ktisma), and this form of doctrine is
   developed by the aid of the Aristotelian philosophy and based on the
   critical exegesis of the Bible. Aristotelian Rationalism dominated the
   school. The thought of an actual redemption was put in the background.
   The Christian interest in monotheism is exhausted by the statement that
   the predicate "underived" attaches to one single being only. This
   interest in the "unbegotten begetter", and also, what is closely
   connected with it, the ranging of all theological thoughts under the
   antithesis of first cause or God, and creation, are also Aristotelian.
   Theology here became a "Technology", that is, a doctrine of the
   unbegotten and the begotten [13] which was worked out in syllogisms and
   based on the sacred codex.

   A pupil of Lucian named Arius, perhaps a Lybian by birth, became when
   already well up in years, first deacon in Alexandria, and afterwards
   presbyter in the church of Baukalis. The presbyters there at that
   period still possessed a more independent position than anywhere else.
   [14] Owing, however, to the influence of the martyr bishop Peter (+
   311) a tendency had gained ascendency in the episcopate in Alexandria,
   which led to Christian doctrine being sharply marked off from the
   teachings of Greek philosophy (mathemata tes Hellenikes philosophias)
   the presence of which had been observed in Origen, and in general
   shewed itself in a distrust of "scientific" theology, while at the same
   time the thought of the distinction between the Logos and the Father
   was given a secondary place. [15] Arius nevertheless fearlessly
   advanced the views he had learned from Lucian. The description we get
   of him is that of a man of grave appearance and a strict ascetic, but
   at the same time affable and of a prepossessing character, though vain.
   He was highly respected in the city; the ascetics and the virgins were
   specially attached to him. His activity had been recognised also by the
   new bishop Alexander who began his episcopate in 313. The outbreak of
   the controversy is wrapped in obscurity, owing to the fact that the
   accounts are mutually contradictory. According to the oldest testimony
   it was an opinion expressed by Arius when questioned by the bishop on a
   certain passage of Scripture, and to which he obstinately adhered,
   which really began the controversy, [16] possibly in the year 318.
   Since the persecution had ceased, the Christological question was the
   dominant one in the Alexandrian Church. Arius was not the first to
   raise it. On the contrary he was able later on to remind the bishop how
   the latter had often both in the Church and in the Council of
   Presbyters (en mese te ekklesia kai sunedrio pleistakis) refuted the
   Valentinian Christology, according to which the Son is an
   emanation,--the Manichæan, according to which the Son is a
   consubstantial part of the Father (meros homoousion tou patros),--the
   Sabellian, according to which the Godhead involves the identity of the
   Son and Father (huiopator),--that of Hieracas. according to which the
   Son is a torch lighted at the torch of the Father, that Son and Father
   are a bipartite light and so on,--and how he, Arius, had agreed with
   him. [17] It was only after considerable hesitation and perhaps
   vacillation too, that Alexander resolved on the excommunication of
   Arius. It took place at a Synod held in 321 or 320 in presence of about
   one hundred Egyptian and Lybian bishops. Along with Arius some
   presbyters and deacons of Alexandria, as well as the Lybian bishops
   Theonas and Secundus, were deposed. This did not quieten Arius. He
   sought and forthwith found support amongst his old friends, and above
   all, got the help of Eusebius of Nicomedia. This student-friend had an
   old cause of quarrel with Alexander, [18] and, contrary to
   ecclesiastical law, had been transferred to Nicomedia by Berytus, the
   most influential bishop [19] at the court of the Empress, a sister of
   Constantine. Arius, driven out of Alexandria "as an atheist", had
   written to him from Palestine. [20] He was able to appeal to a number
   of eastern bishops, and above all, to Eusebius of Cæsarea; in fact he
   asserted that all the eastern bishops agreed with him and had on this
   account been put under the ban by Alexander (?). Eusebius of Nicomedia
   espoused the cause of Arius in the most energetic fashion in a large
   number of letters. [21] Alexander on his part also looked about for
   allies. He wrote numerous letters to the bishops, two of which have
   been preserved--namely, the Encyclica, i.e., the official report of
   what had occurred, [22] and the epistle to Alexander, Bishop of
   Constantinople. (?) [23] In the latter letter, which is written in a
   very hostile tone, Alexander sought to check the powerful propaganda of
   Arianism. He appealed to the bishops of the whole of Egypt and the
   Thebaid and further to the Lybian, Pentapolitan, Syrian,
   Lycio-Pamphylian, Asiatic, Cappadocian, and other bishops. Arius betook
   himself to Nicomedia and from there addressed a conciliatory epistle to
   the Alexandrian bishop which we still possess. [24] He also composed at
   that time his "Thalia," of whose contents which were partly in prose
   and partly in verse, we cannot form any very correct idea from the few
   fragments handed down to us by Athanasius. His supporters thought a
   great deal of this. work while his opponents condemned it as profane,
   feeble, and affected. [25] A Bithynian Synod under the leadership of
   Eusebius decided for Arius, [26] and Eusebius of Cæsarea entered into
   communication with Alexander of Alexandria in the character of
   mediator, in order to induce him to take a more favourable view of the
   doctrine of the excommunicated presbyter. [27] It may have been, more
   than anything else, the political state of things which allowed Arius
   to find his way back once more to Alexandria. Under the patronage of
   some distinguishes bishops with whom he had entered into
   correspondence, but who were not able to bring about any amicable
   arrangement with Alexander, Arius resumed his work in the city. [28] In
   the autumn of 323 Constantine, after his victory over Licinius, became
   sole ruler in the Roman Empire. The controversy had already begun to
   rage in all the coast-provinces of the East. Not only did the bishops
   contend with each other, but the common people too began to take sides,
   and the dispute was carried on in such a base manner that the Jews
   scoffed at the thing in the theatres, and turned the most sacred parts
   of the doctrine of the Church into ridicule. [29] Constantine forthwith
   interfered. The very full letter which he sent to Alexander and Arius,
   [30] in 323-24, is one of the most important monuments of his religious
   policy. The controversy is described as an idle wrangle over
   incomprehensible things, since the opponents are, he says, at one as
   regards the main point. [31] But the letter had no effect, nor was the
   court-bishop, Hosius of Cordova, who brought it, and who as an
   Occidental appeared to be committed to neither side, able to effect a
   reconciliation between the parties. In all probability, however, Hosius
   had already come to an understanding [32] in Alexandria with Alexander,
   and the latter shortly after took a journey to Nicomedia, thoroughly
   completed the understanding, talked over some other bishops there, and
   so prepared the way for the decision of the Council of Nicæa. [33] The
   Emperor was won over by Hosius after he perceived the fruitlessness of
   his union-policy. [34] He now summoned a General Council to meet at
   Nicæa, apparently on the advice of Hosius, [35] and the latter had the
   main share also in determining the choice of the formula proposed. [36]

   But before we take up the Council of Nicæa, we must get some idea of
   the doctrines of the contending parties.

   We still know what were the Christological formulæ of Bishop Alexander
   which were attacked by Arius. [37] They were the words: Aei theos, aei
   huios, hama pater, hama huios, sunuparchei ho huios agennetos [38] to
   theo, aeigenes, agenetogenes, out' epinoia, out' atomo tini proagei ho
   theos tou huiou, aei theos, aei huios, ex autou tou theou ho huios;
   always God, always Son, at the same time Father, at the same time Son,
   the Son exists unbegotten with the Father, everlasting, uncreated,
   neither in conception nor in any smallest point does God excel the Son,
   always God, always Son, from God Himself the Son.

   Alexander thus maintains the beginningless, eternal co-existence of
   Father and Son: the Father is never to be thought of without the Son
   who springs from the Father. It is not improbable that Alexander was
   led thus to give prominence to the one side of the Logos doctrine of
   Origen, owing to the influence of the theology of Irenæus or Melito.
   [39] The doctrine which Arius opposed to this is above all dominated by
   the thought that God, the Only One, is alone eternal, and that besides
   Him there exists only what is created, and that this originates in His
   will, that accordingly the Son also is not eternal, but a creation of
   God out of the non-existent. [40] From this thesis there necessarily
   follows the rejection of the predicate homoousios for the Son. Arius
   and his friends already before the Council of Nicæa give expression to
   it, incidentally indeed, but without ambiguity. [41]

   The doctrine of Arius is as follows: [42]

   (a) God, the Only One, besides whom there is no other, is alone
   unbegotten, without beginning and eternal; He is inexpressible,
   incomprehensible, and has absolutely no equal. These are the notes
   which express His peculiar nature. He has created all things out of His
   free will, and there exists nothing beside Him which He has not
   created. The expression "to beget" is simply a synonym for "to create".
   If it were not, the pure simplicity and spirituality of God's nature
   would be destroyed. God can put forth nothing out of His own essence;
   nor can He communicate His essence to what is created, for this essence
   is essentially uncreated. He has accordingly not been Father always;
   for otherwise what is created would not be created, but eternal. [43]

   (b) Wisdom and Logos dwell within this God as the powers (not persons)
   which are coincident with His substance, and are by their very nature
   inseparable from it; there are besides many created powers. [44]

   (c) Before the world existed, God of His free will created an
   independent substance or hypostasis (ousia, hupostasis) as the
   instrument by means of which all other creatures were to be created,
   since without it the creatures would not have been able to endure the
   contact of the Godhead. This Being is termed in Scripture Wisdom, also
   Son, Image, Word; this Wisdom, which, compared with the inner divine
   Wisdom, is called Wisdom only in a loose sense, has like all creatures
   been created out of nothing. It originates in God only in so far as it
   has been created by God; it is in no sense of the substance or essence
   of God. It has had a beginning; it accordingly did not always exist,
   there was a time in which it was not. That the Scriptures use the word
   "begotten" of this Substance does not imply that this is peculiar to it
   any more than is the predicate "Son"; for the other creatures are
   likewise described here and there as "begotten," and men are called
   "sons of God". [45]

   (d) As regards his Substance, the "Son" is consequently an unrelated
   and independent being totally separated from, and different from, the
   substance or nature of the Father. He has neither one and the same
   substance together with the Father, nor a nature and constitution
   similar to that of the Father. If he had, then there would be two Gods.
   On the contrary, like all rational creatures he has a free will and is
   capable of change. He might consequently have been good or bad; but he
   made up his mind to follow the good, and continued in the good without
   vacillation. Thus he has by means of his own will come to be
   unchangeable. [46]

   (e) Since the Son is, as regards his substance, unrelated to the
   Godhead, [47] he is not truly God, and accordingly has not by nature
   the divine attributes; he is only the so-called Logos and Wisdom. As he
   is not eternal, neither is his knowledge in any sense perfect; he has
   no absolute knowledge of God, but only a relative knowledge, in fact he
   does not even know his own substance perfectly, accordingly he cannot
   claim equal honour with the Father. [48]

   (f) Still the Son is not a creature and a product like other creatures;
   he is the perfect creature, ktisma teleion; by him everything has been
   created; he stands in a special relation to God, but this is solely
   conditioned by grace and adoption; the bestowal of grace on the other
   hand, is based on the steadfast inclination of this free being to the
   good which was foreseen by God. Through God's bestowal of grace and by
   his own steady progress he has become God, so that we may now call him
   "only-begotten God", "strong God" and so on. [49]

   (g) All that Scripture and tradition assert in reference to the
   incarnation and the humanity of this being holds good; he truly took a
   human body (soma apsuchon); the feelings shewn by the historical Christ
   teach us that the Logos to whom they attach--for Christ had not a human
   soul--is a being capable of suffering, not an absolutely perfect being,
   but one who attains by effort absolute perfection. [50]

   (h) Amongst the number of created powers (dunameis) the Holy Ghost is
   to be placed beside the Son as a second, independent Substance or
   Hypostasis, (ousia, hupostasis); for the Christian believes in three
   separate and different substances or persons, (ousiai, hupostaseis);
   Father, Son and Spirit. Arius apparently, like his followers,
   considered the Spirit as a being created by the Son and subordinate to
   him. [51]

   Alexander expressly notes that the Arians appeal to Scripture in
   support of their doctrine, and Athanasius says that the Thalia
   contained passages of Scripture. [52] The passages so frequently cited
   later on by the Arians; Deut. VI. 4, XXXII. 39; Prov. VIII. 22; Ps.
   XLV. 8; Mt. XII. 28; Mk. XIII. 32; Mt. XXVI. 41, XXVIII. 18; Lk. II.
   52, XVIII. 19; John XI. 34, XIV. 28, XVII. 3; Acts II. 36; 1 Cor. I.
   24, XV. 28; Col. I. 15; Philipp. II. 6 f.; Hebr. I. 4, III. 2; John
   XII. 27, XIII. 21; Mt. XXVI. 39, XXVII. 46, etc., will thus already
   have been used by Arius himself. Arius was not a systematiser, nor were
   his friends systematisers either. In this respect their literary
   activity was limited to letters in which they stirred each other up,
   and which were soon put together in a collected form. The only one
   amongst them before Eunomius and Aëtius who undertook to give a
   systematic defence of the doctrinal system, was the Sophist Asterius,
   called by Athanasius the advocate (sunegoros) of the sects. He was a
   clever, clear-headed man, but he was quite unable to wipe out what was
   in everybody's eyes the blot on his character, his denial of the Faith
   during the time of persecution. [53] There were various shades of
   opinion amongst the followers and supporters of Arius. In Arianism in
   its more rigid form the tradition of Paul of Samosata and Lucian
   predominated, in its milder form the subordination doctrine of Origen.
   Both types were indeed at one as regards the form of doctrine, and the
   elements traceable to Origen won over all enlightened "Conservatives".
   We may count Asterius too amongst. the latter, at all events the
   unbending Philostorgius was not at all pleased with him, and Asterius
   subsequently approached near to the Semiarians.

   Previous to the Council of Nicæa, the letters of the bishop Alexander
   are, for us at all events, the sole literary manifestos of the opposite
   party. The Encyklica already shews that the writer is fully conscious
   he has got to do with a heresy of the very worst type. The earlier
   heresies all pale before it; no other heretic has approached so near to
   being Antichrist. Arius and his friends are the enemies of God,
   murderers of the divinity of Christ, people like Judas. Alexander did
   not enter into theoretical and theological explanations. After giving a
   brief but complete and excellent account of the Logos doctrine of
   Arius, he sets in contrast with the statements contained in it,
   numerous passages from the Gospel of John and other quotations from
   Scripture. [54] The sole remarks of a positive kind he makes are that
   it belongs to the substance or essence of the Logos, that he perfectly
   knows the Father, and that the supposition of a time in which the Logos
   was not, makes the Father alogos kai asophos. The latter remark, which
   for that matter of it does not touch Arius, shews that Alexander
   included the Logos or Son in the substance of the Father as a necessary
   element. The second epistle goes much more into details, [55] but it
   shews at the same time how little Alexander, in solving the problem,
   was able definitely to oppose fixed and finished formulæ to those of
   the Arians. The main positions of Arius are once more pertinently
   characterised and refuted.

   Alexander is conscious that he is contending for nothing less than the
   divinity of Christ, the universal Faith of the Church, when he refutes
   the statements that the Son is not eternal, that He was created out of
   the non-existent, that He is not by nature (phusei) God, that He is
   capable of change, that He went through a moral development (prokope),
   that He is only Son by adoption, like the sons of God in general, and
   so on. [56] He not only adduces proofs from the Bible in large numbers,
   [57] he has unmistakably in his mind what is for him a central,
   religious thought. Christ must belong to God and not to the world,
   because all other creatures require such a being in order to attain to
   God and become the adopted sons of God. In order to make clear the
   possibility of such a being, Alexander uses by preference for the Son
   the expression which had been already preferred by Origen--"the perfect
   image," "the perfect reflection." But even this expression does not
   suffice him; it gains deeper meaning by the thought that the Son as the
   image of the Father at the same time first clearly expresses the
   peculiar character of the Father. In the Wisdom, the Logos, the Power,
   the "Son is made known and the Father is characterised. To say that the
   reflection of the divine glory does not exist is to do away also with
   the archetypal light of which it is the reflection; if there exists no
   impress or pattern of the substance of God, then he too is done away
   with who is wholly characterised by this pattern or express
   image:"--gnorizetai ho huios kai ho pater charakterizetai. To gar
   apaugasma tes doxes me einai legein sunanairei kai to prototupon phos,
   hou estin apaugasma . . . to me einai ton tes hupostaseos tou Theou
   charaktera sunanaireitai kakeinos, ho pantos par autou
   charakterizomenos. While in laying down this thesis and others of a
   similar kind, e.g., that the Son is the inner reason and power of the
   Father Himself, he approaches "Sabellianism," the latter doctrine is
   repudiated in the most decided and emphatic way. But on the other hand
   again, not only is the supposition of two unbegottens (agen[n]eta)
   rejected as a calumny, but he repeatedly emphasises in a striking
   fashion the fact that the begetting of the Son is not excluded by the
   application to Him of the predicate always (aei), that the Father alone
   is unbegotten, and that He is greater than the Son. [58] Alexander thus
   asserts both things--namely, the inseparable unity of the substance of
   the Son with that of the Father [59] and their difference, and yet the
   one is held to be unbegotten and the other to be not unbegotten. In
   order to be able to maintain these contradictory theses he takes up the
   standpoint of Irenæus, that the mystery of the existence and coming
   forth of the Son is an inexpressible one even for Evangelists and
   angels, and is no proper object of human reflection and human
   statement. Even John did not venture to make any pronouncement
   regarding the anekdiegetos hupostasis tou monogenous Theou, [60] --the
   ineffable substance of the only begotten God. "How could anyone waste
   his labour on the substance of the Logos of God, unless indeed he were
   afflicted with melancholy?" Pos an periergasaito tis ten tou Theou
   logou hupostasin, ektos ei me melancholike diathesei lephthei
   tunchanoi. [61] Alexander's actual standpoint is undoubtedly plainly
   expressed here. He does not wish to speculate; for the complete
   divinity of Christ is for him not a speculation at all, but a judgment
   of faith, and the distinction between Father and Son is for him
   something beyond doubt. But he sees that he is under the necessity of
   opposing certain formula to the doctrine of Arius. These are partly
   vague and partly contradictory: [62] "The Son is the inner reason and
   power of God," "Father and Son are two inseparable things" (duo
   achorista pragmata), "Between Father and Son there is not the slightest
   difference" (diastema), "not even in any thought" (oud' achri tinos
   ennoias), "There is only one unbegotten," "The Son has come into being
   in consequence of a genesis kai poiesis" (an act of generation and
   production), "The Son has, compared with the world, an ineffable
   substance peculiarly his own" (idiotropos anekdiegetos hupostasis), "He
   is monogenes Theos" (only begotten God), "His Sonship is by its nature
   in possession of the deity of the Father" (kata phusin tunchanousa tes
   patrikes theotetos), [63] "Father and Son are two natures in the
   hypostasis" (te hupostasei duo phuseis [64] ), between the Underived
   and he who has come into being out of the non-existent there is a
   mesiteuousa phusis monogenes (the Son) di' es ta hola ex ouk onton
   epoiesen ho pater tou Theou logou, e ex autou tou ontos patros
   gegennetai," (a mediating only begotten nature by which the Father of
   the God-Logos has made all things out of the non-existent, and which
   has been begotten out of the existent Father), "The Son has not
   proceeded out of the Father kata tas ton somaton homoiotetas, tais
   tomais e tais ekdiaireseon aporroiais (in the manner in which bodies
   are formed, by separation or by the emanation of parts divided off);"
   still we may speak of a fatherly generation! (patrike theogonia) which
   certainly is beyond the power of human reason to grasp." "The
   expressions en, aei, etc., (was, always), used of the Son, are
   undoubtedly too weak, but on the other hand, they are not to be
   conceived so as to suggest that the Son is unbegotten (agennetos); the
   unbeginning genesis from the Father (anarchos gennesis para tou patros)
   is his,--"the Father is greater than the Son, to Him honour in the
   strict sense (oikeion axioma) is due, to the Son the dignity that is
   fitting (time harmozousa)." [65]

   These confused thoughts and formulæ contrast unfavourably with the
   clear and definitely expressed statements of Arius. Alexander's
   opponents had a better right to complain of the chameleon-like form of
   this teaching than he had of that of theirs. When they maintained that
   it offered no security against dualism (two unbegotten, [ageneta]),
   [66] or against Gnostic emanationism (probole, aporroia), or against
   Sabellianism (huiopator), or against the idea of the corporeality of
   God, and that it contained flagrant contradictions, [67] they were not
   far wrong. But they cannot have been in the dark as to what their
   opponents meant to assert, which was nothing else than the inseparable,
   essential unity of Father and Son, the complete divinity of Christ who
   has redeemed us and whom every creature must necessarily have as
   redeemer. Along with this they taught a real distinction between Father
   and Son, though they could assert this distinction only as a mystery,
   and when they were driven to describe it, had recourse to formulæ which
   were easily refuted.

   We may at this point give an account of the doctrine of Athanasius; for
   although it was not till after the Nicene Council that he took part in
   the controversy as an author, [68] still his point of view coincides
   essentially with that of Bishop Alexander. It underwent no development,
   and considered from the stand-point of technical theology it partly
   labours under the same difficulties as that of Alexander. Its
   significance does not lie in the nature of his scientific defence of
   the faith, but solely in the triumphant tenacity of the faith itself.
   His character and his life are accordingly the main thing. The works he
   composed, like all the theological formulae he uses, were wrung out of
   him. The entire Faith, everything in defence of which Athanasius staked
   his life, is described in the one sentence: God Himself has entered
   into humanity. [69]

   The theology and christology of Athanasius are rooted in the thought of
   Redemption, and his views were not influenced by any subordinate
   considerations. [70] Neither heathenism nor Judaism has brought men
   into fellowship with God, the point on which everything turns. It is
   through Christ that we are transported into this fellowship; He has
   come in order to make us divine, i e., to make us by adoption the sons
   of God and gods. But Christ would not have been able to bring us this
   blessing if He Himself had possessed it merely as a gift secundum
   participationem, for in this case He only had just as much as He needed
   Himself and so could not proceed to give away what was not His own.
   [71] Therefore Christ must be of the substance of the Godhead and be
   one with it. Whoever denies that is not a Christian, but is either a
   heathen or a Jew. [72] This is the fundamental thought which Athanasius
   constantly repeats. Everything else is secondary, is of the nature of
   necessary controversy. In the Son we have the Father; whoever knows the
   Son knows the Father. [73] This confession is at bottom the entire
   Christian confession. The adoration of Christ, which according to
   tradition, has been practised from the first, and which has not been
   objected to by their opponents, already, he says, decides the whole
   question. God alone is to be adored; it is heathenish to worship
   creatures. [74] Christ therefore shares in the divine substance.
   Athanasius did not draft any system of theology or christology. The
   real point at issue appeared to him to be quite simple and certain. We
   have to put together his doctrinal system for ourselves, and the
   attempts to construct such a system for him is not something to be
   entered upon lightly. A body of theoretical propositions resulted
   solely from the polemic in which he was engaged and also from his
   defence of the "Homoousios." Throughout, however, his thought in the
   final resort centres not in the Logos as such, [75] but in the Divine,
   which had appeared in Jesus Christ. He has no longer any independent
   Logos doctrine, on the contrary he is a Christologist. We accordingly
   give merely some of the main lines of his teaching.

   1. To acknowledge that the substantial or essential element in Christ
   is "God," is to assert that there is nothing of the creature in this,
   that it does not therefore belong in any sense to what has been
   created. Athanasius insisted as confidently as Arius on the gulf which
   exists between created and uncreated. This constitutes the advance made
   by both in clearness. [76] Arius, however, drew the dividing line in
   such a way that with him the Son belongs to the world side, while with
   Athanasius He, as belonging to God, stands over against the world.

   2. Since the Divine, which has appeared in Christ, is not anything
   created, and since there can be no "middle" substance, [77] it follows,
   according to the reasoning of Athanasius, that this Divine cannot in
   any sense be postulated as resulting from the idea of the creation of
   the world. God did not require any agent for the creation of the world;
   He creates direct. If He had required any such intervening agent in
   order to effect a connection with the creature that was to come into
   existence, this Divine could not have supplied Him with it, for it
   itself really belongs to His substance. In this way the idea of the
   Divine, which in Christ redeemed men, is severed from the world idea;
   [78] the old Logos doctrine is discarded; Nature and Revelation no
   longer continue to be regarded as identical. The Logos-Son-Christ is at
   bottom no longer a world principle, but, on the contrary, a salvation
   principle. [79]

   3. Scripture and tradition know of only one Godhead; they, however, at
   the same time pronounce Christ to be God: they call the Divine which
   has appeared in Christ, Logos, Wisdom and Son; they thus distinguish it
   from God, the Father. Faith has to hold fast to this. But in accordance
   with this we get the following propositions:

   (a) The Godhead is a unity (monas). Therefore the Divine which appeared
   in Christ, must form part of this unity. There is only one underived or
   unbegotten principle; this is the Father. [80]

   (b) The very name Father implies, moreover, that a second exists in the
   Godhead. God has always been Father, and whoever calls Him Father
   posits at the same time the Son; for the Father is the Father of the
   Son, and only in a loose sense the Father of the world and of men; for
   these are created, but the divine Trinity is uncreated, for otherwise
   it might either decrease again, or further increase in the future. [81]

   (c) This Son, the offspring of the Father (gennema tou patros), [82]
   was not, however, begotten in a human fashion as if God were corporeal.
   On the contrary, He has been begotten as the sun begets light and the
   spring the brook; He is called Son, because He is the eternal, perfect
   reflection of the Father, the image [83] proceeding from the substance
   of the Father; He is called Wisdom and Logos not as if the Father were
   imperfect without Him, [84] but as the creative power of the Father.
   [85] "To be begotten" simply means completely to share by nature in the
   entire nature of the Father, implying at the same time that the Father
   does not therefore suffer or undergo anything. [86]

   (d) Consequently the assertions of the Arians that the Son is God,
   Logos, and Wisdom in a nominal sense only, that there was a time in
   which the Son was not, that He has sprung from the will of the Father,
   that He was created out of the non-existent or out of some other
   substance, that He is subject to change, are false. [87] On the
   contrary He is (1) co-eternal with the Father and (2) He is of the
   substance of the Father, [88] for otherwise He would not be God at all,
   (3) He is by His own nature in all points similarly [89] constituted as
   the Father, and finally He is all this, because He has one and the same
   substance in common with the Father and together with Him constitutes a
   unity, [90] but "substance" in reference to God means nothing else than
   "Being." [91] It is not the case that the Father is one substance by
   itself and the Son another substance by itself and that these two are
   similarly constituted. This would do away with the unity of the
   Godhead. On the contrary, the Father is the Godhead; this Godhead,
   however, contains in it a mystery which can only be approximately
   conceived of by men. It conceals within itself in the form of an
   independent and self-acting product something which issues from it and
   which also possesses this Godhead and possesses it from all eternity in
   virtue, not of any communication, but of nature and origin,--the true
   and real Son, the image which proceeds from the substance. There are
   not two divine ousias, not two divine hypostases or the like, but one
   ousia and hypostasis, which the Father and the Son possess. Thus the
   Son is true God, inseparable from the Father and reposing in the unity
   of the Godhead, not a second alongside of God, but simply reflection,
   express image, Son within the one Godhead which cannot and ought not to
   be thought of apart from reflection, express image, and Son. He has
   everything that the Father has, for He actually possesses the ousia of
   the Father; He is homoousios, [92] of the same substance. Only He is
   not actually the Father, for the latter is also His source and root,
   the Almighty Father, the only unbegotten principle. [93]

   (4) The language used of Christ in Scripture to express what is human
   and belonging to the creature, has, always and only, reference to the
   human nature which He took upon Him in order to redeem men. Since He
   who is by nature God took upon Him a body in order to unite with
   Himself what is by nature man in order that the salvation and
   deification of man might be surely accomplished, He also along with the
   body took to Himself human feelings. So complete, however, is the
   identity of the humanity of Christ with the nature of humanity as a
   whole that we may, according to Athanasius, refer the statements of
   Scripture as to a special endowment and exaltation of Christ, to the
   whole humanity. [94] Complete too, however, was the union of the Son of
   God with humanity, which Athanasius, like Arius up to the time of the
   Apollinarian controversy, usually thought of as "Flesh," "vesture of
   the Flesh." [95] Because the body of the Logos was really His own
   body--although we must discard the thought of variation, of change [96]
   --and because this union had become already perfect in Mary's body,
   [97] everything that holds good of the flesh holds good of the Logos
   also, and this is true of all sufferings even,--although He was not
   affected by them so far as His Godhead is concerned, [98] --and Mary is
   the mother of God. Athanasius also refers to the incarnate Logos the
   locus classicus of the Arians, Prov. VIII. 22, 23, [99] with which
   Eustathius of Antioch likewise occupied himself. [100] Finally,
   Athanasius spoke also of a prokope or progress in reference to the
   incarnate Logos, of an increase in the manifestation of God in the body
   of Christ, by which he means that the flesh was more and more
   completely irradiated by the Godhead: to anthropinon en te sophia
   proekopten, [101] (the human advanced in wisdom).

   How are the two mutually opposed doctrines to be judged from the
   standpoint of history, of reason, and of the Gospel? Each party charged
   the other with holding doctrines which involved contradictions, and,
   what is of more consequence, they mutually accused each other of
   apostasy from Christianity, although the Arians never advanced this
   charge with such energy as the opposite party. We have first of all to
   ascertain definitely how much they had in common. Religion and doctrine
   are with both thoroughly fused together, [102] and, indeed, formally
   considered, the doctrine is the same in both cases, i.e., the
   fundamental conceptions are the same. The doctrine of the pre-existent
   Christ, who as the pre-existent Son of God is Logos, Wisdom, and
   world-creating Power of God, seems to constitute the common basis.
   Together with this both have a common interest in maintaining the unity
   of God and in making a sharp distinction between Creator and creature.
   Finally, both endeavour to base their doctrines on Scripture and at the
   same time claim to have tradition on their side, as is evident in the
   case of Arius from the introduction to the Thalia. Both are, however,
   convinced that the final word lies with Scripture and not with
   tradition.

   I. We cannot understand Arianism unless we consider that it consists of
   two entirely disparate parts. It has, first of all, a Christ who
   gradually becomes God, who therefore develops more and more in moral
   unity of feeling with God, progresses and attains his perfection by the
   divine grace. This Christ is the Saviour, in so far as he has conveyed
   to us the divine doctrine and has given us an example of goodness
   perfectly realised in the exercise of freedom. When Arius calls this
   Christ Logos it appears as if he did this by way of accommodation. The
   conception of Arius here is purely Adoptian. But, secondly, with this
   is united a metaphysic which has its basis solely in a cosmology and
   has absolutely no connection with soteriology. This metaphysic is
   dominated by the thought of the antithesis of the one, inexpressible
   God, a God remote from the world, and the creature. The working-out of
   this thought accordingly perfectly corresponds with the philosophical
   ideas of the time and with the one half of the line of thought pursued
   by Origen. In order that a creation may become possible at all, a
   spiritual being must first be created which can be the means whereby a
   spiritual-material world can be created. This cannot be the divine
   reason itself, but only the most complete image of the divine reason
   stamped on a created, freely acting, independent being. With this we
   have arrived at the Neo-platonic origination. Whether in order to find
   a means of transition to the world we are to speak of "God, the
   essential nous of God, the created Logos," or "God, the created Logos,
   the world-spirit," or are to arrange the terms in some other way, is
   pretty much a matter of indifference, and to all appearance Arius laid
   little stress on this. It is the philosophical triad, or duad, such as
   we meet with in Philo, Numenius, Plotinus etc. These created beings
   which mediate between God and the creature are, however, according to
   Arius, to be adored, i.e., it is only as a cosmologist that he is a
   strict monotheist, while as a theologian he is a polytheist. This again
   perfectly corresponds to the dominant Hellenic view. Arius in fact
   occupies a place, so to speak, on the extreme left, for the energetic
   way in which he emphasises the thought that the second ousia has been
   created out of the free will of God, that it is foreign to the
   substance of God, that as a creaturely substance it is capable of
   change and definable, and, above all, the express assertion that this
   "Logos" and "Son" is "Logos" and "Son" merely nominally, that in no
   sense whatever is an emanation or anything of that kind to be thought
   of here, but simply a creation, is surprising even in the sphere of
   Hellenic philosophy. That this created Logos which made possible the
   further creation has appeared in Jesus Christ and has in human vesture
   developed into God and has therefore not been lowered, but on the
   contrary has been exalted by His being man, is accordingly what
   constitutes the uniting thought between the two parts of the system.

   In the other case, as here, the expressions "pre-existent Son of God,"
   "Logos," "Wisdom" are plainly only an accommodation. They are
   unavoidable, but not necessary, in fact they create difficulties. It
   clearly follows from this, however, that the doctrine of Origen does
   not constitute the basis of the system--in so far as its Christology is
   concerned--and that what it has in common with the orthodox system is
   not what is really characteristic of it, but is on the contrary what is
   secondary. The Arian doctrine has its root in Adoptianism, in the
   doctrine of Lucian of Samosata, [103] as is proved, above all, by the
   strong emphasis laid on the creaturehood of the Redeemer and by the
   elimination of a human soul. We know what signification this had for
   Origen. Where it is wanting we can no longer speak of Origenism in the
   full meaning of the word. But it is correct that the
   cosmological-causal point of view of Origen, this one side of his
   complicated system, was appropriated by Arius, that is by Lucian.
   Meanwhile it has to be added that it was not peculiar to Origen. He
   made an effort to get beyond it; he balanced the causal-cosmological
   point of view, according to which the Logos is a heavenly ktisma, by
   the soteriological, according to which He is the essential and
   recognisable image of the Father, which constitutes an essential unity
   with the Father. Of this there is nothing in Arius. [104]

   Arianism is a new doctrine in the Church; it labours under quite as
   many difficulties as any other earlier Christological doctrine; it is,
   finally, in one important respect, really Hellenism which is simply
   tempered by the constant use of Holy Scripture. It is a new doctrine;
   for not only is the frank assertion of the creaturehood and
   changeableness of the Logos in this sharply defined form, new, spite of
   Origen, Dionysius Alex., Pierius and so on, but, above all, the
   emphatic rejection of any essential connection of the Logos with the
   Father. The images of the source and the brook, the sun and the light,
   the archetype and the type, which are almost of as old standing in the
   Church as the Logos-doctrine itself, are here discarded. This, however,
   simply means that the Christian Logos- and Son-of-God-doctrine has
   itself been discarded. Only the old names remain. But new too, further,
   is the combination of Adoptianism with the Logos-cosmology, and if the
   idea of two distinct Logoi and two Wisdoms is not exactly new, it is a
   distinction which had never before this been permitted.

   Athanasius exposed the inner difficulties and contradictions, and in
   almost every case we may allow that he has right on his side. A son who
   is no son, a Logos who is no Logos, a monotheism which nevertheless
   does not exclude polytheism, two or three ousias which are to be
   revered, while yet only one of them is really distinct from the
   creatures, an indefinable being who first becomes God by becoming man
   and who is yet neither God nor man, and so on. In every single point we
   have apparent clearness while all is hollow and formal, a boyish
   enthusiasm for playing with husks and shells, and a childish
   self-satisfaction in the working out of empty syllogisms. [105] This
   had not been learned from Origen, who always had facts and definite
   ends in view when he speculated.

   But all this might be put up with if only this doctrine were in any way
   designed to shew how communion with God is arrived at through Christ.
   This is what we must necessarily demand; for what the ancient Church
   understood by "redemption" was in part a physical redemption of a very
   questionable kind, and it would not necessarily have been anything to
   be regretted if anyone had emancipated himself from this "redemption."
   But one has absolutely nowhere the impression that Arius and his
   friends are in their theology concerned with communion with God. Their
   doctrina de Christo has nothing whatever to do with this question. The
   divine which appeared on earth is not the Godhead, but one of its
   creations. God Himself remains unknown. Whoever expresses adherence to
   the above propositions and does this with unmistakable satisfaction,
   stands up for the unique nature of God, but does this, however, only
   that he may not endanger the uniformity of the basis of the world, and
   otherwise is prepared to worship besides this God other "Gods" too,
   creatures that is; whoever allows religion to disappear in a
   cosmological doctrine and in veneration for a heroic teacher, even
   though he may call him "perfect creature," ktisma teleion, and revere
   in him the being through whom this world has come to be what it is, is,
   so far as his religious way of thinking is concerned, a Hellenist, and
   has every claim to be highly valued by Hellenists. [106]

   The admission that the Arians succeeded in getting a grasp of certain
   features in the historical Christ presented to us by the New Testament,
   cannot in any way alter this judgment. In this matter they were far
   superior to their opponents; but they were absolutely unable to make
   any religious use of what they perceived. They speak of Christ as Paul
   of Samosata does, but by foisting in behind the Christ who was exalted
   to be Lord, the half divine being, logos-creature, logos-ktisma, they
   deprived the most valuable knowledge they had of all practical value.
   Paul could say in a general way: ta kratoumena to logo tes phuseos, ouk
   echei epainon; ta de schesei philias kratoumena huperaineitai (what was
   accomplished by the Logos of nature deserves no praise, but what was
   accomplished in the state of love is to be praised exceedingly). Such a
   statement was made impossible for the Arians by the introduction of
   cosmological speculation. What dominates Paul's whole view of the
   question--namely, the thought that the unity of love and feeling is the
   most abiding unity, scarcely ever finds an echo amongst the Arians, for
   it is swallowed up by that philosophy which measures worth by duration
   in time and thinks of a half-eternal being as being nearer God than a
   temporal being who is filled with the love of God. We cannot therefore
   finally rate very high the results of the rational exegesis of
   christological passages as given by the Arians; they do not use them to
   shew that Jesus was a man whom God chose for Himself or that God was in
   the man Jesus, but, on the contrary, in order to prove that this Jesus
   was no complete God. Nor can we put a high value on their defence of
   monotheism either, for they adored creatures. What is alone really
   valuable, is the energetic emphasis they lay on freedom, and which they
   adopted from Origen, but even it has no religious significance.

   Had the Arian doctrine gained the victory in the Greek-speaking world,
   it would in all probability have completely ruined Christianity, that
   is, it would have made it disappear in cosmology and morality and would
   have annihilated religion in the religion. "The Arian Christology is
   inwardly the most unstable, and dogmatically the most worthless, of all
   the Christologies to be met with in the history of dogma." [107] Still
   it had its mission. The Arians made the transition from heathenism to
   Christianity easier for the large numbers of the cultured and
   half-cultured whom the policy of Constantine brought into the Church.
   They imparted to them a view of the Holy Scriptures and of Christianity
   which could present no difficulty to any one at that period. The Arian
   monotheism was the best transition from polytheism to monotheism. It
   asserted the truth that there is one supreme God with whom nothing can
   be compared, and thus rooted out the crude worship of many gods. It
   constructed a descending divine triad in which the cultured were able
   to recognise again the highest wisdom of their philosophers. It
   permitted men to worship a demiurge together with the primal substance,
   prote ousia; it taught an incarnation of this demiurge and, on the
   other hand again, a theopoiesis. and was able skilfully to unite this
   with the worship of Christ in the Church. It afforded, in the numerous
   formulæ which it coined, interesting material for rhetorical and
   dialectic exercises. It quickened the feeling of freedom and
   responsibility and led to discipline, and even to asceticism. And
   finally, it handed on the picture of a divine hero who was obedient
   even to death and gained the victory by suffering and patience, and who
   has become a pattern for us. When transmitted along with the Holy
   Scriptures, it even produced a living piety [108] amongst Germanic
   Christians, if it also awakened in them the very idea to which it had
   originally been specially opposed, the idea of a theogony. What was
   shewn above--namely, that the doctrine was new, is to be taken cum
   grano salis; elements which were present in the teaching of the Church
   from the very beginning got here vigorous outward expression and became
   supreme. The approval the doctrine met with shews how deeply rooted
   they were in the Church. We cannot but be astonished at the first
   glance to find that those who sought to defend the whole system of
   Origen partly sided with Arius and partly gave him their patronage. But
   this fact ceases to be striking so soon as we consider that the
   controversy very quickly became so acute as to necessitate a decision
   for or against Arius. But the Origenists, moreover, had a very strong
   antipathy to everything that in any way suggested "Sabellianism"; for
   Sabellianism had no place for the pursuit of Hellenic cosmological
   speculation, i.e., of scientific theology. Their position with regard
   to the doctrine of Athanasius was thereby determined. They would rather
   have kept to their rich supply of musty formulæ, but they were forced
   to decide for Arius.

   II. Nothing can more clearly illustrate the perverse state of the
   problem in the Arian-Athanasian controversy than the notorious fact
   that the man who saved the character of Christianity as a religion of
   living fellowship with God, was the man from whose Christology almost
   every trait which recalls the historical Jesus of Nazareth was erased.
   Athanasius undoubtedly retained the most important feature--namely,
   that Christ promised to bring men into fellowship with God. But while
   he subordinated everything to this thought and recognised in redemption
   a communication of the divine nature, he reduced the entire historical
   account given of Christ to the belief that the Redeemer shared in the
   nature and unity of the Godhead itself, and he explained everything in
   the Biblical documents in accordance with this idea. [109] That which
   Christ is and is for us, is the Godhead; in the Son we have the Father,
   and in what the Son has brought, the divine is communicated to us. This
   fundamental thought is not new, and it corresponds with a very old
   conception of the Gospel. It is not new, for it was never wanting in
   the Church before the time of Athanasius. The Fourth Gospel, Ignatius,
   Irenæus, Methodius, the so-called Modalism and even the Apologists and
   Origen--not to mention the Westerns--prove this; for the Apologists,
   and Origen too, in what they say of the Logos, emphasised not only His
   distinction from the Father, but also His unity with the Father. The
   Samosatene had also laid the whole emphasis on the unity, although
   indeed he was not understood. [110] But not since the days in which the
   Fourth Gospel was written do we meet with anyone with whom the
   conviction is so definite, thought out with such an assurance of
   victory, expressed so strongly and so simply, and of such an absolute
   kind, as it is with Athanasius. All the rest by introducing qualifying
   thoughts in some way or other, brought an element of uncertainty into
   their feeling of its truth, and impaired its strength. That in the age
   of Constantine during the greatest revolution which the Church has
   experienced and which was so fraught with consequences, the faith
   represented by Athanasius was confessed with such vigour, is what saved
   the Christian Church. Its faith would probably have got entirely into
   the hands of the philosophers, its confession would have become
   degraded or would have been turned into an imperial official decree
   enjoining the worship of the "clear-shining Godhead", if Athanasius had
   not been there and had not helped those who shared his views to make a
   stand and inspired them with courage.

   But at the beginning of the Fourth Century the form of expression for
   the belief in the unity of the eternal Godhead and its appearance in
   Jesus Christ was already sketched out. It was as little allowable to
   think of a unity of living feeling, of will and aim alone, as of the
   perfect identification of the persons. The doctrines of the
   pre-existing Son of God, of the eternal Logos, but, above all, the view
   that everything valuable is accomplished in the nature only, of which
   feeling and will are an annex, were firmly established. Athanasius in
   making use of these presuppositions in order to express his faith in
   the Godhead of Christ, i.e., in the essential unity of the Godhead in
   itself with the Godhead manifested in Christ, fell into an abyss of
   contradictions.

   Unquestionably the old Logos doctrine too, and also Arianism, strike us
   to-day as being full of contradictions, but it was Athanasius who first
   arrived at the contradictio in adjecto in the full sense of the phrase.
   That the Godhead is a numerical unity, but that nevertheless Son and
   Father are to be distinguished within this unity as two--this is his
   view. He teaches that there is only one unbegotten principle, but that
   nevertheless the Son has not come into being. He maintains that the
   Divine in Christ is the eternal "Son", but that the Son is as old as
   the Father. This Son is not to be thought of either as created, or as
   an attribute of God, or as an emanation or a part of God, and is
   therefore something wholly indefinable. The thought of a theogony is
   rejected as emphatically as that of a creation, and yet the thought of
   an active attribute is not in any sense to be entertained. The Father
   is perfect for Himself and is sufficient for Himself; indeed, although
   Father and Son have one substance, in the sense of a single nature, in
   common, still the Father alone is "the God", and is the principle and
   root of the Son also. Quot verba, tot scandala!

   Whatever involves a complete contradiction cannot be correct, and
   everyone is justified in unsparingly describing the contradiction as
   such. This the Arians sufficiently did, and in so far as they assumed
   that a contradiction cannot be seriously accepted by anyone, and that
   therefore the view of Athanasius must at bottom be Sabellian, they were
   right. Two generations and more had to pass before the Church could
   accustom itself to recognise in the complete contradiction the sacred
   privilege of revelation. There was, in fact, no philosophy in existence
   possessed of formulæ which could present in an intelligible shape the
   propositions of Athanasius. What he called at one time Ousia and at
   another Hypostasis, was not an individual substance in the full sense
   of the word, but still less was it a generic conception.

   If anything is clear, it is the fact that the thought of
   Athanasius--namely, the unity of the Godhead which rested in and
   appeared in Christ, could not be expressed under the traditional
   presuppositions of the pre-existing Son of God and the personal Logos
   existing from all eternity. We have here to do with the most important
   point in the whole question. The very same series of ideas which
   created the most serious difficulties for the Arians and which have
   been shewn to occupy a secondary place in their system, seriously
   hamper the doctrinal utterances of Athanasius; namely, the Logos
   doctrine of Origen and the cosmological-metaphysical conceptions which
   form the background of statements regarding an historical person. The
   Arians required to have a created being, created before the world,
   changeable, of the same nature as men, for their Christ, and had to
   banish all other determinations from their conception, and so they
   could not make use of the Logos of Philo and the Apologists; Athanasius
   required a being who was absolutely nothing else than the Godhead, and
   so the Logos referred to did not in any sense fit in with his doctrine.
   In both cases the combined Logos doctrine of Philo and Origen was the
   disturbing element. And at bottom,--though unfortunately not actually,
   [111] --they both discarded it; Arius when he distinguishes between the
   Logos nuncupativus which Christ is, and the actual Logos of God;
   Athanasius when he banishes the world-idea from the content of the
   substance which he adores in Christ. In the view of Arius, Christ
   belongs in every sense to the world, i.e., to the sphere of created
   things; in that of Athanasius he belongs in every sense to God, whose
   substance He shares.

   Arius and Athanasius both indeed occupy the standpoint of the theology
   of Origen which no one could now abandon; but their religious and
   theological interests do not originate in it. In the gnosis of Origen
   everything spiritual stands to God in a two-fold relation; it is His
   created work and yet it is at the same time His nature. This holds good
   in a pre-eminent sense of the Logos, which comprises all that is
   spiritual in itself and connects the graduated spheres of the spiritual
   substances, which, like it, have an eternal duration, with the supreme
   God-head. To this idea corresponds the thought that the creatures are
   free and that they must return from their state of estrangement and
   their Fall to their original source. Of this we find nothing either in
   Arius or in Athanasius. In the case of the former, the sober
   Aristotelian philosophy on the one hand reacts against this fundamental
   thought, and on the other, the tradition of the Christ who is engaged
   in a conflict, who increases and progresses towards perfection. In the
   case of Athanasius what reacts against it is the ancient belief of the
   Church in the Father, the Almighty Creator of all things, and in the
   Son in whom the Father reveals Himself and has stooped to hold
   fellowship with man.

   It is thus not the case that the gnosis of Origen was simply halved
   between Arius and Athanasius; on the contrary, it underwent a
   fundamental correction in the teaching of both. But it was no longer
   possible to avoid the "vis inertiæ." of the gnosis of Origen, the
   contrary formulae which were held together by the idea of the
   Logos-cosmology as the basis for Christology. [112] And now the
   question was which of the two was to be adopted, the Logos-ktisma or
   the Logos-homoousios formula. The former freed from the latter was
   indeed deprived of all soteriological content, but was capable of
   intelligent and philosophical treatment--namely, rational-logical
   treatment; the latter taken exclusively, even supposing that the
   distinction between the Son and the Father and the superiority of the
   Father were maintained in connection with it, simply led to an
   absurdity.

   Athanasius put up with this absurdity; [113] without knowing it he made
   a still greater sacrifice to his faith--the historical Christ. It was
   at such a price that he saved the religious conviction that
   Christianity is the religion of perfect fellowship with God, from being
   displaced by a doctrine which possessed many lofty qualities, but which
   had no understanding of the inner essence of religion, which sought in
   religion nothing but "instruction," and finally found satisfaction in
   an empty dialectic.

   It was intended that the General Church-Council which was summoned by
   the Emperor to meet at Nicæa should, besides settling some other
   important questions, compose the controversy which already threatened
   to produce division amongst the Eastern bishops. [114] It met in the
   year 325, in summer apparently. There were present about 300 (250, 270)
   bishops, hardly so many as 318 as asserted by Athanasius at a later
   time; the correctness of this latter number is open to suspicion. The
   West was very poorly represented; [115] the Roman bishop was not there,
   but he had sent two presbyters. The most important of the Eastern
   bishops were present. It is not clear how the business was arranged and
   conducted. We do not know who presided, whether Eustathius, Eusebius of
   Cæsarea, or Hosius, It is undoubted, however, that Hosius exercised a
   very important influence in the Council. The Emperor at first gave the
   Council a free hand, [116] though he at once put a stop to private
   wrangling, and he energetically interfered at the most decisive moment,
   and in the character of a theologian interpreted himself the formula to
   be adopted. [117] We may assume that at first he reckoned on the
   possibility that the Council would itself find some formula of
   agreement. He had, however, resolved, under the influence of Hosius,
   that in the case of this not being successfully carried out, he would
   enforce the formula which Hosius had agreed upon with Alexander. As
   regards the composition of the Council, the view expressed by the
   Macedonian Sabinus of Heraclea (Socr. I. 8), that the majority of the
   bishops were uneducated, is confirmed by the astonishing results. The
   general acceptance of the resolution come to by the Council is
   intelligible only if we presuppose that the question in dispute was
   above most of the bishops. [118] Of the "cultured" we have to
   distinguish three parties--namely, Arius and the Lucianists, who had
   Eusebius of Nicomedia for their leader; the Origenists, the most
   important man amongst whom was Eusebius of Cæsarea, who was already
   highly celebrated; [119] and Alexander of Alexandria with his
   following, to which the few Westerns also belonged. [120] The Arians
   came to the Council confident of victory; as yet nothing was
   pre-judged; the Bishop of Nicæa himself was on their side and they had
   relations with the Court.

   All were apparently at one in thinking that the Council could not break
   up without establishing a standard of doctrine, (pistis, mathema) Those
   in the East possessed neither a uniform nor a sufficiently
   authoritative symbol by which the controversy could be settled. The
   Lucianists accordingly--who may have been about twenty in number, not
   more at any rate--produced, after deliberation, a confession of faith
   which was communicated by Eusebius of Nicomedia and embodied their
   doctrine in unambiguous terms. They did this without having previously
   come to an understanding with the Origenists. This was a tactical
   blunder. The great majority of the bishops rejected this rule of faith
   which was decisively in favour of Arianism. [121] Even the
   "Conservatives" must have been unpleasantly affected by the naked
   statement of the Arian doctrinal system. The supporters of Arius were
   now in the greatest perplexity owing to the unforeseen turn which
   events had taken. In order to be able to keep their position at the
   Council at all, they, with the exception of two who remained firm,
   withdrew this sketch of their doctrine, and now made up their minds to
   follow the lead of the Origenists in order to secure at least
   something. Eusebius of Cæsarea now came to the front. No one was more
   learned than he; no one was more intimately acquainted with the
   teaching of the Fathers. He had good reason to hope that he would be
   able to speak the decisive word. If there was a general conviction that
   in everything it was necessary to abide by the ancient doctrine of the
   Church, then there seemed to be no one more fitted to define that
   ancient doctrine than the great scholar who was also, moreover, in the
   highest favour with the Emperor. His formulæ were, "the created image",
   "the reflection originating in the will", "the second God" etc. [122]
   He could, if needful, have accepted the Arian formula; those of
   Alexander he could not adopt, for he saw in them the dreaded
   Sabellianism which meant the death of theological science. Eusebius
   accordingly laid a creed before the Council. [123] He was convinced
   that all could and must unite on the basis supplied by it, and as a
   matter of fact no better conciliatory formula could be imagined. [124]
   Still Eusebius considered it necessary to tack on to it an
   anti-Sabellian addition. [125] According to Eusebius the Creed was
   unanimously pronounced orthodox, [126] still the imperial will already
   made its influence felt here. The Arians were doubtless well pleased to
   get off on these terms. But Alexander and his following demanded a
   perfectly plain rejection of Arianism. They went about it in an
   extremely adroit fashion inasmuch as they accepted the basis of the
   Creed of Cæsarea, but demanded that its terms should be made more
   precise. We know from Eusebius himself that the Emperor sided with
   them, and so far as he was concerned resolved to incorporate in the
   Creed the word "homoousios", which was suggested to him by Hosius.
   [127] But the matter was not settled by the mere insertion of a word.
   It was pointed out that the Creed of Cæsarea contained formulæ which
   might favour the Arian view. Its supporters were already put in the
   position of defendants. Accordingly, the Alexandrian party presented a
   very carefully constructed doctrinal formula which was represented as
   being a revised form of the Creed of Cæsarea [128] and in which some
   think they can recognise, in addition to the contributions of the
   Alexandrians, the hand of Eustathius of Antioch and of Makarius of
   Jerusalem. [129] (1) In place of apanton horaton etc., ("of all seen
   things whatsoever"), there was put by preference panton horaton ("of
   all seen things"), in order to exclude the creation of the Son and
   Spirit; [130] (2) in place of the Logos at the beginning of the second
   article, the "Son" was put, so that all that follows refers to the Son;
   [131] (3) the words Theon ek Theou ("God of God") were extended to
   gennethenta ek tou patros monogene Theon ek Theou ("begotten of the
   Father only begotten God of God"), but in the final discussion,
   however, between monogene and Theon the words tout' estin ek tes ousias
   tou patros ("that is of the substance of the Father") were further
   inserted, because it was observed that otherwise the opposition party
   might be able to put their doctrine into the proposition; [132] (4) the
   unsatisfactory descriptions zoen ek zoes ("life of life"), prototokon
   pases ktiseos ("the first-born of every creature"), pro panton aionon
   ek tou patros gegennemenon ("begotten of the Father before all ages"),
   before di' hou, etc., were deleted, and in their place the following
   was put: Theon alethinon ek Theou alethinou, gennethenta, ou
   poiethenta, di' hou ta panta egeneto ("true God of true God, begotten,
   not made, by whom all things were"). At this point, however, a further
   insertion was made, and this once more in the course of the discussion
   itself, [133] at what too was not at all a suitable place--namely,
   after "poiethenta" ("made"), the words homoousion to patri ("of the
   same substance with the Father"), because it was observed that none of
   the other terms excluded the Arian evasions; (5) the indefinite en
   anthropois politeusamenon ("having lived amongst men") was replaced by
   the definite enanthropesanta ("having become incarnate"); and (6)
   finally, in order to exclude all ambiguity, the condemnation of the
   Arian catchwords was added on to this. [134]

   The opposition parties did not yield without debates, in which the
   Emperor himself took part. [135] We do not know the details of the
   discussions, but we gather from the accounts of Athanasius that the
   Eusebians made still further proposals of a conciliatory kind and
   attempted to produce new catchwords. [136] The nature of their
   objections to the Alexandrian outline of doctrine may be gathered from
   the irenic explanation which Eusebius gave to his Church in Cæsarea as
   well as from the objections which later on were brought against the
   Nicene Creed. They fought against ek tes ousias ("of the substance")
   and homoousios because (1) they believed they saw in these words a
   materialising of the Godhead, which made it a composite substance
   comprising emanations or parts; because (2) they could not help seeing
   in the homoousios a Sabellian definition too, and because (3) the words
   did not occur in Holy Scripture. This last reason was specially
   decisive. In many parts of the Church there was still a shrinking from
   the definite adoption of unbiblical terms for the expression of the
   Faith. [137] In addition to this there was the fact that the homoousios
   had before this been rejected at Antioch. [138] But the will of the
   Emperor decided the matter. Respect for the Emperor, his express
   declaration that there was a desire not to endanger the absolute
   spirituality of the Godhead, the wish to conclude a grand work of
   peace--this doctrinal declaration [139] of the entire Church was,
   moreover, something new and imposing--induced the Conservatives, i.e.,
   the Origenists and those who did not think for themselves, to fall in
   with what was proposed. They all subscribed with the exception of two,
   and at the same time salved their consciences in different ways by
   mental reservations. [140] The Lucianists who up till now had to all
   appearance been united together in an indissoluble friendship, were
   unprincipled enough to sacrifice their old comrade Arius. [141] He was
   condemned as the scapegoat, and the Emperor, anxious to protect with
   the strong hand the unity which had been won, gave orders that the
   books of Arius should be burned and that his adherents should
   henceforth be called "Porphyrians", i.e., should be placed on a level
   with the worst enemies of Christ. [142] To the Alexandrian Church he
   wrote: ho tois triakosiois eresen episkopois ouden estin eteron e tou
   Theou gnome, malista ge hopou to hagion pneuma toiouton kai telikouton
   andron tais dianoiais enkeimenon ten theian boulesin exephotisen [143]
   ("what satisfied the three hundred bishops is nothing else than the
   judgment of God, but most of all where the Holy Spirit being present in
   the thoughts of men such as these and so ripe in years, made known the
   Divine will"). He persecuted the Arians, and the orthodox approved of
   what he did. They are thus responsible along with him for the
   persecution. The Arians at a later date only carried on what the
   orthodox had begun.

   The correct faith had triumphed and--the Bishop of Alexandria. [144]
   The Council of Nicæa is the first step taken by the Bishop of
   Alexandria in aspiring to the primacy of the East.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3] See Vol. iii., pp. 40, 45.

   [4] It is extremely probable that Lucian's study of Origen too had
   convinced him of the correctness of the Logos doctrine. We have to
   regard his doctrine as a combination of the doctrines of Paul and
   Origen. Lucian and Origen are classed together by Epiph., H. 76, 3, as
   teachers of the Arians.

   [5] Amongst Lucian's pupils were Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia,
   Menophantus of Ephesus, Theognis of Nicæa, Maris of Chalcedon,
   Athanasius of Anazarbus (?), the sophist Asterius, and Leontius,
   afterwards bishop of Antioch, and others. In Syria the pupils of
   Dorotheus--namely, Eusebius of Cæsarea and Paulinus of Tyre were
   supporters of Arius, as were also many of Origen's admirers. As regards
   the other partisans of Arius who are known to us by name, we do not
   know whether they were pupils of Lucian or not. Egypt and Libya are
   represented by Theonas of Marmarica, Secundus of Ptolemais and the
   presbyter Georgius of Alexandria, and further, according to
   Philostorgius, by Daches of Berenice, Secundus of Tauchira, Sentianus
   of Boraum, Zopyrus of Barka and Meletius of Lykopolis. In other
   provinces we have Petrophilus of Scythopolis, Narcissus of Neronias,
   Theodotus of Laodicea, Gregorius of Berytus and Aëtius of Lydda.
   Philostorgius further mentions others, but he also reckons as belonging
   to his party those old bishops who did not live to see the outbreak of
   the controversy and who accordingly have been claimed by the orthodox
   side as well; see Gwatkin l.c., p. 31. For other names of presbyters
   and deacons at Alexandria who held Arian views, see the letters of
   Alexander in Theodoret, I. 4, and Socrates, I. 6.

   [6] These pupils of Lucian must have displayed all the
   self-consciousness, the assurance, and the arrogance of a youthful
   exclusive school (ek tes autes deleteriou phratrias, says Epiphanius in
   one place, H. 69, 5), haughtily setting themselves far above the
   "ancients" and pitying their want of intelligence. Highly
   characteristic in this respect is the account of Alexander, their
   opponent, after making all allowance for the malevolent element in it;
   see very specially the following passage, Theodoret, H. E. I. 4): hoi
   oude ton archaion tinas sunkrinein heautois axiousin, oude hois hemeis
   ek paidon homilesamen didaskalois exisousthai anechontai; all' oude ton
   nun pantachou sulleitourgon tina eis metron sophias hegountai; monoi
   sophoi kai aktemones kai dogmaton heuretai legontes einai, kai autois
   apokekaluphthai monois, aper oudeni ton hupo ton helion hetero pephuken
   elthein eis ennoian. One may further compare the introduction to the
   Thalia.

   [7] He is thus a created "God."

   [8] For the proofs of what is here said regarding Lucian see my article
   "Lucian" in Herzog's R.-Encykl., 2nd ed. Vol. VIII. Here I give merely
   the following. For the close connection between Arius and Lucian we
   possess a series of witnesses. Alexander of Alex. says expressly in his
   letter to Alexander (Theodoret H.E. I. 4) that Arius started from
   Lucian. Arius himself in his letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia describes
   himself and his friend as Sulloukianistes; Philostorgius enumerates the
   pupils of Lucian, whom he regards as the friends of Arius (II. 14), and
   lets us see (II. 3, 13-15 and III. 15) that at the beginning of the
   fifth century Lucian was still regarded as the patriarch and teacher of
   the Arians. Epiphanius (Hær. 43. 1) and Philostorgius (l.c.) inform us
   that Lucian was revered by the Arians as a martyr. Epiphanius and
   Marius Victorinus call the Arians "Lucianists" (see also Epiph. H. 76.
   3). Sozomen relates that the Fathers of Arian or semi-Arian views
   assembled in Antioch in the year 341 accepted a confession of faith of
   Lucian's (III. 5). This confession is, it is true, given by Athanasius
   (de synodis 23), Socrates (II. 10) and Hilary (de synod. 29) without
   any statement as to its having originated with Lucian; but Sozomen
   informs us that a semi-Arian synod which met in Caria in 367 also
   recognised it as Lucianist (VI. 12). According to the author of the
   seven dialogues on the Trinity, who was probably Maximus Confessor, the
   Macedonians did the same (Dial. III. in Theodoreti Opp. V. 2, p. 991
   sq., ed. Schultze and Nöss). The semi-Arians also at the synod of
   Seleucia in 359 seem to have ascribed the Confession to Lucian (see
   Caspari, Alte and neue Quellen zur Gesch. d. Taufsymbols, p. 42 f., n.
   18). Since Sozomen himself, however, questions the correctness of the
   view which attributes it to Lucian, and since, moreover, other reasons
   may be alleged against it, we ought with Caspari to regard the creed as
   a redaction of a confession of Lucian's. This fact too shews what a
   high reputation the martyr had in those circles. That Lucian's school
   was pre-eminently an exegetical one is evident amongst other things
   from Lucian's well-known activity in textual criticism, as well as from
   Philostorg. (III. 15).

   [9] See on Arius, e.g., Epiphan. H. 69 c. 69, on Aëtius, who was
   indirectly a pupil of Lucian (Philostorg. III. 15), the numerous
   passages in the Cappadocians and Epiphanius H. 76 T. III., p. 251, ed.
   Oehler. Besides, in almost every sentence of what is left us of the
   writings of Aëtius we see the Aristotelian. Philostorgius testifies to
   the fact that he specially occupied himself with Logic and Grammar; see
   above all, the little work of Aëtius in 74 theses, which Epiphanius (H.
   76) has preserved for us. In his application of Aristotelianism Aëtius,
   however, went further than Arius, as is peculiarly evident from the
   thesis of the knowableness of God.

   [10] See Vol. III., p. 24.

   [11] Correctly given in Baur, L. v. d. Dreieinigkeit I., p. 387
   ff.--not at all clear in Dorner op. cit. I., p. 859.

   [12] It is self-evident that this combination deprived Paul's system of
   doctrine of all the merit which it contained.

   [13] According to Theodoret (Hær. fab. IV. 3) it was Aëtius himself who
   called theology "technology." Perhaps the most characteristic example
   of how this technology treated purely religious language is to be found
   in the benediction with which Aëtius concluded one of his works
   (Epiphan. H. 76. T. III., p. 222, ed. Oehler). Erromenous kai erromenas
   humas ho on autogenntos Theos, ho kai monos alethinos Theos
   prosagoreutheis hupo tou apostalentos Iesou Christou, hupostantos te
   alethos pro aionon kai ontos alethos gennetes hupostaseos, diateresei
   apo tes asebeias, en Christo Iesou to kurio hemon, di' hou pasa doxa to
   patri kai nun kai aei kai eis tous aionas ton aionon. Amen. This
   reminds us mutatis mutandis of the benediction of the modern
   rationalistic preacher, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the great
   teacher and friend of men, be with you all." I am glad further to see
   that Rupp too (Gregor von Nyssa, p. 139) has connected the conception
   of agennesia, as being a central one in Eunomius, with the proton
   kinoun akineton of Aristotle.

   [14] Spite, however, of what we know of the Meletian schism in
   Alexandria and of the temporary connection of Arius with it, (cf. also
   the schism of Colluthus) it is not very clear if the outbreak of the
   Arian controversy, is connected with the opposition between episcopate
   and presbyterate (against Böhringer). The Alexandrian Presbyters were
   at that time actual Parochi. There are some obscure references in the
   letter of Alexander (Theodoret I. 4), see Gwatkin, p. 29.

   [15] See Vol. III., p. 99 ff.

   [16] See Constantine's letter in Euseb., Vita Constant. II. 69; the
   notices in the Church historians and in Epiphanius (H. 69. 4) can
   hardly be reconciled with it. Along with Constantine's statements the
   account of Socrates is specially worthy of consideration (I. 5).

   [17] Ep. Arii ad Alex. in Athanas. de synod. 16 and Epiphan. H. 69. 7.
   According to Philostorg. I. 3, the exertions of Arius had very
   specially contributed to bring about the election of Alexander as
   bishop, although he could then have become bishop himself.

   deiknusin, hos hoti huper heautou spoudazon touto poiei. His lust of
   power is characterised by Alexander in the words (l. c.) nomisas ep'
   auto keisthai ta tes ekklesias.

   [19] He is supposed to have been related to the Emperor. According to a
   letter of Constantine's of a later date (in Theodoret. H. E. I. 19) he
   remained faithful to Licinius and had before the catastrophe worked
   against Constantine.

   [21] See the letter to Paulinus of Tyre--which is put later by some--in
   Theodoret, H. E. I. 6. In this letter Eusebius praises the zeal of the
   Church historian Eusebius in the matter and blames Paulinus for his
   silence. He too ought to come to the help of Arius by giving a written
   opinion based on the theology of the Bible. There is a fragment of a
   letter of Eusebius to Arius in Athanasius, de synod. 17, where there
   are also other letters of the friends of Arius.

   [22] See Socrat. H. E. I. 6 and Athanas., Opp. I., p. 313 sq. (ed.
   Paris, 1689, p. 397 sq.).

   letter is written to several persons.

   [25] On the Thalia see Athan., Orat. c. Arian I. 2-10 de synod. 15.
   Philostorgius II. 2 tells us that Arius put his doctrine also into
   songs for sailors, millers, and travellers etc., in order thus to bring
   it to the notice of the lower classes. Athanasius also mentions songs.
   We can see from this that Arius made no distinction between faith and
   philosophical theology. He followed the tendency of the time. His
   opponents are for him "heretics."

   [31] Constantine wrote the letter not as a theologian, but as Emperor,
   which ought in fairness to be reckoned to his credit. The introduction
   is very skilfully worded: the Emperor trusted that he would he able
   with the help of the Eastern bishops to compose the Donatist schism,
   and now he sees the East torn by a far more destructive schism. He
   offers his services as mediator and accordingly takes up an absolutely
   impartial position. "Alexander should not have asked the questions and
   Arius should not have answered them; for such questions lie outside the
   "Law"; and above all, care ought to have been taken not to bring them
   to the notice of the people. The opponents, who at bottom presumably
   had the same convictions, ought to come to an agreement and compose
   their differences; this is what is done in the schools of philosophy;
   those who attend them dispute, but they afterwards formulate terms of
   agreement upon a common basis. It is only the common people and
   ignorant boys who quarrel about trifles." The close of the letter
   expresses the very great anxiety felt by the Emperor lest the grand
   work of restoring peace and unity entrusted to him by Providence should
   be hindered. He accordingly most earnestly urges peace, even if they
   cannot actually agree. In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas
   and--reserve, is thus the watchword of the Emperor; in faith in
   Providence and in the conception of the Supreme Being they are
   certainly one: for the upholder of all has given to all a common light;
   differences of opinion on separate points are unavoidable and are
   perfectly legitimate when there is radical unity in dogma. "Restore to
   me my peaceful days and my undisturbed nights and do not allow me to
   spend what remains of my life in joylessness." The close is once more
   very effective: he had already started, he says, for Alexandria, but
   had turned back when he heard of the split; the combatants may make it
   possible for him to come by becoming reconciled. This letter can hardly
   have been written under the influence of Eusebius of Nicomedia; still
   Nicomedia had already before this been the starting-point of a movement
   for bringing about union, as the conciliatory epistle of Arius and the
   pacific letter of his friends prove.

   [32] If according to Socrat. III. 7, he at this time agitated in
   Alexandria the question about housia and hupostasis, it must have been
   in the western-orthodox sense. On the other hand, it is said (l. c.)
   that Hosius when in Alexandria endeavoured to refute the doctrine of
   Sabellius. He might thus, as a matter of fact, regard himself as a
   mediator, namely, between the Arian and Sabellian doctrinal
   propositions; see on this below. It is probable that a Synod was held
   in Alexandria during his stay there.

   [33] This, it is true, is the account only of Philostorgius (I. 7), but
   there is no reason fur mistrusting him.

   [34] In Egypt the tumults were so serious that even the image of the
   Emperor was attacked (Vita Const. III. 4).

   [35] This is the account given by Sulpicius Severus, Chron. II. 40;
   "Nicæna synodus auctore Hosio confecta habebatur."

   of this important and influential bishop covers the century between the
   death of Origen and the birth of Augustine.

   [37] From the letter of Arius to Eusebius of Nicomedia.

   [38] Lightfoot (S. Ignatius Vol. II., p. 90 ff.) has published a
   learned discussion on agenetos (underived) and agennetos (unbegotten)
   in the Fathers up till Athanasius. Ignatius (Eph. 7) called the Son as
   to His Godhead "agennetos." In the first decades of the Arian
   controversy no distinction was made between the words, i.e., the
   difference in the writing of them was not taken account of, and this
   produced frightful confusion. Still Athanasius saw clearly from the
   first that though the conception of generation might hold good of the
   Son, that of becoming or derivation did not; s. de synod 3: ton patera
   monon anarchon onta kai agenneton gegennekenai anephiktos kai pasin
   akataleptos oidamen; ton de huion gegennesthai pro aionon kaik meketi
   homoios to patri agenneton einai kai auton, all' archen echein ton
   gennesanta patera. Spite of this he could say (l. c. c. 46): touto to
   onoma--scil. agennetos, as if it were identical in form with
   agenetos--diaphora echei ta semainomena. kai hoi men, to on men mete de
   gennethen, mete holos echon ton aition, legousin agenneton, hoi de to
   aktiston; see also the tiresome distinctions in the work "de decret.
   synod. Nic." 28 sq. The distinction in fact between gennan, gignesthai,
   ktizein was not yet itself a definite one. At a later period there was
   no hesitation in asserting that the Son both as God and as Man is
   gennetos; s. Joh. Damasc. I. 8: chre gar eidenai, hoti to ageneton, dia
   tou henos n graphomenon, to aktiston e to me genomenon semainei, to de
   agenneton, dia ton duo n graphomenon, deloi to me gennethen. From this
   he infers that the Father only is agennetos, while the Son as God is
   gennetos and indeed monos gennetos. One can see from the wonderful word
   of Alexander's, agenetogenes, what difficulties were created at first
   for the orthodox by the agen[n]etos. Athanasius would have preferred to
   banish entirely the fatal word and not to have used it even for the
   Father. That it, as is the case with homoousios also, was first used by
   the Gnostics and in fact by the Valentinians is evident from the
   striking passage in the letter of Ptolemaus to Flora c. 5, which has
   hitherto escaped the notice of those who have investigated the subject.
   Ptolemaus is there dealing with the only good primal God, the primal
   ground of all Being and all things, with the true demiurge and Satan.
   He writes amongst other things: kai estai (ho demiourgos) men
   katadeesteros tou teleiou Theou, hate de kai gennetos on kai ouk
   agennetos--heis gar estin agennetos ho pater, ex hou ta panta . . .
   meizon de kai kurioteros tou antikeimenou genesetai kai eteras ousias
   te kai phuseos pephukos para ten hekateron touton ousian . . . tou de
   patros ton holon tou agennetou--that is thus the characteristic!--he
   ousia estin aphtharsia te kai phos autoon, haploun te kai monoeides, he
   de toutou (scil. tou demiourgou) ousia ditten men tina dunamin
   proegagen, autos de tou kreittonos estin eikon. mede se ta nun touto
   thorubeito, thelousan mathein, pos apo mias arches ton holon ouses te
   kai homologoumenes hemin kai pepisteumenes, tes agennetou kai
   aphthartou kai agathes, sunestesan kai hautai hai phuseis, he te tes
   phthoras kai he tes mesotetos, anomoousioi hautai kathestosai, tou
   agathou phusin echontos ta homoia heauto kai homoousia gennan te gai
   propherein; mathese gar hexes kai ten toutou archen te kai gennesin.
   This is how Ptolemaus wrote c. 160. His words already contain the
   ecclesiastical terminology of the future! We also already meet with the
   term "sophia anupostatos" in a passage of his l. c. c. 1. Many passages
   prove, moreover, that not only the words employed later on, but also
   the ideas from which sprang the Church doctrine of the immanent Trinity
   in its subsequent form, were present in the writings of the
   Valentinians, as, e.g., the following from Hipp. Philos. VI. 29
   (Heracleon): en holos genneton ouden, pater de en monos agennetos . . .
   epei de en gonimos, edoxen auto pote to kalliston kai teleotaton, ho
   heichen en auto, gennesai kai proagagein; phileremos gar ouk en; Agape
   gar, phesin, en holos, he de agape ouk estin agape, ean me e to
   agpaomenon . . . teleioteros de ho pater, hoti agennetos on monos. In
   what follows the whole discussion is conditioned by the problem that
   the begotten Æons are in their nature indeed homoousioi with the
   Father, but that they are imperfect as gennetoi and are inferior to the
   monos agennetos. Here therefore the field for the Arian-Athanasian
   controversy is already marked out. But it is to be noticed further that
   the three terms, monogenes, prototokos, and eikon contain and define
   the entire Valentinian Christology, which is of an extremely
   complicated character. (See Heinrici, die Valentin. Gnosis. p. 120). In
   the fourth century, however, they became the catchwords of the
   different Christologies.

   [39] It is impossible to come to any certain decision on this point, so
   long as it is not proved that the pieces which are ascribed to
   Alexander are really his, and at the same time so long as it is
   uncertain if the sentences from them which also bear the names of
   Irenæus and Melito really belong to these writers and have been made
   use of by Alexander. See on this question Cotterill, Modern Criticism
   and Clement's Epp. to the Virgins, 1884, on this ThLZ., 1884, p. 267 f;
   Pitra, Analecta Sacra T. IV. pp. 196 sq., 430 sq. On this Loofs, ThLZ.
   1884, Col. 572 f., and very specially Krüger, Ztschr. f. wiss. Theol.
   1888, p. 434 ff.; Melito of Sardes and Alex. of Alexandria. Socrates
   asserts (I. 5) that Arius believed that Alexander wished to introduce
   the doctrinal system of Sabellius. But the Christology of Irenæus has
   also been understood in a "Sabellian" sense. The important address of
   Alexander on soul and body, in which he also treats of the Incarnation,
   is to be found in Migne T. 18.

   [40] This was the original point of dispute. Diokometha, writes Arius

   [41] See the fragment from the Thalia in Athan. de synod. 15, the
   letter of Eusebius of Nicomedia to Paulinus, also that of Arius to
   Alexander.

   [42] The fragments of the Thalia and the two letters of Arius which
   have been preserved are amongst the most important sources: cf. also
   the confession of faith of Arius in Socr. I. 26 (Sozom. II. 27). Then
   we have the statements of his earliest opponents, very specially the
   two letters of Alexander and the verbal quotations of the propositions
   of Arius in Athanasius; see especially ep. ad episc. "Ægypt 12 and de
   sentent. Dionys. 23, also the Orat. c. Arian. In the third place, we
   can adduce the propositions laid down by the earliest Arians, or by the
   patrons of Arius. Opponents made little difference between them and
   Arius himself, and the actual facts shew that they were justified in so
   doing; see the letter of Eusebius of Nicomedia to Paulinus and the
   fragments of Arian letters in Athanas. de synod. 17, also the fragments
   from Asterius. Finally, we have to consider what the Church historians
   and Epiphanius have to tell us regarding the doctrinal propositions of
   Arius. There was no "evolution" of Arianism, we can only distinguish
   different varieties of it. Even Eunomius and Aëtius did not "develop"
   the doctrinal system, but only gave it a logically perfect form. Lucian
   had already completed the entire system, as is specially evident from
   the letter of Eusebius of Nicomedia to Paulinus; see also the
   introduction to the Thalia in Athan., Orat. c. Arian. I. 5, which,
   moreover, presents the character of Arius in an unfavourable light:
   kata pistin eklekton Theou, suneton Theou, paidon hagionm orthotomon,
   hagion Theou pneuma labonton, tade emathon egoge hupo ton sophies mete
   chonton, asteion, theodidakton, kata panta sophon te; touton kat'
   ichnos elthon ego bainon homodoxos ho periklutos, ho polla pathon dia
   ten Theou doxan, hupo te Theou mathon sophian kai gnosin ego egnon.

   [43] In the doctrine of God as held by Arius and his friends two main
   ideas appear all through as those upon which everything depends: (1)
   that God alone is agennetos; (2) that all else has been created out of
   nothing by God's free will. In accordance with this they get rid of
   everything designated as probole agennetos, eruge, gennema, meros
   homoousion, ex aporroias tes ousias, monas platuntheisa, hen eis duo
   dieremenon, etc.; even the old pictorial expressions "Light of Light",
   "Torch of Torch" are rejected, and they will have nothing to do with
   the transformation of an originally impersonal eternal essence or
   substance in God into a personally subsisting essentiality; see the
   epp. Arii ad Euseb. et Alexand. Ei to; Hek gastros, kai to; Ek patros
   exelthon kai heko, hos meros tou homoousiou kai hos probole hupo tinon
   noeitai, sunthetos estai ho pater kai diairetos kai treptos kai soma
   . . . kai ta akoloutha somati paschon ho asomatos Theos.; It was
   Eusebius Nic. specially in his letter to Paulinus, who developed the
   thought that "to beget" is equal to "to create" and he, for the rest,
   allows that if the Son were begotten out of the substance of the Father
   the predicate agennetos would attach to Him, and He would possess the
   tautotis tes phuseos with the Father. In laying down their doctrine of
   God, Arius and his friends express themselves with a certain amount of
   fervour. One can see that they have a genuine concern to defend
   monotheism. At the same time they are as much interested in the
   negative predicates of the Godhead as the most convinced
   Neo-platonists. On pater see the Thalia in Athan., Orat. I. c. Arian c.
   5: ouk aei ho Theos pater en, all' en hote ho Theos monos en kai oupo
   pater en, husteron de epigegone pater.

   pepoigmenon ouk en prin genesthai, to genomenon de archen echei tou
   einai. Athan. Nazarb., ep. ad. Alex.: "Why do you blame the Arians
   because they say that the Son ktisma pepoietai ex ouk onton kai hen ton
   panton estin? We are to understand by the hundred sheep of the parable
   all created beings, and thus the Son too is included." Georg. Laod. ep.
   ad. Alex.: "Don't blame the Arians because they say en pote hote ouk en
   ho huios tou Theou, Isaiah too came later than his father." Georg.
   Laod. ep. ad. Arianos. "Don't be afraid to allow that the Son is from
   the Father; for the Apostle says that all things are from God, although
   it is certain that all things are ex ouk onton." Thalia (de synod. 15):
   he monas en, he duas de ouk en prin huparxei. Arius for the rest seems
   to have considered the creation of this "Son" as simply a necessity,
   because God could not create directly, but required an intermediate
   power.

   [46] Ep. Euseb. ad Paulin.: Hen to ageneton, hen de to hup' autou
   alethos kai ouk ek tes ousias autou gegonos, katholou tes phuseos tes
   agenetou me metechon, alla gegonos holocheros heteron te phusei k. te
   dunamei.. The tautotes tes phuseos is rejected. Ep. Arii ad Alex.:
   huion hupostesanta idio thelemati atrepton kai analloioton. Who says,
   therefore, that the Son is in everything like the Father introduces two
   "agennetoi." Thalia: te men phusei hosper pantes houto de autos ho
   logos esti treptos, to de idio autexousio, heos bouletai, menei kalos;
   hote men toi thelei dunatai trepesthai kai autos hosper kai hemeis,

   Arretos Theos ison oude homoion ouch homodoxon echei. ho huios idion
   ouden echei tou Theou kath' hupostasin idiotetos oude gar estin isos
   all' oude homoousios auto. The Triad is not of homoiais doxais:
   anepimikta heautais eisin hai hupostaseis auton, mia tes mias
   endoxotera doxais ep' apeiron. Xenos tou huiou kat' ousian ho pater,
   hoti anarchos huparchei. According to the letter of Eusebius to
   Paulinus it looks as if Eusebius held the unchangeableness of the Son
   to belong to his substance; he probably, however, only means that it
   had come to be his substance. At a later date many Arians must have
   attributed to the Son an original unchangeableness as a gift of the
   Father, for Philostorgius mentions as a peculiarity of the Arian bishop
   Theodosius that he taught (VIII. 3): ho Christos treptos men te ge
   phusei te oikeia.

   [47] Because of this sundering of the Father and the Son the Arians at
   a later date are also called "Diatomites" (Joh. Damasc. in Cotellier,
   Eccl. Gr. monum. I., p. 298).

   [48] Thalia (Orat. c. Arian I. 6): oude Theos alethinos estin ho logos.
   He is only called God, but he is not truly God, kai to huio ho pater
   aoratos huparchei kai oute horan oute gignoskein teleios kai akribos

   gignoskomen kata ten idian dunamin. Ho huios ten heautou ousian ouk
   oide. Euseb. Cæs. ep. ad Euphrat.: Christos ouk estin alethinos Theos.
   The conviction that the Son is not truly God, and that all lofty
   predicates attach to him only in a nuncupative sense, that he does not
   know the Father, is very strongly expressed in the fragment of the
   Thalia de synod. 15.

   [49] Arii Ep. ad Euseb.: pleres Theos monogenes, analloiotos (in virtue
   of his will). Arii ep. ad Alex.: huion monogene . . . ktisma tou Theou

   Reflection, Word; God cannot produce a greater than He; Theou thelesei
   ho huios helikos kai hosos estin, ex hote kai aph' hou kai apo tote ek
   tou Theou hupeste, ischuros Theos on, but he extols the greater Father.
   Arius ap. Athan. Orat. I. c. Arian. 9: metoche kai autos etheopoiethe.
   It is evident from Alexander's letter to Alexander that Arius strongly
   emphasised the prokope, the moral progress of the Son.

   [50] Owing to the general uncertainty regarding the extent of the
   "humanity" which prevailed at the beginning of the controversy, the
   latter assertion of the Arians was not so energetically combatted as
   the rest. That the limitation of the humanity of Christ to a body
   originated with Lucian, is asserted by Epiph. Ancorat. 33.

   [51] In the writings of Arius ousia and hupostasis are used as
   synonymous terms. The impersonal Spirit (Logos, Wisdom) indwelling in
   God the Father as Power, was naturally considered by the Arians to be
   higher than the Son. On this point they appeal like the old Roman
   Adoptianists to Matt. XII. 31 (see Vol. III., p. 20 ff.). It is indeed
   not even certain whether Arius and the older Arians when they speak of
   a Trinity, always included the Holy Spirit. According to Athanasius de
   synod. 15, we may conclude that their Trinity consisted of the
   following hypostases: (1) God as primordial without the Son; (2) God as
   Father; (3) the Son. Still this is not certain.

   [52] Orat. I. c. Arian. 8.

   [53] On Asterius see Athan., Orat. c. Arian. I. 30-33; II. 37; III. 2,
   60; de decret. syn. Nic. 8, 28-31; de synod. 18, 19, 47. Epiphan. H.
   76, 3; Socrat. I. 36; Philostorg. II. 14, 15; Hieron. de vir. inl. 94.
   Marcellus of Ancyra wrote against the principal work of Asterius, see
   Zahn, p. 41 ff. Athanasius attacked a suntagmation of his. One of the
   main theses of this book was that there are two ageneta. Asterius also
   discussed 1 Cor. I. 24, and indeed he took the correct view. His
   explanation too of the passage John XIV. 10, is worthy of note: eudelon
   hoti dia touto eireken heauton men en to patri, en heauto de palin ton
   patera, epei mete ton logou, hon diexercheto, heautou phesin einai,
   alla tou patros dedokotos ten dunamin. Upon this passage Athanasius
   remarks (Orat. III. 2) that only a child could be pardoned such an
   explanation. It is a point of great importance that Asterius, like Paul
   of Samosata, reckoned the will as the highest thing. Accordingly, to
   create of His free will is more worthy of God too than to beget (l. c.
   III. 60). Athanasius says that Arius himself made use of the work of
   Asterius, and in this connection he gives us the important statement of
   Asterius (de decret. 8) that created things are not able tes akratou
   cheiros tou agennetou ergasian bastaxai, and that on account of this
   the creation of the Son as an intermediary was necessary. (See Orat. c.
   Arian II. 24.)

   [54] John I. 1, 13, 18, X. 15, 30, XIV. 9, 10; Hebr. I. 3, II. 10,
   X1II. 8; Ps. XLV. 2; CX. 3; Mal. III. 6. The passages continued to be
   regarded by the orthodox as the most important.

   [55] Theodoret I. 4. Exaggerations and calumnies of the worst kind are
   not wanting in this writing. The reproach, too, that the Arians acted
   like the Jews is already found here. Of more importance, however, is
   the assertion that the Arian christology gave countenance to the
   heathen ideas of Christ and that the Arians had also in view the
   approval of the heathen. Ebion, Artemas (see Athanas., de synod. 20)
   and Paul are designated their Fathers.

   [56] The two last theses are rejected in a specially emphatic manner.
   Alexander repeatedly complains in this connection of the procedure of
   Arius in taking from the Holy Scriptures only such passages as have
   reference to the humiliation of the Logos for our sakes, and then
   referring them to the substance of the Logos. "They omit the passages
   which treat of the divinity of the Son. Thus they arrive at the impious
   supposition that Paul and Peter would have been like Christ if they had
   always persisted in the good."

   [57] John I. 1-3, I. 18, X. 30, XIV. 8, 9, 28; Matt. III. 17, XI. 27; 1
   John V. 1; Coloss. I. 15, 16; Rom. VIII. 32; Heb. I. 2 f.; Prov. VIII.
   30; Ps. II. 7, CX. 3, XXXV. 10; Is. LIII. 8.

   [58] From this it is plainly evident that the real point in dispute was
   not as to subordination and coordination, but as to unity of substance
   and difference of substance. That the archetype is greater than the
   type is for Alexander a truth that is beyond doubt. He goes still
   farther and says: oukoun to agenneto patri oikeion axioma phulakteon,
   medena tou einai auto ton aition legontas, to de huio ten harmozousan
   timen aponemeteon, ten anarchon auto para tou patros gennesin
   anatithentas.

   [59] The expression "homoousios" does not occur in Alexander.

   [60] On this expression, which was used by Arius, see Hort, Two
   Dissertations, 1876.

   [61] The respective passages in the letter have so many points of
   contact with expressions of Irenæus (see Vol. II., pp. 230 f., 276 f.)
   as to make the supposition, which also commends itself for other
   reasons, very probable (see above, p. 54, note 1), that Alexander had
   read Irenæus and had been strongly influenced by him. That Irenæus was
   known in Alexandria, at least at the beginning of the third century,
   follows from Euseb., H. E. VI. 14. (Strange to say it has undoubtedly
   not been proved that Athanasius ever quotes from Irenæus.) Alexander
   shews that he is not throughout dependent on Origen.

   [62] Alexander made no distinction between ousia, hupostasis, phusis.

   [63] Hon tropon gar he arretos autou hupostasis asunkrito huperoche
   edeichthe huperkeimene panton hois autos to einai echarisato, houtos
   kai he huiotes autou kata phusin tunchanousa tes patrikes theotetos
   alekto huperoche diapherei ton di' autou thesei huiotethenton.

   [64] On John X. 30: hoper phesin ho kurios ou patera heauton anagoreuon
   oude tas te hupostasei duo phuseis mian einai saphenizon, all' hoti ten
   patriken emphereian akribos pephuken sozein ho huios tou patros, ten
   kata panta homoioteta autou ek phuseos apomaxamenos kai aparallaktos
   eikon tou patros tunchanon kai tou prototutou ektupos charakter.

   [65] In the Confession of Faith which Alexander had put at the close of
   his letter, the Spirit, the Church, and so on, are mentioned. According
   to Alexander, too, the Logos got only a body from Mary, who, for the
   rest, is called theotokos (see Athan. Orat. III. 29, 33). Möhler and
   Newman (Hist. Treatises, p. 297) consider Athanasius as the real author
   of Alexander's encyclical epistle. Their arguments, however, are not
   convincing.

   [66] Hence the reproach so frequently brought against this doctrine,
   that according to it Father and Son are "brothers"; see, e.g., Orat. c.
   Arian I. 14. Paul of Samosata had already brought this reproach against
   all the adherents of the Logos doctrine. The Arians sought to make a
   reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine that the Son is the perfect image
   of the Father, by pointing out that in this case the Son too must beget
   as well as the Father (Or. c. Arian. I. 21).

   [67] See some of those adduced by them in Orat. c. Arian. I. 22: they
   are said to have pointed them out to children and women.

   [68] That he took an active interest in the Nicene Council is
   undoubted; see Theodoret I. 26, Sozom, I. 17 fin., but, above all,
   Apol. Athan. c. Arian. 6 and the work "de decretis." The Arians drew
   special attention to the influence exercised by Athanasius, when
   deacon, on his bishop Alexander, and Athanasius did not contradict
   their statements; see also Gregor Naz. Orat. 21, 14.

   [69] His chief works against the Arians are the four Orationes c.
   Arian--his most comprehensive work, containing mainly his refutation of
   the Arian Bible exegesis; the fourth Oration is, however, either merely
   a sketch, or else it is not in its proper place along with the others;
   further, the treatises de decret. Nic. synodi, de sentent. Dionys.
   Alex., historia Arian. ad monachos, apologia c. Arian., apologia ad
   imp. Constantium, de synodis Arimini et Seleuciæ habitis, the Tomus ad
   Antioch., and in addition the festival-orations and some lengthy
   letters, e.g., that ad Afros episcopos.

   [70] To prove this it would be necessary to quote hundreds of passages.
   In none of his larger works has Athanasius omitted to base his
   anti-Arian christology on the thought of redemption, and wherever he
   gives this as the basis one feels that he is adducing what is his most
   telling argument. The manner too in which he was able, starting from
   this as the central point of his whole view of the subject, to justify
   what were purely derivative formulæ by referring them back to it, is
   well worthy of notice; cf. the Orat. c. Arian., espec. II. 67-70. The
   fact that his knowledge of scientific theology was slender is hinted at
   by Gregor Naz., Orat. 21. 6.

   [71] Specially striking is what he says de synod. 51: Christ could not
   make others gods if He himself had, to begin with, been made God; if He
   possessed His god-head merely as something bestowed upon Him, He could
   not bestow it, for it would not be in His own power, and He would not
   have more than He needed Himself. Similarly Orat. I. 39, I. 30: Ouk ara
   katabas ebeltiothe alla mallon ebeltiosen autos ta deomena beltioseos;
   kai ei tou beltiosai charin katabebeken, ouk ara misthon esche to
   legesthai, huios kai Theos, alla mallon autos huiopoiesen hemas to
   patri kai etheopoiese tous anthropous genomenos autos anthropos. Ouk
   ara anthropos on husteron gegone Theos, alla Theos on husteron gegonen
   anthropos, hina mallon hemas theopoiese. II. 69, I. 16: autou tou huiou
   metechontes tou Theou metechein legometha, kai touto estin ho elegen ho
   Petros hina genesthe theias koinonoi phuseos.

   [72] The frequent designation of the Arians as Jews and heathen, and
   together with this the designation "Ariomanites," were employed by
   Athanasius in a really serious sense; see de decret. 1-4, 27; Encycl.
   ad. ep. "Ægypt. et Lib. 13, 14; Orat. I. 38, II. 16, 17, III, 16, 27
   sq. "Abomination of the impious" XI. Festbrief, p. 122 (Larsow).

   [73] Orat. I. 12: To the demand of Philip, "Shew us the Father," Christ
   did not reply: (blepe ten ktisin, but "He who sees me, sees the
   Father." Orat. I. 16: tou huiou metechontes tou Theou metechein
   legometha . . . he tou huiou ennoia kai katalepsis gnosis esti peri tou
   patros, dia to ek tes ousias autou idion einai gennema. I. 21.

   [74] This is a point which is very frequently emphasised; see Orat. I.
   10, II. 20, 24, but chiefly III. 16: Diati oun hoi Areianoi toiauta
   logizomenoi kai noountes ou sunarithmousin heautous meta ton Hellenon;
   kai gar kakeinoi, hosper kai outoi, te ktisei latreuousi para ton
   ktisanta ta panta Theon; alla to men onoma to Hellenikon pheugousi, dia
   ten ton anoeton apaten, ten de homoian ekeinois dianoian hupokrinontai.
   kai gar kai to sophon auton, hoper eiothasin legein, ou legomen duo
   agenneta, phainontai pros apaten ton akeraion legontes; phaskontes gar;
   "ou legomen duo agenneta," legousi duo Theous kai toutous diaphorous
   echontas tas phuseis, to men geneten, to de agenetoi. Ei de hoi men
   Hellenes heni ageneto kai pollois genetois latreuousin. houtoi de heni
   ageneto kai heni geneto, oud' houto diapherousin Hellenon. This was the
   view of it which was still held at a later period also. The expression
   in the Vita Euthymii (Cotel. Monum. II., p. 201) C. 2, is full of
   meaning: Tou Hellenismou lexantos ho tou Areianismou polemos ischuros
   ekratei.

   [75] It is very characteristic of Athanasius' way of looking at things
   that with him the Logos in general retires into the background, and
   further that he expressly declines to recognise or to define the divine
   in Christ from the point of view of his relation to the world or in
   terms of the predicate of the eternal. Image, Reflection and Son are
   the designations which he regards as most appropriate. See, e.g., Orat.
   III. 28: ou tosouton ek tou aidiou gnorizetai kurios, hoson hoti huios
   esti tou Theou; huios gar on achoristos esti tou patros . . . kai eikon
   kai apaugasma on tou patros echei kai ten aidioteta tou patros.

   [76] Beyond Origen and the Origenists, who, though they too certainly
   make a sharp distinction between the Godhead and the creation,
   attribute with Philo an intermediate position to the Logos. The
   Eusebians held fast to this, and that is why Athanasius always treats
   them as Arians; for in connection with this main point the maxim in his
   opinion held good "Whosover is not with us is against us." See Orat.
   IV. 6, 7; Encycl. ad ep. Ægypt, et Lib. 20; de decret. 6, 19, 20; ad
   Afros 5, 6, and the parallel section in the work "de synodis."

   [77] Orat. I. 15: If the Son is Son then that wherein He shares is not
   outside of the substance of the Father: touto de palin ean heteron e
   para ten ousian tou huiou to ison atopon apantesei, mesou palin
   heuriskomenou toutou ek tou patros kai tes ousias tou huiou, hetis pote
   esti. In putting it thus Athanasius corrected not only an incautious
   expression of Bishop Alexander (see above p. 24 f.), but very specially
   the thesis of the Origenists of "The image and reflection which sprang
   from and was created out of the will" (see e.g., Euseb. Demonstr. IV.
   3). But Arius himself, spite of all his efforts to avoid it, also
   arrived at the idea of a "middle substance" between the Godhead and the
   creature, because according to him God had necessarily to make use of
   such a being in order to be able to create at all.

   [78] In contrast to this it holds good of the Arians that ton
   demiourgon ton holon tois poiemasi sunarithmesosi (Orat. I. c. Arian.
   T. I., p. 342).

   [79] It is this which constitutes the most significant advance made by
   Athanasius, the real fruit of his speculation which took its start from
   the thought of redemption. The Logos of the philosophers was no longer
   the logos whom he knew and adored. The existence of the Logos who
   appeared in Christ is independent of the idea of the world. The
   creation of the world--abstractly speaking--might even have taken place
   without the Logos. This is the point in which he is most strongly
   opposed to the Apologists and Origen. No traces of this advance are to
   be found as yet in the works "c. Gent" and "de incarnat." See, on the
   other hand, Orat. II. 24, 25: ou kamnei ho Theos prostatton, oude
   asthenei pros ten ton panton ergasian, hina ton men huion monos monon
   ktise, eis de ten ton allon demiourgian hupourgou kai boethou chreian
   eche tou huiou. oude gar oude huperthesin echei, hoper an ethelese
   genesthai, alla monon hethelese kai hupeste ta panta, kai to boulemati
   autou oudeis anthesteke. Tinos oun heneka ou gegone ta panta para monou
   tou Theou to prostagmati, ho gegone kai ho huios . . . alogia men oun
   pasa par' authois; phasi de homos peri toutou, hos ara thelon ho Theos
   ten geneten ktisai phusin, epeide heora me dunamenen auten metaschein

   kai ktizei protos monon hena kai kalei touton huion kai logon, hina
   toutou mesou genomenou houtos loipon kai ta panta di autou genesthai
   dunethe; tauta ou monon eirekasin, alla kai grapsai tetolmekasin
   Eusebios te kai Areios kai ho thusas Asterios. As against this view
   Athanasius shews that God is neither so powerless as not to be able to
   create the creatures nor so proud as not to be willing to create them
   (ei de hos apaxion ho Theos ta alla ergasasthai, ton men huion monon
   eirgasato, ta da alla to huio anecheirisen hos boetho; kai touto men
   anaxion Theou; ouk esti gar en theo tuphos); he shews further from
   Matt. X. 29, VI. 25 f. that God cares for all things in the most direct
   way, and therefore has also brought them into existence. The same proof
   is given in de decret. 8. Athanasius thus did away with the latent
   dualism between the godhead and the creature which had existed in
   Christian theology since the time of Philo. God is creator in the
   directest way. This, however, implies that the Logos is discarded. If
   spite of this Athanasius not only retained the name, but also
   recognised the function of a mediator of creation and type of all
   rational beings, the reason was that he understood Scripture as
   implying this, and because he was not able wholly to free himself from
   the influence of tradition. But the Divine in Christ is no longer for
   him the world-reason, on the contrary it is the substance of the Father
   which--accidentally, as it were--has also the attributes of creative
   power and of the reason that embraces and holds ideas together. For
   Athanasius, in fact, the Son is the substance of the Father as the
   principle of redemption and sanctification. The most pregnant of his
   formulæ is in Orat. III. 6. in support of which he appeals to 2 Cor. V.
   19: to idion tes tou patros ousias estin ho huios, en ho he ktisis pros
   ton Theon katellasseto.

   [80] That the Godhead is a unity, is a thought which Athanasius
   emphasised in the strongest way over and over again (monas tes
   theotetos), (2) also that there are not two underived or unbegotten
   principles (archai), and finally (3) that the Father is the arche,
   which because of this may be identified with the monas also. He retorts
   the charge of Polytheism brought against him by the Arians; they, he
   says, adore two gods (see above, note 4, p. 27). The best summary of
   his view is in Orat. IV. I: monada tes theotetos adiaireton kai
   aschiston; lechtheie mia arche theotetos kai ou duo archai hothen
   kurios kai monarchia estin.

   [81] Orat. III. 6: patera ouk an tis eipoi, me huparchontos huiou; ho
   men toi poieten legon ton Theon ou pantos kai ta genomena deloi; esti
   gar kai pro ton poiematon poietes; ho de patera legon euthus meta tou
   patros semainei kai ten tou huiou huparxin. dia touto kai ho pisteuon
   eis ton huion eis ton patera pisteuei; eis gar to idion tes tou patros
   ousias pisteuei, kai houtos mia estin he pistis eis hena Theon. II. 41.
   De decret. 30 fin.: legontes men gar ekeinoi ton Theon ageneton ek ton
   genomenon auton poieten monon legousin, hina kai ton logon poiema
   semanosi kata ten idian hedonen; ho de ton Theon patera legon heuthus
   en auto kai ton huion semainei. The Son is a second in the Godhead, see
   Orat. III. 4: duo men eisin, hoti ho pater parer esti kai ouch ho autos
   huios esti; kai ho huios esti kai ouch ho autos pater esti; mia de he
   phusis. IV. I: hoste duo men einai patera kai huion, monada de
   theotetos adiaireton.. The idea that the Triad must be from all
   eternity and be independent of the world, if it is not to be increased
   or diminished, is developed in Orat. I. 17. There is a strong polemic
   against the Sabellians in Orat. IV.

   [82] In the theoretical expositions of his teaching Athanasius uses the
   expression gennema in preference to huios, in order to exclude the idea
   of human generation.

   [83] "Reflection", "Image", "God of God", are the expressions which
   always appeared to Athanasius to be the most appropriate. He preferred
   the first of these in order to exclude the thought that the Son
   proceeded from the will of the Creator. The light cannot do otherwise
   than lighten, and it always shines or lightens, otherwise it would not
   be light. The archetype projects its type necessarily. Following Origen
   he puts the whole emphasis on the eternal (Orat. I. 14: aidios estin ho
   huios kai sunuparchei to patri) and necessary. If the Son were begotten
   by the will of the Father, He would be something contingent, a
   creation, and would have a beginning: though certainly He was not, on
   the other hand, begotten contrary to this will, as the Arians charge
   their opponents with believing (Orat. III. 62, 66), nor from some
   necessity superior to God, nor does the blessed Godhead undergo any
   kind of suffering (Orat. I. 16), on the contrary He proceeded from the
   substance of God ou para gnomen. Only the expression ek tes ousias
   suffices, as Athanasius over and over again makes plain; any
   intervention of the will here degrades the Son; for "the substance is
   higher than the will." See the characteristic passage Orat. III. 62:
   hosper antikeitai te boulesei to para gnomen, houtos huperkeitai kai
   proegeitai tou bouleuesthai to kata phusin. oikian men oun tis
   bouleuomenos kataskeuazei, huion de genna kata phusin. kai to men
   boulesei kataskeuazomenon erxato ginesthai kai exothen esti tou
   poiountos; ho de huios idion esti tes ousias tou patros gennema kai ouk
   estin exothen autou; dio oude bouleuetai peri autou, hina me kai peri
   heautou doke bouleuesthai; hoso oun tou ktismatos ho huios huperkeitai,
   tosouto kai tes bouleseos to to kata phusin. The Father wills the Son
   in so far as He loves Him and wills and loves Himself (Orat. III. 66),
   but in so far as "willing" involves ten ep' ampho rhopen, i.e.,
   includes the ability not to will, the Son is not from the will of the
   Father.

   [84] Athanasius rarely repeats the unguarded utterances of Bishop
   Alexander and others belonging to the orthodox party. The Father is for
   him, on the contrary, in and for Himself--if one may so put
   it--personal; He is nous and He is tes idias hupostaseos theletes. In
   one passage in his later writings (de decret. 15) he has. however,
   curiously enough, argued that the Father would be alogos and asophos,
   if the Logos were not from all eternity.

   [85] In order to give meaning to the expressions "Logos", "Wisdom",
   Athanasius could not avoid describing the divine in Christ as the
   wisdom, prudence, strength, might, creative power in God, see Orat. I.
   17, III. 65. Still he rarely has recourse to these terms.

   [86] After the beginning of the Arian controversy, though not before it
   (see c. Gent. 2), Athanasius made a thorough distinction between "to
   beget" and "to create." "Begetting" held good of the Father only in
   reference to the Son. It means the production of a perfect image of
   Himself which, while originating in His substance, has by nature a
   share in the entire substance. That the Son shares in the entire
   substance of the Father is a thought which was constantly repeated by
   Athanasius, Orat. I. 16: to holos metechesthai ton Theon ison esti
   legein hoti kai genna. The begotten is thus idion tes ousias tou Theou
   gennema (Orat. II. 24), which phusei echei ten patriken ousian and in
   fact teleian. That God does not in consequence of this suffer or
   undergo anything, and that there is here no question of an emanation,
   are points which he urges as against the Valentinians.

   [87] The refutation of these propositions given by Athanasius takes a
   great number of forms; we may distinguish the religious-dogmatic, the
   dialectic-philosophic, the patristic and the biblical refutations (see
   Böhringer, Athanasius, pp. 210-240). For Athanasius himself the
   religious and biblical argument is the chief thing. Besides numerous
   passages from the Gospel of John, Athanasius quotes specially 1 John V.
   20; Rev. I. 4; Matt. III. 17, XVII. 5; Rom. I. 20, VIII. 32, IX. 5;
   Hebr. I. 3, XIII. 8; Ps. II. 7; XLV. 2, CII. 28, CXLV. 13; Is. XL. 28.
   Matt. XXVIII. 19 had for him supreme importance. Amongst the theses
   laid down by the Arians he had a special objection to that of the
   prokope of the Logos. Hence the strong emphasis he lays on the
   atreptos.

   [88] "From the Father," as Athanasius says in several passages, would
   be sufficient if it were not possible to say, using the words in an
   improper sense, that everything is from God because it has been created
   by God. It is because the Eusebians make capital out of this that we
   must avow: ek tes ousias tou patros; see de decret. 19; de synod. 33
   sq.: ad Afros 5. He entirely rejects the idea of a mere unity of
   feeling or doctrine between the Father and the Son (e.g., Orat. III.
   ii) for this would mean the disappearance of the Godhead of the Son.

   [89] The word "homoios" means something more than our word "resembling"
   and something less than our word "similar"; our "similarly constituted"
   comes nearest it. The "homoios" alone did not satisfy Athanasius,
   because it implicitly involves a difference and, above all, a
   distinction, and he says, moreover, that even dog and wolf, tin and
   silver are homoia. He, however, certainly applied the word in
   connection with substance (phusis ousia) or with "kata panta" (e.g., de
   decret. 20) to the relation between Father and Son (homoiosis tou huiou
   pros ton patera kata ten ousian kai kata ten phusin, de synod. 45). But
   still he found it necessary as a rule, at least at a later date,
   expressly to emphasise the henotes--where he expresses himself in a
   less strict way we also find homoiotes alone--and in opposition to the
   Homoiousians was driven to add "ek tes ousias" to "homoiousios" in
   order to banish any idea of separateness. (de synod. 41). Yet he
   recognised at the same time (l.c. c. 53 sq.) that homoios is really an
   unsuitable word; for it cannot be used of substances, but only of
   schemata kai poiotetes. In connection with substances we say tautotes.
   Men resemble each other in general outline and character, but in
   substance they are homophueis; vice versa, man and dog are not unlike,
   but yet they are heterophueis. Thus homophues and homoousion match each
   other, and in the same way heterophues and heteroousion. The phrase
   homoios kat' ousian always suggests a metousia; to gar homoion poiotes
   estin, hetis te ousia prosgenoit' an. Thus it is correct to say of
   created spiritual beings that they resemble God, not however in
   substance, but only in virtue of sonship. Homoiousios is in fact
   nothing, and when used of the real Son is consequently either nonsense
   or false.

   [90] This is the key to the whole mode of conception: Son and Father
   are not a duality, but a duality in unity, i.e., the Son possesses
   entirely the substance which the Father is; He is a unity with the
   unity which the Father is. Athanasius did not defend the idea of the
   co-ordination of the two as opposed to a subordination view, but the
   unity and inseparability as opposed to the theory of difference and
   separateness. He, however, expresses this as follows: in substance
   Father and Son are one; or, the Son has one and the same substance with
   the Father. Thus the expression "mia phusis" is often used for both;
   and so we have: ousia hen estin autos gennesas auton pater (de synod.
   48). The Son has the henotes pros ton patera (de decret. 23); He
   constitutes with Him a adiairetos henotes; there subsists between both
   henotes homoioseos kata ten ousian kai kata ten phusin. He expresses
   his meaning most plainly in those passages in which he attaches the
   tautotes to Father and Son without prejudice to the fact that the
   Father is the Father and not the Son. Identity of substance, as
   Athanasius (de synod. 53) explains, is tautotes. Thus he says (Orat. I.
   22): ho huios echei ek tou patros ten tautoteta. In a passage of
   earlier date he had already said (c. Gent. 2): dous to huio kai tes
   idias aidiotetos ennoian kai gnosin, hina ten tautoteta sozon k.t.l.
   Later on, (de decret. 23): ananke kai en touto ten tautoteta pros ton
   heautou patera sozein, 20: me monon homoion ton huion alla tauton te
   homoiosei ek tou patros einai . . . ou monon homoios alla kai
   adiairetos esti tes tou patros ousias, kai hen men eisin autos kai ho
   pater. 24: henotes kai phusike idiotes . . . ten henoteta tes phuseos
   kai ten tautoteta tou photos me diairomen. Orat. IV. 5 (and elsewhere):
   pater en to huio, huios en to parti . . . he tou huiou theotes tou
   patros esti . . . he theotes kai he idiotes tou patros to einai tou
   huiou esti Thus homoios is unsatisfactory not only because it does not
   express complete likeness, but, above all, because it does not express
   the unity upon which everything depends. The Son cannot, like human
   sons, go away from the Father, (de decret. 20) for He is in a more
   intimate relation to Him that a human son is to his father; He is
   connected with the Father not as an accident of which we might make
   abstraction (l. c. 12), but as to idion tes patrikes hupostaseos (Orat.
   III. 65) or as to idion tes ousias tou patros (frequently in de decret.
   Orat. I. 22), or as idion tes ousias tou Theou gennema. Athanasius uses
   the words "idios", "gnesios" frequently; they give the conception of
   Son a more extended meaning than it naturally has, so that the Son may
   not appear as exothen haplos homoios and consequently as heteroousios
   (de decret. 23). The substantial unity of Father and Son is the
   fundamental thought of Athanasius. Atzberger therefore correctly says
   (op. cit. p. 117) "There can be no doubt but that Athanasius conceived
   of the unity of the Father and the Son as a numerical unity of
   substance." In Orat. III. 3 ff. where he puts himself to great trouble
   to state the problem that two are equal to one, he says: Hei kai
   heteron estin hos gennema ho huios, alla tauton estin hos Theos; kai
   hen eisin autos kai ho pater te idioteti kai oikeioteti tes phuseos kai
   te tautoteti tes mias theotetos. We cannot therefore help being
   astonished (with Zahn p. 20) to find that Athanasius declines to use
   the word monoousios of the Son (see Expos. fidei 2: oute huiopatora
   phronoumen hos hoi Sabellioi, legontes monoousion kai ouch homoousion
   kai en touto anairountes to einai huion); still he always says: mian
   oidamen kai monen theoteta tou patros. If the question is raised as to
   whether Athanasius thought of the Godhead as a numerical unity or as a
   numerical duality, the answer is: as a numerical unity. The duality is
   only a relative one--if we may write such an absurdity--the duality of
   archetype and type. That the Arians called the Catholics "Sabellians"
   is expressly stated by Julian of Eclan. (August., op. imperf. V. 25).

   [91] Theotes, ousia, hupostasis, idiotes tes ousias, oikeiotes tes
   ousias (hupostaseos) are all used by Athanasius in reference to the
   Godhead as perfectly synonymous. He had no word by which to describe
   Father and Son as different subjects, and indeed he never felt it
   necessary to seek for any such word. We cannot call idiotes tes ousias
   anything special; for Athanasius by the very use of the word idiotes
   asserted the unity of the Father and Son. Hupostasis and ousia are
   repeatedly described by him as identical; see de decret. 27; de synod.
   41; ad Afros 4; he de hupostasis ousia esti, kai ouden allo
   semainomenon echei e auto to on, hoper Ieremias huparxin onomazei legon
   . . . he gar upostasis kai he ousia huparxis estin (so still in the
   year 370). Tom. ad Antioch. 6: hupostasin men legomen hegoumenoi tauton
   einai eipein hupostasin kai ousian. The divine substance is, however,
   nothing other than to on (pure Being); see ad Afr. l.c. and the decret.
   22; Godhead is the ousia akataleptos . . . to; Theos, ouden heteron e
   ten ousian autou tou ontos semainei. As opposed to this phusis is the
   nature which attaches to the substance as the complex of its
   attributes; Athanasius distinguishes it from ousia; hence the formula
   often used: kata ten ousian kai kata ten phusin (e.g., de synod. 45)
   see also Tom. ad Antioch 6, where Athanasius after the words above
   quoted, continues: mian de phronoumen dia to ek tes ousias tou patros
   einai ton huion kai dia ten tautoteta tes phuseos; mian gar theoteta
   kai mian einai ten tautes phusin pisteuomen. Orat. I. 39: The Son is
   phusei kat' ousian tauta. When, however, Athanasius asserts the
   numerical unity of the Ousia of Father, Son, (and Spirit) he is
   thinking of it both as being that which we call "substance" and also as
   what we call "subject", so that here again, too, what is obscure is not
   the unity, but the duality (triad) as in Irenæus. In de synod. 51 the
   conception of the Ousia as involving three substances, i.e., a common
   genus and two co-ordinate "brothers" ranged under it, is expressly
   rejected as Hellenon hermeneiai. It is only the one passage: Expos.
   fid. 2, (see above) where Athanasius rejects monoousios, that betrays
   any uncertainty on his part. It stands quite by itself. Otherwise by
   ousia he understands the individual or single substance which, however,
   as applied to God, is the fulness of all Being, a view which allows him
   to think of this substance as existing in wonderful conditions and
   taking on wonderful shapes.

   [92] The meaning of this word will be clear from what was said in the
   preceding discussion. It signified oneness of substance, not likeness
   of substance, "unius substantiæ." Father and Son possess in common one
   and the same substance, substance in the sense of the totality of all
   that which they are. This is how Athanasius always understood the word,
   as Zahn (op. cit., pp. 10-32) was the first to point out in opposition
   to the long current erroneous interpretations of it. It is in fact
   equal to tautousios, the meaning which the Semiarians also attached to
   it (Ephiph. H. 73. 11). Athanasius neither discovered the word, nor had
   he any special preference for it; but he always recognised in it the
   most fitting expression wherewith to repel Arians and Eusebians; see on
   the adoption of the word into the Nicene Creed and the history of its
   interpretation, the discussions which follow.

   [93] This is an important point in the Athanasian doctrine and balances
   in some degree the thoughts comprised in the word "homoousios." From
   some passages it certainly appears as if the statement that the Son has
   everything in common with the Father (according to Holy Scripture)
   except the name of Father (see Orat. III. 4 fin; III. 6; de synod. 48,
   49; frequently as in Orat. I. 61, the language is paradoxical to the
   verge of absurdity) expressed a merely nominal distinction between
   Father and Son. According to this, He is either identical with the
   Father, or a part of the Father's substance, or an attribute of God, or
   a kind of pendicle which has emanated from the Father; but all these
   modes of conception were considered at the, time to be "Sabellian":
   they were condemned already. In order to escape them or rather because
   he himself considered them to be false, Athanasius in the proper place
   strongly emphasised the idea that the Father is the entire monad, that
   He is the arche for the Son too, that it is in fact the ousia of the
   Father which the Son has received, that thus the conception of the
   Father as the sole Theos pantokrator maintains the unity of the
   Godhead. The Father is the mia arche (Orat. IV. 1); there are not two
   or three Fathers (III. 15); there is hen eidos theotetos, which is the
   Father, but to eidos touto esti kai en to huio (l.c.); the Father is ho
   Theos. He alone is autos ho Theos, He alone is the unbegotten God
   (Expos. fid. I); the Son is a gennema, even though He has not come into
   being. Accordingly the Father is sufficient for Himself (Orat. II. 41),
   and he ousia tou patros estin arche kai rhiza kai pege tou huiou. The
   "homoousios" does not thus include any absolute co-ordination.
   According to Athanasius all men are homoousioi relatively to each
   other, because they are homogeneis and homophueis (de synod. 52 sq.)
   and yet spite of this we find amongst them superiority and
   subordination. The same is the case here. Athanasius maintains the
   inseparable unity of substance of Father and Son, the unity of the
   Godhead; but this idea is for him applicable only in virtue of another,
   according to which the Father has everything of Himself while the Son
   has everything from the Father. Father and Son, according to
   Athanasius, are not co-ordinate equal substances, but rather one single
   substance, which involves the distinction of arche and gennema, and
   thus of principle and what is deduced, and in this sense involves a
   subordination, which, however, is not analogous to the subordination in
   which the creature stands to God.

   [94] See Orat. I. 41: Tes anthropotetos estin he hupsosis, i.e., not of
   the humanity of Christ, but of humanity as a whole: c. 42: When
   Scripture uses the word "echarisato;" in reference to what God does to
   Christ, this is not said of the Logos, but on our account: di' hemas
   kai huper hemon touto palin peri autou gegraptai. hosper gar hos
   anthropos ho Christos apethane kai hupsothe, houtos hos anthropos
   legtai lambanein hoper eichen aei hos Theos, hina eis hemas phthase kai
   he toiaute dotheisa charis. The human race is thereby enriched. c. 43:
   By our kinship with the body of Christ we too have become a temple of
   God and are henceforth made sons of God, so that already in us the Lord
   is adored. "Therefore hath God also exalted Him"--this signifies our
   exaltation.

   [95] So correctly Baur. I have not found Dorner's statement that the
   presupposition of a human soul occupies the background of the whole
   view of Athanasius "of the incarnation and redemption as affecting the
   totality of man" (op. cit. I. p. 957) to be supported by evidence. From
   what is alleged by Dorner it merely follows that Athanasius did not
   reflect on the subject. Baur, however, meanwhile goes too far when he
   expresses the opinion that Athanasius designedly left the human soul of
   Christ out of account; on the contrary, by the term "Flesh" he
   understood the whole substance of man, (see Orat. III. 30) and did not
   feel there was any necessity for studying the question as to the
   position occupied by the soul.

   [96] Orat. IV. 31.

   [97] Orat. IV. 32-34.

   [98] Orat. I. 45, III. 30-33.

   [99] Almost the whole second oration against the Arians is devoted to
   the task of refuting the use made by them of this passage.

   kai organon tes sophias pros ten energeian tes theotetos kai ten
   eklampsin autes genomenon.

   [102] Both thus occupy the stage of development which was described in
   Vol. III., pp, 113-118. We may say meanwhile, and what follows will
   prove it, that the fusion of a theoretical doctrine with religion was
   more thorough in the case of Arianism than with Athanasius.

   [103] See above p. 3, and in addition Athan. Orat. III. 51: The view of
   Lucian of Samosata is the idea of the pure creaturehood and humanity of
   the Redeemer ho te men dunamei kai umeis phroneite, to de onomati monon
   arneisthe dia tous anthropous. This is no mere trick of logic, although
   the alleged motive of the correction of the Adoptianist doctrine is
   assuredly incorrectly described.

   [104] We do not know whether or not Arius appealed to Origen. The later
   Arians undoubtedly quoted him in support of their views; they seem,
   however, to have appealed most readily to Dionysius of Alex. See Athan.
   de sentent. Dionysii.

   [105] See the tractate of Aëtius preserved in Epiphanius; but the older
   Arians had already acted in the same way.

   [106] There are some good remarks on Arianism in Kaufmann, Deutsche
   Geschichte I., pp. 232, 234; also in Richter, Weström. Reich, p. 537.

   [107] Schultz, Gottheit Christi, p. 65.

   [108] The figure of Ulfilas vouches for this; his confession of faith
   (Halm, § 126) is the only Arian one which is not polemical.

   [109] Anyone, on the other hand, who, like Arius, held to the idea of a
   developing and struggling Christ was not able to conceive of Him as
   Redeemer, but only as teacher and example. This was the situation: the
   Bible accounts of Christ did not favour and establish the sole idea
   which was held at the time regarding fellowship with God and
   redemption, but, on the contrary, they interfered with it.

   [110] Athanasius always appealed to the collective testimony of the
   Church in support of the doctrine which he defended. In the work, de
   decret, 25 sq., he shews that the words ek tes ousias and homoousios
   were not discovered by the Nicene Fathers, but, on the contrary, had
   been handed down to them. He appeals to Theognostus, to the two
   Dionysii and Origen, to the latter with the reservation that in his
   case it is necessary to distinguish between what he wrote gumnastikos
   and what he wrote of a positive character. It is one of the few
   passages in which he has thought of Origen.

   [111] They were not able, and did not dare, to discard it actually,
   because of John I. 1 f., on account of the Church tradition, and
   because of the scientific views of the time. As regards Athanasius, we
   have to keep in mind his idea of the Father as the rhiza of the Son,
   and his other idea, according to which the world was actually made by
   the Son.

   [112] Dionysius of Alexandria was a genuine pupil of Origen, for he was
   equally prepared to maintain the other side of the system of Origen,
   when his namesake pointed out to him that by his one-sided emphasising
   of the one side, he had lost himself in highly questionable statements.
   Eusebius of Cæsarea took up the same position.

   [113] The Nicene Creed sanctioned it. One of its most serious
   consequences was that from this time onward Dogmatics were for ever
   separated from clear thinking and defensible conceptions, and got
   accustomed to what was anti-rational. The anti-rational--not indeed at
   once, but soon enough--came to be considered as the characteristic of
   the sacred. As there was everywhere a desire for mysteries, the
   doctrine seemed to be the true mystery just because it was the opposite
   of the clear in the sphere of the profane. Even clear-headed men like
   the later members of the school of Antioch were no longer able to
   escape from absurdity. The complete contradiction involved in the
   Homoousios drew a whole host of contradictions after it, the further
   thought advanced.

   [114] For the sources and the literature referring to the Council of
   Nice see Herzog's R-Encykl., Vol. X. 2, p. 530 ff. The accounts are
   meagre and frequently self-contradictory. We do not yet possess an
   exhaustive study of the subject. In what follows the main points only
   can be dealt with. I must renounce the idea of giving here the detailed
   reasons in support of the views I hold. See Gwatkin, p. 36 ff.

   [115] No one was present from Britain; though there were probably
   bishops from Illyria, Dacia, Italy, Gaul, Spain, Africa and also a
   Persian bishop. Eusebius (Vita III. 8) compares the meeting with that
   described in Acts II.

   [116] Sozom. I. 18; we certainly cannot form any clear picture of what
   took place from the account given in this passage.

   [117] This follows from the letter of Eusebius of Cæsarea to his Church
   (Theodoret, H. E. I. 11), which we may regard as trustworthy in
   connection with this matter. Eusebius there distinguishes quite plainly
   two parties; (1) the party to which he himself belongs and (2) the
   party which he introduces with "hoi de" (hoi de prophasei tes tou
   homoousiou prosthekes tende ten graphen pepoiekasin, the Nicene Creed
   follows) and which he does not describe in more definite terms than by
   "autoi" (kai de tautes tes graph~s hup' auton hupagoreutheises).

   [118] With the exception of the bishops whom their contemporaries and
   our earliest informants have mentioned by name, there do not seem to
   have been any capable men at the Council.

   [119] It is worthy of note that Eusebius in the letter just cited does
   not introduce the Arians as a special party, but merely hints at their
   existence. The middle party stood, in fact, very near to them.

   [120] Athanasius (de decret. 19 sq. ad Afros 5, 6, de synod. 33-41)
   mixes up the two opposition-parties together.

   [121] See Theodoret I. 6: fin.; he relies upon the account of
   Eustathius. In addition Athanas., Encycl. ad epp. Ægypt 13, de decret.
   3.

   [122] See the characteristic passage Demon str. IV. 3: he men auge ou
   kata proairesin tou photos eklampei. kata ti de tes ousias sumbebekos
   achoriston. ho de huios kata gnomen kai proairesin eikon hupeste tou
   patros. bouletheis gar ho Theos gegonen huiou pater kai phos deuteron
   kata panta heauto aphomoiomenon hupestesato.

   [123] According to Eustathius (in Theodoret I. 7) the creed of the
   strict Arians was composed by Eusebius of Nicomedia; at least I think
   that it must be the latter who is referred to in what is said in that
   passage: hos de ezeteito tes pisteos ho tropos, enarges men elenchos to
   gramma tes Eusebiou prouballeto blasphemias. epi panton de anagnosthen
   autika sumphoran men astathmeton tes ektropes heneka tois autekoois
   prouxenei, aischunen d'anekeston to grapsanti pareichen. It is
   impossible that it can be the creed of Eusebius of Cæsarea which is
   referred to here, for the latter (1.c. I. 11) expressly notes that his
   creed after having been communicated to the Council was substantially
   accepted. Whether we have a right to call the creed which he produced
   simply "Baptismal Creed of the Church of Cæsarea," is to me
   questionable, judging from the introduction to it given in the letter
   to his Church.

   [124] The creed is contained in the letter of Eusebius to his Church.
   See Theodoret I. 1: Pisteuomen eis hena Theon patera pantokratora, ton
   ton hapanton horaton te kai aoraton poieten, kai eis hena kurion Iesoun
   Christon, ton tou Theou logon, Theon ek Theou, phos ek photos, zoen ek

   hagion.

   [125] Touton hekaston einai kai huparchein pisteuontes, patera
   alethinos patera, kai huion alethinos huion, pneuma te hagion alethinos
   pneuma hagion, katha kai ho kurios hemon apostellon eis to kerugma tous

   [126] Tautes huph' hemon ektetheises tes pisteos oudeis paren

   hupographein te tois dogmasi kai sumphonein toutois autois parekeleueto
   (I. 11).

   [127] According to Eusebius, however, the Emperor himself added an
   interpretation of the Homoousios. We read in the letter of Eusebius,
   immediately after the words cited in the foregoing note: henos monou
   prosengraphentos rhematos tou Homoousiou, ho kai autos hermeneuse legon
   hoti me kata somaton pathe legoito Homoousios, oute kata diairesin,
   oute kata tina apotomen ek tou patros hupostenai . . . theiois de kai
   aporretois logois prosekei ta toiauta noein. The word is thus only
   intended to express the mystery!

   [128] Eusebius in an ill-concealed tone of reproach says hoi de (i.e.,
   the Alexandrians) prophasei tes tou Homoousiou prosthekes tende ten
   graphen, (i.e., the Nicene Creed) pepoiekasi, that is, they have
   corrected my proposed creed not only here but in other passages also.

   [129] See Hort., l.c., p. 59 and my article in Herzog, R.-Encyklop.,
   Vol. VIII., p. 214 ff.

   [130] See Gwatkin, p. 41.

   [131] The "Logos" is wholly absent from the Nicene Creed; after what
   has been adduced above this will cause as little astonishment as the
   fact that neither Athanasians nor Arians took any offence at its
   exclusion.

   [132] See on this what is told us by Athanasius, l.c. The clumsy
   position of the words which mutilate the conception monogene Theon,
   further proves that they are an insertion made at the very last.

   [133] See Athanasius, l.c.

   [134] The doctrinal formula in accordance with this was worded as
   follows. (The differences above discussed between it and the Creed of
   Cæsarea are to he explained as the result of the influence exercised by
   the Jerusalem and Antiochian Creed). The textual proofs are enumerated
   in Walch, Bib]. symb., p. 75 sq., Hahn, § 73, 74, and Hort.
   l.c.;--slight variations occur--: Pisteuomen eis hena Theon patera
   pantokratora, panton horaton te kai aoraton poieten, kai eis hena
   kurion Iesoun Christon, ton huion tou Theou, gennethenta ek tou patros

   [135] Eusebius in Theoderet, H. E. I. 11: eroteseis toigaroun kai
   apokriseis enteuthen anekinounto, ebasanizeto ho logos tes dianoias ton
   eiremenon.

   [136] See Athan. de decret. 19, 20; ad Afros 5, 6.

   [137] Still Gwatkin, p. 43, goes too far when he asserts that "the use
   of agrapha in a creed was a positive revolution in the Church." It is
   quite impossible to maintain this in view, for example, of the Creed of
   Gregorius Thaumaturgus.

   [138] See on moousios, which the Gnostics were the first to use, and on
   its meaning and history Vol. III. 141 f., 221; above pp. 15 f., 32-35;
   I. 257; II. 259, 352, 354; iii. 45. On the older ecclesiastical use of
   ousia, hupostasis, hupokeimenon, above all in Origen, see the scholarly
   discussions by Bigg (the Christian Platonists, p. 164 ff.). "Ousia is
   properly Platonic, while hypostasis, a comparatively modern and rare
   word, is properly Stoic" . . . Hypokeimenon already in Aristotle means
   the substantia materialis, hule quæ determinatur per formam or ousia
   cui inhærent pathe sumbebekota . . . the theological distinction
   between the terms ousia and hupostasis is purely arbitrary." On the
   conception of hypostasis see Stentrup, Innsbrucker Zeitschr. f. Kath.
   Theologie. 1877, p. 59 ff. The question as to who brought forward the
   homoousios again after it had been condemned at Antioch, is an
   important one. It does not occur in the letters of Bishop Alexander.
   Athanasius had never any special preference for the word. It is found
   only once in the Orat. c. Arian (Orat. I. 9), and in the undoubtedly
   conciliatory work, de synod., 41, he admits that importance does not
   attach so much to the word as to the thing. The conceptions "henotes"
   and "ek tes ousias" would have served the purpose so far as he himself
   was concerned. Such being the state of the case one may reasonably
   assume that the word was not revived by any one belonging to the
   Eastern Church, since its rejection at Antioch must have stood in the
   way of this, but rather that some one in the West went back upon it,
   and Hosius is the only one we can think of as the likely person. This
   hypothesis is strengthened by the following considerations: (1)
   According to the testimony of Eusebius of Cæsarea there can be no doubt
   that the Emperor himself energetically defended the word homoousios,
   but the Emperor was dependent on Hosius; (2) Athanasius (hist. Arian.
   42) says of Hosius: houtos en Nikaia pistin exetheto; (3) the
   Western-Roman doctrine was the substantial unity of Father and Son; the
   Alexandrian bishop was accused before the Roman bishop Dionysius on the
   ground that he was unwilling to use "homoousios'" and in Rome the
   accused excuses himself for not using it, and it is the Roman bishop
   who in his letter stated in energetic language the kerugma tes
   monarchias, the henosthai to Theo ton logon, and the ou katamerizein
   ten monada. I therefore conjecture that the word had been retained in
   Rome, i.e., in the West, since the time of the controversy of the
   Dionysii, that when the occasion offered it was once more produced in
   the East, and that the Alexandrians then accepted the word because they
   themselves had no better short catchword at their command. This
   explains why Athanasius always treats the expression as one which was
   suitable so far as the actual fact to be expressed was concerned, but
   which as regards its form was for him a foreign term. He could not, it
   is true, go quite so far as Luther (Opp. reform. V., p. 506): "Quod si
   odit anima mea vocem homousion et nolim ea uti, non ero hæreticus. Quis
   enim me coget uti, modo rem teneam, quæ in concilio per scripturas
   definita est? Etsi Ariani male senserunt in fide, hoc tamon optime,
   sive malo sive bono animo, exegerunt, ne vocem profanam et novam in
   regulis fidei statui liceret." Finally, the statement of Socrates (III.
   7) which indeed has been rejected by most, is decisive. According to
   this Hosius during his stay in Alexandria--before the Nicene
   Council--had discussed ousia and hupostasis. At the first glance that
   undoubtedly seems unworthy of belief, because it is a husteron-proteron
   but as soon as we remember the work of Tertullian, adv. Prax., which is
   the most important dogmatic treatise which the West produced previous
   to Augustine and which cannot have been unknown to Hosius, everything
   becomes clear. In this work in which Tertullian bears witness to the
   strong influence exercised upon him by Monarchianism spite of the fact
   that he is opposing it, no thought is so plainly expressed as this,
   that Father, Son, and Spirit are unius substantiæ, i.e., homoousioi
   (Vol. II., p. 259 ff.). Along with this, however, we have the idea
   clearly developed, that Father, Son, and Spirit are different a
   personæ" (see e.g., c. 3: "proximæ personæ, consortes substantiæ
   patris", 15; "visibilem et invisibilem deum deprehendo sub manifesta et
   personali distinctione condicionis utriusque"; see also the conception
   of "personales substantiæ" in adv. Valent. 4). These personæ are also
   called by Tertullian "formæ cohærentes", "species indivisæ", "gradus"
   (c. 2, 8), and in fact even simply "nomina" (c. 30), and this gives his
   representation as much a Monarchian appearance as the appearance of an
   immanent Trinity (for a more detailed examination, see the appendix to
   this chapter). It is from this source, and also from Novatian who in
   his work, de trinitate, adopted the thoughts of Tertullian, that the
   theology of Hosius is derived. He may very probably, along with
   Tertullian, have already spoken of "personæ", side by side with the
   "unius substantiæ" which the entire West possessed belief in, in
   accordance with the baptismal formula, for this is what it was
   understood to be. (See Hilar., de trinit. II. I. 3: Ambros. de myster.
   5 fin). That his formula was: "unius substantiæ tres personæ" where
   persona is certainly to be conceived of rather as species or forma--not
   as "substance"--is very probable. The Western Hippolytus, moreover, (c.
   Noët. 14) also spoke of one God and several prosopeia, and so too did
   the Western Sabellius, and Tert. (l.c. c. 26) says bluntly: "ad singula
   nomina in personas singulas tinguimur." Only this point must remain
   undecided--namely, whether Hosius already actually translated "persona"
   by "hupostasis." It is not probable, since in the so-called Creed of
   Sardica he used hupostasis as = ousia (substantia). That his main
   catchword was mia ousia follows from what he says in his letter to
   Narcissus of Neronias (Euseb. c. Marcell., p. 25).

   [139] This is what the Nicene Creed was primarily intended to be, and
   not a baptismal creed, as the anathemas prove.

   [140] Theouas of Marmarika and Secundus of Ptolemais refused and were
   deposed and banished, and the same thing happened in the case of Arius
   and some presbyters. Arius was specially forbidden by the Council to
   enter Alexandria, Sozom I. 20. The evasions to which the Lucianists and
   Origenists had recourse in order to justify their conduct to
   themselves, can be studied in the letter of Eusebius to his Church.
   Eusebius interprets "ek tes ousias tou patros" as equal to "He has His
   existence from the Father" (!), "gennethenta ou poiezenta" as
   equivalent to "the Son is not a creature like the rest of the
   creatures", homoousios as homoiousios, meaning mono to patri to
   gegennekoti kata panta tropon omoios and not out of a foreign
   substance. The worst shift of all is undoubtedly when Eusebius writes
   to his Church that he has (now) rejected the formula en pote hote ouk
   en, because we ought not to use any unbiblical expressions whatsoever
   (but Homoousios!) and because the Son did indeed exist already before
   His incarnation. But that was not the point at all! Peponthe ti deinon,
   says Athanasius (de decret. 3), with justice, of this passage in the
   letter.

   [141] They afterwards asserted no doubt that they had not subscribed
   the anathemas, but only the positive doctrine of the Nicene Creed
   (Socr. I. 14). However, Eusebius of Nicomedia and Theognis of Nicæa a
   were, notwithstanding this, banished soon after; they were suspected by
   the Emperor of being Arians and intriguers; see the strongly hostile
   letter of Constantine in Theodoret I. 19.

   [142] Socr. I. 9; those with Arian books in their possession were even
   to be punished with death.

   [143] L.c. Other writings of Constantine in the same place. The
   synodal-epistle in Theodoret I. 9, Gwatkin, p. 50, has proved that in
   the respect shewn by Athanasius for the Nicene Council there is no
   trace "of the mechanical theory of conciliar infallibility." It is
   necessary to guard against exaggerated ideas of the extent to which the
   decree of the Nicene Council was accepted. It can be proved that in the
   East (see e.g., Aphraates' Homilies) and still more in the West, there
   were numerous bishops who did not trouble themselves about the decree
   and for whom it had no existence. It was not till after the year 350
   that men began to think over the Nicene Creed in the West, and to
   perceive that it contained more than a mere confirmation of the ancient
   Western belief in the doctrine of monarchy.

   [144] The victory of the Bishop of Alexandria may be studied above all
   in the Canons of Nicæa. They have not so far been treated of from this
   point of view.
     __________________________________________________________________

   2. TO THE DEATH OF CONSTANTIUS. [145]

   Never again in the history of the Church has there been a victory so
   complete and so quickly secured as that at Nicæa, and no other decision
   of the Church approaches it in importance. The victors had the feeling
   that they had set up for all ages [146] a "warning notice against all
   heresies" (stelographia kata pason haireseon), and this estimate of the
   victory has continued to be the prevailing one in the Church. [147] The
   grand innovation, the elevation of two unbiblical expressions to the
   rank of catchwords of the Catholic Faith, insured the unique nature of
   this Faith. At bottom not only was Arianism rejected, but also
   Origenism; for the exclusive Homoousios separated the Logos from all
   spiritual creatures and seemed thus to do away with scientific
   cosmology in every form.

   But it was just because of this that the strife now began. The Nicene
   Creed effected in the East a hitherto unprecedented concord, but this
   was amongst its opponents, while its friends, on the other hand, felt
   no genuine enthusiasm for its subtle formulae. The schismatic Meletians
   of Egypt made common cause with the Arians and Origenists; those of the
   bishops who were indifferent or stupid were induced to oppose it by the
   bugbear of Sabellianism and by the unbiblical shape in which the new
   faith was formulated. Society was still for the most part heathen, and
   this heathen society openly sided with the anti-Nicenes; the Jews too,
   who were still influential, ranged themselves on this side. The clever
   sophist Asterius was able, as "travelling professor", to interest large
   numbers in "the one Unbegotten". But, above all, the two Eusebiuses
   sought again to be masters of the situation. The one necessarily strove
   in the first instance to regain his seat, the other to make the weight
   of his untouched personal authority once more felt in theology also.
   What their mutual relationship was is not clear; in any case they
   marched separately and struck unitedly. [148] The Nicomedian always
   thought first of himself and then of his cause; the Bishop of Cæsarea
   saw science and theology disappear in the movement which received its
   impulse from Alexandria. Both, however, had made up their minds not to
   part company with the Emperor if they could not otherwise succeed in
   managing him. The great mass of the bishops always were, in accordance
   with this policy, purely "imperial". With regard to the strict Arians,
   however, it must be admitted to their credit that during the whole
   controversy they were as little willing to accept as authoritative the
   decisions of the Emperors in matters of faith as were Athanasius,
   Hilary, and Lucifer.

   When Constantine interfered in the great controversy, he had only just
   come to the East. He was under the guidance of Western bishops, and it
   was Western Christianity alone with which he had hitherto been
   acquainted. And so after an abortive attempt to compose the
   controversy, he had accomplished the "work of peace" at Nicæa in
   accordance with Western views. But already during the years which
   immediately followed he must have learned that the basis upon which he
   had reared it was too narrow, that, above all, it did not meet the
   requirements of the "common sense" of the East. As a politician he was
   prudent enough not to take any step backward, but, on the other hand,
   as a politician he knew that every law gets its meaning quite as much
   from the method in which it is carried out as from the letter of it.
   Feeling this--to which has to be added the presence of Arian influences
   at the Court--he had since about the year 328 resolved, under cover of
   the Nicene Creed, to reinstate the broader doctrinal system of older
   days whose power he had first got to know in Asia, in order to preserve
   the unity of the Church which was endangered. [149] But Constantine did
   not get the length of doing anything definite and conclusive. He merely
   favoured the anti-Nicene coalition to such an extent that he left to
   his sons a ruptured Church in place of a united one. The anti-Nicene
   coalition, however, had already become during the last years of
   Constantine's life an anti-Athanasian one. On the eighth of June, 328,
   Athanasius, not without opposition on the part of the Egyptian bishops,
   [150] had mounted the Episcopal throne in Alexandria. The tactics of
   the coalition were directed first of all towards the removal of the
   main defenders of the Nicene faith, and it was soon recognised that the
   youthful bishop of Alexandria was the most dangerous of these.
   Intrigues and slanders of the lowest kind now began to come into play,
   and the conflict was carried on sometimes by means of moral charges of
   the worst kind, and sometimes by means of political calumnies. The
   easily excited masses were made fanatical by the coarse abuse and
   execrations of the opponents, and the language of hate which hitherto
   had been bestowed on heathen, Jews, and heretics, filled the churches.
   The catchwords of the doctrinal formula, which were unintelligible to
   the laity and indeed even to most of the bishops themselves, were set
   up as standards, and the more successful they were in keeping up the
   agitation the more surely did the pious-minded turn away from them and
   sought satisfaction in asceticism and polytheism in a Christian garb.
   In every diocese, however, personal interests, struggles about sees and
   influence, were mixed up with the controversy, and this was the case in
   the West too, especially in Rome, as we may gather from the events of
   the year 366. Thus a series of bloody town-revolutions accompanied the
   movement.

   In the midst of all this Athanasius alone in the East stood like a rock
   in the sea. If we measure him by the standard of his time we can
   discover nothing ignoble or mean about him. The favourite charge of
   hierarchical imperiousness has something naïve about it. His stern
   procedure in reference to the Meletians was a necessity, and an
   energetic bishop who had to represent a great cause could not be
   anything else but imperious. It is certainly undeniable that for years
   he was formally in the wrong, inasmuch as he would not admit the
   validity of his deposition. He regarded it as the task committed to
   him, to rule Egypt, to regulate the Church of the East in accordance
   with the standard of the true faith, and to ward off any interference
   on the part of the State. He was a Pope, as great and as powerful a one
   as there ever has been.

   When the sons of Constantine entered upon the inheritance of their
   father, the heads of the Nicene party in the East had been deposed or
   exiled; Arius, however, was dead. [151] The exiled bishops in
   accordance with a resolution [152] come to in common by the Emperors,
   were free to return as a body. This was the case in the latter part of
   the autumn of 337. But as soon as Constantius became master in his own
   domain he continued the policy of his father. He wished to rule the
   Church as the latter had done; he perceived that this was possible in
   the East only if the Nicene innovation, or at least the exclusive
   application of it, were got rid of, and he did not feel himself bound
   to the Nicene Creed as his father had done. One cannot but admit that
   the youthful monarch shewed statesmanlike insight and acted with
   energy, and with all his devotion to the Church he never allowed
   churchmen to rule as his brother did. He had not, however, the patience
   and moderation of his father, and though he had indeed inherited from
   the latter the gift of ruling, he had not got from him the art of
   managing men by gentle force. The brutal trait which Constantine knew
   how to keep in check in himself, appeared in an undisguised fashion in
   his son, and the development of the Emperor into an Oriental despot
   advanced a stage further in Constantius. [153] First of all, Paul of
   Constantinople was deposed for the second time; Eusebius of Nicomedia
   at last secured the seat he had so long striven after. Eusebius of
   Cæsarea died, and his place was taken by a man deserving of little
   respect, Acacius, a friend of the Arians. The tumults which took place
   in Egypt after the return of Athanasius made it easier for his enemies,
   who regarded him as deposed and once more pronounced the sentence of
   deposition at a Synod in Antioch, to move the Emperor to proceed
   against him. His energetic conduct in his diocese and the violence of
   his Egyptian friends (Apol. c. Arian. 3-19) aggravated the situation.
   Constantius listened to the Eusebians, but did not sanction the choice
   of Bishop Pistus whom they had set apart for Alexandria. He decreed the
   deposition of Athanasius, and sent as bishop to Alexandria, a certain
   Gregory, a Cappadocian who had nothing to commend him save the imperial
   favour. Athanasius anticipated a violent expulsion by leaving
   Alexandria--in the spring of 339. He betook himself to Rome, leaving
   his diocese behind him in a state of wild uproar.

   The Eusebians were now masters of the situation, but just because of
   this they had a difficult task to perform. What had now to be done was
   to get the Nicene Creed actually out of the way, or to render it
   ineffective by means of a new formula. This could only be done in
   conjunction with the West, and it would have to be done in such a way
   that they should neither seem to be giving the lie to their own vote in
   Nicæa--and therefore they would have to make it appear that they were
   attacking only the form and not the contents of the confession--nor
   seem to the Church in the West to be proclaiming a new faith. It is in
   the light of these facts that we are to regard the symbols of Antioch
   and the negotiations with Julius of Rome. They found themselves shut up
   in a position from which they could not escape without a certain amount
   of evasion. The faith of Athanasius must not be attacked any more than
   that of the Westerns. [154] The condemnation of the great bishop had
   thus always throughout to be based on personal accusations. As regards
   the doctrinal question, the whole stress had to be laid on getting the
   Homousios put quietly aside, on the ground that it was unbiblical and
   gave an inlet to Sabellianism. In this respect the doctrine of
   Marcellus of Ancyra was very welcome to the Eusebians, for they sought,
   not without justice, to shew from it to what destructive results a
   theology which based itself on the Homousios must lead. [155] But the
   Roman bishop was not to be corrupted, he did not even sacrifice
   Marcellus; and the creeds of Antioch which were not actually heterodox,
   but which were not sincere, did not at all meet with his approval. He
   did not concern himself with the attempt, justifiable from the point of
   view of the Orientals and of Constantius, to create for the East a
   doctrinal form of expression which was more in accordance with the
   convictions of the majority. The most important result of the
   operations of the Eusebians at Antioch, and the one which was of the
   greatest consequence, was that they had to bring themselves to renounce
   Arianism in order to gain over the West. Arianism was now condemned on
   all sides in the Church; nevertheless the Eusebians did not attain
   their aim. [156]

   During the following years Constantius' hands were tied by the Persian
   war, and he was forced to keep on good terms with his brother so as to
   avoid having trouble on the western boundary of his kingdom also. At
   the same time, just after the death of Eusebius of Nicomedia, which
   took place in the autumn of 342, the party amongst the conservatives of
   the East who, partly no doubt for political reasons, were actually set
   on coming to an agreement with the West, gained the lead. A general
   Council which was summoned by Constans to meet at Sardica in the summer
   of 343 and was approved of by Constantius, was to restore the unity of
   the Church. But the Western bishops, about a hundred in number,
   rejected the preliminary demand of the Eastern bishops for the
   deposition of Athanasius and Marcellus, both of whom were present in
   Sardica; pronounced sentence of deposition upon the leaders of the
   Orientals after the exodus of the latter; after an investigation
   declared the bishops attacked to be innocent, that is to say, orthodox;
   avowed their belief in the Nicene Creed, and under the guidance of
   Hosius took up the most rigid attitude possible on the doctrinal
   question. [157] In opposition to this the bishops, who met together in
   the neighbouring Philippopolis, framed a circular letter, dated from
   Sardica, in which they set forth the illegality of the procedure of
   their opponents, and confessed the faith in terms essentially identical
   with those of the fourth formula of Antioch. [158]

   The endeavours of Constantius to give efficacy [159] to the resolutions
   of his bishops fell through; in fact, the shameless attempt to set a
   trap for the two Western bishops sent as a deputation from Sardica to
   Constantius and provided with a letter of introduction from Constans,
   and who were to try and effect the recall of the banished bishops,
   turned out to their advantage. [160] Constantius, so at least it seems,
   had not for a while any real confidence in his own party; or was it
   that he was afraid to rouse his brother? In a long-winded formula drawn
   up at Antioch in the summer of 344 they once more sought to hint to the
   West their orthodoxy and to suggest the minimum of their demands. [161]
   The Church in the West, it is true, rejected at both the Councils held
   at Milan in the years 345 and 347, the teaching of Photinus of Sirmium,
   who, in a surprising fashion, had developed an Adoptian doctrinal
   system out of the doctrine of Marcellus, [162] but otherwise remained
   firm; and the ship of the Eusebians already appeared to be in so great
   danger that its two chief pilots, Ursacius and Valens, preferred to go
   over to the opposite party and to make their peace with Athanasius.
   [163] Constantius, very sorely pressed by the Persians, sought to have
   peace in the Church at any price and even granted the prayer of his
   brother's protégé, Athanasius, and allowed him to return to Alexandria
   (in October 346), where Gregory meanwhile had died (in June 345 [164]
   ). The bishop got an enthusiastic welcome in his city. The protest of
   the Eastern Council at Sirmium--the first Council of Sirmium--had no
   effect. A large number of the Eastern bishops were themselves tired of
   the controversy, and it almost looked as if the refusal of the West to
   condemn Marcellus together with the word homoousios, now virtually
   constituted the only stone of offence. [165]

   But the death of Constans in 350 and the overthrow of the usurper
   Magnentius in 353 changed everything. If in these last years
   Constantius had been compelled by the necessities of the situation to
   submit to the bishops, his own subjects, who had ruled his deceased
   brother, now that he was sole sovereign he was more than ever resolved
   to govern the Church and to pay back the humiliations which he had
   undergone. [166] Already in the year 351 the Easterns had at
   Sirmium--the second Council--again agreed upon taking common action,
   and Ursacius and Valens promptly rejoined them. [167] The great thing
   now was to humiliate the stubborn West. Constantius set about the task
   with wisdom, but what he wanted done he carried out by the sheer force
   of terror. He demanded only the condemnation of Athanasius, his mortal
   enemy, as a rebel, and purposely put the doctrinal question in the
   background. He forced the Western bishops, at Arles in 353 and at Milan
   in 355, to agree to this, by terrorising the Councils. The moral
   overthrow of the Westerns was scarcely less complete than that of the
   Easterns at Nicæa. Though the great majority were unaware of the
   struggle and were not forced to adopt a new confessional formula, still
   the fact could not be concealed from those who better understood the
   state of things, that the projected condemnation of Athanasius meant
   something more than a personal question. The few bishops who refused
   were deposed and exiled. [168] The order for his deposition was
   communicated to Athanasius in February 356. Yielding only to force, he
   made his escape into the desert where the Emperor could not reach him.
   Egypt was in a state of rebellion, but the revolt was put down by the
   Emperor with blood. [169] The unity of the Church was restored; above
   all, it was once more brought under the imperial sway. And now,
   forsooth, the orthodox bishops who had formerly secured so much by the
   help of Constans began to recollect that the Emperor and the State
   ought not to meddle with religion. Constantius became "Antichrist" for
   those who would have lauded him as they had his father and his brother,
   if he had given them the help of his arm. [170]

   But the political victory of the Eastern bishops directly led to their
   disunion; for it was only under the tyranny of the West and in the
   fight against Athanasius and the word "homoousios" that they had become
   united. Above all, Arianism in its rigid, aggressive form again made
   its appearance. Aëtius and Eunomius, two theologians of spirit who had
   been trained in the Aristotelian dialectic, and were opponents of
   Platonic speculation, expressed its tenets in the plainest possible
   way, would have nothing to do with any mediation, and had no scruple in
   openly proclaiming the conversion of religion into morality and
   syllogistic reasoning. The formula which they and their followers,
   Aëtians, Eunomians, Exukontians, Heterousiasts, Anomoeans, defended,
   ran thus: "heterotes kat' ousian", "anomoios kai kata panta kai kat'
   ousian" ("different in substance", "unlike in everything and also in
   substance"). If they allowed that the Son perfectly knows the Father,
   this was not in any way a concession, but an expression of the thought
   that there is no kind of mystery about the Godhead, which on the
   contrary can be perfectly known by every rightly instructed man. And so
   too the statement that the Logos had his superior dignity from the date
   of his creation, and did not first get it by being tested, was not
   intended at all as a weakening of the Arian dogma, but as an expression
   of the fact that God the Creator has assigned its limit to every being.
   [171] The great majority of the Eastern bishops, for whom the
   Origenistic formula in very varied combinations were authoritative,
   were opposed to this party. The old watchword, however, "the
   unchangeable image", which was capable of different interpretations,
   now received in opposition to Arianism, in its strict form, and on the
   basis of the formula of Antioch, more and more a precise signification
   as implying that the Son is of like nature with the Father in respect
   of substance also, and not only in respect of will (homoios kata panta
   kai kata ten ousian), and that his begetting is not an act at all
   identical with creation. The likeness of the qualities of Son and
   Father was more and more recognised here; on the other hand, the
   substantial unity was disallowed, so as to avoid getting on the track
   of Marcellus; i.e., these theologians did not, like Athanasius, advance
   from the unity to the mystery of the duality, but, on the contrary,
   still started from the duality and sought to reach the unity by making
   Father and Son perfectly co-ordinate. They therefore still had a Theos
   deuteros, and in accordance with this excluded the idea of full
   community of substance. The leaders of these Homoiousians, also called
   semi-Arians, were George of Laodicea, [172] Eustathius of Sebaste,
   Eusebius of Emesa, Basilius of Ancyra, and others.

   The point of supreme importance with the Emperor necessarily was to
   maintain intact the unity between those who up till now had been
   united, but this was all the more difficult as the Homoiousians more
   and more developed their doctrinal system in such a way that their
   ideas came to have weight even with those Westerns who lingered in
   exile in the East and whose theology was on Nicene lines. [173] Some
   bishops who were devoted to Constantius and who represented simply and
   solely the interests of the Emperor and of the Empire, now sought by
   means of a formula of the most indefinite possible character to unite
   Arians and semi-Arians. These were Ursacius, Valens, Acacius of
   Cæsarea, and Eudoxius of Antioch. If up till 356 the Nicene Creed had,
   strictly speaking, been merely evaded, now at last a Confession was to
   be openly brought forward in direct opposition to the Nicene Creed.
   Simple likeness of nature was to be the dogmatic catchword, all more
   definite characterisations being omitted, and in support of this,
   appeal was made to the insoluble mystery presented by the Holy
   Scriptures (homoios kata tas graphas--like according to the
   Scriptures). This ingenious formula, along with which, it is true, was
   a statement expressly emphasising the subordination, left it free to
   every one to have what ideas he chose regarding the extent of the
   qualities of Father and Son, which were thus declared to be of like
   kind. The relative homoios did not necessarily exclude the relative
   anomoios, but neither did it exclude the homoiousios. Already at the
   third Council of Sirmium (357), after Constantius, on a visit to Rome,
   had overthrown his enemies, a formula was set forth by the Western
   bishops of as conciliatory a character so far as Arianism was concerned
   as could possibly be conceived. It was proclaimed in presence of the
   Emperor, who under the influence of his consort came more and more to
   have Arian sympathies. This is the second Sirmian formula. [174] But
   the bishops assembled at Ancyra did not acquiesce in the move towards
   the Left (358). [175] What a change! Easterns now defended purity of
   doctrine against Arianising Westerns! A deputation from this Council
   succeeded in paralysing the influence of the Arians with Constantius,
   and in asserting at the Fourth Council of Sirmium, in 358, their
   fundamental principles to which the Emperor lent the weight of his
   authority. [176] But the triumph of the Homoiousians led by Basilius
   Ancyranus was of short duration. The Emperor saw that the Church could
   not be delivered up either to Nicæans, to semi-Arians, or to Arians.
   The alliance between the two first mentioned, which was so zealously
   pushed on by Hilary, was not yet perfect. A grand Council was to
   declare the imperial will, and Homoiousians and Arians vied with each
   other in their efforts to get influencing it. The Homoeans alone,
   however, both in their character as leaders and as led, concurred with
   the Emperor's views. They were represented by Ursacius, Valens, Marcus
   of Arethusa, Auxentius of Milan, and Germinius of Sirmium. The fourth
   Sirmian formula (359), an imperial cabinet-edict and a political
   masterpiece, was intended to embody what was to be laid before the
   Council. [177] The latter was summoned to meet at Rimini and Seleucia
   because the circumstances in the East and West respectively differed so
   very much. In May 359 more than four hundred Western bishops assembled
   at Rimini. They were instructed to treat only of matters relating to
   the Faith and not to leave the Council till the unity aimed at had been
   attained. But the Emperor's confidants failed to induce the great
   majority of the members to accept the Sirmian formula. The bishops, on
   the contrary, took their stand on the basis of the Nicene Creed which
   had been abandoned during these last years, rejected Arianism and
   declared its friends deposed. But when they sought by means of a
   Deputation to get the Emperor to give his sanction to their decisions,
   they did not get a hearing. The Deputation was not admitted to the
   Emperor's presence, was at first detained and then conducted to Nice in
   Thrace, where the members at last shewed themselves docile enough to
   sign a formula--the formula of Nice--which was undoubtedly essentially
   identical with the Confession which the Westerns had themselves drawn
   up two years earlier at Sirmium, at the third Synod in 357--("the Son
   is like the Father [kata panta is omitted] according to the
   Scriptures"). Armed with this document Ursacius and Valens made their
   way to Rimini, taking the deputies with them, and by means of threats
   and persuasions finally induced the Assembly there to accept the
   formula into which one could indeed read the Homoiousia, but not the
   Homousia. In the autumn of 359 the Eastern Synod met at Seleucia. The
   Homoiousians, with whom some Niceans already made common cause, had the
   main say. Still the minority led by Acacius and Eudoxius, which
   defended the Sirmian formula and clung to the likeness while limiting
   it, however, to the will, was not an insignificant one. There was an
   open rupture in the Synod. The majority finally deposed the heads of
   the opposition-party. [178] But as regards the East as well, the
   decision lay with the court. [179] The Emperor, importuned on all
   sides, had resolved to abandon the strict Arians, and accordingly
   Aëtius was banished and his Homoean friends had to leave him, but he
   was also determined to dictate the formula of Nice to the Easterns too.
   [180] Their representatives finally condescended to recognise the
   formula, and this event was announced at the Council of Constantinople
   in 360, and the Homoean Confession was once more formulated. [181]
   Although the new Imperial Confession involved the exclusion of the
   extreme Left, this did not constitute its peculiar significance. Had it
   actually been what it appeared to be, a formula of union for all who
   rejected the unlikeness, it would not have been something to be
   condemned, from the standpoint of the State at all events. But in the
   following year it was recklessly used as a weapon against the
   Homoiousians. [182] They had to vacate all positions of influence, and
   by way of making up for what had been done to the one Aëtius, who had
   been sacrificed, his numerous friends were installed as bishops. [183]
   Under cover of the "likeness in nature" a mild form of Arianism was
   actually established in the Church, modified chiefly only by the
   absence of principle. In Gaul alone did the orthodox bishops once more
   bestir themselves after Julian had in January 360 been proclaimed
   Augustus at Paris. [184] Constantius died in November 361, during the
   campaign against the rebels.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [145] In what follows I give merely a sketch; the details belong to
   Church history.

   [146] Athanas. ad Afros II. and elsewhere.

   [147] Up to time of the Chalcedonian Creed the conceptions Homoousia
   and Orthodoxy were quite identical; the latter involved no more than
   the former. Thus the orthodoxy of Origen is for Socrates (VI. 13)
   undoubted, just because none of his four chief opponents (Methodius,
   Eustathius, Apollinaris, and Theophilus) charge him with heresy in
   reference to his doctrine of the Trinity.

   [148] The best investigation regarding Eusebius of Nicomedia is
   contained in the article in the Dict. of Chr. Biogr. We know Eusebius,
   it is true, almost exclusively from the picture which his opponents
   have drawn of him. But in his actions he has portrayed himself as an
   imperious prince of the Church of a secular type, for whom all means
   were justifiable.

   [149] If Eusebius is right the Emperor had already at Nice also
   advocated a broad application of the orthodox formula.

   [150] The matter, so far as the particulars are concerned, is quite
   obscure.

   [151] The dates put shortly are as follows. Some three years after the
   Nicene Council, years which for us are absolutely dark (the letter of
   Constantine in Gelas., Hist. Conc. Nic. III. I is probably not
   genuine), Constantine begins to turn round. (Was this owing to the
   influence of Constantia and her court-clergyman?) The recall of Arius,
   Eusebius of Nicom. and Theognis (the latter's letter in Socrat. I. 14,
   is perhaps not genuine). Eusebius gains a decisive influence over the
   Emperor. At an Antioch synod 330. Eustathius of Antioch, one of the
   chief champions of the Nicene Creed is deposed (for adultery) at the
   instigation of the two Eusebiuses. Arius presents to the Emperor a
   diplomatically composed confession of faith which satisfies him, (Socr.
   I. 26) is completely rehabilitated, and demands of Athanasius that he
   be allowed to resume his position in Alexandria. Athanasius refuses,
   and succeeds in making good his refusal and in clearing himself from
   the personal charges brought against him on the part of the Eusebians.
   At the Synod of Tyre 335 (not 336) held under the presidency of the
   Church historian Eusebius, the coalition nevertheless succeeds in
   passing a resolution for the deposition of Athanasius on account of
   certain alleged gross excesses, and in persuading the Emperor to
   proceed against him as a disturber of the peace, and this spite of the
   fact that in the year 334 Athanasius, in opposition to the Synod of
   Cæsarea, had convinced the Emperor of his perfect innocence and of the
   base intrigues of the Meletian bishops. Athanasius notwithstanding this
   succeeded a second time in inducing the Emperor to give his case an
   impartial trial, by hastening to Constantinople and making a personal
   statement to the Emperor, who was taken by surprise. His opponents, who
   had meanwhile been commanded to go from Tyre to Jerusalem, now
   expressly declared that the doctrinal explanations given by Arius and
   his friends were sufficient, and already made preparations for burying
   the Nicene Creed in their pretentious assembly, and also for bringing
   to trial Marcellus, the friend of Athanasius. They were, however,
   summoned by the Emperor to come to Constantinople and to carry on their
   deliberations. Only the worst of Athanasius' opponents complied with
   this demand, and they succeeded by bringing forward new accusations (at
   the beginning of the year 336), in inducing the Emperor to banish
   Athanasius (to Trier). Still it is at least doubtful if the Emperor did
   not wish him to escape for a while from his enemies. His chair in any
   case was not filled. Marcellus, who had also appealed to the Emperor,
   was deposed and condemned on account of erroneous doctrine. The solemn
   induction of Arius into his Church--against the wish of the bishop,
   Alexander of Constantinople--was immediately robbed of its significance
   by his sudden death. The Emperor sought to carry on his energetic
   peace-policy by the banishment of other "disturbers of the peace," such
   as the Meletian leading spirit, and Paulus, the newly elected bishop of
   Constantinople. He died, however, in May 337, in his own opinion in the
   undoubted Nicene faith. His son maintained that he had himself further
   resolved on the restitution of Athanasius. Sources: besides the Church
   historians and Epiphanius, chiefly Athan. Apolog. c. Arian.; in
   addition, the Festival letters, the Hist. Arian. ad monach. de morte
   Arii ad Serapionem, Ep. ad epp. Æg. 19, and Euseb., Vita Constant. IV.

   [152] On this resolution see Schiller II., p. 277 f.

   [153] The best characterisation is in Ranke IV., p. 35 ff.; see also
   Krüger, Lucifer, p. 4 ff., Gwatkin, p. 109 sq., Schiller II., p. 245
   ff.

   [154] This explains why the canons of the Synod of Antioch came to
   enjoy a high reputation and why Hilary (de synod. 32) designated the
   assembly a synodus sanctorum.' All the same such a description is not
   quite intelligible; we know too little both of the character and of the
   proceedings of the Synod.

   [155] Marcellus is an extremely interesting phenomenon in the history
   of theology; he did not, however, succeed in effecting any change in
   the history of dogma or in creating any noteworthy number of followers.
   At the Council of Nicæa he belonged to the few who zealously championed
   the Homousios (Apol. c. Arian. 23, 32). After the Council he was,
   besides Eustathius, at first the sole literary representative of
   orthodoxy, since he wrote a comprehensive treatise peri hupotages by
   way of reply to the work of the Arian Asterius. This work, in which he
   defends the unity of substance of the Logos, drew upon him from the
   dominant party the accusation of Sabellianism and Samosatenism. His
   case was dealt with at the Councils of Tyre, Jerusalem, and
   Constantinople, since he also personally defended Athanasius and
   opposed the restoration of Arius. Spite of his appeal to the Emperor he
   was at Constantinople deprived of his office as a teacher of erroneous
   doctrine, another bishop was sent to Ancyra, and Eusebius of Cæsarea
   endeavoured in two works (c. Marcell., de ecclesiast. theolog.) to
   refute him. These works are for us the source for the teaching of
   Marcellus. Marcellus did not recognise the common doctrinal basis of
   Arianism and orthodoxy; he went back behind the traditional teaching of
   Origen, like Paui of Samosata, and consequently got rid of the element
   which caused the trouble to Arianism and, in a higher degree, to
   orthodoxy. His doctrinal system presents, on the one hand, certain
   points of agreement with that of the old Apologists, though these are
   more apparent than real, and on the other with that of Irenmus; still
   it cannot be proved that there is any literary dependence. Marcellus
   was at one with Arius in holding that the conceptions "Son", "begotten"
   etc., involve the subordination of the being thus designated. But just
   because of this he rejected these conceptions as being inapplicable to
   the divine in Christ. He clearly perceived that the prevalent theology
   was on a wrong track owing to its implication with philosophy; he
   wished to establish a purely biblical system of doctrine and sought to
   shew that these conceptions are all used in the Scriptures in reference
   to the incarnate one, the view of most in the older days, e.g.,
   Ignatius. The Scripture supplies only one conception to express the
   eternal-divine in Christ, that of the Logos (the Logos is image or type
   only in connection with man created in his image): the Logos is the
   indwelling power in God, which has manifested itself in the creation of
   the world as dunamis drastike, in order then for the first time to
   become personal with the view of saving and perfecting the human race.
   Thus the Logos is in and for itself, in its essential nature, the
   unbegotten reason of God indwelling in God from all eternity and
   absolutely inseparable from him; it begins its actuality in the
   creation of the world, but it first becomes a personal manifestation
   distinct from God in the incarnation, through which the Logos as the
   image of the invisible God becomes visible. In Christ consequently the
   Logos has become a person and son of God--a person who is as surely
   homoousios to Theo as he is the active working of God Himself. After
   the work has been completed, however, the Son subordinates Himself to
   the Father in such a way that God is again all in all, since the
   hypostatic form of the Logos now ceases (hence the title of M.'s work:
   peri hupotages; the idea is an old one, see Vol. II.). M. confessed
   that he did not know what became of the humanity of Christ. The
   stumbling-blocks which this system presented to that age were (1) that
   M. called only the incarnate one Son of God, (2) that he taught no real
   pre-existence, (3) that he assumed the Kingdom of Christ would have an
   end, and (4) that he spoke of an extension of the indivisible monad.
   Marcellus having been recalled (337) and then expelled again from his
   diocese (338), like Athanasius, betook himself to Rome, and by means of
   a confession in which he disguised his doctrine, induced Bishop Julius
   to recognise his orthodoxy. (The confession is in the letter to Julius
   in Epiph. H. 72. 2: Zahn, Marcell. p. 70 f., vainly attempts to dispute
   the fact of a "disguising." In the letter he avows his belief in the
   Roman Creed also.) The Roman synod of the year 340 declared him to be
   sound in the faith. It scarcely fully understood the case; what is of
   much more importance is that Athanasius and consequently also the
   Council of Sardica did not abandon Marcellus, and the Council indeed
   remarked that the Eusebians had taken as a positve statement what he
   had uttered only tentatively (zeton). That Athanasius spite of all
   remonstrances should have pronounced Marcellus orthodox, is a proof
   that his interest in the matter was confined to one point, and centred
   in the godhead of the historical Jesus Christ as resting upon the unity
   of substance with God. Where he saw that this was recognised, he
   allowed freedom of thought on other points. At a later period, it is
   true, when it became possible still more to discredit Marcellus through
   his pupil Photinus, there was a disagreement of a temporary kind
   between him and Athanasius. Athanasius is said to have refused to have
   intercourse with him and Marcellus is said to have dropped him.
   Athanasius also combatted the theology of M. (Orat. c. Arian. IV),
   though he afterwards again recognised the truth of his faith.
   Epiphanius informs us (72. 4) that he once put some questions to the
   aged Athanasius regarding M.: Ho de oute huperapelogesato, oute palin
   pros auton apechthos henechthe, monon de dia tou prosopou meidiasas
   hupephene , mochtherias me makran auton einai, kai hos apologesamenon
   eiche. Marcellus' followers in Ancyra also possessed at a later date an
   epistle of Athanasius (Epiph. 72. 11) which was favourable to them. The
   East, however, stuck firmly to the condemnation of Marcellus, and so
   too did the Cappadocians at a later period--a proof this also of a
   radical difference between them and Athanasius The further history of
   this matter has no place here (see Zahn op. cit. and Möller,
   R.-Encykl., 2nd Ed., p. 281 f.). Marcellus died in the year 373, close
   on a hundred years old, after that his theology had repeatedly done
   good service to the opponents of orthodoxy, without, however, helping
   them to discredit Athanasius.

   [156] The negotiations between Bishop Julius and the Eusebians
   assembled at Antioch (Rom. Council, autumn 340 Council at Antioch,
   summer and autumn 341) are from the point of view of Church politics of
   great significance, and more particularly the letter of Bishop Julius
   to the Eusebians after the Roman Council (Apol. c. Arian. 21) is a
   masterpiece. But we cannot enter on this matter here. The four formula
   of Antioch (it is to them that the reproach brought by Athanasius
   against his opponents chiefly refers--namely, that they betrayed their
   uncertainty by the new forms of faith they were constantly publishing
   see de decret. 1: de synod. 22--23: Encycl. ad epp. Ægypt. 7 sq.: Ep.
   ad. Afros 23) are in Athan., de synod. 22 sq. (Hahn § 84, 115, 85, 86).
   There are some good remarks in Gwatkin, p. 114 sq. The zealous efforts
   made by the Eusebians to arrive at a harmonious agreement with the West
   were probably closely connected also with the general political
   situation. After the fall of Constantine II. (spring 340) Constans had
   promptly made himself master of the whole of his brother's domain
   Constantius, whose attention was claimed by severe and incessant wars
   on the eastern boundary, was unable to hinder this. From the year 340
   Constans thus had the decisive preponderance in the Empire. The first
   Antiochian formula still supports Arius, though with the odd
   qualification that those who were in favour of him had not followed him
   (pos gar episkopoi ontes akolouthesan presbutero), but had tested his
   teaching: it limits itself to describing the Son as monogene, pro
   panton ton aionon huparchonta kai sunonta to gegennekoti auton patri,
   but it already contains the anti-Marcellian proposition descriptive of
   the Son: diamenonta basilea kai Theon eis tous aionas. The second,
   so-called Lucian, formula already gathers together all designations for
   the Son which could possibly be used of His Godhead from an Origenistic
   standpoint (above all, monogene Theon, Theon ek Theou, atrepton te kai
   analloioton, tes theoteros ousias te kai boules kai dunameos kai doxes
   tou patros aparallakton eikona, Theon logon); it then adopts once more
   the addition which Eusebius had appended to the outline of his belief
   presented at Nicæa (see p. 52), and formulates the following
   proposition against Marcellus; ton onomaton ouch haplos oude argos
   keimenon semainonton akribos ten oikeian hekastou ton onomazomenon
   hupostasin (N.B. = ousian) kai taxin kai doxan, hos einai te men
   hupostasei tria, te de sumphonia hen; but on the other hand, without
   mentioning Arius, it expressly rejects the Arian catchwords objected to
   at Nicæa. The third, submitted by the Bishop of Tyana, has a still
   stronger anti-Marcellan colouring (I. Chr. onta pros ton Theon en
   hupostasei . . . menonta eis tous aionas), repudiates Marcellus,
   Sabellius, and Paul of Samosata by name, but otherwise in place of all
   other possible designations it has the Nicene sounding: Theon teleion
   ek Theou teleiou. At length the fourth formula, drawn up some months
   later, became the final one. It is constructed as far as possible on
   the model of the Nicene Creed; at the end too some Arian catchwords are
   expressly condemned. The most important propositions run thus: kai eis
   ton monogene autou huion, ton kurion hemon I. Chr., ton pro panton ton
   aionon ek tou patros gennethenta, Theon ek Theou, phos ek photos . . .
   logon onta kai sophian kai dunamin kai zoen kai phos alethinon, at the
   close of this section (against Marcellus): hou basileia akatalutos ousa
   diamenei eis tous apeirous aionas; estai gar kathezomenos en dexia tou
   patros ou monon en to aioni touto, alla kai en to mellonti. All four
   formulæ have this in common, that they are compatible with the theology
   of Origen; the three last, that Arianism in the strict sense is
   repudiated. The fourth was communicated to the Emperor Constans by a
   deputation in Gaul. For the rest it ought not to be forgotten that the
   Eusebians formally adhered to the basis of the Nicene Creed; see Hefele
   I., p. 502 ff.

   [157] Sardica was situated in the territory of Constans. The most
   influential of the Eastern bishops were present. Hosius took the lead.
   (Histor. Arian 15.) The formal restatement of the Nicene Creed desired
   by some of them was not proceeded with. (Athan. Tom. ad Antioch. 5
   against Socrates II., 20); but the description of the Faith which will
   be found at the close of the encyclical letter, although it is not to
   be regarded as an official declaration, is a document whose importance
   has hitherto not been sufficiently recognised. It originated with
   Hosius and Protogenes of Sardica, and is the most unambiguous
   expression of the Western view in the matter, so unambiguous that for
   the moment it seemed even to the orthodox Orientals themselves to be
   questionable (the formula is in Theodoret II. 8, lat. translation
   discovered by Maffei). It is here first of all that the proposition is
   found: mian hupostasin, hen autoi hoi hairetikoi ousian prosagoreuousi
   (for hupostasin we have in the Latin "substantiam" ), tou patros kai
   tou huiou kai tou hagiou pneumatos. Kai ei zetoien, tis tou huiou he
   hupostasis estin, homologoumen hos haute en he mone tou patros
   homologoumene. In the second place the doctrine of the Son is put in
   such a way that one can very easily understand how the Westerns refused
   to condemn Marcellus; there are turns of expression which approach the
   doctrine of Marcellus. (A comparison with the Christology of Prudentius
   is instructive in this connection.) Ursacius and Valens amongst others
   were declared deposed. Their bishoprics were situated in the territory
   of Constans, but they were of an Arian way of thinking. Eefele, op.
   cit. p. 533 ff., treats in great detail the canons and acts of the
   Council.

   [158] Above all, the Eusebians repeated their old statement that the
   decrees of deposition pronounced by Councils in reference to bishops
   are irrevocable. So too they held to the charges against Marcellus (of
   erroneous doctrine) and against Athanasius (of flagrant abuse of his
   power). There is a wish to introduce something entirely new, "ut
   orientales episcopi ab occidentalibus judicarentur"; but whoever holds
   by Marcellus and Athanasius let him be Anathema. The doctrinal formula
   (Hilarius Fragm. III. and de synod, 34) differs little from the fourth
   formula of Antioch and thus condemns Arianism. Formally the Easterns
   were in the right as regards Athanasius.

   [159] Histor. Arian. 18, 19.

   [160] Histor. Arian. 20; Theodoret II. 9, 10. Bishop Stephanus of
   Antioch, who had tried the trick, was deposed.

   [161] Their motive in bringing forward the new formula was by almost
   completely meeting the demands of the Westerns in reference to the
   doctrinal question, to induce them to give way on the personal
   question. (Ekthesis macrostichos, see Athan., de synod. 26: Socrat II.
   19). It begins with the fourth formula of Antioch, then follow detailed
   explanations of the faith as against the Arians, Sabellians, Marcellus,
   and Photinus who is mentioned here for the first time. Spite of the
   polemic against the proposition of Athanasius--who is, however, not
   mentioned by name--that the Son is begotten ou boulesei oude thelesei,
   this formula indicates the greatest approach conceivable on the part of
   the Eusebians towards meeting the views of their opponents. They
   emphasise in the strongest way the unity of the one Godhead (c. 4):
   oute men, tria homologountes pragmata kai tria prosopa (it has to be
   noticed that the bishops avoid the expression three "substances or
   hypostases" and use the Western prosopon which had been brought into
   discredit by Sabellius) tou patros kai tou huiou kai a. pneumatos kata
   tas graphas, treis dia touto Theous poioumen, and they expressed
   themselves in such a way in c. 9, that the words must pass for an
   unobjectionable paraphrase of the Homousios. They are practically the
   very same expressions as those used by Athanasius to describe the
   relation of Father and Son. "Homousios" is, however, wanting: but, on
   the other hand, we find here, so far as I know, for the first time:
   kata panta homoion. Socrates, II. 20, has candidly remarked on the
   formula macrostichos: tauta hoi kata ta hesperia mere episkopoi dia to
   alloglossous einai kai dia to me sunienai ou prosedechonto, arkein ten
   en Nikaia pistin legontes. On the Acts of a Synod at Köln, from which
   we gather that Bishop Euphrates of Köln who was sent to Antioch from
   Sardica, had afterwards fallen away to Arianism, see Rettberg (K.-G.
   Deutschlands, I., p. 123 ff.) and Hauck (K.-G. Deutschlands, I., p. 47
   f.), who are opposed to their genuineness; Friedrich (K.-G.
   Deutschland, I., p. 277 f.) and Söder (Stud. u. Mitth. ans. d.
   Benedict. Orden, fourth year's issue, I., p. 295 f., II., p. 344 f.,
   fifth year, I., p. 83 f.) who are in favour of it.

   [162] Photinus of Sirmium, a fellow-countryman and pupil of Marcellus,
   developed the doctrinal system of the master in such a way as to
   represent even the energeia drastike of God as not assuming a concrete
   hypostatic form in Jesus Christ, (or if it did take a concrete form as
   a hypostasis, then this was a purely human one--the matter is not quite
   clear). He thus rigidly held fast the single personality of God, and
   accordingly, like Paul of Samosata, saw in Jesus a man miraculously
   born (Zahn, op. cit., p. 192 combats this; but neither is the evidence
   that Photinus denied the birth from the Virgin Mary certain enough, nor
   is it in itself credible that a catholic bishop in the fourth century
   should have departed so far from the tradition), predestined to his
   office by God, and who in virtue of his moral development has attained
   to divine honour. We thus have here the last inherently logical attempt
   to guard Christian monotheism, entirely to discard the philosophical
   Logos-doctrine, and to conceive of the Divine in Christ as a divine
   effect. But this attempt was no longer in harmony with the spirit of
   the age; Photinus was charged on all sides with teaching erroneous
   doctrine. His writings have disappeared: compare the scattered
   statements regarding him in Athanasius, Hilary, the Church historians,
   Epiph. H. 72 and the anathemas of various Councils, see also Vigilius
   Taps. adv. Arian., Sabell. et Photin.). The two Milan Councils, the
   date of which is not quite certain, condemned him, so too did a Sirmian
   Council of Eusebians which was perhaps held as early as 347. Still he
   remained in office till 351, held in high respect by his congregation.
   That the macrostic Confession of the Orientals ought not all the same
   to be accepted as so orthodox as it from its wording appears to be, is
   evident from the fact that the Eastern bishops who were deputed to take
   it to the West declined at Milan to condemn Arianism too. (Hilarius,
   Fragm. V.)

   [163] For the documents relating to their conversion, which was
   hypocritical and dictated entirely by policy, and to their complete
   recognition of Athanasius, see Athanas. Apol. c. Arian. 58, Hilar.,
   Fragm. II.

   [164] Schiller (op. cit. p. 282). "As a matter of fact Constans wished
   to establish a kind of supremacy in relation to his brother, which in
   spiritual matters was to be exercised through the Bishop of Rome.
   Trusting to his support, deposed bishops on their own authority
   returned to their dioceses, without having received the sanction of the
   Emperor. The restoration of Athanasius resolved on by the Council was a
   direct interference with the sovereignty of Constantius . . . But
   Constans was able once more to make such a skilful use of the existing
   Persian difficulty that his brother yielded." The fact is that the
   recall of Athanasius was altogether forced upon Constantius; the
   relation of the great bishop to his Emperor at this time was not that
   of a subject, but that of a hostile power with which he had to treat.
   This is naturally glossed over in the papers issued by Constantius
   referring to the recall. It is specially characteristic that Athanasius
   did not personally present himself before Constantius till after
   repeated invitations; see, above all, Apol. c. Arian. 51-56, Hist.
   Arian. 21-23.

   [165] A Council of Jerusalem held in 346 under Maximus actually
   recognised Athanasius as a member of the Church. (Apol. c. Arian. 57).
   Cyril's Catecheses shew the standpoint of the Oriental extreme Right;
   they are undoubtedly based on Orig. de princip.; but they faithfully
   express the Christological standpoint of the formula macrostichos; the
   homoousios only is wanting; as regards the matter of the Faith, Cyril
   is orthodox. The polemic directed against Sabellius and Marcellus
   (Catech. 15, 27) is severe and very bitter; Arianism is also refuted,
   but without any mention of names. Jews, Samaritans, and Manicheans are
   the chief opponents referred to, and Cyril is at great pains everywhere
   to adduce the biblical grounds for the formulæ which he uses. The
   Catecheses of Cyril are a valuable document in illustration of the fact
   that amongst the Eastern opponents of the Nicene formula there were
   bishops who, while fully recognising that Arianism was in the wrong,
   could not bring themselves to use a doctrinal formula which seemed to
   them a source of ceaseless strife and to be unbiblical besides.

   [166] Schiller (p. 283 f.) supposes that Constantius was apprehensive
   before this that Athanasius would declare for Magnentius. Hence his
   friendly letter to Athanasius after the death of Constans, Hist. Arian.
   24.

   [167] Photinus was deposed here. The Creed of this Council, the first
   formula of Sirmium (in Athanas., de synod. 27, Hilar. de synod. 38 and
   Socr. II., 30), is identical with the Fourth Formula of Antioch, but
   numerous anathemas are added to it in which formulæ such as "two gods",
   (2), "platusmos tes ousias estin ho huios" (7), "logos endiathetos e
   prophorikos" (8) are condemned, and already several explanations of
   Bible passages are branded as heretical (11, 12, 14-18). The
   subordination of the Son is expressly (18) avowed in this Creed, which
   otherwise strongly resembles the Nicene Creed. The anathemas 20-23 have
   to do with the Holy Ghost. In No. 19 the formula hen prosopon is
   rejected. Nos. 12, 13, deny that the divine element in Christ is
   capable of suffering. One can see that new questions have emerged.

   [168] Of the Western bishops--leaving out Pannonia--almost all were
   orthodox. The Councils--that of Arles was a provincial Council, that of
   Milan a General Council, but apparently badly attended--were also
   managed by the new Pope Liberius (since 352), but ended quite contrary
   to his will. The best description is in Krüger Lucifer, pp. 11-20. At
   Arles Paulinus of Trier was the only one who remained firm, and he was
   exiled to Phrygia; even the Papal legates yielded. At Milan Lucifer and
   Eusebius. of Vercelli were exiled, and also Dionysius of Milan,
   although he had agreed to the condemnation of Athanasius. Soon after
   Hosius, Liberius, and Hilary had to follow them into exile. In Milan
   Constantius actually ruled the Church, but with a brutal terrorism.
   There are characteristic utterances of his in Lucifer's works and in
   Athanasius.

   [169] Already in the years immediately preceding, an incessant
   agitation had again been kept up against Athanasius; see Socr. II., 26,
   Sozom. IV., 9, Athan. Apol. ad Const. 2 sq., 14 sq., 19 sq. He betook
   himself to the desert, but later on he seems to have remained in hiding
   in Alexandria. No one, it would appear, cared to secure the price set
   upon his head. We have several writings of his belonging to this
   period. His successor, George, was pretty much isolated in Alexandria.

   [170] The watchword of the "independence" of the Church of the State
   was now issued by Athanasius, Hilary, and above all by the hot-blooded
   Lucifer. Hilary, who first emerges into notice in 355, speedily gained
   a high reputation. He was the first theologian of the West to penetrate
   into the secrets of the Nicene Creed, and with all his dependence on
   Athanasius was an original thinker, who, as a theologian, far surpassed
   the Alexandrian Bishop. On his theology see the monograph by Reinkens,
   also Möhler, op. cit. 449 ff., and Dorner.

   [171] After the full account given of the theology of Arius there was
   no need for any detailed description of the theology of Aëtius and
   Eunomius; for it is nothing but logical Arianism; see on the Ekthesis
   pisteos and the Apologetikos of Eunomius Fabricius-Harless T. IX. The
   rejection of all conciliatory formulæ is characteristic.

   [172] Dräseke (Ges. patristische Unters., 1889, p. 1 ff.) wishes to
   credit him with the anonymous work against the Manicheans, which
   Lagarde discovered (1859) in a MS. of Titus of Bostra.

   [173] With Hilary, for example, as his work "de synodis" proves. It is
   very characteristic that Lucifer, the strictest of the Nicenes, never
   came to have a clear idea of the meaning of the formulæ, homoousios and
   homoiousios; see Krüger, p. 37 f.

   [174] The Confession is in Hilary, de Synod. 11, Athan. de synod. 28,
   Socrat. II. 30. Valens, Ursacius and Germinius of Sirmium took the
   lead. The words homoousios and homoiousios were forbidden as being
   unbiblical and because no one could express the generation of the Son.
   It is settled that the Father is greater, that the Son is subordinate.
   Here too the Christological problem of the future is already touched
   upon. Hilary pronounces the formula blasphemous. It marks the
   turning-point in the long controversy to this extent that it is the
   first public attempt to controvert the Nicene Creed. Against it
   Phobadius wrote the tractate "de filii divinitate", which is severely
   Western-Nicene in tone, and in this respect is markedly different from
   the conciliatory work of Hilary "de synodis"; see on it Gwatkin, p. 159
   sq. The Eastern bishops Acacius and Uranius of Tyre, who shared the
   sentiments of the court-bishops, accorded a vote of thanks to the
   latter at a Council at Antioch, held in 358. Hosius subscribed the
   second Sirmian formula (Socr. II. 31).

   [175] Aëtius was in high favour with Eudoxius of Antioch, and his
   pupils occupied the Eastern bishoprics. The manifesto of Sirmium
   appeared like an edict of toleration for strict Arianism. At the
   instigation of George of Laodicea some Semi-Arians joined together to
   oppose it at the Council of Ancyra. The comprehensive synodal-letter of
   Ancyra (Epiph. p. 73, 2-11, see Hilar. de synod) indicates the
   transition on the part of the Semi-Arians to the point of view at which
   the Nicæans were able to meet them. It was re-echoed in the writings of
   Hilary and Athanasius de synodis (358-359). The Semi-Arians at Ancyra
   took up a position based on the fourth Antiochian formula, which was
   also that of Philippopolis and of the First Sirmian Council, but they
   explained that the new Arianism made it necessary to have precise
   statements. The following are the most important explanations given;
   (1) the name Father by its very form points to the fact that God must
   be the author of a substance of like quality with Him (aitios homoias
   autou ousias): pas pater homoias autou ousias noeitai pater--this does
   away with the relation of Logos-Son and world-idea--(2) the designation
   "Son" excludes everything of a created kind and involves the full
   homoiotes, (3) "the Son" is consequently Son in the peculiar and unique
   sense, and the analogy with men as sons of God is thus done away with.
   The likeness in substance is further based on Bible statements, and in
   the 19 anathemas together with Sabellianism all formulæ are rejected
   which express less than likeness in substance. Finally, however,
   "homoousios" too, together with the characteristic addition "e
   tautoousios" has an anathema attached to it, i.e., the substantial
   unity of essence is rejected as Sabellian. The Conservatives of the
   East have undoubtedly here quite changed their ground. A definitely
   defined doctrine has taken the place of prolix formulæ, at once
   cosmological and soteriological in drift, and derived from Origen,
   Lucian, and Eusebius.

   [176] The victory of the Semi-Arians at the court is a turn of affairs
   which we cannot clearly explain. The fact is incontestable. The third
   formula of Sirmium, drawn up at the Fourth Council of Sirmium, is
   identical with the fourth Antiochian formula. That Constantius should
   have fallen back on this is perhaps to be explained from the fact that
   the disturbances at Rome made it necessary for him to send Liberius
   back there, though the most he could hope for was to get him to
   subscribe that formula, but not the manifesto of the year 357. He
   actually got him to do this, i.e., Liberius subscribed several older
   confessional formularies which originated at a time when the Nicene
   Creed had been only indirectly attacked. It was not only, however, that
   Liberius bought his freedom at that time, but it was actually for the
   time being a question of a general victory of the Homoiousians, which
   they used too entirely in their own interest, after all the bishops
   present at Sirmium, including Ursacius and Valens, had had to make up
   their minds to subscribe the synodal decrees. Eudoxius of Antioch and
   Aëtius and in addition 70 Anomoeans were banished at the instigation of
   Basil of Ancyra and there were many instances of the violent use of
   power. One cannot be certain if these same violent proceedings did not
   bring about once more a quick change of feeling on the part of the
   Emperor.

   [177] The Council was intended to bring about at last a general peace;
   at first the Emperor evidently intended to summon it to meet at Nicæa
   (Soz. IV. 16), then Nicomedia was next considered as a likely place,
   but it was destroyed by an earthquake. Then it was that Nicæa was again
   thought of; Basil of Ancyra had still a great influence at the time.
   Finally, the party opposed to this was victorious, and the plan of a
   division of the Councils was carried through. But it was just this
   opposition-party which now wished to unite all parties in a Homoean
   Confession and gained over the Emperor to assent to this. The actual
   result, however, was that Homoeans and Anomoeans on the one hand,
   Homoiousians and Homousians on the other, more and more drew together.
   Hilary, who was staying in the East, had indeed already explained to
   his Gallic compatriots that it was possible to attach an "unpious"
   meaning to homoousios quite as readily as to homoiousios. The bishops
   assembled in presence of the Emperor now composed in advance for the
   Council a Confession which, since Semi-Arians were also present, might
   serve as a means of reconciling Homoean and Homoiousian conceptions. It
   was already evident at the time of signing it that it was differently
   interpreted. The catchwords ran thus: homoion patri kata tas
   graphas--homoion kata panta hos hoi hagiai graphai legousin. Valens
   signed it and at the same time simply repeated the word homoion without
   the kata panta; Basil in signing it expressly remarked that panta
   included being also. The formula is in Athan. de synd. 8, Socrat. II.
   37; see Sozom. IV. 17. The dogmatic treatise of Basil in Epiph. H. 73,
   12-22, has reference to this formula, which Athanasius (de synodis) had
   already scoffed at because of its being dated, i.e., because it bore
   the signs of its newness on its front.

   [178] Socr. II. 37 explains that Nice was chosen with the view of
   giving to the new formula a name which sounded the same as that of the
   Nicene Creed. The formula is in Athan. de synod. 30, and Theodoret II.
   21: homoion kata tas graphas, hou ten gennesin oudeis oiden. In
   addition: to de onoma tes ousias hoper haplousteron enetethe hupo ton
   pateron, agnooumenon de tois laois skandalon ephere, dia to en tais
   graphais touto me ekpheresthai, erese periairethenai kai pantelos
   medemian mnemen ousias tou loipou ginesthai . . . mete me dein epi
   prosopou patros kai huiou kai hagiou pneumatos mian hupostasin
   onomazesthai. One might be pleased with this rational explanation if
   polytheism did not in fact lurk behind it.

   [179] Hilary was present in Seleucia and made common cause with the
   Homoiousians against the others. Acacius in face of the superior
   numbers of the Homoiousians sought to save his party by drawing up a
   creed in which he expressly repudiated the Anomoeans and proclaimed the
   likeness in will, (see the creed in Athanas. de synod. 29, Epiph. H.

   [180] It was on the night of the last day of the year 359 that the
   Emperor achieved the triumph of the homoios in his empire.

   [182] People like Eudoxius and Acacius were real victors; they got a
   perfectly free hand for themselves against the Homoiousians at the cost
   of the condemnation of Aëtius, and made common cause with Valens and
   Ursinus. The Creed of Nice was sent all over the Empire for signature
   under threat of penalty.

   [183] Eunomius became bishop of Cyzikus; Eudoxius of Antioch received
   the chair of Constantinople.

   3. TO THE COUNCILS OF CONSTANTINOPLE 381. 383.

   The three possible standpoints--the Athanasian, the Lucianist-Arian,
   and the Origenist, which in opposition to the Arian had gradually
   narrowed itself down to the Homoiousian--had been set aside by
   Constantius in the interest of the unity of the Church. But the Homoean
   formula, which had no firm theological conviction behind it, meant the
   domination of a party which gravitated towards Arianism, i.e., which
   resolved faith in Jesus Christ into a dialectical discussion about
   unbegotten and begotten and into the conviction of the moral unity of
   Father and Son. It was for twenty years, with the exception of a brief
   interval, the dominant creed in the East. This fact finds its
   explanation only in the change, or narrowing, which came over what was
   at an earlier date the middle party. The Arianising Homoeans were now
   conservative and in their way even conciliatory. They disposed of the
   ancient tradition of the East as the Eusebians had done before them;
   for their formula "of like nature according to Holy Scripture"
   contained that latitude which corresponded to the old traditional
   doctrine. With this we may compare the standpoint of Eusebius of
   Cæsarea. The old middle party had, however, in the homoiousios made for
   themselves a fixed doctrinal formula. [185] This was a change of the
   most decisive kind. We may still further say it was not the "Homousios"
   which finally triumphed, but on the contrary the Homoiousian doctrine,
   which fixed on the terms of agreement with tale "Homousios." The
   doctrine which Hosius, Athanasius, Eustathius, and Marcellus had
   championed at Nicæa, was over-thrown. The new Origenism which was based
   on the "Homousios" succeeded in establishing itself. A form of doctrine
   triumphed which did not exclude scientific theology, a subject in which
   Athanasius and the Westerns of the older days never shewed any
   interest. But Athanasius himself contributed to the revolution thus
   accomplished, [186] though it is very doubtful if he ever came to see
   the full extent of it.

   Julian granted liberty to all the bishops to return, and in so doing
   did away with the artificial state of things created by Constantius.
   The Nicæans were once more a power, and Athanasius who returned to
   Alexandria in February 362, at once re-assumed the leadership of the
   party. A Synod was held at Alexandria in summer, and this prepared the
   way for the triumph of orthodoxy in the year 381. [187] It was here
   resolved that the Nicene Creed was to be accepted sans phrase. i.e.,
   that those were to be recognised as Christian brethren who now
   acknowledge the homoousios, and condemn the Arian heresy together with
   its chief supporters, irrespective of any former departure on their
   part from the faith. But still further, the question as to whether it
   was necessary to believe in one hypostasis or in three was left an open
   one. (At Alexandria the Holy Spirit had already been the subject of
   discussion as well as the Son.) Both statements were disapproved of
   since the homoousios was considered to be sufficient, but it was
   explained that both might be understood in a pious sense. [188] These
   resolutions were not passed without strong opposition. [189] Not only
   did some bishops demand that those who had subscribed the Fourth
   Sirmian Formula should be denied the communion of the Church, but, what
   was of much greater importance, there was a party which insisted on the
   interpretation of the Nicene Creed which had been settled by some of
   the Western bishops at Sardica, and which as a matter of fact was the
   original one. [190] But they did not press their views, and they seem
   to have acquiesced in the decision of the Synod. This marked a complete
   change. [191] If up till now orthodox faith had meant the recognition
   of a mysterious plurality in the substantial unity of the Godhead, it
   was now made permissible to turn the unity into a mystery, i.e., to
   reduce it to equality and to make the threefoldness the starting-point;
   but this simply means that that Homoiousianism was recognised which
   resolved to accept the word homoousios. And to this theology, which
   changed the substantial unity of substance expressed in the homoousios
   into a mere likeness or equality of substance, so that there was no
   longer a threefold unity, but a trinity, the future belonged, in the
   East, though not to the same extent in the West. The theologians who
   had studied Origen regarded it with favour. The Cappadocians started
   from the homoousios, [192] though this is certainly true of Gregory of
   Nyssa only indirectly. They acknowledged the homoousios and accordingly
   set up a system of doctrine which neither disavowed the theology of
   Origen, that is, science in general, nor yet remained in the
   terminologically helpless condition of Athanasius. But they succeeded
   in attaining terminological clearness--they could not improve on the
   matter of the doctrine--only because they modified the original thought
   of Athanasius and developed the theology which Basil of Ancyra had
   first propounded in his tractate. Ousia now got a meaning which was
   half way between the abstract "substance" and the concrete "individual
   substance", still it inclined very strongly in the direction of the
   former. [193] Hupostasis got a meaning half way between "Person" and
   "Attribute", (Accident, Modality), still the conception of Person
   entered more largely into it. [194] Prosopon was avoided because it had
   a Sabellian sound, but it was not rejected. The unity of the Godhead,
   as the Cappadocians conceived of it, was not the same as the unity
   which Athanasius had in his mind. Basil the Great was never tired of
   emphasising the new distinction implied in ousia, and hupostasis. For
   the central doctrine of the incarnation of God they required a
   conception of God of boundless fulness. Mia ousia (mia theotes) en
   trisin hupostasesin, (one divine substance (one divine nature) in three
   subjects,) was the formula. In order to give clear expression to the
   actual distinction of the Persons within the Godhead, Gregory of Nyssa
   attached to them tropoi huparxeos, (modes of existence,) idiotetes
   charakterizousai, exaireta idiomata, (characteristic peculiarities,
   special characters). To the Father he attributed agennesia, the quality
   of being unbegotten, and in consequence of this the word which had
   formerly been forbidden by the Niceans was once more restored to a
   place of honour, no longer, however, as referring to substance, but as
   expressing a mode of being (schesis) of God the Father. To the Son he
   attributed gennesia, the quality of being begotten, and even the older
   Homoiousians shewed more reserve on this point than Gregory did. To the
   Spirit he attributed ekporeusis--procession. [195] But what is more,
   the entire Origenistic speculation regarding the Trinity, with which
   Athanasius would have nothing to do, that is, of which he knew nothing,
   was rehabilitated. The moment or element of finitude within the
   Trinitarian evolution was no doubt struck out, still the Absolute has
   nevertheless not only modi in itself, but also in some degree, stages.
   The (eternal) generation or begetting, in the sense of a Godhead
   extending itself to the limits of the creaturely, was again put in the
   foreground. In this way the subordination-conception, which was an
   irreducible remainder in Athanasius' whole way of looking at the
   question, again acquired a peculiar significance. The idea that the
   Father in Himself is to be identified with the entire Godhead again
   became one of the ground-principles of speculation. He is the
   starting-point of the Trinity, just as He is the Creator of the world.
   The idea that He is source, beginning, cause of the Godhead (pege,
   arche, aitia tes theotetos), the cause (to aition) and consequently God
   in the proper sense (kurios Theos), while the other Hypostases again
   are effects (aitiata), [196] meant something different to the
   Cappadocians from what it did to Athanasius. For the Logos-conception,
   which Athanasius had discarded as theistic-cosmical, again came to the
   front, and in their view Logos and Cosmos are more closely related than
   in that of Athanasius. The unity of the Godhead does not rest here on
   the Homousia, but in the last resort, as with Arius, on the "monarchy"
   of God the Father; and the Spiritual on earth is, in fine, not a mere
   creature of God, but--at any rate with Gregory of Nyssa--as in the view
   of Origen, is a being with a nature akin to His. [197] "Science"
   concluded an alliance with the Nicene Creed; that was a condition of
   the triumph of orthodoxy. If at the beginning of the controversy the
   scientific thinkers--including those amongst the heathen--had
   sympathised with Arianism, men were now to be found as the defenders of
   the Nicene Creed to whom even a Libanius yielded the palm. These men
   took their stand on the general theory of the universe which was
   accepted by the science of the time; they were Platonists, and they
   once more naïvely appealed to Plato in support even of their doctrine
   of the Trinity. [198] Those who were on the side of Plato, Origen,
   [199] and Libanius--Basil indeed had recommended the latter to his
   pupils as one who could help them in advanced culture,--those who were
   on a footing of equality with the scholars, the statesmen, and highest
   officials, could not fail to get sympathy. The literary triumphs of the
   Cappadocians who knew how to unite devotion to the Faith and to the
   practical ideals of the Church with their scientific interests, the
   victories over Eunomius and his following were at the same time the
   triumphs of Neo-platonism over an Aristotelianism which had become
   thoroughly arid and formal. [200] Orthodoxy in alliance with science
   had a spring which lasted from two to three decades, a short spring
   which was not followed by any summer, but by destructive storms. Spite
   of all the persecutions, the years between 370 and 394 were very happy
   ones for the orthodox Church of the East. It was engaged on a great
   task, and this was to restore the true faith to the Churches of the
   East, and to introduce into them the asceticism which was closely
   allied with science. [201] It was in the midst of a struggle which was
   more honourable than the struggles of the last decades had been. Men
   dreamt the dream of an eternal league between Faith and Science.
   Athanasius did not share this dream, but neither did he disturb it. He
   did not go in for the new theology, and there is much to shew that it
   did not quite satisfy him. [202] But he saw the aim of his life, the
   recognition of the complete Godhead of Christ, brought nearer
   accomplishment, and he continued to be the patriarch and the recognised
   head of orthodoxy, as the letters of Basil in particular shew. When,
   however, orthodoxy had attained its victory, there arose after a few
   years within its own camp an opponent more dangerous to its scientific
   representatives than Eunomius and Valens--the traditionalism which
   condemned all science.

   Nothing more than an outline can here be given of the development of
   events in particular instances. The Synod of Alexandria was not able by
   means of its resolution to unite the parties which had separated at
   Antioch: the party of the orthodox who clung to the old faith and that
   of the Homoiousians who under the leadership of Meletius acknowledged
   the Homousios. This Antiochian split remained an open wound, and the
   history of the attempts to get it healed makes it abundantly evident
   that different doctrines were really in question, that Alexandria and
   the East had not lost their feeling of distrust of Meletius, and that
   the Cappadocians who were at the head of the new orthodoxy in the East
   were not able to suppress the suspicion of Sabellianism in the light of
   the old orthodoxy. [203]

   Jovian, who was inclined to orthodoxy, once more recalled Athanasius
   who had been banished for the last time by Julian. [204] Athanasius
   somewhat prematurely announced the triumph of the true faith in the
   East. [205] Under the new ruler, Acacius, at a Synod held in Antioch in
   363, found himself obliged to agree with Meletius and to join with him
   in declaring his adherence to the homoousios, explaining at the same
   time that it expressed as much as the ek tes ousias (of the substance)
   and the homoiousios together [206] (see Athan., de Synod.) But the
   accession of Valens in the following year changed everything. An
   attempt on the part of the semi-Arians at the Synod at Lampsacus in 364
   to get the upper hand, miscarried. [207] Eudoxius of Constantinople and
   the adroit Acacius who again made a change of front, became masters of
   the situation, and Valens resolved to adopt once more the policy of
   Constantius, to maintain the Arian Homoeism in its old position, and to
   make all bishops who thought differently [208] suffer. Orthodox and
   Homoiousians had again to go into banishment. From this time onwards
   many Homoiousians turned to the West, having made up their minds to
   accept the homoousios in order to get support. The West after the brief
   episode of the period of oppression (353-360) was once more Nicene.
   There were but few Arians, although they were influential. After
   various Councils had met, the Homoiousians sent deputies from Pontus,
   Cappadocia, and Asia [209] to Liberius to get the doctrinal union
   brought about. Liberius, whose sentiments were the same as those of
   Hilary, did not refuse their request. The announcement of this happy
   event was made at Tyana in 367; [210] but at a Carian Council a
   Homoiousian minority persisted in rejecting the homoousios. [211] From
   this time Basil, who became bishop in 370, [212] took an active part in
   affairs and he was soon after followed by the other Cappadocians, and
   they threw not only the weight of science, but also that of asceticism,
   into the scale in favour of orthodoxy. The new bishop of Rome, Damasus,
   took a decided stand against Arianism at the Roman Synods held in 369
   (370) and 377, then against the Pneumatomachians (see below) and the
   Apollinarian heresy, while Marcellus and Photinus were also condemned.
   The rigid standpoint of the bishops Julius and Athanasius again became
   the dominant one in the West, and it was only after some hesitation
   that the Western bishops resolved to offer the hand of friendship to
   the new-fashioned orthodoxy of the East. The representatives of the
   latter did not indeed settle the Antiochian schism at the well-attended
   Council at Antioch in September 379, but they subscribed the Roman
   pronouncements of the last years, and thus placed themselves at the
   standpoint of Damasus. [213]

   But meanwhile very great changes had taken place in the State. In
   November 375 Valentinian died. He had not taken any part in Church
   politics, and had in fact protected the Arian bishops as he did the
   orthodox bishops, and had never had any difference with his brother
   regarding their religious policy. His successor, the youthful Gratian,
   [214] yielded himself wholly to the guidance of the masterful Ambrose.
   He firmly established the State Church as against the heterodox
   parties, by passing some severe laws, and in doing this he followed
   Ambrose "whom the Lord had taken from amongst the judges of the earth
   and placed in the Apostolic chair." (Basil ep. 197, 1.) In August 378
   Valens fell at the battle of Adrianople, fighting with the Goths; and
   on the 19th of January, 379, the Western Theodosius was made Emperor of
   the East by Gratian. The death of Valens was quite as much a
   determining cause of the final triumph of orthodoxy as its alliance
   with science; for the inner force of a religious idea can never secure
   for it the dominion of the world. Theodosius was a convinced Western
   Christian who took up the policy of Gratian, but carried it out in a
   perfectly independent fashion. [215] He was determined to rule the
   Church as Constantius had done, but to rule it in the spirit of rigid
   orthodoxy. He had himself been baptised [216] in the year 380, and
   immediately after appeared the famous edict which enjoined the orthodox
   faith on all nations. It is, however, in the highest degree
   characteristic of his whole policy that this faith is more definitely
   described as the Roman and Alexandrian faith, i.e., the new doctrinal
   orthodoxy of Cappadocia and Asia is passed over in silence. [217] After
   his entry into Constantinople Theodosius took all their churches from
   the Arians and handed them over to the orthodox. [218] In the year 381
   he issued a regulation in which he prohibited all heretics from holding
   divine service in the towns. In the same year, however, the Emperor
   summoned a large Eastern Council to meet at Constantinople, and its
   resolutions were afterwards regarded as ecumenical and strictly
   binding, though not till the middle of the fifth century, and in the
   West not till a still later date. This Council denotes a complete
   change in the policy of Theodosius. His stay in the East had taught him
   that it was necessary for him to recognise as orthodox all who
   acknowledged the Nicene Creed however they might interpret it, and at
   the same time to make an attempt to gain over the Macedonians. He had
   come to see that in the East he must rely upon the Eastern form of
   orthodoxy, the new orthodoxy, that he would have to suppress the
   aspirations of the Alexandrian bishops, and that he must do nothing
   which would have the appearance of anything like tutelage of the East
   by the West. This reversal of his policy is shewn most strikingly by
   the fact that Meletius of Antioch was called upon to preside at the
   Council, the very man who was specially suspected by the orthodox of
   the West. [219] He died shortly after the Council met, and first
   Gregory of Nazianzus, [220] and then Nectarius of Constantinople
   presided over its deliberations. The opposition at the Council between
   the old orthodox party, orthodox in the Alexandrian and Western sense,
   who were few in numbers, and the new orthodox party composed of
   Antiochians, Cappadocians and Asiatics, was of the most pronounced
   character, though we are only partially acquainted with it. [221] The
   confusion was so great that Gregory of Nazianzus resigned and left the
   Council with the most bitter feelings. [222] Still union was finally
   secured, although the attempt to win over the Macedonians failed. The
   "150 bishops" unitedly avowed their adherence to the Nicene faith, and,
   as we are told, accepted in addition to this a special explanation of
   the doctrine of the Trinity in which the complete Homousia of the
   Spirit also was expressed. In the first canon containing the decisions,
   after the ratification of the Nicene Creed, Eunomians (Anomeans) Arians
   (Eudoxians) Semi-Arians (Pneumatomachians) Sabellians, Marcellians,
   Photinians and Apollinarians were expressly anathematised. The Nicene
   Creed thus gained an unqualified victory so far as its actual terms
   were concerned, but understood according to the interpretation of
   Meletius, the Cappadocians, and Cyril of Jerusalem. The community of
   substance in the sense of equality or likeness of substance, not in
   that of unity of substance, was from this time the orthodox doctrine in
   the East. But the Creed which since the middle of the fifth century in
   the East, and since about 530 in the West, has passed for the
   ecumenical-Constantinopolitan Creed, is neither ecumenical nor
   Constantinopolitan; for the Council was not an ecumenical one, but an
   Eastern one, and it did not in fact set up any new Creed. This Creed,
   on the contrary, is the Baptismal Creed of the Jerusalem Church which
   was issued in a revised form soon after 362 and furnished with some
   Nicene formulæ and with a regula fidei in reference to the Holy Spirit,
   and which was perhaps brought forward at the Council of 381 and
   approved of, but which cannot pass for its creed. How it subsequently
   came to rank as a decision of the Council is a matter regarding which
   we are completely in the dark. This much, however, is clear, that if
   this Creed had any connection at all with the Council of 381, the
   neo-orthodox character of the latter is thereby brought out in a
   specially striking way; for the so-called Creed of Constantinople can
   in fact be taken simply as a formula of union between orthodox,
   Semi-Arians, and Pneumatomachians. The most contested phrase of the
   Nicene Creed "ek tes ousias tou patros" is wanting in it, and it
   presents the doctrine of the Holy Spirit in a form which could not have
   appeared wholly unacceptable even to the Pneumatomachians. [223]

   For this very reason it is certainly out of the question to regard the
   Creed as the Creed of the Council of 381. It did indeed assert the
   complete Homousia of the divine Persons. But the legendary process in
   the Church which attached this Creed to that Council performed a
   remarkable act of justice; for in tracing back to this Council "an
   enlarged Nicene Creed" without the "ek tes ousias tou patros", "of the
   substance of the Father", without the Nicene anathemas, and without the
   avowal of the Homousia of the Spirit, and in attesting it as orthodox,
   it, without wishing to do so, preserved the recollection of the fact
   that the Eastern orthodoxy of 381 had really been a neo-orthodoxy,
   which in its use of the word Homoousios did not represent the dogmatic
   conviction of Athanasius. In the quid pro quo involved in this
   substitution of one Creed for another, we have a judicial sentence
   which could not conceivably have been more discriminating; but it
   involves still more than that--namely, the most cruel satire. From the
   fact that in the Church the Creed of Constantinople gradually came to
   be accepted as a perfect expression of orthodoxy, and was spoken of as
   the Nicene Creed while the latter was forgotten, it follows that the
   great difference which existed between the old Faith and the
   Cappadocian neo-orthodoxy was no longer understood, and that under
   cover of the Homoousios a sort of Homoiousianism had in general been
   reached, the view which has really been the orthodox one in all
   Churches until this day. The father of the official doctrine of the
   Trinity in the form in which the Churches have held to it, was not
   Athanasius, nor Basil of Cæsarea, but Basil of Ancyra.

   All the same, the thought of the great Athanasius, though in a
   considerably altered form, had triumphed. Science and the revolution
   which took place in the political world had paved the way for its
   victory; suppressed, it certainly never could have been.

   The Westerns were anything but pleased in the first instance with the
   course things had taken in the East. At Councils held at the same time
   in Rome and Milan, in the latter place under the presidency of Ambrose,
   they had made representations to Theodosius and had even threatened him
   with a withdrawal of Church privileges. [224] But Theodosius answered
   them in a very ungracious manner, whereupon they sought to justify
   their attitude. [225] The Emperor was prudent enough not to fall in
   with the proposal of the Westerns that an ecumenical Council should be
   summoned to meet at Rome. He followed the policy of Constantius also in
   keeping the Churches of the two halves of the Empire separate, as his
   choice of Rimini and Seleucia proves. And by his masterly conduct of
   affairs he actually succeeded in introducing a modus vivendi in the
   year 382, spite of the attempts made to thwart him by his colleague
   Gratian who was led by Ambrose. Gratian summoned a General Council to
   meet at Rome, to which the Eastern bishops were also invited. But
   Theodosius had already got them together in Constantinople. They
   accordingly replied in a letter in which they declined the invitation,
   and its tone which was as praise-worthy as it was prudent, helped in
   all probability to lessen the tension between the East and the West.
   They appealed, besides, not only to the decisions of the Council of
   381, but also to their resolution of 378 in which they had made
   advances to the West, [226] and they explained finally that they had
   adopted a recent detailed dogmatic declaration of the Western bishops,
   of Damasus that is, and were ready to recognise the Paulinists in
   Antioch as orthodox, which meant that they no longer suspected them of
   Marcellianism. [227] The despatch of three envoys to Rome where,
   besides Jerome, the distinguished Epiphanius happened to be just at
   this time, could not but help towards the conclusion of a treaty of
   peace. The opposition to Nectarius of Constantinople and Cyril of
   Jerusalem was now allowed to drop in Rome; but the Western bishops
   could not yet bring themselves to acknowledge Flavian in Antioch, and,
   moreover, Paulinus, his opponent, was himself present at the Council in
   Rome. There was once more a strong reaction against Apollinarianism.
   [228]

   If Arianism, or Homceism, from the time when it ceased to enjoy the
   imperial favour tended rapidly to disappear in the Empire, if too it
   had no fanatic as Donatism had, it was nevertheless still a power in
   the East in 383; large provinces had still Arian tendencies, the common
   people [229] in them above all; while in the West it had supporters
   [230] in the Empress Justinia and her son. Theodosius was more
   concerned to win over the Arians than to drive them out of the Church.
   In the first years of his reign while shewing a firm determination to
   establish orthodoxy, he had at the same time followed a sort of
   conciliatory policy which, however, to the honour of the Arians be it
   said, did not succeed. lust as in 381 he invited the Macedonians to the
   Council, so in the year 383 he made a further attempt to unite all the
   opposing parties at a Constantinopolitan Council and if possible to
   bring about concord. The attempt was sincere--even Eunomius was
   present--but it failed; but it is very memorable for two reasons: (1)
   the orthodox bishop of Constantinople made common cause on this
   occasion with the Novatian bishop, a proof of how insecure the position
   of orthodoxy in the capital itself still was; [231] (2) an attempt was
   made at the Council to transfer the whole question in dispute between
   orthodox and Arians into the region of tradition. The Holy Scriptures
   were to be dispensed with, and the proof of the truth of orthodoxy was
   to be furnished solely by the testimony of the ante-Nicene Fathers to
   whose authority the opposite party must as good Catholics bow. This
   undertaking was a prophecy of the ominous future which was before the
   Church, and proved at the same time that the actual interest in the
   controversy in the East had already once more taken a secondary place
   compared with the conservative interest. Nothing grows faster than
   tradition, and nothing is more convenient when the truth of a
   proposition has to be defended than to fall back on the contention that
   it has always been so. [232]

   After this Council Theodosius discontinued his efforts in favour of
   union and from this time sought to suppress Arianism. Ambrose seconded
   his plans in Upper Italy. The orthodox State-Church, which was,
   however, on the other hand, a Church-State, was established. Severe
   laws were now passed against all heretics with the exception of the
   Novatians. [233] The State had at last secured that unity of the Church
   which Constantine had already striven after. But it was a two-edged
   sword. It injured the State and dealt it a most dangerous wound.
   Amongst the Greeks Arianism died out more quickly than Hellenism.
   Violent schisms amongst the Arians themselves seem to have accelerated
   its downfall, [234] but the different stages are unknown to us. The
   history of its fortunes amongst the German peoples until the seventh
   century does not fall within the scope of this work. The educated
   laity, however, in the East regarded the orthodox formula rather as a
   necessary evil and as an unexplainable mystery than as an expression of
   their Faith. The victory of the Nicene Creed was a victory of the
   priests over the faith of the Christian people. The Logos-doctrine had
   already become unintelligible to those who were not theologians. The
   setting up of the Nicene-Cappadocian formula as the fundamental
   Confession of the Church made it perfectly impossible for the Catholic
   laity to get an inner comprehension of the Christian Faith taking as
   their guide the form in which it was presented in the doctrine of the
   Church. The thought that Christianity is the revelation of something
   incomprehensible became more and more a familiar one to men's minds.
   This thought has for its obverse side the adoration of the mystery,
   [235] and for its reverse side indifference and subjection to
   mystagogues. [236] The priests and theologians could certainly not give
   the people more than they possessed themselves; but it is alarming to
   note in the ecclesiastical literature of the Fourth Century and the
   period following how little attention is given to the Christian people.
   The theologians had always the clergy. the officials, good society in
   their minds. The people must simply believe the Faith; they accordingly
   did not live in this Faith, but in that Christianity of the second rank
   which is represented in the legends of the saints, in apocalypses, in
   image-worship, in the veneration of angels and martyrs, in crosses and
   amulets, in the Mass regarded as magical worship, and in sacramental
   observances of all sorts. Christ as the homoousios became a dogmatic
   form of words; and in place of this the bones of the martyrs became
   living saints, and the shades of the old dethroned gods together with
   their worship, revived once more.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [185] The dogmatic dissertation of the Homoiousians in Epiphan. 73,
   12-22, is of the highest importance; for it shews in more than one
   respect a dogmatic advance: (1) the differentiation of the conceptions
   ousia, hupostasis, prosopon begins here. The first of these is used in
   order to express the idea of the essence or substance which imprints
   itself in the form of a definite quality; accordingly the action of the
   Fathers who in protesting against Paul of Samosata attributed a special
   ousia to the Son, is by an explanation excused. They did this in order
   to do away with the idea that the Logos is a mere rhema, a lektike
   energeia. The proper expression, however, is hupostasis. It is because
   the Logos is an hupostasis, i.e., because he does not, like the other
   words of God, lack being, that the Fathers called ten hupostasin ousian
   (c. 12). The akribeia tes ton prosopon epignoseos must be strictly
   maintained as against Sabellius (c. 14); but no one is to be led astray
   by the word hupostaseis (Pl.); it does not mean that there are two or
   three Gods: dia touto gar hupostaseis hoi anatolikoi legousin, hina tas
   idiotetas ton prosopon huphestosas kai huparchousas gnorisosin. The
   word "Hypostasis" is thus merely meant to give the word prosopon a
   definite meaning, implying that it is to be taken as signifying
   independently existing manifestations (c. 16), while ousia is in the
   tractate interchangeable with phusis or pneuma, and is thus still used
   only in the singular; (2) quite as much attention is already given to
   the Holy Ghost as to the Son, and the tropoi huparxeos are developed,
   i.e., an actual doctrine of the Trinity independent of any ideas about
   the world, is constructed (c. 16): Ei gar pneuma ho pater, pneuma kai
   ho huios, pneuma kai to hagion pneuma, ou noeitai pater ho huios;
   huphesteke de kai to pneuma, ho ou noeitai huios, ho kai ouk esti . . .
   Tas idiotetas prosopon huphestoton hupostaseis onomazousin hoi
   anatolikoi, ouchi tas treis hupostaseis treis archas e treis theous
   legontes . . . Homologousi gar mian einai theoteta . . . homos ta
   prosopa en tais idiotesi ton hupostaseon eusebos gnorizousi, ton patera
   en te patrike authentia huphestota noountes, kai ton huiou meros onta

   huphestota homologountes, kai to pneuma to hagion, ho he theia graphe
   parakleton onomazei, ek patros di' huiou huphestota gnorizontes . . .
   Oukoun en pneumati hagio huion axios nooumen, en huio de monogenei
   patera eusebos kai axios doxazomen, (3) the Christological problem
   based on Philipp. II. 6 and Rom. VIII. 3 (homoioma) is already
   introduced for the elucidation of the Trinitarian: apo tou somatikou
   eusebos kai ten peri tou homoiou ennoian hemas kai epi tou asomatou
   patros te kai huiou didachthenai (c. 17, 18). As Christ's flesh is
   identical with human flesh, but is, on the other hand, on account of
   its wonderful origin only homoios, kata ton homoion tropon kai ho huios
   pneuma on kai ek tou tatros pneuma gennetheis, kata men to pneuma ek
   pneumatos einai to auto estin, kata de to aneu aporroias kai pathous
   kai merismou ek tou patros gennethenai homoios esti to patri.
   Accordingly we have now the decisive statement: Oukoun dia tes pros
   philippesious epistoles edidaxen hemas pos he hupostasis tou huiou
   homoia esti te hupostasei tou patros; pneuma gar ek patros. Kai kata
   men ten tou pneumatos ennoian (and therefore thought of in essence as a
   generic conception) tauton, hos kata ten tes sarkos ennoian tauton. Ou
   tauton de alla homoion, dioti to pneuma, ho estin ho huios, ouk estin
   ho pater, kai he sarx, hen ho logos anebalen, ouk estin ek spermatos
   kai hedones, all' houtos hos to euangelion hemas edidaxen . . . ho
   pater pneuma on authentikos poiei, ho de huios pneuma on ouk
   authentikos poiei hos ho pater all' homoios. Oukoun katha men sarx kai
   sarx tauton, hosper katho pneuma kai pneuma tauton. katho de aneu
   sporas ou tauton all' homoion, hosper katho aneu aporroias kai pathous
   ho huios ou tauton all' homoion. Thus these Homoiousians already admit
   the tauton if they also reject the tautoousios (= homoousios, i.e.,
   Father and Son are tauton as regards substance, in so far as they are
   both pneuma, but in so far as they are different Hypostases they are
   not identical, but of like nature. (4) These Homoiousians have
   expressly rejected the designations agennetos for God and gennetos for
   the Son, and indeed not only because they are unbiblical, but because
   "Father" includes much more than "Unbegotten", and because "gennetos"
   includes much less than "Son", and further because the conjunction
   "unbegotten--begotten" does not express the relation of reciprocity
   between Father and Son (the gnesios gegennemeno), which is emphasised
   as being the most important (c. 14, 19): dio kan patera monon
   onomazomen, echomen to onomati tou patros sunupakouomenen ten ennoian
   tou huiou, pater gar huiou pater legetai; kan huion monon onomasomen,
   echomen ten ennoian tou patros, hoti huios patros legetai. Whoever
   names the one names the other at the same time, and yet does not posit
   him merely in accordance with his name, but with his name kai tes
   phuseos oikeioteta; on the other hand, agenneton ou legetai gennetou
   agenneton, oude genneton agennetou genneton. Athanasius could scarcely
   wish more than this, or rather: we have already here the main outlines
   of the theology of the three Cappadocians, and it is not accidental
   that Basil of Ancyra is himself a Cappadocian.

   [186] The work of Athanasius, de synodis, written in the year 359, is
   of the highest importance for the history of the Arian controversy. It
   is distinguished as much by the firmness with which his position is
   maintained--for Athanasius did not yield in any point--as by its
   moderation and wisdom. The great bishop succeeded in combining these
   qualities in his book, because he was not concerned with the formula
   itself, but solely with the thought which in his view the formula
   attacked best expressed. We must, he said, speak like brethren to
   brethren to the Eomoiousians who hold almost the same view as the
   Nicæans and are merely suspicious about a word. Whoever grants that the
   Son is in nature of like quality with the Father and springs from the
   substance of the Father is not far from the homoousios; for this is a
   combination of ek tes ousias and homoiousios (c. 41 ff.). While
   expressly making an apology to Basil of Ancyra, he endeavours to remove
   the stumbling-blocks presented by homoousios, but seeks at the same
   time to shew that homoiousios either involves an absurdity or is
   dogmatically incorrect (c. 53 f.).

   [187] The most important source of information for the Synod of
   Alexandria is the Tomus of Athanas. ad Antioch., and in addition Rufin.
   X. 27-29, Socr. III. 7, Athan. ep. ad Rufinian. I need not here (after
   the work published by Revillout) enter upon any discussion of the
   suntagma didaskalias of the Synod, which is identical with Opp.
   Athanas. ed. Migne XXVIII., p. 836 sq.; cf. Eichhorn, Athan., de vita
   ascet. testim., 1886, p. 15 sq. On the Synod cf. also Gregor. Naz.
   Orat. 21, 35.

   [188] Tom. ad Antioch. 5. 6. This was probably the largest concession
   which Athanasius ever made. When Socrates affirms that at the Synod the
   employment of "Ousia" and "Hypostasis" in reference to the Godhead was
   forbidden, his statement is not entirely incorrect; for it is evident
   from the Tomus that the Synod did actually disapprove of the use of the
   terms in this way.

   [189] This is sufficiently shewn in the Tomus; the Lucifer schism has
   its root here; see Krüger, op. cit., pp. 43-54. Lucifer was, moreover,
   not a man of sufficient education to appreciate the real question at
   issue. He did not wish to have the venia ex poenitentia accorded to the
   Semi-Arians who were passing over to orthodoxy. It was thus a
   Novatian-Donatist element which determined his position.

   [190] See above, p. 68, and the Tom. c. 5. init. These bishops thus
   demanded the acknowledgment of the mia hupustasis. The West never at
   bottom abandoned this demand, but in the Meletian-Antiochian schism it,
   however, finally got the worst of it and had to acquiesce in the
   Eastern doctrinal innovation. That at the Synod of Alexandria, however,
   the Homoiousians also attempted to get their catchword, or, their
   interpretation of the homoousios, adopted, is evident from the letter
   of Apollinaris to Basil; see Dräseke Ztschr. f. K.G., VIII., p. 118 f.

   [191] Just as it is to Zahn that, speaking generally, we primarily owe
   the understanding of the original meaning of Homoousios, so it is he
   too who, so far as I know, first plainly noticed this complete change.
   (Marcell, p. 87 f., also Gwatkin, p. 242 sq.)

   [192] This is specially evident from the letter of Basil to Apollinaris
   (in Dräseke, op. cit. 96 ff.) of the year 361. Basil communicates to
   the great teacher (of whom later) his doubts as to whether it is
   justifiable to use the word homoousios. For biblical and philosophical
   dogmatic reasons he is inclined to prefer the formula aparallaktos
   homoios kat' ousian. Apollinaris accordingly explains to him (p. 112
   ff.) that the homoousios is more correct, but his own explanation of
   the word is no longer identical with that of Athanasius. He finds both
   expressed in it, the tautotes as well as the heterotes, and according
   to his idea the Son is related to the Father as men are to Adam. Just
   as it may be said of all men, they are Adam, they were in Adam, and
   just as there is only one Adam, so too is it with the Godhead. Basil at
   any rate started from Homoiousianism, and it is because this has not
   been taken into consideration that the letter in question has been
   pronounced not genuine. For the rest, the efforts of the Benedictines
   in the third volume of their edition of the Opp. Basil. (Præf.) to
   vindicate Basil's orthodoxy shew that, leaving this letter out of
   account, his perfect soundness in the faith is not--in all his
   utterances--beyond doubt. Later on Basil understood the homoousios
   exactly in the sense given to it by him in the letter to Apollinaris
   and which at that time made him hesitate to use it; see Krüger, p. 42
   f. See further the characteristic statements made at an earlier date in
   ep. 8. 9: ho kat' ousian Theos to kat' ousian Theo homoousios!

   [193] Basil has frequently so expressed himself as to suggest that he
   regarded the idea of the generic unity of Father and Son as sufficient
   (see, e.g., ep. 38, 2). Zahn (p. 87): "the ousia with Basil designates
   the koinon, the hupostasis the idion (ep. 114, 4). He is never tired of
   holding forth on the difference between the two expressions, and goes
   so far as to assert that the Nicene Fathers were well aware of this
   difference, since they would surely not have put the two words side by
   side without some purpose (ep. 125)." It is interesting to note that
   already at the Council of Antioch in 363 it had been explained that ou
   kata tina chresin Helleniken lambanetai tois patrasi to onoma tes
   ousias. Assuredly not! It was a terminology which was expressly
   invented.

   [194] And yet in Gregory of Nyssa the persons appear also as
   sumbebekota (accidents).

   [195] See the treatises of Gregor. Nyss. peri diaphoras ousias kai
   hupostaseos--peri tou oiesthai legein Theous--pros Hellenas ek ton
   koinon ennoion. "Prosopon" is no longer for Gregory a technical term in
   the strict sense of the word, but on the other hand he also avoids the
   expression "three atoma". The word phusis maintained itself alongside
   of ousia, and in the same way idiotes was used along with hupostasis.
   The God who was common to the Three was supposed to be a real
   substance, not, however, a fourth alongside of the Three, but on the
   contrary the unity itself! On the characteristics of the Hypostases,
   see Gregor. Naz. Orat. 25. 16: Koinon to me gegonenai kai he theotes.
   Idion de patros men he agennesia, huiou de he gennesis, pneumatos de he
   ekpempsis. The two others expressed their views in almost similar terms
   in their works against Eunomius, unless that Gregory of Nyssa alone put
   the doctrine of the Holy Ghost in a logically developed form (see
   below), while as regards it, Basil (see de spir. s. ad Amphiloch.)
   advanced least of them all. The pronounced attitude taken up by them
   all, especially by Basil, against Marcellus, is characteristic. The
   theological orations of Gregory of Nazianzus (Orat. 27-31) may, more
   than anything else, have spread the doctrinal system far and wide. (It
   is important to note that in opposition to it Athanasius in his letter
   ad Afros. [c. 369] expressly said that hupostasis and ousia were to be
   used as identical in meaning.) It follows from Orat. 31 (33) that
   Gregory did not wish to apply the number one to the Godhead; a unity
   was for him only the kinesis and phusis (mian phusin en trisin
   idiotesi, noerais teleiais, kath' heautas huphestosais, arithmo
   diairetais kai ou diairetais theoteti). So too he was doubtful about,
   the suitability of the old image, "source, stream", for the Trinity,
   not only because it represents the Godhead as something changeable,
   something flowing, but also because it gave the appearance of a
   numerical unity to the Godhead. He is equally unwilling, and in fact
   for the same reasons, to sanction the use of the old comparison of sun,
   beam, and brightness. He is always in a fighting attitude towards
   "Sabellianism". The doctrine of the one God is to him Jewish--that is
   the new discovery. "We do not acknowledge a Jewish, narrow, jealous,
   weak Godhead" (Orat. 25. 16). Gregory had, moreover, already begun
   those odd speculations about the immanent substance of God which,
   though they are mere bubble-blowing, are still highly thought of. The
   divine loftiness, according to him, shews itself in this, that in His
   immanent life also God is a fruitful principle; the life of the
   creature has its vital manifestation in the tension of dualities, but
   it is in this opposition that its imperfection also consists; the
   Trinity is the "sublation", or abrogation of the duality, living
   movement and at the same time rest, and not in any way a sublimation
   into multiplicity. The Orat. 23 in particular is full of thoughts of
   this sort, see c. 8: triada teleian ek teleion trion, monados men
   kinetheises dia to plousion, duados de huperbatheises, huper gar ten
   hulen kai to eidos, ex hon ta somata, triados de horistheises dia to
   teleion, prote gar huperbainei duados sunthesin, hina mete stene mene
   he theotes mete eis apeiron cheetai; to men gar aphilotimon, to de
   atakton, kai to men Ioudaikon pantelos, to de Hellenikon kai polutheon.

   [196] Gregor. Nyss., ek ton koinon ennoion T. II. p. 85; hen kai to
   auto prosopon tou patros, ex hou ho huios gennatai kai to pneuma to
   hagion ekporeuetai, dio kai kurios ton hena aition onta ton autou
   aitiaton hena Theon phamen..

   [197] It is here that we have the root of the difference between
   Athanasius and Gregory.

   [198] From this time this once more became the fashion amongst the
   scientific orthodox. The confession of Socrates (VII. 6) is very
   characteristic. He cannot understand how the two Arian Presbyters,
   Timotheus and Georgius can remain Arians and yet study Plato and Origen
   so industriously and esteem them so highly oude gar Platon to deuteron
   kai to triton aition, hos autos onomazein eiothen, archen huparxeos
   eiliphenai phesi, kai Origenes sunaidion pantachou homologei ton huion
   to patri. It is instructive further to note how Philostorgius too (in
   Suidas) asserts that in the matter of the vindication of the homoousios
   Athanasius was deemed a boy in comparison with the Cappadocians and
   Apollinaris.

   [199] See the Philocalia.

   [200] This is one of the strongest impressions we carry away from a
   reading of the works against Eunomius.

   [201] This aspect of the activity of the Cappadocians cannot be too
   highly valued. But in this respect too, though in quite a new fashion,
   they took up the work of Athanasius. The dominant party on the contrary
   were supported by an Emperor (Valens) who no doubt for good reasons
   persecuted monarchism. (See the law in the Cod. Theodos. XII. 1, 63 of
   the year 365.) The aversion of the Homoeans to monasticism is evident
   from the App. Const. Basil's journey to Egypt was epoch-making. The
   relation in which he stood to Eustathius of Sebaste, the ascetic and
   Semi-Arian, is also of great importance.

   [202] For the sake of peace and in order to secure the main thing,
   Athanasius at the Synod of Alexandria, which may be called a
   continuation of the Synod of Ancyra, himself concluded the alliance
   with the new Oriental orthodoxy and acknowledged Meletius. But his
   procedure later on in the Antiochian schism (see Basil., ep. 89, 2),
   the close relation in which he stood throughout to Rome as contrasted
   with the East, the signal reserve he exhibited towards Basil (Basil.
   ep. 66, 69), and finally the view he took of the Marcellian Controversy
   which was still going on--Basil saw in Marcellus a declared Sabellian
   heretic, while the judgment passed on him and his following by
   Athanasius was essentially different--prove that he never came to have
   a satisfying confidence in the neo-orthodox Niceans who were associated
   with Meletius; see on this Zahn, pp. 83 ff., 88 ff., Rade; Damasus, p.
   81 ff.

   [203] See the art. "Meletius" in Herzog's R.-Encykl. IX., p. 530 f. and
   the discussion by Rade, op. cit., p. 74 ff. The Westerns had the same
   kind of feeling in reference to the opponent of Meletius in Antioch,
   Paulinus, as they formerly had in reference to Athanasius; he alone was
   for them orthodox; but they did not succeed in getting their view
   adopted. Heron. ep. 15. 16 shews what scruples the formula, treis
   hupostaseis, gave rise to in the minds of the Westerns.

   [204] Julian, spite of his aversion to all Christians, seems
   nevertheless to have been somewhat more favourably disposed towards
   Arianism than towards orthodoxy, i.e., than to Athanasius, who,
   moreover, incurred his suspicions on political grounds.

   [205] See his letter to Jovian in the Opp. and in Theodoret. IV. 3.
   Here the matter is so represented as to suggest that there were now
   only a few Arian Churches in the East. The attack on those who do
   indeed accept the homoousios, but give it a false interpretation, is
   worthy of note.

   [206] See the Synodical epistle in Socrat. III. 25, Mansi III., p. 369.

   [207] Socrat. IV. 2 sq. 12, Sozom. VI, 7 sq. In the following decade
   the view of Eudoxius of Constantinople was the authoritative one.

   [208] The Altercatio Heracliani et Germinii is instructive see Caspari,
   Kirchenhist. Anecdota, 1883.

   [209] Cappadocia was the native land of the new orthodoxy; see the
   Cappadocian self-consciousness of Gregor. Naz.; up till this time,
   however, it had been the principal seat of Arianism.

   [210] Socrat. IV. 12.

   [211] Sozom. VI. 12.

   [212] He was at the same time the patriarch of the diocese of Pontus.

   [213] It was Athanasius who roused Damasus to take up an attitude of
   energetic opposition to the Arian Bishop Auxentius of Milan, and thus,
   speaking generally, led him to follow in the track of Bishop Julius;
   see Athan. ep. ad Afros. It was at the Roman Council of 369 that the
   Western episcopate first formally and solemnly renounced the resolution
   of Rimini. On the text of the epistle of this Council, see Rade, p. 52
   ff. Auxentius of Milan was condemned; but this sentence was a futile
   one since the Court protected him. No mention was yet made at this
   Council of the difficulties of the East. The years from 371 to 380 are
   the epochs during which the new-fashioned orthodoxy of the East, under
   the leadership of Basil and Meletius, attempted to induce the West to
   bring its influence to bear on Valens and the Homoean-Arian party, by
   means of an imposing manifesto, and thus to strengthen orthodoxy in the
   East, but at the same time to pronounce in favour of the
   Homoiousian-Homoousian doctrine and to put the orthodox Niceans in the
   wrong. These attempts were not successful; for Damasus in close league,
   first with Athanasius, then after his death (373), with his successor
   Peter, was extremely reserved, and in the first instance either did not
   interfere at all or interfered in favour of the old Niceans, of
   Paulinus that is, at Antioch. (This Peter, like Athanasius before him,
   had fled to Rome, and the alliance of Rome with Alexandria was part of
   the traditional policy of the Roman bishop from the clays of Fabian to
   the middle of the fifth century.) The numerous letters and embassies
   which came from the East of which Basil was throughout the soul, shew
   what trouble was taken about the matter there. But the letters of Basil
   did not please the "akribesteroi" in Rome; at first, indeed,
   intercourse with the East was carried on only through the medium of
   Alexandria, and on one occasion Basil had his letter simply returned to
   him. He complained that at Rome they were friendly with everybody who
   brought an orthodox confession and did not mind anything else. He
   referred to the friendship shewn towards those who were inclined to the
   views of Marcellus, further to the friendly intercourse of the Roman
   bishop with Paulinus, who was always suspected of Sabellianism by
   Basil, and to the occasional recognition of an Apollinarian. In letter
   214 Basil brought the charge of Sabellianism against the entire
   Homoousian doctrine in its older form. It was in the year 376 that the
   West first promised help to the East. (The decretals of Damasus = 1
   Fragment of the letter of Damasus designated by Constant as ep. 4.)
   Basil now (ep. 263) pleads for active interference--where possible an
   imposing Council--against the heretics who are heretics under cover of
   the Nicene Creed, and he designates as such the Macedonian Eustathius
   of Sebaste, Apollinaris and Paulinus, i.e., the man who taught pretty
   much the same doctrine as Athanasius; according to Basil, however, he
   is a Marcellian. The accusations against Paulinus were naturally
   received with anything but favour in the West. Peter of Alexandria who
   was still in Rome at the time, called Meletius, Basil's honoured
   friend, simply an Arian. A Synod was nevertheless held in Rome at which
   Apollinarianism was for the first time rejected (377); to it we owe the
   pieces 2 and 3 in the ep. Damasi, 4 ed. Constant. Basil died in January
   379. He did not attain the aim of all his work, which was to unite the
   orthodoxy of the East and the West on the basis of the Homoiousian
   interpretation of the Homousios. But soon after his death, in September
   379, Meletius held a synod in Antioch, and this synod subscribed all
   the manifestoes of the Romans, i.e., of the West, issued during the
   previous years 369, 376, 377, and thus simply submitted to the will of
   the West in dogmaticis, and despatched to Rome the Acts which contained
   the concessions. The triumph of the old-orthodox interpretation of the
   Nicene Creed thus seemed perfect. The West, under the guidance of
   Ambrose, from this time forth recognised the Meletians also as
   orthodox. It was from there (see the Synod of Aquileia 380, under
   Ambrosius) that the proposal emanated that if one of the two
   anti-bishops in Antioch should die, no successor should be chosen, and
   thus the schism would be healed. The fact that the Meletians thus came
   round to the orthodox standpoint is explicable only when we consider
   the complete changes which had taken place in the political situation
   since the death of Valens. On the involved state of things in the years
   from 369 to 378 see the letters of Basil, 70, 89-92, 129, 138, 214,
   215, 239, 242, 243, 253-256, 263, 265, 266. It was the investigation of
   the matter by Rade, op. cit. pp. 70-121, which first threw light on
   this. On Damasus and Peter of Alex. see Socrat. IV. 37, Sozom. VI. 39,
   Theod. IV. 22. All were agreed in holding Athanasius in high respect.
   It was this that kept the combatants together. Gregory begins his
   panegyric (Orat. 21) with the words: Athanasion epainon areten
   epainesomai, and in saying this he said what everybody thought.

   [218] With the exception of Egypt most of the Churches in the East were
   at this time in the hands of the Arians.

   [219] The relations which existed in the years 378-381 between the East
   and the West (Alexander was closely allied with the latter) are
   complicated and obscure. Their nature was still in all essential
   respects determined by the continuance of the schism in Antioch. The
   following is certain (1) Theodosius, as soon as he came to perceive the
   true state of things in the East, had ranged himself on the side of the
   orthodox there; he wished to suppress Arianism not by the aid of the
   West and of the Alexandrian bishop Peter who was closely allied with
   Rome and who had already acted as if he were the supreme Patriarch of
   the Greek Church, but by the orthodox powers of the East itself. The
   proof of this is (1) that he transferred in a body to Meletius the
   Arian Churches in Antioch Paulinus was shelved; (2) that in the Edict
   (Cod. Theodos. XVI. 1, 3) he does not mention Damasus, but on the
   contrary enumerates the orthodox of the East as authorities (July 30th,
   381) and this Gwatkin, p. 262, rightly terms an "amended definition of
   orthodoxy"; (3) that he refused to accede to the repeated and urgent
   demands of the Westerns who wished him to settle impartially the
   dispute at Antioch with due respect to the superior claims of Paulinus,
   and also refused their request for the summoning of an Ecumenical
   Council at Alexandria; (4) that he summoned an Eastern Council to meet
   at Constantinople without troubling himself in the slightest about the
   West, Rome and Alexandria, made Meletius president of it, heaped
   honours upon him, and sanctioned the choice of a successor after his
   death, and this in spite of the advice of the Westerns that the whole
   Antiochian Church should now be handed over to Paulinus, an advice
   which had the support of Gregory of Nazianzus himself. Nor can there be
   any doubt in view of the manner in which the Council was summoned to
   meet, that its original intention was to draw up a formula of agreement
   with the Macedonians. It is certain (II.) that the orthodox Fathers who
   assembled at Constantinople gladly recognised and availed themselves of
   the opportunity thus presented of freeing themselves from the tutelage
   of Alexandria and the West, and of recalling by a distinct act the
   concessions which they had made under compulsion two years previously
   at Antioch. "It is in the East that the sun first rises, it was
   starting from the East that the God who came in the flesh flashed upon
   the world." By their united attitude, their choice of Flavian as the
   successor of Meletius, who had died during the Council, by passing the
   third Canon--on the importance of the chair of Constantinople--and by
   their rejection of Maximus who was proposed for the chair of
   Constantinople by Alexandria and patronised by Rome and the West, they
   inflicted the severest possible defeat on Alexandria and the West, and
   specially on the policy of Peter and Damasus. It is certain (III.)
   finally, that shortly before the Council of Constantinople, during the
   Council, and immediately after it rose, the relations between the
   Egyptians and Westerns and the East were of the most strained
   character, and that a breach was imminent. (See the letter in Mansi
   III., p. 631.)

   [220] The choice of him as president (on this and on the general
   procedure of the Council see his Carmen de vita sua) was not any more
   than that of Meletius approved of by Alexandria and Rome. His support
   of Paulinus may find its explanation in the fact that he aimed at
   getting into the good graces of Rome after he had himself attained the
   Patriarchate. Gregory had a Tasso-like nature. Quite incapable of
   effecting anything in the sphere of Church government or politics, he
   did not really desire office; but he wished to have the honour and
   distinction which are connected with office. So long as he did not have
   office he was ambitious, when he had it he threw it away.

   [221] The Egyptians even went the length of separating themselves from
   the majority at the Council; they did not approve of the decisions come
   to by the neo-orthodox; see Theodoret V. 8.

   [222] The Egyptian bishops felt it to be intolerable that the
   Cappadocian and not their man, Maximus, should get the position of
   Patriarch in Constantinople The resignation of Gregory of Nazianzus was
   the price demanded by the Egyptians for yielding; see Gregory's
   farewell address to the Council, Orat. 42. The Canons 1-4 of the
   Council--for these only are in all probability genuine, while those
   which follow belong to the Council of 382--are strongly
   anti-Alexandrian and are intended to bring down the claims of the
   Alexandrian which were already pitched high Canon 3 is directed not so
   much against Rome as against Alexandria (Ton mentoi Konstantinoupoleos
   episkopon echein ta presbeia tes times meta ton tes Rhomes episkopon,
   dia to einai auten nean Rhomen). Canon 2 is intended to put a stop to
   the attempt of the Bishop of Alexandria to rule other Eastern Churches.
   But this very Canon plainly proves (cf. the sixth Canon of Nice) that
   as a matter of fact the Bishop of Alexandria had a position in the East
   which was wholly different from that of the other bishops. He only is
   mentioned in the singular number--ton men Alexandreias episkopon . . .
   tous de tes Anatoles episkopous . . , phulattomenon ton presbeion te
   Antiocheon ekklesia . . , tous tes Asianes dioikeseos episkopous . . .
   tous tes Pontikes . . . tous tes Thrakikes. The peculiar position of
   the Alexandrian bishop which the latter wished to develop into a
   position of primacy, was chiefly due to three causes. (It is quite
   clear that Athanasius and Peter wished so to develop it, and perhaps
   even Dionysius the Great; the intention of the Alexandrian scheme to
   place Maximus on the episcopal seat of Constantinople, was to secure a
   preponderating influence upon the capital and the imperial Church by
   the aid of this creature of Alexandria.) These three causes were as
   follows; (1) Alexandria was the second city of the Empire and was
   recognised as such in the Church also at least as early as the middle
   of the third century; see, e.g., the conciliar epistle of the great
   Council of Antioch of the year 268, addressed "to the bishops of Rome
   and Alexandria and to all Catholic churches." (Alexandria ranks as the
   second, Antioch as the third city of the Empire in Josephus, de Bello
   Jud. 4, 11, 5, cf. the chronograph of the year 354, Stryzygowski,
   Jahrb. d. k. deutschen archäol. Instituts. Supplementary vol., 1888,
   I., die Kalenderbilder des Chronographen v. j. 354, p. 24 f. The
   chronograph gives the series thus, Rome, Alexandria, Constantinople,
   Trèves. Lumbroso, L'Egitto dei Greci e dei Romani, 1882, p. 86, proves
   that all the authors of the first to the third centuries agree in
   giving the first place after Rome to Alexandria, see, e.g., Dio
   Chrysostomus, Orat. 32, I, p. 412: he gar polis humon to megethei kai
   to topo pleiston hoson diapherei kai periphanos apodedeiktai deutera
   ton hupo ton helion. In the "ordo urbium nobilium" of Ausonius we have
   for the first time the cities given in the following order: Rome,
   Constantinople, Carthage, Antioch, Alexandria, Trèves. So long as
   Alexandria was the second city in the Empire, it was the first city in
   the East. (2) Alexandria had this in common with Rome, that it had no
   cities in its diocese which were of importance in any way. The bishop
   of Alexandria was always the bishop of Egypt (Libya and Pentapolis), as
   the bishop of Rome was always the bishop of Italy. The case was quite
   otherwise with Antioch and Ephesus; they always had important
   episcopates alongside of them. (3) The lead in the great Arian
   controversy had fallen to the Bishop of Alexandria; he had shewn
   himself equal to this task and in this way had come to be the most
   powerful ecclesiastic in the East. The hints which I have given as to
   the policy of the Alexandrian Patriarch here and in Chap. III. 2, have
   been further developed in an instructive fashion by Rohrbach (die
   Patriarchen von Alexandrien) in the Preuss. Jahrb. Vol. 69, Parts I and
   2.

   [223] On the Creed of Constantinople see my article in Herzog's
   R.-Encyklop. VIII., pp. 212-230, which summarises the works of Caspari
   and particularly of Hort, and carries the argument further. The
   following facts are certain. (1) The Council of 381 did not set up any
   new creed, but simply avowed anew its adherence to the Nicene Creed
   (Socrat. V. 8, Sozom. VII. 7, 9, Theodoret V. 8, Greg. Naz. ep. 102
   [Orat. 52] the testimony of the Latin and Constantinople Councils of
   382). (2) If we take the years from 381 to 450, we do not find in any
   Synodal Act, Church Father, or heterodox theologians during that period
   any certain trace whatsoever of the existence of the Creed of
   Constantinople, much less any proof that it was used then as the Creed
   of Constantinople or as the official Baptismal Creed; it is
   simultaneously with the recognition of the Council of 381 as an
   ecumenical Council--about 451 in the East, in the West fifty years
   later--that the Creed in question, which now emerges, is first
   described as the Creed of Constantinople. (3) It did not, however, then
   first come into existence, but is on the contrary much older; it is
   found already in the Ancoratus of Epiphanius which belongs to the year
   374, and there is no reason for holding that it is an interpolation
   here; on the contrary (4) the internal evidence goes to shew that it is
   a Nicene redaction of the Baptismal Creed of Jerusalem composed soon
   after 362. The Creed is thus not any extension of the Nicene Creed, but
   rather belongs to that great series of Creeds which sprang up after the
   Council of Alexandria (362) in the second creed-making epoch of the
   Eastern Churches. At that time the opponents of Arianism in the East,
   now grown stronger, resolved to give expression to the Nicene doctrine
   in connection with the solemn rite of baptism. It was possible to do
   this in three different ways, that is to say either by embodying the
   Nicene catchwords in the old provincial church creeds, by enlarging the
   Nicene Creed for the special purpose of using it as a baptismal Creed,
   or, finally, by adopting it itself, without alteration, for church use
   as a baptismal Creed, in spite of its incompleteness and its polemical
   character. These three plans were actually followed. In the first half
   of the fifth century the third was the one most widely adopted, but
   previously to this the two first were the favourites. To this series
   belong the revised Antiochian Confession, the later Nestorian Creed,
   the Philadelphian, the Creed in the pseudo-Athanasian hermeneia eis to
   sumbolon, the second, longer, Creed in the Ancoratus of Epiphanius, the
   Cappadocian-Armenian, the exposition of the Nicene Creed ascribed to
   Basil, a Creed which was read at Chalcedon and which is described as
   "Nicene." To this class our Creed also belongs. If it be compared with
   the Nicene Creed it will be easily seen that it cannot be based on the
   latter; if, on the other hand, it be compared with the old Creed of
   Jerusalem (in Cyril of Jerusalem) it becomes plain that it is nothing
   but a Nicene redaction of this Creed. But this is as much as to say
   that it was probably composed by Cyril of Jerusalem. Moreover, its
   general character also perfectly corresponds with what we know of
   Cyril's theology and of his gradual approximation to orthodoxy.
   (Socrat. V. 8, Sozom. VII. 7) "Cyril's personal history presents in
   various respects a parallel to the transition of the Jerusalem Creed
   into the form of the so-called Creed of Constantinople." That is to
   say, in the Creed which afterwards became ecumenical the words of the
   Nicene Creed "tout' estin ek tes ousias tou patros" and the Nicene
   anathemas are omitted. The christological section accordingly runs
   thus: "kai eis hena kurion Iesoun Christon, ton huion tou Theou ton
   monogene, ton ek tou patros gennethenta pro panton ton aionon, phos ek
   photos, Theon alethinon ek Theou alethinou, gennethenta ou poiethenta,
   homoousion to patri, di' hou ta panta egeneto." From the writings of
   the Eomoiousians and the Cappadocians we can accordingly easily gather
   that the "ek tes ousias tou patros" presented a far greater difficulty
   to the half-friends of the Nicene Creed than the homoousios; for
   homoousios not without some show of fairness might be interpreted as
   homoios kat' ousian, while on the contrary the "ek tes ousias", both in
   what it said and in what it excluded--the will, namely--seemed to leave
   the door open to Sabellianism. It follows also from Athan. de Synodis
   that he considered the "ek tes ousias" as of supreme importance; for in
   a way that is very characteristic of him he observes that homoousios is
   equal to homoiousios ek tes ousias, that is, whoever intentionally
   avows his belief in the homoousios without the "ek tes ousias" avows
   his belief in it as a Homoiousian. The Christological formula in the
   Creed of Jerusalem, i.e., what was later on the
   Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed, is thus almost homoiousian, even
   although it retains the homoousios. It corresponds exactly to the
   standpoint which Cyril must have taken up soon after 362. The same
   holds good of what the Creed says regarding the Holy Spirit. The words:
   "kai eis to pneuma to hagion, to kurion, to zoopoion, to ek tou patros
   ekporeuomenon, to sun patri kai huio sunproskunoumenon kai
   sundoxazomenon, to lalesan dia ton propheton" are in entire harmony
   with the form which the doctrine of the Holy Spirit had in the sixties.
   A Pneumatomachian could have subscribed this formula at a pinch; and
   just because of this it is certain that the Council of 381 did not
   accept this Creed. We can only conjecture how it came to be the Creed
   of Constantinople (see Hort., pp. 97-106 f. and my article pp. 225 f.,
   228 f.). It was probably entered in the Acts of the Council as the
   Confession by which Cyril had proved to the Council that his faith was
   orthodox and which the highly esteemed Epiphanius had also avowed as
   his. The Bishop of Constantinople took it from among the Acts shortly
   before the year 451 and put it into circulation. The desire to foist
   into the churches a Constantinopolitan Creed was stronger in his case
   than his perception of the defects of this very Creed. It was about 530
   that the Creed of Constantinople first became a Baptismal Creed in the
   East and displaced the Nicene Creed. It was about the same time that it
   first came into notice in the West, but it, however, very quickly
   shoved the old Apostolic Baptismal Creeds into the background, being
   used in opposition to Germanic Arianism which was very widely spread
   there. On the "filioque" see below. We may merely mention the extreme
   and wholly unworkable hypothesis of the Catholic Vincenzi (De process.
   Spiritus S., Romæ, 1878) that the Creed of Constantinople is a Greek
   made-up composition belonging to the beginning of the seventh century,
   a fabrication the sole aim of which was to carry back the date of the
   rise of the heresy of the procession of the Holy Spirit ex patre solo
   into the Fourth Century.

   [224] See the letter "Sanctum" in Mansi III., p. 631.

   [225] See the letter "Fidei" in Mansi III., p. 630.

   [226] The important letter is in Theodoret V. 9. It contains a
   description of the persecutions which had been endured, of the
   struggles which still continued, thanks that they hos oikeia mele
   should have received an invitation to the Council so that they may rule
   along with the West and that it may not rule alone, regret that they
   are prevented from appearing at it; then follows the exposition of the
   Faith, after the despatch of the three envoys had been announced: "What
   we have suffered we suffered for the Evangelical Faith which was
   settled at Nicæa, tauten ten pistin kai humin kai hemin kai pasi tois
   me diastrethpusi ton logon tes alethous pisteos sunareskein dei; hen

   ousias e tes phuseos e tes theotetos temnomenes kai te aktisto kai
   homoousio kai sunaidio triadi metagenesteras tinos e ktistes e
   heteroousiou phuseos epagomenes. The Easterns did not yield anything
   here and yet they expressed their belief in as conciliatory a form as
   possible since they were silent about Marcellus, called Sabellianism a
   "disease", but Arianism a "blasphemy". Next follows the reference to
   the acts of the Councils of 379 and 381, then an explanation regarding
   the new appointment to the "as it were newly founded Church of
   Constantinople" and to the bishopric of Antioch where--this is directed
   against Rome and Alexandria--the name Christian first arose. So too the
   recognition of Cyril of Jerusalem, who had suffered so much for the
   Faith, is justified. Jerusalem is called in this connection "the mother
   of all Churches." The Easterns at the close beseech the Westerns to
   give their consent to all this, tes pneumatikes mesiteuouses agapes kai
   tou kuriakou phobou, pasan men katastellontos anthropinen proapatheian,
   ten de ton ekklesion oikodomen protimoteran poiountos tes pros ton
   kath' hena sumpatheias e charitos. Then will we no longer say, what is
   condemned by the Apostles: "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of
   Cephas", but we shall all appear as belonging to Christ, who is not
   divided in us, and will with the help of God preserve the body of the
   Church from division.

   [227] The so-called fifth Canon of the Council of 381 (see Rade, pp.
   107, 116 f., 133) belongs to the Synod of 382, as also the sixth; the
   seventh is later. It runs: peri tou tomou ton Dutikon kai tous en
   Antiocheia apedexametha tous mian homologountas patros kai huiou kai
   hagiou pneumatos theoteta. It can only he the Paulinists in Antioch who
   are here referred to. But as regards the Western Tomos we must with
   Rade, op. cit., apparently take it to be the twenty-four Anathemas of
   Damasus (in Theodoret V. II.). This noteworthy document, which perhaps
   originated in the year 381, presents in a full and definite way the
   standpoint of the Westerns in regard to the different dogmatic
   questions. It is specially worthy of notice that the doctrine of
   Marcellus is condemned without any mention being made of its author.
   The ninth anathema is further of importance and also the eleventh: "If
   anyone does not confess that the Son is from the Father, i.e., is born
   of His Divine substance, let him be accursed." Compare with this the
   so-called Creed of Constantinople in which the ek tes ousias is
   wanting. The fulness with which the doctrines of the Incarnation and
   the Holy Spirit are already treated, is significant.

   [228] To this period, according to Rade's pertinent conjecture, the
   work of Damasus given in Theodoret V. to against Apollinarianism, also
   belongs. It probably came from the pen of Jerome, soon after 382, and
   gives expression to the supreme self-consciousness of the occupant of
   the chair of Peter. Jerome always flattered Damasus.

   [229] The Church historians, Philostorgius in particular, give us some
   information about this, but they do not enter much into particulars.
   Eunomius kept his ground firmly and courageously and declined all
   compromises. He did not even so much as recognise the baptism and
   ordination of the other Church parties (Philostorg. X. 4). The
   Conciliar epistle of the Easterns of the year 382 (see above) further
   shews what difficulties the attempt to carry through the Homoousios
   gave rise to.

   [230] See the struggles of Ambrose against Arianism in Upper Italy,
   which went on still the year 388. After the death of his mother,
   Valentinus II. declared for orthodoxy; see Cod. Theodos. XVI. 5, 15.
   The knowledge that Maximus the usurper had owed his large following to
   the fact of his being strictly orthodox helped to bring about this
   decision. The assertion of Libanius that Maximus entered into an
   alliance even with the unruly and rebellious Alexandrians is one which
   is calculated to make us reflect. The fact that in the days of
   Theodosius Ambrose was at the head of the Church in the West, probably
   contributed largely to bring about an adjustment of the differences
   between the Western-Alexandrian and the Cappadocian-neo-orthodox
   doctrines of the Son. This bishop had learned from Philo, Origen, and
   Basil, and he had friendly intercourse with the last mentioned; but he
   never sheaved any interest in or appreciation of the difference between
   the form of doctrine in East and West, and he did not go into the
   speculations of the theologians of the East. It was thus merely in a
   superficial fashion that he accepted the theological science of the
   East. But this very fact was of advantage to him so far as his position
   was concerned; for it meant that he did not separate himself from the
   common sense of the West, while, on the other hand, he had a great
   respect for the Cappadocian theology and consequently was admirably
   suited for being a peace-maker. Ex professo he did not handle the
   Trinitarian problem; his formulæ bear what is essentially the Western
   stamp, without, however, being pointed against the "Meletians", and in
   fact, he himself accepted the statement: "nulla est discrepantia
   divinitatis et operis; non igitur in utroque una persona, sed una
   substantia est"; but on the other hand: "non duo domini, sed unus
   dominus, quia et pater deus et filius deus, sed unus deus, quia pater
   in filio et filius in patre--nevertheless--unus deus, quia una deitas"
   (see Förster, Ambrosius, p. 130). Ambrose did not engage in any
   independent speculations regarding the Trinity, as Hilary did (see
   Reinkens, op. cit., and Schwane, D G. d. patrist. Zeit., p. 150 ff.).
   The fact, however, that in the fourth century the greatest theologian
   of the West--namely, Jerome, and the most powerful ecclesiastical
   prince of the West, Ambrose, had learned their theology from the
   Greeks, was the most important cause of the final union of East and
   West in the matter of the doctrine of the Trinity. Hosius, Julius of
   Rome, Lucifer and Damasus of Rome would not have been able to
   accomplish the dogmatic unity of the two halves of the Empire. As a
   matter of fact the dogmatic unity did not spring from the alliance of
   Athanasius, Julius, Peter, and Damasus, Alexandria and Rome that is,
   but from the alliance of Athanasius, Hilary, Basil, Jerome, and
   Ambrose.

   [231] On the Novatians in the East in the Fourth Century and their
   relations to the orthodox, particularly in the city of Constantinople,
   see my articles s. v. "Novatian", "Socrates", in Herzog's R: Encykl.
   The Novatians, strange to say, always had been and continued to be
   Nicene. The explanation of this may be found in the fact that they
   originated in the West, or in the fact of their connection with the
   West.

   [232] Socr. V. to (Sozom. VII. 12) has given us some information
   regarding the proceedings at the Council of Constantinople in 383.
   Theodosius wished to have an actual conference between the opposing
   parties. Sisinius, the reader to the Novatian bishop Agelius, is then
   said to have advised that instead of having a disputation the matter
   should be settled simply on the basis of passages from the Fathers; the
   patristic proof alone was to be authoritative. Socrates tells us that
   with the consent of the Emperor this was actually the course followed,
   and that on the part of the orthodox only those Fathers were appealed
   to who had lived before the Arian controversy. The raising of the
   question, however, as to whether the various parties actually
   recognised these Fathers as authoritative, produced a Babylonian
   confusion amongst them, and indeed even amongst the members of one and
   the same party, so that the Emperor abandoned this plan of settling the
   dispute. He next collected together Confessions composed by the
   different parties (the bold one composed by Eunomius is still
   preserved, see Mansi III., p. 646 sq.), but rejected them all with the
   exception of the orthodox one, and ungraciously sent the parties home.
   The Arians, it is said, consoled themselves for the Emperor's unkind
   treatment of them, with the saying that "many are called but few
   chosen". This narrative, so far as the particulars are concerned, is
   too much a made-up one to be implicitly trusted. But the attempt to
   decide the whole question on the authority of tradition was certainly
   made. If we consider how at first both parties proceeded almost
   exclusively on the basis of the Holy Scriptures we can perceive in the
   attempt an extremely significant advance in the work of laying waste
   the Eastern Churches.

   [233] See Cod. Theodos. XVI. 1, 4 of the year 386 and the other laws of
   Theodosius and his sons. Things became particularly bad from about 410
   onwards.

   [234] See Sozom. in Books VII. and VIII., especially in VIII. 1.

   [235] Athanasius had already described the whole substance of the
   Christian religion as a "doctrine of the mysteries"--see, e.g., his
   Festival-letters, p. 68 (ed. Larsow).

   [236] We have here, above all, to remember the attitude taken up by
   Socrates, which is typical of that of the ecclesiastically pious laity
   of the East. His stand-point is--we ought silently to adore the
   mystery. Whatever the generation the last but one before his own has
   fixed, is for him already holy; but he will have nothing to do with
   dogmatic disputes in his own time, and one may even find in what he
   says traces of a vague feeling on his part that the laity as regards
   their Faith had in fine been duped by the bishops and their
   controversies. His agreement with what was said by Euagrius in
   reference to the Trinity (III. 7) is characteristic of his position in
   the matter: pasa protasis e genos echei kategoroumenon e eidos e
   diaphoran e sumbebekos e to ek touton sunkeimenon; ouden de epi hagias
   triados ton eiremenon esti labein. siope proskuneistho to arreton. He
   will have nothing to do with ousia and hupostasis. The case too of
   Procopius of Cæsarea illustrates the attitude of reserve taken up by
   the laity in the sixth century to the whole dogmatic system of the
   Church.

APPENDIX.

  THE DOCTRINE OF THE HOLY GHOST AND OF THE TRINITY.

   I. In the baptismal formula, along with the confession of belief in the
   Father and Son, there had always been from early times a confession
   also of belief in the Holy Spirit. This belief expressed the thought
   that Christianity has within it the Spirit of the Father--the Spirit of
   Christ--the living, illuminating, divine principle. The Spirit is the
   gift of God. But after the Montanist controversies the combination of
   Spirit and Church, Spirit and individual Christians came to have a
   secondary place in regular theological thought. The World-Church and
   its theologians busied themselves instead with the Spirit in so far as
   it spoke through the prophets, in so far as it had before this brooded
   "over the waters", in so far as it descended on Christ at His baptism,
   etc.--though this soon became a minor point--or took part in His human
   origin. But there was quite an accumulation of difficulties here for
   rational theology. These difficulties lay (1) in the notion itself, in
   so far as pneuma also described the substance of God and of the Logos;
   (2) in the impossibility of recognising any specific activity of the
   Spirit in the present; (3) in the desire to ascribe to the Logos rather
   than to the Spirit the active working in the universe and in the
   history of revelation. The form of the Spirit's existence, its rank and
   function were accordingly quite uncertain. By one the Holy Spirit was
   considered as a gift and as an impersonal--and therefore also an
   unbegotten--power which Christ had promised to send and which
   consequently became an actual fact only after Christ's Ascension; by
   another as a primitive power in the history of revelation; by a third
   as an active power in the world-process also. Others again attributed
   to it a personal existence misled by the expression "the Paraclete". Of
   these some regarded it as a created divine being, others as the highest
   spiritual creature made by God, the highest angel; others again as the
   second probole or "derivatio" of the Father, and thus as a permanently
   existing Being sharing in the God-head itself; while once more others
   identified it with the eternal Son Himself. There were actually some
   too who were inclined to regard the Spirit, which is feminine in
   Hebrew, and which was identified with the "Wisdom" of God, as a female
   principle. [237] The views held regarding its rank and functions also
   were accordingly very different. All who regarded the Spirit as
   personal, subordinated it to the Father and probably also as a rule to
   the Son when they distinguished it from the latter, for the relation of
   Father and Son did not seem to permit of the existence of a third being
   of the same kind, and, besides, Christ had expressly said that he would
   send the Spirit, and therefore it looked as if the latter were His
   servant or messenger. The other idea that the Logos is the organ of the
   Spirit or Wisdom is very rarely met with. This or an idea similar to it
   was the one reached by those who distinguished between the impersonal
   Logos or Wisdom eternally inherent in God and the created Logos or
   Wisdom, and then identified the divine in Christ with the latter. As to
   its functions, we meet with no further speculations regarding their
   peculiar nature after the attempts of the Montanists to define them,
   until a very much later date when at last theologians had learned to
   commit a special department of the mysteries to the care of the Spirit.
   All that was meanwhile said regarding the activity of the Spirit in the
   world-process, in the history of revelation, in regeneration, including
   illumination and sanctification, was of a wholly vague kind, and was
   frequently either the expression of perplexity or of exegetical
   learning, but never gave evidence of any special theological interest
   in the question. We must not, however, overlook the fact that in Church
   theology in its oldest form as we see it in Irenæus and Tertullian, we
   find an attempt made to give to the Spirit, which had necessarily to be
   ranked as a being of special dignity within the Godhead, an immanent
   relation to the Father and the. Son. The passages in Irenæus referring
   to the Spirit are of special importance, though Tertullian was the
   first to call Him "God". One can trace within theology a well-marked
   line of development running from Justin through Tertullian to Origen.
   [238] After Sabellius, starting from totally different premises, had by
   his speculations drawn attention to the Holy Spirit, Origen here too
   supplied a definite conception on the subject just as he had in
   connection with the doctrine of the Logos. While admitting the want of
   any certainty in what was given by tradition, he treated the doctrine
   of the Holy Spirit entirely according to the analogy of the doctrine of
   the Logos, and even demanded that it should be so treated. The Holy
   Spirit forms part of the Godhead, it is a permanently existing divine
   Being, but it is at the same time a creature, and a creature, in fact,
   which occupies a stage lower than the Son, because it, like everything
   created, has come into being by the Son or Logos. The sphere of its
   activity is correspondingly smaller than that of the Son. Origen
   declared that intensively it was more important, but he did not give
   this its due value, since for him the categories of magnitude, space,
   and causality were in the last resort the highest. [239] The fact that
   the doctrine of the Holy Spirit was treated in Tertullian (adv. Prax.)
   and Origen in a way perfectly analogous to that followed in the case of
   the doctrine of the Logos, is the strongest possible proof that there
   was no specific theological interest taken in this point of doctrine.
   [240] Nor was it different in the period following. The Arian and the
   Arianising formula of the Fourth Century still at least embody the
   attempt to state in reference to the Spirit what, according to the old
   Church tradition, describes the character of its active working, little
   as that is; the pompous formula of orthodoxy, however, merely gives
   expression to the general thought that there is no foreign element in
   the Godhead, and shews, moreover, that the doctrine of the hypostasis
   of the Holy Spirit was already beginning to be an embarrassing one for
   the Church.

   The doctrine of Origen that the Holy Spirit is an individual hypostasis
   and that it is a created being included within the sphere of the
   Godhead itself, found only very partial acceptance for more than a
   century. And even in the cases in which, under the influence of the
   baptismal formula, reference was made to a Trinity in the
   Godhead--which came to be more and more the practice,--the third Being
   was still left in the vague, and, as at an earlier period, we hear of
   the promised gift of the Holy Spirit. Nevertheless the philosophical
   theologians became more and more convinced that it was necessary to
   assume the presence not merely of a threefold economy in the Godhead,
   but of three divine beings or substances. In the first thirty years
   after the commencement of the Arian controversy, the Holy Spirit is
   scarcely ever mentioned, [241] although the Lucianists and consequently
   Arius too regarded it as indeed a divine hypostasis, but at the same
   time as the most perfect creature, which the Father had created through
   the Son and which therefore was inferior to the Son also in nature,
   dignity, and position. [242] In their Confessions they kept to the old
   simple tradition: pisteuomen kai eis to pneuma to hagion, to eis
   paraklesin kai hagiasmon kai teleiosin tois pisteuousi didomenon, [243]
   "and we believe in the Holy Spirit given to believers for consolation,
   and sanctification, and perfection." They recognised three graduated
   hypostases in the Godhead. The fact that Athanasius did not in the
   first instance think of the Spirit at all, regarding which also nothing
   was fixed at Nicæa, is simply a proof of his intense interest in his
   doctrine of the Son. The first trace of the emergence of the question
   as to the Spirit is found, so far as I know, in the Anathemas (20 ff.)
   of the very conservative Creed of the Eusebian Council of Sirmium
   (351). Here the identification of the Holy Spirit with the unbegotten
   God and with the Son, as also the designation of it as meros tou patros
   e tou huiou, (part of the Father and of the Son,) are forbidden. [244]
   It was towards the end of the fifties that Athanasius directed his
   attention to the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, and he at once took up a
   firm position. [245] If the Holy Spirit belongs to the Godhead it must
   be worshipped, if it is an independent being then all that holds good
   of the Son holds good of it also, for otherwise the Triad would be
   divided and blasphemed and the rank of the Son too would again become
   doubtful--this is for him a conclusive argument. There can be nothing
   foreign, nothing created in the Triad which is just the one God (hole
   trias heis Theos estin). Athanasius was not only able to adduce a
   number of passages from Scripture in support of this assertion, but he
   also endeavoured to verify his view by a consideration of the functions
   of the Holy Spirit. The principle of sanctification cannot be of the
   same nature as the beings which it sanctifies; the source of life for
   creatures cannot itself be a creature; he who is the medium whereby we
   enter into fellowship with the Divine nature must himself possess this
   nature. [246] On the other hand, He who works as the Father and the Son
   work, or to put it more accurately, He who bestows one and the same
   grace--for there is only one grace, namely, that of the Father through
   the Son in the Holy Spirit--is part of the Godhead, and whoever rejects
   Him separates himself from the Faith generally. Thus everything is
   really already expressed in the baptismal formula; for without the Holy
   Spirit it would be destroyed, since it is the Spirit who throughout
   completes or perfects what is done. The personality of the Spirit is
   simply presupposed by Athanasius in the indefinite form in which he
   also presupposed the personality of the Son. The attempts to
   distinguish the peculiar nature of the activity of the Spirit from that
   of the Father and the Son did not indeed get beyond empty words such as
   perfection, connection, termination of activity, etc. The question as
   to why the Son could not do all this Himself, and why, if there was
   here a third, the existence of a Fourth was not also possible, was left
   unanswered. It is necessary to believe in the Trinity as handed down by
   tradition: "and it is manifest that the Spirit is not one being of the
   many nor an angel [one of many], but one unique being, or rather, He
   belongs to the Logos who is one, and to God who is one, and is also of
   the same substance" (kai ouk adelon, hoti ouk esti ton pollon to
   pneuma, all' oude angelos, all' hen on. mallon de tou logou henos ontos
   idion kai tou Theou henos ontos idion kai homoousion estin). [247] The
   "Tropicists" as he calls those who teach erroneous doctrine in
   reference to the Holy Spirit, are in his view no better than the
   Arians.

   The letters of Athanasius to Serapion of Thmuis were called forth by
   the complaints of this bishop about the intrigues of those who taught
   false doctrine regarding the Holy Spirit. As a matter of fact, amongst
   the Semi-Arians the doctrine of the Holy Spirit was now purposely
   developed in opposition to the Homousia. It was in particular the
   highly esteemed chief of the Thracian Semi-Arians, Macedonius, at a
   later date the deposed bishop of Constantinople, who defended the
   doctrine that the Spirit is a creature similar to the angels, a being
   subordinate to the Father and the Son and in their service. [248] It is
   worth noting with regard to these Semi-Arians that the more their
   common opposition to the Homoeans and Anomoeans drove them to side with
   the Nicæans the more firmly they stuck to their doctrine of the Spirit.
   It looked as if they wished to preserve in their doctrine of the Holy
   Spirit the Conservativism which they had had to abandon as regards the
   doctrine of the Son. It was at the Synod of Alexandria (362) that the
   orthodox first took up the definite position with regard to this
   question that whoever regards the Holy Spirit as a creature and
   separates it from the substance of Christ, in so doing divides up the
   Holy Trinity, gives a hypocritical adherence to the Nicene Faith, and
   has merely in appearance renounced Arianism. [249] But what was thus
   firmly established by the Alexandrians by no means at once became law
   for the orthodox in the East. The statements regarding the Spirit [250]
   were indeed further amplified in subsequent years in connection with
   the remodelling of the old Confessions, but amongst the Homoiousians
   who were becoming Homousians, the greatest uncertainty continued to
   prevail up till 380. The thirty-first oration of Gregory of Nazianzus
   which was composed at that time, proves this. [251] Meanwhile it was
   just the Cappadocians who did most towards getting the orthodox
   conception naturalised in the Church, namely, Basil in his work against
   Eunomius (lib. III.) and in the tractate "de spiritu sancto," Gregory
   of Nazianzus in several of his orations (31, 37, 44), and Gregory of
   Nyssa in his amplifications of Trinitarian doctrine. They had
   apparently learned something from the letters of Athanasius ad Serap.,
   for they repeat his arguments and give them more formal development.
   But neither in Basil nor in Gregory of Nazianzus is there the
   stringency which marks the thought of Athanasius. The absence of any
   tangible tradition exercised a strong influence [252] on them, and at
   bottom they are already satisfied--Basil at any rate--with the avowal
   that the Spirit is not in any sense a creature. [253] Gregory of Nyssa
   as an Origenist and speculative Trinitarian carried the doctrine
   further. [254] As the theologians were at a loss how to accord to the
   Spirit a peculiar mode of being in relation to the Father, they hit
   upon the plan of attributing to it, following some passages in St John,
   eternal sending forth (ekpempsis) and procession (ekporeusis). Just as
   in the second century the begetting of Christ whereby he came to exist
   on this earth had been made into a super-terrestrial begetting then
   became an eternal begetting, while the "being begotten" next came to be
   regarded as the supreme characteristic of the second hypostasis, so in
   the fourth century an "eternal sending" of the Spirit was made out of
   the promised "sending" of the Holy Spirit and was regarded as
   descriptive of the essential characteristic of the third hypostasis
   within the Holy Trinity. Nowhere can the work of imaginative conception
   be more plainly recognised than here. Behind a history already in
   itself a wonderful one, and the scene of which is laid partly in the
   Godhead and partly within humanity, there was put by a process of
   abstraction and reduplication a second history the events of which are
   supposed to pass entirely within the Godhead itself. The former history
   is to get its stability through the latter which comprises "the entire
   mystery of our Faith."

   The matter was much more quickly settled in the West. Hilary, it is
   true, was anything but clear as regards doctrine, but this was merely
   because he had eaten of the tree of Greek theology. The general
   unreasoned conviction in the West was that the Holy Spirit, belief in
   whom was avowed in the Apostles' Creed, is the one God likewise.

   When the question as to the personality of the Spirit emerged, it was
   as quickly settled that it must be a persona, for the nature of God is
   not so poor that His Spirit cannot be a person.--(It has to be noted
   that persona and our "person" are not the same thing.) The views of
   Lactantius again on this point were different. Since the year 362 the
   orthodox at several Councils in the West and then in Asia had
   pronounced in favour of the complete Godhead of the Spirit [255] in
   opposition to the Arians, as we see from the Confession of Eunomius,
   and also to the Pneumatomachians. [256] The big Eastern Council
   summoned to meet at Constantinople in 381 by Theodosius originally
   included thirty-six Macedonians amongst its members. But they could not
   be got to assent to the new doctrine of the Holy Spirit, spite of all
   the imperial efforts made to win them over. They were accordingly
   compelled to leave the Council. [257] The latter reaffirmed the Nicene
   Creed, but gave to it a detailed dogmatic explanation which has not
   been preserved, in which the complete homousia of the Spirit was
   avowed, and in the same way the first canon of the Council passes
   condemnation on the Semi-Arians or "Pneumatomachians". [258] The
   pronouncements of the years following confirmed the final result; see
   the epistle of the Council of Constantinople of 382, [259] but above
   all, the anathemas of Damasus. [260] The doctrine of the homousia of
   the Spirit from this time onward was as much a part of orthodoxy as the
   doctrine of the homousia of the Son. But since according to the Greek
   way of conceiving of the matter, the Father continued to be regarded as
   the root of the Godhead, the perfect homousia of the Holy Spirit
   necessarily always seemed to the Greeks to be called in question
   whenever he was derived from the Son also. He consequently seemed to be
   inferior to the Son and thus to be a grandchild of the Father, or else
   to possess a double root. Then, besides, the dependence of the Spirit
   on the Son was obstinately maintained by the Arians and Semi-Arians on
   the ground that certain passages in the Bible supported this view, and
   in the interest of their conception of a descending Trinity in three
   stages. Thus the Greeks had constantly to watch and see that the
   procession of the Spirit from the Father alone was taught, and after
   the revised Creed of Jerusalem became an ecumenical Creed, they had a
   sacred text in support of their doctrine, which came to be as important
   as the doctrine itself.

   II. The Cappadocians [261] and their great teacher, Apollinaris of
   Laodicea, [262] before them, reached the doctrine of the Trinity, which
   remained the dominant one in the Church, though it always continued to
   be capable of being differently restated by theologians. We are to
   believe in one God, because we are to believe in one divine substance
   or essence (ousia, phusis, essentia, substantia, natura) in three
   distinct subjects or persons (hupostasis,persona [prosopon]). The
   substance is to be thought of neither as a mere generic conception nor,
   on the other hand, as a fourth alongside of the three subjects, but as
   a reality, i.e., the unity must coincide with the real substance. The
   subjects again are not to be represented as mere attributes nor, on the
   other hand, as separate persons, but as independent, though apart from
   their mutual relationship, unthinkable, partakers of the divine
   substance. Their likeness of nature which is involved in their
   community of substance finds expression in the identity of their
   attributes and activities, their difference in the characteristic note
   (tropos huparxeos, idioma) of their manner of existence as signified by
   the ideas, unbegotten, begotten, proceeding from (agennesia, gennesia,
   ekporeusis). The special characteristic attached to the Father implies
   that He is the source, the root, the first principle of the Godhead,
   while the two other persons--within the divine substance--are "caused".
   The Father is greater than the other two in so far as He is the first
   principle and the cause (kata ton tes arches kai aitias logon). The
   Godhead is consequently in itself and apart from all relation to the
   world, an inexhaustible living existence and no rigid and barren unity,
   "as the Jews teach." Yet neither is it a divided multiplicity "as the
   heathen think", but, on the contrary, unity in Trinity and Trinity in
   unity. Because the Godhead is what is common to the Three, there is
   only one God. At the same time the hypostatic difference is not to be
   regarded as a merely nominal one, but it has not reference to the
   substance, the will, the energy, the power, time, and consequently not
   to the rank of the persons. From the unity results the unity of
   activity. Every divine act is to be understood as a working of the
   Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit as is expressed in the terms,
   primal source, mediating power, and completion. See, above all, Gregor.
   Naz. Orat. 27-32.

   This doctrinal system shews itself to be a radical modification of the
   system of Origen under the influence of the religious thought defended
   by Athanasius and the West, that the Godhead which appeared, Jesus
   Christ, and the Godhead which is still active in the Church, the Holy
   Spirit, are the Godhead themselves. [263] The Cappadocians were pupils
   both of Origen [264] and of Athanasius. This fact explains their
   doctrinal system.

   Before them, however, there had been a theologian in the ancient Church
   who had come under influences wholly similar to those which had
   affected them, and who because of this, also anticipated in a striking
   way their formulae when he saw that he must amplify the doctrine of
   God. This was Tertullian. Tertullian's theology was dependent on the
   one hand on Justin and the Apologists, and on the other on Irenæus, but
   besides this the modalistic Monarchianism which at that time held sway
   in the West and which he combatted, exercised a strong influence upon
   him. Consequently the conditions under which Tertullian composed his
   work "adv. Praxean" were, mutatis mutandis, the same as those by which
   the Cappadocians were surrounded, and they accordingly led to a similar
   result, so that we may say: the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity
   already announced its presence even in its details, in Tertullian--and
   only in him and in his pupil Novatian. [265] Did not Hosius carry it
   into the East? (See above p. 57.)

   The Christological dogma with its formula had already had a share in
   the establishment of the Trinitarian dogma. Tertullian had already made
   use of the same conceptions for giving a fixed form both to his
   doctrine of God and to his Christology (adv. Prax.). The form taken by
   the Trinitarian doctrine of the Homoiousians, as represented by Basil
   of Ancyra and of Apollinaris, was likewise determined by their
   Christological speculations. (It was Christological speculation which
   produced the "homoioma" [likeness] and which gave currency to the
   analogy of the conceptions. "Humanity" and "Adam" in relation to
   individual men. [266] But the Cappadocians learned from them. Quod erat
   in causa, apparet in effectu! An Aristotelian and a Subordinationist
   element lurks in the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity as well as this
   element of dependence upon Christological dogma. The Christological
   controversies accordingly could not but re-act on the form given to the
   dogma of the Trinity. That their influence was not stronger than the
   historical evidence shews it actually to have been, is to be explained
   solely by the rigid form taken by the dogma so quickly rendered sacred
   by tradition. Anything in the way of modification was unsuccessful, and
   accordingly the attempts in this direction belong not to the history of
   dogma, but of theology. Some Monophysites who were influenced by the
   Aristotelian philosophy and who were thus scholars of the same type as
   Apollinaris, but who were also Chalcedonian theologians, attempted to
   give a dialectic shape to the ambiguous conceptions of "Nature" and
   "Person" in the Church. In doing this they naturally landed either in
   Tritheism or in Unitarianism, which their opponents could also
   represent as Quaternity whenever the three persons were reckoned as
   belonging to the one real Substance as Reals and not as attributes. The
   departure on the part of the Monophysites from orthodox dogma had not a
   philosophical cause only, though the period was one in which there had
   been a revival of Aristotelian study, but was also the result of their
   Christology. Since in their Christology they regarded phusis (nature)
   as equal to hupostasis (hypostasis), [267] it naturally suggested
   itself to them to carry out the same equation in reference to the
   Trinity. But if ousia or phusis be regarded as equivalent to upostasis
   then we have Unitarianism; while if on the other hand, in making this
   equation we start from the hypostasis, we have three gods. Both of
   these doctrines were taught amongst the Monophysites in the sixth
   century, or to put it more accurately, from about 530. [268] In
   opposition to the Tritheists Johannes Damascenus, although he was
   himself strongly influenced by Aristotle and based his theology on the
   work of the Cappadocians, gave a Modalistic turn to the theological
   exposition of the dogma of the Trinity, and in so doing sought to get
   rid of the last remains of Subordinationism. It is true that he also
   grants that the Father is greater than the Son (de fide orthodox. I. 8)
   because He is the Principle of the Son, a view which Athanasius too,
   founding on John XIV. 28, had always maintained, but he nevertheless
   conceives of the being unbegotten (agennesia) in a still higher fashion
   than the Cappadocians had done--namely, as a mode of being of the same
   kind as the being begotten (gennesia) and procession (ekporeusis), and
   in order to put the unity of the Hypostases on a firm basis he not only
   emphasises much more strongly the "in one another" (en allelois) which
   had already been maintained before this, rejecting the Apollinarian
   analogy of human-substance and man, and teaching that each person is
   not less dependent on others than on himself, but he also uses the
   questionable formula that the difference between them exists only for
   thought (epinoia), and that there exists between them a pervasion
   (perichoresis) without, however, any blending (sunaloiphe) and mixture
   (sumphursis) (I. 8). In his case too this way of putting the dogma was
   determined by the Christological dogma. [269]

   In the Eastern Church the further development of the dogma of the
   Trinity beyond the limit reached by the Cappadocians had no appreciable
   result. [270] It was too unimportant in itself, and, above all, it left
   untouched the point in connection with which the placing of the Father
   above the other Hypostases came most plainly to the front. John also
   (I. 8) taught that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father. [271] He
   further simply repeated the old statements that the Spirit proceeds
   through the Son, that He is the image of the Son as the latter is of
   the Father, and that He is the mediation between Father and Son,
   although in his day the doctrine of the Latins--the filioque--was
   already known in the East. [272] The Easterns clung to the statements
   in support of which they alleged countless passages from the writings
   of the Fathers of the Fourth Century, that the Spirit proceeds from the
   Father, or from the Father through the Son. As against the Arians and
   Semi-Arians they emphasised the Spirit's independence of the Son, in so
   far as dependence meant that the Spirit was a creation of the Son, and
   they always continued to stick to the "from the Father". If in the
   following centuries they seldom purposely emphasised it, still they
   always laid stress on it as being a self-evident expression of the
   thesis that the Father is the First Principle (arche) in the Trinity,
   and that accordingly the Spirit appears as depotentiated, or double
   caused, if it is regarded as proceeding from the Son also. [273] The
   doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Father alone
   thus clearly shews that in the East the mutual indwelling of the
   Hypostases was not thought of as complete, and that the Father was
   regarded as greater than the Son. The spiritual representation of the
   Trinity was of a different kind in the East and in the West
   respectively, especially from the time of Augustine onwards. It is
   accordingly at this point that Photius (867) took up the subject, since
   he, in searching for a dogmatic disputed point, charged the West with
   introducing innovations into doctrine, and strengthened this charge by
   alleging the still graver accusation against the West, of having
   falsified the most holy Creed of Constantinople by the addition of the
   "filioque"--"worst of evils is the addition to the holy Creed" (kakon
   kakiston he en to hagio sumbolo prostheke). As a matter of fact
   "filioque", as a word in the Creed and indeed in the doctrine itself
   too, was an innovation, but in reality it was merely the correct
   expression for the original Western conception of the one God in whom
   the Trinity coheres. This is not the place to describe the endless
   controversy; for the countless and ever new arguments adduced on both
   sides, so far as they do not spring from a different way of conceiving
   of the Trinity and from the determination to hold by what had once been
   delivered to the Church, are worthless. Nor have the attempts to
   reconcile the opposing views any interest for the history of dogma,
   because, as a rule, they were dictated by ecclesiastical policy. It is,
   however, worthy of note that the Greeks gradually came to be suspicious
   of the old "dia tou huiou", "through the Son", too, but that they
   otherwise continued to hold by the Cappadocian doctrine of the Trinity.
   [274] This together with the dogma of the Incarnation continued to be
   the Faith of the Church, the mystery kat' exochen. The whole of the
   material, however, which had been taken over from Greek philosophy was
   turned to account in giving a definite form to this dogma, and was to a
   certain extent exhausted here. Accordingly in the Trinitarian theology
   we also meet with what the Church inherited from the downfall of the
   ancient world of thought, though certainly it presents itself in a very
   much abridged and stunted form. Owing to the way in which it was
   employed and owing to its being united with separate Biblical
   expressions which came to be taken as philosophical-theological
   conceptions--the tropoi huparxeos, modes of existence for example--it
   doubtless underwent the most astonishing modification. Still the
   doctrine of the Trinity in the theological treatment given to it,
   became the vehicle by which the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy
   was transmitted to the Slavic and Germanic peoples. It contains a most
   peculiar blend of the Christian thought of the revelation of God in
   Jesus and the legacy of ancient philosophy.

   In the West, Augustine, following an ancient Western tendency,
   destroyed the last remains of subordinationism, though just because of
   this he advanced in the direction of Modalism. According to him in
   constructing the doctrine of God we should not start from the person of
   the Father. On the contrary the conception of the Godhead ought from
   the very first to be personal and Trinitarian, so that the Father is
   regarded as being conditioned in His existence by the Son in the same
   way as the Son is by the Father. Augustine wishes the unity of the
   three persons to be so conceived of that the three are equal to each
   one singly, and the triple personality is understood as existing within
   the absolute simplicity of God. The differences or characteristic notes
   of the three persons are still to hold good when the Godhead is so
   conceived of; but they appear merely as relations in the one Godhead,
   and their characteristics are done away when it is considered that in
   connection with the act of production or procession Son and Spirit are
   to be regarded as active agents. Augustine searched for analogies to
   the threefoldness which is found in the one divine essence, in
   creation, in the conceptions of basis and substance, form and idea,
   persistence, and in the human spirit in object, subjective picture of
   the object, intention of perception--mens ipsa, notitia mentis,
   amor--memoria, intelligentia, voluntas. The doctrine in its entirety is
   the effort of a man whose mind was as sceptical as it was
   intellectually powerful, but who revelled in the incomprehensible, who
   had laid hold of a new thought, but who both as sceptic and as
   theosophist felt himself bound to tradition, and who for this reason
   was for his punishment driven about between the poles of a docta
   ignorantia and a knowledge which was replete with contradictions. This
   speculation, which attempts to construe the most immanent of immanent
   Trinities and to sublimate the Trinity into a unity, just because it
   does this, discards everything in the way of a basis in historical
   religion and loses itself in paradoxical distinctions and speculations,
   while at the same time it is not able to give clear expression to its
   new and valuable thought. The great work of Augustine, "De Trinitate",
   can scarcely be said to have promoted piety anywhere or at any time.
   It, however, became the high-school not only for the technicological
   culture of the understanding, but also for the metaphysics of the
   Middle-Ages. The realistic scholasticism of the Middle-Ages is not
   conceivable apart from this work, because it itself already contains
   Scholasticism. [275]

   It was for Augustine a self-evident truth that the Holy Spirit proceeds
   also from the Son, and he expressly maintained this. [276] In doing
   this he merely gave expression to the view which was implicitly
   contained in the ancient Western doctrine of the Trinity [277] inasmuch
   as the procession of the Spirit from Father and Son implied in it could
   never be regarded as the procession from two First Principles. The
   first mention of the doctrine after Augustine is in the Confession of
   Faith of a Synod of Toledo which probably met in 447, hardly in 400,
   "paracletus a patre filioque procedens" (Hahn, § 97) and in the words
   of Leo I. (ep. ad Turib. c. 1): "de utroque processit"; see further the
   so-called Athanasian Creed and the Confession of the Synod of Toledo in
   the year 589 (Reccared's Confession, Hahn, § 106). It was at this Synod
   that the "filioque" was first put into the text of the Creed of
   Constantinople, which had probably then or shortly before first reached
   Spain. We have no further information regarding the reception it met
   with; [278] it is likely that in opposition to the West Gothic Arianism
   there was a desire to give expression to the doctrine of the equality
   of Father and Son. From Spain the addition reached the Carlovingian
   Frankish Empire, [279] and already in the first decades of the ninth
   century it had been there embodied in the official form of the
   Creed--by the order of Charles the Great. In Rome the Augustinian
   doctrine of the Holy Spirit had indeed been long ago sanctioned, but as
   late as the beginning of the ninth century the Creed as accepted there
   was still without that addition, as the table constructed by Leo III.
   and his answer to the Frankish ambassadors in the year 809 prove. Soon
   after this, however,--when and under what circumstances it is
   impossible to say--it was adopted into the Creed in Rome too; see the
   ordo Romanus de div. off. (Max Bibl. Patr. XIII., p. 677a), which
   perhaps belongs to the second half of the ninth century, and the
   controversy with Photius. [280]

   So far as popular Christian thought is concerned, the Cappadocian
   manner of formulating the doctrine exercised in the end a more decisive
   influence even in the West than the Augustinian view which dissolves
   the persons into conceptions and leaves little room for the play of
   ordinary or pictorial thought. But for the Church and for Science [281]
   Augustine's view came to be authoritative. What contributed most to
   this result was the fact that it was embodied as the doctrine of
   Athanasius in a formula which came to have the authority of a universal
   and binding Confession of Faith. It is extremely probable that the
   so-called Athanasian Creed, so far as the first half of it is
   concerned, is a Gallican Rule of Faith explanatory of the Creed of
   Nicæa. As such it was from the fifth century onwards, by means of the
   theology of Augustine and Vincentius of Lerinum, gradually made into a
   course of instruction for the clergy, i.e., the monks, suitable for
   being committed to memory. As a regula fidei meant to explain the
   Nicene Creed it was called "fides catholica" or "fides Athanasii",
   though it had other names also, and perhaps as early as 500 it began
   with the words "Quicunque vult salvus esse." It is probable that in the
   course of the sixth century it essentially received its present
   technical form in Southern Gaul where the West-Gothic Spanish Arianism
   still continued to provoke opposition. In the middle of the sixth
   century it, or at least a recension very similar to it, was already
   current as the authoritative course of instruction for the clergy in
   Southern Gaul, and was together with the Psalms learned by heart. It
   got into the decisions of single Councils from the Psalm-books and
   breviaries of the monks and clergy, in so far as the practice had here
   begun of appealing to single statements in this rule of faith. Starting
   from here it gradually came to be the Confession of the Frankish Church
   in the eighth and ninth centuries. It was perhaps then that the second
   Christological half was added, the origin of which is completely
   wrapped in obscurity; it was of course put together before the ninth
   century. The Frankish Church by its relations with Rome was the means
   of communicating the Creed as the Confession of Athanasius to the
   entire Western Church during the period from the ninth to the eleventh
   centuries. As Rome and--through Rome--the West finally received the
   Gallico-Frankish form of the so-called Apostles' Creed and gave up the
   primitive Apostles' Creed, so too Rome adopted as a second Creed the
   Gallico-Frankish statement of the Augustinian doctrine of the Trinity.
   This, at any rate, is the relatively most probable view that can be
   taken of the obscure history of the origin and reception of the
   so-called Athanasian Creed. [282] The three so-called ecumenical Creeds
   are consequently all "apocryphal." The Apostles' Creed did not
   originate with the Apostles, though so far as its basis is concerned,
   it belongs to the post-Apostolic age; the Nicene-Constantinopolitan
   Creed originated neither in Nicæa nor in Constantinople, but in
   Jerusalem or Cyprus, though it got its main contents from Nicæa; the
   Athanasian Creed is not the work of Athanasius. Nor are they
   ecumenical, on the contrary it is at most the Nicene-Constantinopolitan
   Creed which can be so termed [283] since the East knew nothing of the
   other two.

   The doctrine of the Trinity in the Athanasian Creed is strictly
   Augustinian, and yet it has certain traits which are not to be traced
   either to Augustine or to Vincentius. No other Creed went so far in the
   development of the doctrine of the Trinity as an article of faith
   necessary to salvation, as this one. This can be explained only by the
   fact of its having originated in mediæval times. The Franks regarded
   the Faith handed down to them by the ancient Church simply as a legal
   statute, and accordingly only required faith in the Faith, obedience,
   that is, fides implicita therefore, since they did not yet possess what
   was required for a religious or philosophical appropriation of the
   system of belief. Under the form of fides implicita, however, i.e., a
   faith of obedience, the most developed theology can be looked for from
   every one. In the Athanasian Creed as a Creed we have the
   transformation of the doctrine of the Trinity as an article of Faith to
   be inwardly appropriated, into an ecclesiastical legal statute on the
   observance of which salvation depends. [284]

   For Athanasius the fundamental religious thought was the "Homoousios",
   and just because of this he could not treat it technically. For the
   Cappadocians the "Homoousios" and the doctrine of the Trinity came to
   be the sum of theological knowledge. For the Westerns after Augustine
   these doctrines became a sacred legal statute, to which, above all,
   obedience must be rendered. This is the course of things which is
   constantly repeated in the history of religion. Men pass from the
   religious thought to the philosophical and theological doctrinal
   proposition, and from the doctrinal proposition which requires
   knowledge to the legal proposition which demands obedience, or to the
   sacred relic the common veneration for which constitutes a bond of
   union for the community, whether it be that of the nation, the state,
   or the Church. And thus the process of formulating comes to have an
   ever-increasing importance, and the Confession with the mouth becomes
   the foundation of the Church. But in reference to this the Valentinian
   Herakleon had as early as the second century correctly remarked:--

   "There is an agreement in faith and life on the one hand and in word on
   the other; the agreement in word is also an agreement based on
   authorities which many hold to be the only agreement, though this is
   not a sound opinion; for hypocrites can subscribe to this kind of
   agreement." (Homologian einai ten men en te pistei kai politeia, ten de
   en phone; he men oun en phone homologia kai epi ton exousion ginetai,
   hen monen homologian hegountai einai hoi polloi, ouch hugios; donantai
   de tauten ten homologian kai hoi hupokritai homologein.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [237] The fact that in the original draft of the Apostolical
   Constitutions (II. 26) a parallel is drawn between the deaconess and
   the Holy Spirit is perhaps connected with this too.

   [238] But it is only in so far as Origen teaches the pre-temporal
   "processio" of the Spirit that his doctrine betokens an advance on that
   of Tertullian, who still essentially limits the action of the Spirit to
   the history of the world and of revelation. By the "unius substantiæ"
   which he regards as true of the Spirit also, Tertullian comes nearer
   the views which finally prevailed in the Fourth Century than Origen.
   For the remarkable formula used by Hippolytus in connection with the
   Spirit, see Vol. II., p. 261.

   [239] On the doctrine of the Holy Spirit before Origen and in Origen
   see Vol. II. passim, Kahnis, L. vom. h. Geist, 1847, Bigg, The
   Christian Platonists, 171 sq., Nitzsch, pp. 289-293.

   [240] It is in Irenæus alone that we find indications of any specific
   speculation regarding the Holy Spirit.

   [241] See Basil., ep. 125: ho de peri tou pneumatos logos en paradrome
   keitai, oudemias exergasias axiotheis, dia to medepo tote kekinesthai
   to zetema, i.e., at the time of the Nicene Council.

   [242] See above, p. 19. The view of Eunomius is representative of the
   whole group; see the documents which originated with him and Basil c.
   Eunom. III. 5. Epiphanius has pithily summarised the Arian doctrine (H.
   69 c. 56): to hagion pneuma ktisma palin ktismatos phasin einai dia to
   dia tou huiou ta panta gegenesthai (John I. 3).

   [243] See the so-called Confession of Lucian, i.e., the Second Creed of
   Antioch.; cf. besides the third and fourth formulæ of Antioch, the
   so-called formula of Sardica--a proof that the orthodox theologians of
   the West had not yet given attention to the question; their statement:
   pisteuomen ton parakleton, to hagion pneuma, hoper hemin autos ho
   kurios kai epengeilato kai hepempsen; kai touto pisteuomen pemphthen,
   kai touto ou peponthen, all' ho anthropos, if it has been correctly
   handed down, shews, besides, a highly suspicious want of clearness;
   further the formula macrostich., the formulæ of Philippopolis and the
   later Sirmian and Homoean formula; in the formula of 357 we have
   "spiritus paracletus per filium est."

   [244] The theology of Marcellus might certainly have drawn the
   attention of the theologians to the doctrine of the Spirit; for
   Marcellus discussed this doctrine although not with fulness; see Zahn,
   op. cit., p. 147 ff. According to Marcellus the Spirit proceeds from
   the Father and from the Logos, and forms part of the divine substance;
   its special work does not, however, begin till after that of the Son.

   [245] See Athanas. ad Serap.

   [246] Passages op. cit., above all, I. 23, 24: ei ktisma de en to
   pneuma to hagion, ouk an tis en auto metousia tou Theou genoito hemin;
   all' e ara ktismati men suneptometha, allotrioi de tes theias phuseos

   amphibolon, hoti he toutou phusis Theou esti.

   [247] Ad Serap. I. 27. Athanasius also appeals in support of this
   belief to the tradition of the Catholic Church (c. 28 sq.), though he
   is able to construe it ideally only and does not quote any authorities.

   [248] On Macedonius see the articles in the Diction. of Chr. Biogr. and
   in Herzog's R.-Encykl, and in addition Gwatkin, pp. 160-181, 208. The
   doctrine is given in Athan. ad Serap. I. 1 f. Socrat. II. 45, 38,
   Sozom. IV. 27, etc., Basil, ep. 251, Theodoret. II. 6. The Macedonians
   laid stress on the difference between the particles ek, dia, en, as
   used of the hypostases, and emphasised the fact that the Holy Scripture
   does not describe the Holy Spirit as an object of adoration, and
   pointed out that the relation of Father and Son did not admit of a
   third. What the trite diatheke of the Macedonians was (see Gregor. Naz.
   Orat. 31. 7), I do not know.

   [249] See Athan., Tom. ad Antioch. 3, see also 5: to agion pneuma ou
   ktisma oude xenon all' idion kai adiaireton tes ousias tou huiou kai
   tou patros.

   [250] The formula of the revised Creed of Jerusalem, i.e., the later
   Creed of Constantinople, is characteristic. It only demands the
   complete adoration and glorifying of the Spirit along with the Father
   and Son, but otherwise confines itself to general predicates: "to
   kurion, to zoopoion, to ek tou patros ekporeuomenon, to lalesan dia ton
   propheton." These are undoubtedly of a very exalted kind and seem also
   to exclude the idea of the dependence of the Spirit on the Son, but
   nevertheless they do not get the length of the complete Homousia.

   [251] He writes, "Of the wise amongst us some consider the Holy Spirit
   to be an energy, others a creature, others God, while others again
   cannot make up their minds to adopt any definite view out of reverence
   for Scripture, as they put it, because it does not make any very
   definite statement on the point. On this account they neither accord to
   Him divine adoration nor do they refuse it to Him, and thus take a
   middle road, but which is really a very bad path. Of those again who
   hold Him to be God, some keep this pious belief to themselves, while
   others state it openly. Others to a certain degree measure the Godhead
   since like us they accept the Trinity, but they put a great distance
   between the three by maintaining that the first is infinite in
   substance and power, the second in power, but not in substance, while
   the third is infinite in neither of these two respects." For the
   details see Ullmann, p. 264 f.; at pages 269-275 he has set forth the
   doctrine of Gregory regarding the Holy Spirit, together with the
   Scriptural proofs.

   [252] Gregory of Nazianzus has consequently (Orat. 31.2) to begin by
   remarking that he had been accused of introducing a Theos xenos kai
   agraphos. He himself practically admits the want of any explicit
   Scriptural proof, and has recourse to the plea (c. 3) that "love of the
   letter is a cloak for impiety." Basil undoubtedly appealed (de s. s.
   29) to Irenæus, Clemens Alex., Origen, and Dionysius of Rome in defence
   of his doctrine, but he felt all the same that there was little
   evidence in support of it. Gregory made a similar admission.

   [253] Cf. also the remarkable words of Gregory of Naz. Vol. III., p.
   230. The striking utterances of the Cappadocians regarding the letter
   of Holy Scripture, tradition kerygma, and dogma all owe their origin to
   the troublesome situation created by the doctrine of the Holy Spirit.
   The Greeks of later days no longer found themselves in such a
   predicament of this kind, and consequently they did not require to
   repeat the bold statements regarding tradition.

   [254] See also the work of Didymus, peri triados, edid. Mingarelli,
   particularly the Second Book, c. 6 sq., written about 380, which
   contains the fullest Fourth Century proof of the complete Godhead of
   the Holy Spirit which we possess. Previous to this Didymus had already
   composed a tractate "de spiritu sancto". Of special interest further is
   the "oikonomia", that is, the pædagogic or politic reticence which the
   Cappadocians permitted themselves and others in connection with the
   doctrine of the Holy Spirit. According to Gregory of Naz. God Himself
   merely indicated the Godhead of the Holy Spirit in the N. T. and did
   not plainly reveal it till later on in order not to lay too great a
   burden on men (!)--a theory which over-throws the whole Catholic
   doctrine of tradition. It is thus also permitted to the faithful now to
   imitate this divine "economy" and to bring forward the doctrine of the
   Spirit with caution and to introduce it gradually. "Those who regard
   the Holy Spirit as God are godly men illuminated with knowledge, and
   those who say that He is God, when this is done in presence of
   well-disposed hearers, have something heroic about them, but if it be
   done in presence of the vulgar-minded it shews that they do not possess
   the true teaching wisdom (ei de tapeinois, ouk oikonomikoi), because
   they are casting their pearls into the mud, or are giving strong meat
   instead of milk," and so on (Orat. 41.6). Gregory defends the conduct
   of Basil also, who, watched by the Arians in his lofty post in Cæsarea,
   guarded against openly calling the Holy Spirit "God" because the gumne
   phone that the Holy Spirit is God would have cost him his bishopric.
   (Orat. 43.68.) He acknowledged the Godhead of the Spirit "economically"
   only, i.e., when the time was suitable for so doing. He was sharply
   blamed for this conduct by the rigidly orthodox clerics, as Gregory
   tells us (Ep. 26, al. 20). They complained that while Basil expressed
   himself admirably regarding the Father and the Son, he tore away the
   Spirit from the divine fellowship as rivers wash away the sand on their
   banks and hollow out the stones; he did not frankly confess the truth,
   but acted rather from policy than from truly pious feeling, and
   concealed the ambiguity of his teaching by the art of speech. Gregory
   who was regarded as a suspected person himself, stood up for his
   friend; a man, he said, occupying such an important post as Basil did,
   must surely proceed with some prudence and circumspection in
   proclaiming the truth (beltion oikonomethenai ten aletheian) and make
   some concession to the haziness of the spirit of the time so as not to
   still further damage the good cause by any public pronouncement. The
   difference between Athanasius and the religious-orthodox on the one
   hand, and the theological-orthodox on the other, comes out here with
   special clearness. Athanasius would have indignantly rejected that
   "oikonomethenai ten aletheian", because he did not regard God Himself
   as a politician or a pedagogue, who acts kat' oikonomian, but as the
   Truth. If he had ever acted as the Cappadocians did, the Homoeans would
   have been the victors. Still, on the other hand, we ought not to judge
   the Cappadocians too severely. As followers of Origen they regarded the
   loftiest utterances of the Faith as Science; but Science admits, in
   fact often demands a pedagogic and economic or accommodating method of
   procedure. Just as Basil made a distinction between kerugmata and
   dogmata, so Gregory (Orat. 40) concluded his Decalogue of Faith with
   the words: echeis tou musteriou ta ekphora, kai tais ton pollon akoais
   ouk aporreta; ta de alla eiso mathese, tes triados charizomenes, ha kai
   krupheis para seauto sphragidi kratoumena.

   [255] Their leaders, in addition to Macedonius, were Eustathius of
   Sebaste, Eleusius of Cyzikus, and probably also Basil of Ancyra. In
   Marathonius of Nicomedia the party had a member who was held in high
   honour both because of his position and his ascetic life. The
   Macedonians in general made a deep impression on their contemporaries
   by their ascetic practices and by their determined struggle against the
   Homoeans. In the countries on the Hellespont they were the most
   important party.

   [256] The most important utterances are the Epistle of the Alexandrian
   Council of 363, the declarations of the Westerns under Damasus in the
   years 369, 376, 377, the resolution of an Illyrian Council, (given in
   Theodoret IV. 9), the Council at Antioch in 379, which is decisive as
   regards the East in so far as those present avowed their belief in the
   Western doctrine including the doctrine of the Spirit. Compare,
   besides, the Confession of Basil (Hahn, § 121): baptizomen eis triada
   homoousion, that of Epiphanius in the Ancorat. (374): pneuma aktiston,
   and that produced by Charisius (Hahn, § 144): pneuma homoousion patri
   kai huio.

   [257] See Socr. V. 8; Sozom. VII. 7, 9; Theodoret V. 8.

   [258] It follows from a communication of the Council held at
   Constantinople in 382, that the Council issued a "tomus" on the
   doctrine of the Trinity. That the formula in reference to the Holy
   Spirit which is given in the so-called Creed of Constantinople, did not
   proceed from the Council of 381 and cannot have proceeded from it,
   since it is not sufficiently different from the view of the
   Macedonians, has been shewn above, p. 93.

   [259] Theodoret V. 9.

   [260] C. 16 f., see Theodoret V. 11.

   [261] Athanasius prepared the way in his letters ad Serapionem.

   [262] As is proved by his correspondence with Basil and as his own
   writings shew, Apollinaris was the first who completely developed the
   orthodox doctrine of the Trinity. He was, however, more strongly
   influenced by Aristotle than the Cappadocians were, and accordingly in
   his case the conception of the one divine substance was a shade nearer
   the idea of a mere generic conception than with them, although he too
   was in no way satisfied with the genuine conception (see above p. 84).
   Apollinaris further retained the old image of auge, aktis, helios, not,
   however, as it would appear, in order by it to illustrate the unity,
   but rather the difference in the greatness of the persons (peri triad.
   12, 17). (The Logos had already a side turned in the direction of
   finitude.) His followers afterwards directly objected to the doctrine
   of the Cappadocians and vice versa. We are now better acquainted with
   Apollinaris's doctrine of the Trinity than formerly, since Dräseke
   (Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch. VI., p. 503 ff.) has shewn it to be very probable
   that the pseudo-Justinian Ekthesis pisteos etoi peri triados is by him,
   and that the detailed statements of Gregory of Nazianzus in the first
   letter to Kledonius refer to this work (op. cit., p. 515 ff.). From the
   work, kata meros pistis, which Caspari has rightly claimed for
   Apollinaris (Alte and neue Quellen, 1879, p. 65 f.), and which
   represents a dogmatic advance as compared with the tractate peri
   triados, it likewise follows that Apollinaris is to be reckoned amongst
   the founders of the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity,--also because of
   his advanced doctrine of the Holy Spirit in which he teaches the
   homousia--and that in fact he ought to be called the very first of
   these.

   [263] Gregory designates as opponents of the correct doctrine of the
   Trinity (1) the Sabellians, (2) the Arians, (3)--this is extremely
   remarkable--the hyper-orthodox who teach the doctrine of three Gods
   equal in substance (hoi agan par' hemin horthodoxoi, Orat. 2, 37). The
   true orthodoxy is always represented as the middle path. For details,
   see Ullmann, pp. 232-275.

   [264] The theology of Origen was transplanted into the Pontus country
   by Gregorius Thaumaturgus. It is thus that Marcellus also probably
   became acquainted with it and combatted it.

   [265] Owing to the importance of the matter it may be allowable here to
   go back again to Tertullian (see Vol. ii., p. 258 f.). The crude part
   of his doctrine and the points in which it diverges from Cappadocian
   orthodoxy are indeed sufficiently obvious. Son and Spirit proceed from
   the Father solely in view of the work of creation and revelation; the
   Father can send forth as many "officiales" as He chooses (adv. Prax.
   4); Son and Spirit do not possess the entire substance of the Godhead,
   but on the contrary are "portiones" (9); they are subordinate to the
   Father (minores); they are in fact transitory manifestations: the Son
   at last gives everything back again to the Father; the Father alone is
   absolutely invisible, and though the Son is indeed invisible too, He
   can become visible and can do things which would be simply unworthy of
   the Father, and so on. All these utterances along with other things
   shew that Tertullian was a theologian who occupied a position between
   Justin and Origen. But the remarkable thing is that at the same time we
   have a view in a highly developed form which coincides with the
   Cappadocian view, and--this is genuinely Western--in some points in
   fact approaches nearer Modalism and the teaching of Athanasius than
   that of Gregory and has a strong resemblance to the doctrine of an
   immanent Trinity, without actually being such: the Godhead in
   substantia, status, potestas, virtus, is one (2 ff.), there is only one
   divine substance and therefore there are not two or three Gods or Lords
   (13, 19). In this one substance there is no separatio, or divisio, or
   dispersio, or diversitas (3, 8, 9), though there is indeed a
   distributio, distinctio, dispositio, dispensatio (9, 13), an oikonomia
   in short, a differentia per distinctionem (14). Accordingly the unitas
   substantiæ is not in any way a singularitas numeri (22, 25)--God is not
   unicus et singularis (12)--but it comprises three nomina or species,
   formæ gradus, res, personæ, (Tertullian here, however, usually avoids
   the use of all substantives), see 2, 8 etc. No one of these is a mere
   attribute, on the contrary each is a substantiva res ex ipsius dei
   substantia (26); there are thus tres res et tres species unius et
   indivisæ substantiæ (19); these, however, are most intimately connected
   together (conjuncti 27); they are tres cohærentes (8, 25) without,
   however, being one (masc.) [rather are they one (neut. 22, 25)],
   because the second and the third spring ex unitate patris (19) and are
   accordingly God as He is, individui et inseparati a patre (18). In the
   divine substance there are in fact conserti et connexi gradus (8).
   These three gradus or persons are different from each other in
   proprietas and conditio, but not in substance (8, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18,
   24, 25). The peculiar property of the Father is that He is a nullo
   prolatus et innatus (19) and also absolutely invisible. The Son is also
   invisible in virtue of the substance, but visible as to his conditio
   (14). In virtue of the substance there is in fact a perfect societas
   nominum; even the Son in accordance with this is "almighty" (17, 18).
   It is thus necessary to believe in the unitas ex semetipsa derivans
   trinitatem. This has already become an established truth as against
   Jews and heathen. What is most instructive of all, however, is to
   notice Tertullian's use of "persona" as distinguished from
   "substantia", because it is here that he has most plainly prepared the
   way for the later orthodox phraseology. The Latin Bible supplied
   Tertullian with the word "persona"; for (adv. Prax. 6) in Proverbs
   VIII. 30 it had "cottidie oblectabar in persona ejus" and in
   Lamentations IV. 20 (adv. Prax. 14) "spiritus personæ ejus Christus
   dominus." (The LXX. has prosopon in both passages.) Both passages must
   have attracted special notice. But Tertullian was further a jurist, and
   as such the conceptions "persona" and "substantia" were quite familiar
   to him. I accordingly conjecture--and it is probably more than a
   conjecture--that Tertullian always continued to be influenced in his
   use of these words by the juristic usage, as is specially evident from
   his naïve idea of a substantia impersonalis and from the sharp
   distinction he draws between persona and substantia. From the juristic
   point of view there is as little objection to the formula that several
   persons are possessors of one and the same substance or property, that
   they are in uno statu, as to the other formula that one person
   possesses several substances unmixed. (See Tertullian's Christology
   adv. Prax. 27; Vol. ii., p. 281.) The fact that Tertullian, so far as I
   know, never renders "substance" by "natura"--although he takes the
   latter to include substance--seems to me as conclusively in favour of
   my view as the other fact that, in the introduction to his work (3), he
   attempted to elucidate the problem by making use of an image drawn from
   the spheres of law and politics. "Monarchy does not always require to
   be administered by one despot; on the contrary he may name proximæ
   personæ officiales, and exercise authority through them and along with
   them; it does not cease to be one government, especially when the Son
   is the co-administrator. Son and Father are, however, consortes
   substantiæ patris." Tertullian's exposition of the doctrine in which he
   hit upon the spirit of the West was, however, hardly understood in the
   East. In the East the question was taken up in a philosophical way, and
   there the difficulties first made themselves felt, which in the
   juristic way of looking at the matter bad been kept in the background.
   In the latter "persona" is sometimes manifestation, sometimes ideal
   subject, sometimes fictive subject, sometimes "individuum", and
   "substantia" is the property, the substance, the Real, the actual
   content of the subject as distinguished from its form and manifestation
   (persona). It is significant that Tertullian is also able to use nomen,
   species, forma, gradus, and in fact even res for "persona", so elastic
   is the conception, while for "substantia" he has deitas, virtus,
   potestas, status. On the other hand, when the question is viewed
   philosophically it is difficult, it is in fact actually impossible to
   distinguish between nature and person. The following passages will
   illustrate Tertullian's use of words, (ad v. persona): adv. Valent. 4:
   "personales substantiæ", sharply distinguished from "sensus, affectus,
   motus"; adv. Prax. 7: "filius ex sua persona profitetur patrem"; ibid:
   "Non vis eum substantivum habere in re per substantiæ proprietatem, ut
   res et persona quædam videri possit" (scil. Logos); ibid: "quæcumque
   ergo substantia sermonis (tou logou) fuit, illam dico personam"; 11:
   "filii personam . . . sic et cetera, quæ nunc ad patrem de filio vel ad
   filium, nunc ad filium de patre vel ad patrem, nunc ad spiritum
   pronuntiantur, unamquamque personam in sua proprietate constituunt";
   12: "alium autem quomodo accipere debeas jam professus sum, personæ,
   non substantiæ, nomine, ad distinctionem non ad divisionem"; 13: "si
   una persona et dei et domini in scripturis inveniretur, etc."; 14: "si
   Christus personæ paternæ spiritus est, merito spiritus, cujus personæ
   erat, id est patris, eum faciem suam ex unitate scilicet pronuntiavit";
   15: "manifesta et personalis distinctio conditionis (this too is a
   juristic conception) patris et filii"; 18: "pater prima persona, quæ
   ante filii nomen erat proponenda"; 21: "quo dicto (Matt. XVI. 17)
   Christus utriusque personæ constituit distinctionem"; 23: (on John XII.
   28) "quot personæ tibi videntur, Praxea?" . . . "Non propter me ista
   vox (John XII. 30) venit, sed propter vos, ut credant et hi et patrem
   et filium in suis quemque nominibus et personis et locis"; 24: "duarum
   personarum conjunctio (in reference to John XIV. 10 "apparet proprietas
   utriusque personæ"); 26: "nam nec semel sed ter ad singula nomina in
   personas singulas tinguimur"; 27: "Father and Son must not be
   distinguished in una persona"; c. 27: "videmus duplicem statum non
   confusum sed conjunctum in una persona, deum et hominem Jesum"; 31:
   "sic voluit deus renovare sacramentum, ut nove unus crederetur per
   filium et spiritum, ut coram iam deus in suis propriis nominibus et
   personis cognosceretur."

   [266] Natural theology also exercised an influence here and did good
   service to the Homousios. If it is certain that man has been created
   kath' homoiosin of God, and if the view--a view which was indeed
   rejected--could even suggest itself, that his spirit is a portio dei
   (substantia divina), then the Logos appeared to have no advantage over
   man if the Homoousia were not attributed to Him.

   [267] Ouk esti phusis anupostatos--said both Monophysites and
   Nestorians in setting forth their Christology. This was applied to the
   Trinity. But the orthodox too in so far as they were Aristotelians,
   shunned the platonic--which was also the juristic--fiction of a phusis
   anupostatos, and this was bound to create difficulties in connection
   with their doctrine of the Trinity. The Theopaschian controversy is
   connected with this; see Chap. III.

   [268] Of the Monophysite Tritheists the most important are Askusnages,
   Johannes Philoponus against whom Leontius of Byzantium wrote "de
   sectis", and Peter of Kallinico. On the works of John, see the article
   in the Dict. of Christ. Biogr.; an important fragment in Joh. Damasc.,
   de hær. 83 from the "Diætetes" of John. Here it may be plainly seen
   that Christology determined the form of John's doctrine of the Trinity,
   but that he sought to give out as Church doctrine his Aristotelian
   conception of the Hypostasis, viz., Nature reaching manifestation in an
   "individuum", Nature itself existing only in the single substance, or
   in the Idea. From Leontius we gather that John spoke of treis merikai
   ousiai and accepted the notion of an ousia koine which, however, exists
   only in conception. This doctrine caused divisions amongst the
   Monophysites, and these led the Coptic patriarch Damian to emphasise so
   strongly the reality of the one substance, that he could be represented
   as a Tetradite, although at the same time he probably took away from
   the independence of the persons. Cf. the Art. "Tritheisticher Streit"
   by Gass in the R.-Encykl.

   [269] See on this Bach, DG. des MA. I., pp. 53 ff., 67 ff. In the
   Tritheistic propositions and in the counter-movement we have the
   beginning of the mediæval controversy regarding Realism and Nominalism.

   [270] On the other hand the fact that the most distinguished teacher of
   the East propounded a doctrine of the Trinity which seems to be akin to
   that of Augustine was of importance for Western theology. We cannot
   assume that Augustine influenced John. Moreover, after this theologians
   were still to be found in the East who, perhaps under the influence of
   Mohammedanism, worked out the doctrine of the Trinity in a modalistic
   way. Thus in the eleventh century Elias of Nisibis in his book "On the
   proof of the truth of the Faith", written against the Mohammedans, says
   (Horst, 1886, p. 1 f.); "Wisdom and Life are two attributes of God,
   which no one except Him possesses. For this reason Christians also say
   that He is three persons, i.e., possesses three essential
   attributes--namely, Essence, Wisdom which is His Word, and Life; He is,
   however, a single substance . . . Three persons' expresses the same as
   is expressed by the statement--the Almighty is God, wise, and living.
   The Essence is the Father, the Wisdom is the Son, the Life is the Holy
   Spirit." God is thus purely a single being. I am not able to say
   whether Elias is alone amongst the Nestorians in teaching this
   heterodox doctrine.

   [271] The addition "and rests in the Son" does not require to be taken
   account of; see Langen, Joh. v. Damaskus, p. 283 ff.

   [272] John expressly rejects the view (l.c.) that the Spirit is from
   the Son or that it has its huparxis from the Son (Hom. de Sabb. s.).

   [273] Para tou huiou or dia tou huiou was the expression used; i.e., it
   was assumed from what was stated in Holy Scripture that there was a
   mesiteia on the part of the Son in connection with the ekporeusis of
   the Spirit; e.g., Athan. ad Serap. I. 20, so that Athanasius himself
   could say, "what the Holy Spirit has, it has from (para) the Son"
   (Orat. IV. 24), but the Father alone is the cause of the Spirit; cf.
   Basil. ep. 38. 4, de sp. s. 6 f.; Gregor., Naz., Orat. 31. 7, 8, 29;
   Gregor., Nyss., Orat. cat. 3 and many passages in his work against
   Eunomius. This system of doctrine continued to be the dominant one, and
   it makes no difference to it that a passage has always been pointed to
   in Epiphanius and Cyril according to which the Spirit is ex amphoin.
   Marcellus had already expressed himself on this point in his own
   fashion when he wrote (Euseb., de eccl. theol. III. 4): Pos gar, ei me
   he monas adiairetos ousa eis triada platunoito, enchorei, auton peri
   tou pneumatos pote men legein, hoti ek tou patros ekporeuetai, pote de
   legein, ekeinos ek tou emou lepsetai kai anangelei humin. In reference
   to this point the dominant theology found it possible only to
   distinguish between the immanent processio and the processio in the
   historical revelation, or to analyse the "para" into "ek" (Father) and
   "dia". In the Nestorian controversy the use of the proposition that the
   Spirit proceeds from the Son was formally disallowed. Theodoret, it is
   true, maintained in opposition to Cyril the view that the Holy Spirit
   is idion huiou, but he declared it to be an impiety to teach that the
   Holy Spirit is ex huiou or has di' huiou ten huparxin (Opp. V. p. 47
   ed. Schultze). Maximus Confess. further repeated this in the ep. ad
   Marinum, and so too did Joh. Damasc. It is to be found also in the
   Confession of Theodore v. Mops. (Hahn, § 139, p. 230).

   [274] Photius, Mystag. (ed. Hergenröther) p. 15: Ei duo aitiai en te
   thearchike kai huperousio triadi kathoratai, pou to tes monarchias
   poluumneton kai theoprepes kratos; The tracing back of the Holy Spirit
   to the Father and the Son is compared to Manichean dualism. The
   controversial works are innumerable and those in the Slav languages are
   also very numerous, dating chiefly from the ninth, eleventh,
   thirteenth, (Council of Lyons) fifteenth (Synod of Florence) and
   seventeenth (Cyrillus Lucaris) centuries. In our own day, owing to the
   Old-Catholic movement and its projects of Union, the question has again
   been revived. For the carrying out of their plans of Union with Eastern
   Churches, which have already been in a large measure successful, the
   Romans have always found it necessary to have controversialists of a
   conciliatory disposition, e.g., Leo Allatius; while for their
   condemnation of the obstinate Greeks they have always required
   fanatical controversialists. The Greeks in order to protect themselves
   against the threatening encroachment on the part of the Romans, still
   continue to lay great stress on dogmatic controversy, as is proved by
   the existence of numerous works and essays, and even by the Greek
   newspapers which appear in Constantinople. Besides the large works on
   the Schism by Pichler, and on Photius by Hergenröther, cf. Walch, Hist.
   controv. de process. s. s. 1751; Theophanes, de process. s. s. 1772;
   Gass, Symbolik d. griech. K. p. 130 ff.; Kattenbusch, op. cit. I., p.
   318 ff.; Vincenzi, op. cit.; Langen, Die trinitar. Lehrdifferenz, 1876;
   Swete, On the History of the Procession of the Holy Spirit, 1876;
   Stanley, The Eastern Church, 1864; Kranich, Der h. Basil, i. s.
   Stellung z. filioque, 1882; Pawlow, Kritische Versuche zur Geschichte
   der ältesten griechish-russischen Polemik gegen die Lateiner (Russian)

   [275] The larger histories of dogma go very fully into Augustine's
   doctrine of the Trinity. For the history of dogma, however, it is
   sufficient to get a knowledge of the main outlines of this doctrine.
   The chief source is the great work "de trinitate", the letters Nos. 11
   and 120 are specially instructive; the former because, written
   immediately after Augustine's conversion, it nevertheless already
   contains his fundamental thought, although still in a simple form and
   accompanied by a confidence in the power of sanctified reason to
   understand the mystery; letter 120, because in a proportionately brief
   form it sets forth the doctrine in its matured shape. (The Quaternity
   is rejected in c. 7, 13.) Besides this, attention should be given to
   lib. XI. 10 de civit. dei, amongst other passages; cf. the monographs
   by Bindemann and Dorner jun., and also Gangauf, Augustin's specul.
   Lehre v. Gott., 1865. According to Augustine it is not the divine
   substance or the Father that is the monarchical principle, but, on the
   contrary, the Trinity itself is the one God (unus deus est ipse
   trinitas, pater et filius et spiritus s. est unus deus; see de trin. V.
   9, c. serm. Arian. c. 4). Consequently the equality and unity are
   conceived of by him in a much stricter fashion than by the
   Cappadocians. He is not afraid of the paradox that two persons are
   equal to three, and again that one is equal to three (VII. 11, VI. 10);
   for "singula sunt in singulis et omnia in singulis et singula in
   omnibus et omnia in omnibus et unum omnia." Accordingly the Son too
   takes an active part in His own sending (II. 9: "a patre et filio
   missus est idem filius, quia verbum patris est ipse filius"); the
   immanent function of the persons as well as their economic function are
   never to be thought of as separated, for "sunt semper unicem, neuter
   solus" (VI. 7); it is therefore true that the Trinity--in the O.
   T.--has also been seen (II.), a fact which the Greeks denied, and that
   the unity is actually a numerical one. It is accordingly also
   self-evident that the equality is a perfect one; the Father in all His
   acts is no less dependent on the Son than the Son is on Him (c. serm.
   Arian. 3: 1. C. 4 is therefore striking: "solus pater non legitur
   missus, quoniam solus non habet auctorem, a quo genitus sit vel a quo
   procedat"); the special qualities do not establish anything in the way
   of superiority or inferiority. Nor are the persons to be conceived of
   as independent substances or as accidents, but as relations, in which
   the inner life of the Godhead is present (V. 4, VII. 11, VI. 60, V. 5:
   "in deo nihil quidem secundum accidens dicitur, quia nihil in eo
   mutabile est; nec tamen omne quod dicitur, secundum substantiam
   dicitur. Dicitur enim ad aliquid, sicut pater ad filium et filius ad
   patrem, quod non est accidens, quia et ille semper pater et ille semper
   filius" etc. V. 6: amplification of the "relative", see also ep. 233).
   We can see that Augustine only gets beyond Modalism by the mere
   assertion that he does not wish to be a Modalist, and by the aid of
   ingenious distinctions between different ideas. His strength and the
   significance of his book consist in the attempts he makes to base the
   doctrine of the Trinity on analogies, together with these distinctions
   in thought. In connection with these Augustine has given us some
   extraordinarily acute and valuable discussions on psychology, the
   theory of knowledge, and metaphysics, which supplied the subsequent
   centuries with philosophical education. The Scholastics made use of
   these investigations not only in connection with the doctrine of the
   Trinity, in discussing which they do not get beyond Modalism--but also
   in connection with the conception of God in itself and theology
   generally. It is impossible, however, to understand the labyrinths of
   the work "de trinitate", on which Augustine was occupied for fifteen
   years, if we do not keep the fact in view that the great thinker has
   attempted to express in his formula for the Trinity a thought which
   this formula not only does not contain, but, on the contrary,
   implicitly disowns--namely, that the Godhead is personal and is
   consequently one person, that theotes and Theos mean the same thing.
   Obliged to believe in "the three persons in the one essence" by
   tradition, but obliged also by his Christian experience to believe in
   the single personality of God (see the Confessions), spite of the value
   which he too puts upon the "Essence" this situation could only result
   in a contradiction. Had Augustine been able to make a fresh start in
   putting the Christian religion into a doctrinal system, he would have
   been the last to have thought of the Greek formula. One who could write
   (V. 9) "dictum est tres personæ' non ut illud diceretur, sed ne
   taceretur," would not have discovered the three persons in the one
   substance! But though thus involved in contradiction this great mind
   was nevertheless able to instruct posterity in a hundred ways, for
   Augustine employed the whole resources of his philosophy in the
   endeavour to overcome the contradiction which could not be overcome. It
   is moreover, of importance that his acquaintance with the Cappadocian
   theology was of such a very superficial kind. When (V. 9) he translates
   the formula, mian ousian treis hupostaseis, by "una essentia tres
   substantiæ" it is evident that he had not entered into the spirit or
   grasped the point of view of that theology. The addition, however, "sed
   quia nostra loquendi consuetudo iam obtinuit, ut hoc intelligatur cum
   dicimus essentiam, quod intellegitur cum dicimus substantiam, non
   audemus dicere: unam essentiam tres substantias, sed unam essentiam vel
   substantiam, tres autem personas, quemadmodum multi Latini ista
   tractantes et digni auctoritate dixerunt, cum alium modum aptiorem non
   invenirent, quo enuntiarent verbis quod sine verbis intellegebant,"
   proves that spite of the agreement come to with the East, the West was
   not yet conscious of possessing a common terminology. The studies of
   Reuter (Ztschr. f. K. G. V., p. 375 ff., VI. p. 155 ff.) have thrown
   light on Augustine's relation to the Trinitarian conclusions of the
   East. We may assent to his thesis (p. 191) "In his discussion of the
   doctrine of the Trinity Augustine seldom expressly falls back on the
   formulæ of the Nicene Creed. His doctrine is not anti-Nicene, but
   neither is it for the most part Nicene in its wording. He made very
   little use of the discussions of Greek or even of Latin authors." The
   Nicene Creed is not once mentioned in the work "de trinitate". We ought
   not in fact to measure the acquaintance which the West had with the
   theological development in the East by the careful attention given to
   it by the Roman bishops. Reuter is right in saying (p. 383 f.) that it
   is not so much the Nicene Creed or indeed any formula whatever which
   Augustine takes for granted as expressing the Church doctrine of the
   Trinity, but rather a fixed series of fundamental thoughts. The West
   was never so deeply impressed by the Nicene Creed as the East had been.
   In the writings of Tertullian, Novatian, Dionysius of Rome amongst
   others, it possessed the "series of fundamental thoughts" which proved
   sufficient and in which was still contained a trace of that hen
   prosopon maintained by Calixt. (Philos. IX. 12) and the presence of
   which is still manifested in the "non ut illud diceretur [to wit, tres
   personæ']" of Augustine. Just for this very reason the West did not
   require the Nicene Creed, or required it only when it came to close
   quarters with Arianism, as we may gather from what is said by Ambrose.
   We have finally to refer to an important element in the position of
   Augustine in reference to the doctrine of the Trinity. Augustine was
   positively and negatively influenced by Neo-Platonism as represented by
   Plotinus and Porphyry. Negatively, in so far as he was there confronted
   with a doctrine of the Trinity, but with one which was based on a
   descending series of emanations; positively, in so far as he took over
   from Plotinus the thought of the simplicity of God and attempted
   actually to make use of it. To Augustine as a philosopher the
   construction of a doctrine of the Trinity was already a matter of
   course. All the more was it necessary for him to strive to construct a
   peculiarly Christian doctrine of the Trinity, and, because of the idea
   of simplicity which could no longer be referred to the Father alone, to
   bring the other two persons into unity with the Father. With the
   philosophical postulate of the simplicity of God was blended the
   religious postulate of the personality of God, a point regarding which
   indeed Augustine never got to have theoretically clear views. Here
   accordingly the other two "persons" had to be fused, and in this way
   originated the logical work of art represented by his doctrine of the
   Trinity, which no one had taught him and which appeared even to himself
   to be so difficult that he did not count on its being understood by
   outsiders (Reuter, p. 384). Prudentius (see, e.g., Cath. XI. 13 sq.)
   has a very ancient doctrine of the Trinity, which partly recalls that
   of Tertullian and partly that of Marcellus.

   [276] The Father Himself is only relatively principium, the Son and the
   Holy Spirit are also to be termed principium; but they form together
   one principium (V. 13). The statement accordingly holds good: "fatendum
   est, patrem et filium principium esse spiritus sancti, non duo
   principia." It is, however, worthy of note that Augustine in this very
   place (V. 14) rejects the view that the Son was born of the Holy Spirit
   also.

   [277] It seems to have appeared again in the teaching of Priscillian as
   avowed Modalism; see the Anathemas of the Spanish Synod of 447 in
   Hefele, op. cit. II., p. 307 f., and Leo I., ep. ad Turibium.

   [278] See the Acts of the Council in Mansi IX., pp. 977-1010, Gams, K.
   Gesch. Spaniens II. 2, p. 6 ff., Hefele III., p. 48 ff. Rösler
   (Prudentius, p. 362 ff.) regards the Confession in question as being
   that of the Council of 400.

   [279] The first controversy, (with the Easterns,) arose at the Council
   of Gentilly in the year 767. Already in the libri Carolini the East is
   censured for not accepting the filioque.

   [280] See Abelard, Sic et Non IV., p. 26 sq. ed. Cousin, and the works
   cited above; in addition Köllner, Symbolik I., p. 1 f., p. 28 ff.

   [281] See Erigena's doctrine of the Trinity, which is entirely drawn
   from Augustine, de div. nat. I. 62, II. 32, 35, homil. in prolog. ev.
   sec. Joann.

   [282] For the older works on the Athanasian Creed which begin with the
   disquisition of Voss (1642), see Köllner, Symbolik I., p. 53 ff. In
   more recent times, besides Caspari, the English, who use the Creed at
   divine service and nevertheless have come to feel it to be
   inconvenient, have published valuable discussions on it; see Ffoulkes
   The Athan. Creed, 1871; Swainson, The Nicene and Apost. Creeds, etc.,
   1875; Ommaney, Early History of the Athan. Creed, 1875; two
   prize-essays by Peabody and Courtney Stanhope Kenny, 1876, which are
   known to me only from the Jena Lit. Ztg., 1877, No. 21. In addition the
   discussions on the Utrecht Psalter by Hardy (1874), Aratz (1874), and
   Springer (1880). It is since the non-Athanasian origin of the Creed has
   been established beyond doubt both on internal and external grounds,
   that positive work has begun to be done, and this has not yet been
   brought to a conclusion. The question as to how far its transmission in
   writing takes us back has already been the subject of important
   controversies. It is doubtful if the manuscript takes us back as far as
   the time of Charles the Great or Charles the Bald. But the question of
   origin cannot be decided by the settlement of this point. Swainson
   gives 850 as the date of its origin--amongst the Neustrian clergy--and
   sees in it a piece of intentional deception. Ffoulkes endeavours to
   prove that it originated at the end of the eighth century and is also
   inclined to believe there was deception in the matter; Caspari suggests
   the sixth century; others go as far back as the fifth, beyond the
   middle of which, at any rate, we cannot, for internal reasons, go. The
   question of origin is a complicated one since the Rule of Faith
   originated by stages and only gradually came to he authoritative. There
   is no reason for thinking of deception. What I have given in the text
   is based on independent studies, but to describe these at length would
   take us too far. The most certain traces seem to me to point to
   Southern Gaul, and North Africa may also have had something to do with
   it. The Athanasian Creed does not belong to the same category as the
   pseudo-Isidorian Decretals as Swainson holds; nor was it set up by
   Charles the Great as a sharp boundary line between East and West, which
   is the view of Ffoulkes; on the contrary, it was a syllabus of
   instruction based on the doctrine of Athanasius, which in uncritical
   times was turned into a creed of Athanasius. The necessity for a
   detailed creed of this kind was coincident with the desire to possess a
   compendium of the sacred paradoxes of Augustine and at the same time a
   sharp weapon against the Trinitarian, i.e., Arian, errors which had for
   so long haunted the West.

   [283] The Armenian Church possesses a Creed which is closely akin to
   the Creed of Constantinople, but not identical with it.

   [284] The Creed is in Hahn, § 81. Careful attention has been bestowed
   on the separate statements by those who have investigated the subject,
   and their origin has been ascertained. The verses 9-12 are not to be
   directly traced to Augustine. Four times over in the Creed salvation is
   made dependent on carefully defined belief. This is not like Augustine;
   see ep. 169. 4. He did not intend his amplifications of Trinitarian
   doctrine to be taken as Church doctrine (de trin. I. 2). The most
   recent work on the Creed is in Lumby's History of the Creeds, third
   ed., 1887. Lumby comes to the conclusion based on a very careful
   examination of the MSS., and tradition, that the Creed in its present
   shape is not older than the time of Charles the Bald.

CHAPTER II.

  THE DOCTRINE OF THE PERFECT LIKENESS OF THE NATURE OF THE INCARNATE SON OF GOD
  WITH THAT OF HUMANITY.

   While the question whether the Divine which had appeared on the earth
   was identical with the supreme Godhead, was still agitating men's
   minds, the second question arose as to the nature of the union of the
   Divine in Christ with humanity. In this question, comprising as it does
   two closely connected problems, the problem, namely, as to the
   character of the humanity of Christ, and the problem as to how the
   union of divinity and humanity is to be conceived of, that which
   constituted the supreme concern of Greek theology has its culmination.
   It accordingly had already necessarily emerged in the Arian
   controversy, for it was in reference to the thought of the union of
   Godhead and humanity that the whole controversy was carried on by
   Athanasius. [285]

   The problem was not a new one; on the contrary, it had already engaged
   the attention of the old theologians who had carried on the struggle
   against Marcion and Valentin, [286] and since the time of Irenæus it
   had occupied a central place in men's thoughts. The doctrine that the
   flesh of Christ was actual human flesh had been for long an established
   one, [287] although platonising theologians still continued to find it
   possible to combine with it dogmatic thoughts and a refined
   Valentianism; [288] in fact, no single outstanding Church teacher
   really accepted the humanity in a perfectly unqualified way. Further
   than that it was necessary to believe in an actual "incarnation of the
   Logos" (sarkosis tou logou) all else was uncertain. What in the way of
   intensification or modification the conception of the sarx was
   susceptible of in order still to rank as human flesh, was a point which
   was as uncertain as the question as to the relation between sarx and
   anthropos, and as the other question as to whether the sarx must
   maintain itself as such in union with the Divine and whether it could
   or could not do this. All the Christological problems which had before
   given rise to controversies with the Gnostics returned in a more subtle
   form, since it was still possible to posit a real sarx of Christ in the
   statement of the problem, and then actually to do away with it again in
   the course of speculation.

   A Christological theory had undoubtedly been propounded by Origen,
   according to which the presence of a human soul also in Jesus is to be
   expressly admitted. Others before him had long ago demanded this,
   perhaps partly because they already felt that everything turned on the
   human personal life, and that a human body without a soul involves a
   merely seeming humanity, though they did not actually draw the logical
   conclusions. [289] But the theory of Origen was not determined by this
   thought alone. He was also influenced by a cosmological postulate. He
   required a middle term between the Logos and matter to bind them
   together, and this was to be found in the human soul of Christ,
   concerning which he taught that it had not shared in the general
   antemundane fall of the spirits. [290] Moreover, he was certainly acute
   enough to perceive that the free human will also must be located in the
   personality of Christ and that Holy Scripture affirms that it is. But
   his theory of the human soul and of the nature of the union of the
   divine and human in Christ scarcely passed beyond the circle of his own
   pupils. [291] It was too closely connected with the most peculiar and
   most questionable fundamental presuppositions of the great philosopher
   and was also too difficult to win approval. Even in Alexandria in the
   time of Alexander and Athanasius it would appear that attention was no
   longer given to Origen's way of putting the doctrine; in those cases in
   which his view was retained its effect at best was merely still further
   to increase the elasticity of all the conceptions attached to the
   person of Jesus.

   The general stagnation which marked theology in the first half of the
   Fourth Century, shewed itself no less in the different views of the
   Incarnation than in the doctrine of the Godhead of Christ. Most
   theologians contented themselves with the idea of the ensarkosis, and
   in connection with this clung to the most naïve doketic views as regard
   details. [292] If this already involved a reassertion of the opinions
   held in the oldest theological schools which Christianity possessed,
   namely, the Valentinian, others went still further in reasserting these
   opinions and directly taught the doctrine of the heavenly sarx of
   Christ, [293] the Homousia of this sarx with the Godhead of the Logos,
   and so on. [294] Others adopted the theory of a transformation.
   According to them the sarx originated with the Logos Himself, who in
   view of its appearance or manifestation, by an act of transformation
   made for Himself a body capable of suffering and thus in part renounced
   His own nature. We can trace the influence here of the old monarchian
   theologoumena of the huiopator who is incapable of suffering when He
   wills and capable of suffering when He wills. [295] Speculative
   Pantheistic views, such as afterwards plainly reappeared amongst the
   Monophysites and which had formerly been propounded by the Gnostics,
   may already have been in existence at this time, ideas such as those of
   the moment of finitude in the essence of God Himself, and of the Cosmos
   as the natural body of the Godhead. In opposition to these views some
   taught the doctrine of a perfect incarnation (enanthropesis), feeling
   probably that a mere ensarkosis or appearing in the flesh was not
   sufficient. But they were perfectly in the dark in regard to the
   question as to whether the Godhead really became a man or adopted human
   nature. As no one had yet decided this question, so no one knew whether
   the incarnate Logos had two natures or one, though the great majority
   clung to the idea of one nature without knowing, however, how to
   conceive of it. No one knew whether the Logos was blended with humanity
   or merely joined with it, whether He had transformed Himself into it or
   whether He had put it on as a dress and dwelt in it as in a temple,
   whether in becoming man He had taken it up into the Godhead, or in
   deifying it had left its peculiar nature intact; or had not deified it
   at all, but had merely associated it with the Godhead. Further, no one
   knew in what way the Gospel statements were to be employed in
   connection with the complicated nature of the God-man. Was the flesh,
   the man, born of the Virgin Mary, or was the Logos born of her together
   with the flesh. Who suffers, who hungers, who thirsts, who trembles and
   is afraid, who asks and is anxious, who confesses his ignorance, who
   describes the Father as the only Good, who dies, the man or the
   God-man? And again: who does miracles, commands nature, forgives sins,
   in short, who is the Redeemer, God or the God-Man? There was no fixed,
   generally accepted answer. Further, no one was able to make any
   definite statement regarding the permanence of the humanity [296] of
   Christ and its nature after the Resurrection, and yet the question as
   to the effect of the Incarnation turned entirely on this point.
   Finally, the question as to whether the Logos did or did not undergo a
   change owing to the Incarnation, was one on which complete uncertainty
   prevailed. The questions regarding exaltation, humiliation,
   depotentiation, assumption emerged and affected the always half
   concealed fundamental question, as to the relation of the Divine and
   human generally. The theologians, however, groped uncertainly about,
   and however paradoxical many of the doctrines already were of a
   suffering without suffering, of a humiliation without humiliation,
   still the most paradoxical by no means passed yet for the most certain.
   [297] We can easily see that we are here at the very central point of
   the old Greek theology; at the time of the Nicene Creed this was,
   however, no rock, but a slippery bit of country shelving down on all
   sides. The religious thought: Theos sarkotheis di' hemas--God made
   flesh for us,--stood firm, but the theology which sought to grasp it
   slipped off it at every point. How could it possibly be put in
   intelligible conceptions so long as theologians concerned themselves
   with the "Natures"! A human nature made divine which nevertheless
   remains truly human, is a contradictio in adjecto. What those in after
   times succeeded in doing was accordingly not to give a clear
   explanation, but simply a paraphrase which as formulated was by no
   means perfectly suited to express the thought, and whose value
   consisted in this, that it surrounded the speculative theologians with
   a hedge and prevented them from falling into abysses.

   The Christological problem, however, as it was treated in the ancient
   Church was not only connected in the closest way with the Trinitarian,
   and, further, had not only the element of contradiction in common with
   it, but it also in the last resort issued in the same formulæ. If in
   the case of the latter the singular of the substance or nature and the
   plurality of the persons were the accepted terms, it was the reverse
   way in the case of the other, where the accepted terms came finally to
   be the plurality of the substances and the unity of the persons. The
   distinction between "Nature" and "Person" was also the subject of
   discussion in both cases. That this distinction, with which the West
   had been long acquainted without, however, using it as a speculative
   starting-point, supplied the means of escape from the difficulties
   connected with both problems, theologians had begun to perceive as
   early as the middle of the Fourth Century, though undoubtedly in a slow
   and hesitating fashion. This was the anchor to which they fastened
   themselves, although it was not supplied by any philosophy; they had to
   provide it for themselves. While, however, so far as the Trinitarian
   problem was concerned, the distinction once introduced quickly
   established itself in the East, it was a century before it triumphed
   there as regards the Christological problem, and this triumph, far from
   uniting the parties, permanently separated them.

   What is the explanation of this remarkable phenomenon? It may be said
   that neither in connection with the Trinitarian question did the
   perfect unity of the substance succeed in establishing itself (see pp.
   120, 125); but it very nearly did so, and the controversy accordingly
   ceased. Why then did the formula of the unity of the person not in the
   same way prove satisfactory in connection with the Christological
   problem?

   This question may already be raised here, though it cannot be settled
   till the next chapter. Attention must, however, be directed to one
   point. The antecedents of the "solution" of the Trinitarian and
   Christological problem which proved victorious in the Eastern Church
   and consequently in the Catholic Church generally, are to be found only
   partly in the East; it was naturalised in the West. The Tertullian who
   in the work "adv. Prax." created the formula of the "una substantia"
   and the "tres personæ", in the same work constructed the formulae of
   the "utraque substantia (duplex status non confusus--this is the
   asunchutos--sed conjunctus) in una persona" (the substance of two kinds
   in one person, the twofold state not confused but joined together in
   one person); "duæ substantiæ in Christo Jesu, divina et humana" (two
   substances in Christ Jesus, divine and human); "salva est utriusque
   proprietas substantiæ in Christo Jesu" (the property of each substance
   in Christ Jesus is not interfered with). [298] He thus laid the
   foundation for the formally similar treatment of both problems, and
   created the terminology which was accepted by the East after more than
   two hundred years. Had he the same interest in the Christological
   problem as the later Eastern theologians had? Was the deification of
   humanity a matter of importance to him? By no means. And what
   philosophy did he make use of? Well, no philosophy at all; on the
   contrary, he used the method of legal fictions. By the aid of the
   distinction current among jurists between "substance" and "person" he
   with great facility explained and securely established as against the
   Monarchians both the ancient ecclesiastical and, par excellence,
   Western formula, "Christus deus et homo", and also the formula, "pater,
   filius et spiritus sanctus--unus deus." Substance--for Tertullian never
   uses the word "nature"--is in the language of the jurists not anything
   personal, but rather corresponds to "property" in the sense of
   possession, or to the essence as distinguished from the manifestation
   or "status"; the person again is not in itself anything substantial,
   but the subject or individual as capable of entering into legal
   relations and possessing property, who can quite well possess different
   substances, just as on the other hand it is possible for one substance
   to be in the possession of several persons. Tertullian introduced these
   legal terms into theology. That this is what they were in his use of
   them, and not philosophical terms, is shewn by the words themselves,
   shewn too by the application made of them and by the utter disregard of
   the difficulty which their application must necessarily create for
   every philosophical thinker. And it was these legal fictions which the
   East had to accept as philosophy, i.e., theology, or change into
   philosophy! This became the basis of the "philosophy of revelation."
   (!) This was more than the boldest Neo-Platonic philosophy in its
   strangest intellectual phantasies had ever asked. No wonder that
   difficulties were made about accepting it, especially when, besides, it
   did not cover what was still the preponderating interest of the Faith,
   the interest in the deification of humanity. People always shrank from
   positing an ousia anupostatos, a substance without an hypostasis,
   because when used in reference to a living being it was simply absurd,
   and because the unity of the person of Christ, "salva utriusque
   substantiæ proprietate", gave no security for the unity of the Godhead
   and humanity. The jurist Tertullian, however, could manage quite well
   with "person" and "substance", as if the distinction between them were
   self-evident, because he did not here develop the logical results of
   the doctrine of redemption, but gave expression [299] to a matter of
   fact which was ostensibly contained in the Creed, and because he did
   not, properly speaking, indulge in philosophical speculation, but
   applied the artificial language of the jurists. If we accordingly
   perceive that many centuries afterwards, the philosophical-realistic
   method of handling the main problem was in Western scholasticism
   completely displaced by a formal-logical or legal method of treatment,
   there is nothing surprising in this; for the foundation of such a
   method of handling the problem was in fact laid by Tertullian.

   Irenæus had already clearly discerned and plainly expressed the thought
   of the most perfect union. The great Western theologians about the year
   200 were further advanced in respect of Christology in consequence of
   the struggle with Gnosticism and Patripassianism, than the East was a
   hundred years later. [300] But what they had secured in the heat of
   battle did not possess even in the West itself any general validity;
   while in the East the greatest uncertainty reigned, having been brought
   in by the "scientific" Christology of Origen. [301] It delayed or threw
   back the development, which had certainly begun in a strictly
   scientific form. Thus at the beginning of the Fourth Century the East
   had once more to take up the question entirely anew. If we are to
   estimate correctly what was finally accomplished, it must not be
   measured by the Gospel, but by the dead state of things which had
   prevailed a hundred years before.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The assertion of Arius and his pupils that the Logos took only a human
   body gave the impulse to renewed consideration of the problem. Like
   Paul of Samosata the Lucianists would have nothing to do with two
   natures, but they taught the doctrine of one half-divine nature which
   was characterised by human feelings, limited knowledge and suffering.
   [302] Like Paul of Samosata they also found fault with the orthodox on
   the ground that their Christology led to the assumption of two Sons of
   God or two natures; for these were still regarded as identical. The
   reply made by the orthodox at first to this charge lacked theological
   precision. Just because Athanasius was as much convinced of the
   necessity of the Incarnation (enanthropesis) as of the unity of the
   personality of Christ as Redeemer, he did not put the doctrine in fixed
   formulæ. On the one hand, as against Arius, he made a sharp distinction
   between what the God and what the man in Christ had done, in order to
   keep the Logos Omoousios free of everything human; on the other hand,
   however, he wished the divine and human to be thought of as a perfect
   unity; for it is to a strictly uniform being that we owe our salvation,
   the Word made flesh, the logos sarkotheis. [303] The prolix
   amplifications of Hilary [304] were still more uncertain, so much so
   that there was some justification for the charge brought against
   orthodoxy by its opponents, that it led to a division of the Son of God
   from the Son of Man. But Athanasius had not reflected on this; in this
   connection too he had stated the mystery simply and forcibly,
   frequently in the words of Irenæus. The Logos not only had a man, did
   not only dwell in a man, but was man. He united what was ours with
   Himself in order to give us what was His. The Logos is not, however,
   thereby lowered, but on the contrary, the human is raised higher. [305]
   The question as to the extent of what was comprised in the human nature
   was one which Athanasius did not think out. He preferred to speak of a
   natural union, an henosis phusike, in Christ, but in this connection he
   uniformly disregarded the human personality. The free will was the
   category used, roughly speaking, at that period to express what is
   called in modern times "human personality". But Athanasius had not yet
   thought of this term in connection with Christ, because he had not
   learned anything from Origen. In all probability he found in fact no
   problem here, but, like Irenæus, a comforting mystery which could not
   be other than it was. He did not see that the mind must necessarily go
   astray on this matter either in the direction of the Gnostic doctrine
   of two natures or in that of the doctrine of unity, in the sense in
   which it was held by Valentinian, the doctrine of a heavenly humanity,
   or in the sense in which it was held by Arius. He believed that the
   doctrine of one composite being would serve his purpose which in any
   given case allowed of the distinction being made between what belonged
   to the divinity and what belonged to the humanity respectively. Neither
   did the great theologian who attached himself to Athanasius--namely,
   Marcellus--perceive yet the full difficulty of the problem. His
   energetic and practical theology could, however, only bring him nearer
   to the doctrine of a complete unity. The Logos is the Ego of the
   Personality of Christ; the nature which serves as an organ for the
   incarnate Logos and gives outward expression to his self-manifestation,
   is impersonal. The Logos is the energeia drastike, the divine energy;
   the body is the matter which is moved by it, which is transformed into
   a perfect instrument for the Logos. Marcellus was still further than
   Athanasius from assuming the existence of two separate, independent
   natures. He does indeed incidentally attack the Arian idea of the unity
   and he also employs the expression sunapheia, connection, for the union
   of the Logos with humanity, but at bottom he sees at every point in the
   incarnate God-Logos a perfect unity. [306] He thus thought about the
   matter as the great Christologist did after him, who first felt the
   difficulty of the problem and created a formula which did not harm
   Greek religious feeling, but rather gave it a secure basis, and which
   in doing this nevertheless left unnoticed an element of tradition which
   was indeed concealed, but was not to be rooted out.

   Apollinaris of Laodicea [307] whose divine teachers were Pythagoras,
   Plato, and Aristotle, who had learned from Athanasius, whose
   theological method was the Aristotelian one, and who because of this
   had been strongly influenced by the Arian theology, the zealous and
   acute opponent of Origen and Porphyry, the sober-minded exegete who
   preserved the most brilliant traditions of the school of Antioch and
   had a reverence for the letter of Scripture, made it the task of his
   life to combat the Origenistic and Arian theologies,--their doctrine of
   the Trinity and their Christology. Nemesius and Philostorgius have
   termed him the most important theologian of his age, [308] and that in
   fact he was. The most striking proof of his importance is supplied by
   the fact that many of his works create the impression of having been
   written in later centuries, so energetically has he thought out the
   Christological problem and overtaken the coming generations. His
   syllogistic-dialectic and his exegetic method is akin to that of the
   later Antiochians, and consequently the Fourth Century possessed in
   Marcellus, Eunomius, Apollinaris and the Antiochians a series of
   theologians, who, although not unacquainted with Plotinus and Origen,
   did not all the same adhere to the Origenistic, Neo-Platonic
   speculative views, theologians who were united by their employment of
   the same philosophico-theological method, but who nevertheless arrived
   at wholly different results. [309]

   Apollinaris in combating Arius and his changeable Christ, Christos
   treptos, started by allowing that the assumption that in Christ the
   God-Logos who was equal in substance with God united Himself with a
   physically perfect man, necessarily led to the idea of two Sons of God,
   one natural and one adopted. [310] A perfect God and a perfect man can
   never make a uniform being, [311] and in this he was in agreement with
   Paul of Samosata, Marcellus and the Arians. They constitute on the
   contrary a hybrid form, i.e., a fabulous Minotaur, a cross breed, etc.
   But if there is no such thing as a union between a perfect God and a
   perfect man, then, if these premises are valid, the idea of the
   incarnation of God which is the whole point in question, disappears.
   And further the unchangeableness and sinlessness of Christ disappears
   also, for changeableness and sin belong to the nature of the perfect
   man. We are, therefore, not to see in the Redeemer a perfect man, we
   are on the contrary to assume and believe that the Logos assumed human
   nature, namely, the animated sarx, but that He Himself became the
   principle of self-consciousness and self-determination (pneuma) in this
   sarx. Freedom too is an attribute of the perfect man, but--this as
   against Origen--Christ cannot possibly have possessed this freedom; for
   the Godhead in Him would have destroyed it. God, however, destroys
   nothing He has created. [312]

   Apollinaris sought to prove his doctrine out of the central convictions
   of Greek piety, and at the same time to establish it by Biblical and
   speculative arguments. In a lying age he stated it with the most
   refreshing candour. Everything that Christ had done for us God must
   have done, otherwise it has no saving power: "The death of a man does
   not abolish death"--anthropou thanatos ou katargei ton thanaton. [313]
   Everything that He did must be perfect else it avails us nothing. There
   is here thus absolutely no room for a human ego. This would do away
   with the redemption. If it had been present in Him, then Paul of
   Samosata would be right, and Christ would be merely an inspired man,
   anthropos entheos; but such a being cannot give us any help; for if he
   had not essentially united humanity with Himself how could we expect to
   be filled with the divine nature? Further, if he had been a man he
   would have been subject to weaknesses, but we require an unchangeable
   spirit who raises us above weaknesses. [314] Therefore He must have
   assumed our nature in such a way that He made it the perfect organ of
   His Godhead and Himself became its nous--the human nature of Christ "is
   not moved separately"--ou kineitai idiazontos. But this is also the
   doctrine of Scripture. It says that the Logos became flesh, and by this
   is denoted the animated body, not the nous. It does not say "He assumed
   a man", but that "He was found as a man"--hos anthropos. It teaches
   that He appeared in the likeness of sinful flesh--en homoiomati sarkos
   hamartias, and was in the likeness or according to the likeness of
   men--en homoiomati anthropon or kath' homoiosin. It shews finally that
   there was in Him the most perfect unity of the human and the divine, so
   that it says of the humanity what holds good of the divinity and vice
   versa; God was born and died, and so on. At the same time, however, the
   Godhead is not to be thought of as capable of suffering. Owing to the
   intimate union with the sarx which was wholly and entirely its sarx, it
   shared in a complete fashion in the suffering, and the efficacy of
   redemption consists only in the fact that it did so share in it. And
   conversely the sarx is entirely taken up into the nature of the Logos.
   "The flesh therefore is divine, because it is united with God, and it
   indeed saves"--theike ara sarx, hoti Theo sunephthe kai haute men
   sozei. [315] Starting from this Apollinaris attempted to give his
   doctrine a speculative basis. This also rests on Scripture passages,
   but at the same time it refers back to a peculiar metaphysic. The
   attempt indeed to reach it was made long before his day, and it is
   uncertain how far he himself followed it out, since those who tell us
   about it had here an occasion for special pleading. Apollinaris starts
   from the Scriptural statement that Christ is the heavenly man, the
   second spiritual, heavenly Adam. (See also John III. 13.) Close upon
   this idea he, like Marcellus, puts in the more general idea of
   Aristotle that the divine is always related to the human as the moving
   to the moved. [316] As such they stand opposed. This relation first
   reached perfect outward embodiment and manifestation in the word made
   flesh, the logos sarkotheis. But the Logos as "the mover" was from all
   eternity destined to become the logos sarkotheis. He has always been in
   mysterious fashion "mind incarnate"--nous ensarkos, and "spirit made
   flesh"--pneuma sarkothen. Therefore He could be and had to be the logos
   sarkotheis, the Logos made flesh. He certainly did not bring His flesh
   with Him from heaven, but He is nevertheless the "heavenly man";
   because it was intended that He should become flesh, His flesh is
   consubstantial with His Godhead; His Godhead comprised within it the
   future moment of the incarnation from all eternity, because only thus
   was it destined to be in the most perfect way the authoritative
   principle, the hegemonikon, of the creature. And just for this reason
   the historical incarnation which cannot be denied, is the direct
   opposite of anything like the accidental and arbitrary inspiration of a
   man. It is the realisation of an idea which always had its reality in
   the essence of the Logos, the heavenly man, the mediator (mesotes)
   between God and humanity. After the incarnation too everything in this
   heavenly man is divine; for death could be overcome only if it was God
   who suffered and died. The human is purely the passive element only,
   the organ of the Godhead and the object of redemption. [317]

   This doctrine, estimated by the presuppositions and aims of the Greek
   conception of Christianity as religion, is complete. Apollinaris set
   forth in a way that cannot be surpassed, energetically developed and in
   numerous works untiringly repeated, with the pathos of the most genuine
   conviction, what at heart all pious Greeks believed and acknowledged.
   Every correction made on his Christology calls in question the basis or
   at least the vitality of Greek piety. Only this perfect unity of the
   person guarantees the redemption of the human race and its acquiring of
   a divine life. "Oh new creation and wondrous mingling. God and flesh
   produced one nature!" (o kaine ktisis kai mixis thespesia, Theos kai
   sarx mian apetelesan phusin!) All else in the Redeemer is non-existent
   for faith. The assumption of a human separate personality in Christ
   does away with His power as Redeemer. Thousands before Apollinaris felt
   this and had a vague idea of its truth. He alone understood and
   preached it. He did not juggle with what was a matter of indifference
   to Faith or dangerous to Faith, but did away with it. [318]

   But he perceived at the same time that that separate personality is
   present whenever a human nous is attributed to Christ. This decided the
   matter so far as he was concerned. Christ possessed no human nous. He
   was honest enough not to say anything more about the perfect humanity
   of Christ, but openly avowed that Christ was not a complete man. [319]
   The fact that Apollinaris, when called on to decide between the
   interests of the Faith and the claims of tradition, unhesitatingly
   decided in favour of the former, is fitted to call forth our
   admiration, and is a clear proof of the great bishop's piety and love
   of truth.

   But the very frankness of his language reminded the Church that the
   Gospel and partly tradition also demand a complete human nature for
   Christ. Even before the appearance of Apollinaris the conflict with
   Arius had, from about the year 351, taken a turn which made it as
   necessary to emphasise the complete human nature of the incarnate one
   as to reject the thought of a transformation of the Logos into flesh or
   of a depotentiation. The Christological question became involved with
   the Trinitarian, and the latter was illustrated by the aid of the
   former. The full humanity was supposed to prove the full Godhead ex
   analogia; it had been reached in the struggle against Gnosis, and it
   was required in order to explain the Gospel accounts which otherwise
   cast a shadow on the Godhead of the Redeemer. Accordingly the complete
   humanity of Christ was first expressly asserted at the Council of
   Alexandria in 362 and, in fact, in opposition [320] to the views of
   Apollinaris. [321] The great literary activity of the bishop who was
   equally distinguished as exegete and apologist and as a systematic
   theologian, and who gathered around him a band of enthusiastic pupils,
   falls within the sixties. [322] With the beginning of the seventieth
   year of the century the Cappadocians came forward in opposition to
   their old master, shewed now their unconcealed indignation and sought
   to cast suspicion on his doctrine of the Trinity also. Apollinaris
   accordingly retorted by treating them as they treated him. How far
   Athanasius himself was mixed up with the controversy is a point which
   is still uncertain. Apollinaris separated from the Church about the
   year 375. Soon after he consecrated Vitalius bishop of Antioch. [323]
   It was the West led by Bishop Damasus which hastened to the assistance
   of the orthodoxy of the East held in fetters under Valens, and which at
   the Roman Council of 377 condemned Apollinarianism. [324] It could do
   this with a good conscience since it had always understood the "filius
   hominis" in the thesis in the full extent of the term and had had no
   difficulties about the unity. Basil had been the denouncer of the
   Apollinarian heresy (Ep. 263). The Council of Antioch of 379 sided with
   the Romans, and that held at Constantinople in 381 in its first canon
   expressly condemned the heresy of the Apollinarians. The anathemas of
   Damasus which belong perhaps to the year 381, condemn (No. 7) "those
   who say that the Word of God dwelt in human flesh in place of the
   rational and intellectual soul of man, since the Son Himself is the
   Word of God and was not in His body in place of a rational and
   intellectual soul, but assumed and saved our soul, i.e., a rational and
   intellectual soul without sin," ("eos, qui pro hominis anima
   rationabili et intelligibili dicunt dei verbum in humana carne
   versatum, quum ipse filius sit verbum dei et non pro anima rationabili
   et intelligibili in suo corpore fuerit, sed nostram id est rationabilem
   et intelligibilem sine peccato animam susceperit atque salvaverit."
   [325] Before this those are condemned on the other hand "who assert the
   existence of two sons, one before time and another after the assumption
   of flesh from the Virgin"--"qui duos filios asserunt, unum ante sæcula
   et alterum post assumptionem carnis ex virgine"--With all the zeal of a
   fanatic who had nevertheless not made the matter his own, Damasus,
   under the guidance of Jerome, soon after the year 382, once more took
   up the question and warned the Church against the doctrine of
   Apollinaris and his pupil Timothy: "Christ the Son of God by His
   passion brought the most complete redemption to the human race in order
   to free from all sin the whole man who lies in sin. If therefore anyone
   says something was wanting either in the humanity or divinity of
   Christ, he is filled with the spirit of the devil and proves himself to
   be a son of hell. [326] Why therefore do you once more demand of me the
   condemnation of Timothy? He has already been deposed here by the
   sentence of the Apostolic chair, Bishop Peter of Alexandria being also
   present at the time, together with his teacher Apollinaris, and must
   await on the day of judgment the chastisement and punishment due to his
   sin." [327] Apollinaris was condemned. One after another the
   representatives of the non-Alexandrian theology, Paul, Marcellus,
   Photinus, Apollinaris were cut off from the Church. The Antiochians
   will follow them, but the turn of Origen and his pupils is also to
   come; the Cappadocians only will be saved "so as by fire."

   The homousia or the identity in nature,--for both words were used,--of
   the humanity of the Redeemer and humanity, was thus acknowledged. And
   as a matter of fact many and important arguments could be alleged in
   support of it. One has to make use of the most desperate exegesis in
   order to banish it from the Synoptics. And further Christ redeemed only
   what He assumed; if He did not assume a human soul then the latter has
   not been redeemed, and this appeared a very obvious argument. Finally,
   it was only by the assumption of the completeness of the human nature
   in Christ that His divinity seemed to be secured against sinking down
   into the region of human feelings and suffering. But what signified
   these advantages if the unity was insecure? And Apollinaris was
   perfectly right: it was insecure. His opponents, the Cappadocians,
   might indeed be able to refute him as regards separate points, [328]
   but they could not escape from the reproach he brought against them
   that they reduced the doctrine to the idea of an inspired man. In
   proportion, however, as they sought to escape it, their assertion of
   the completeness of the human nature in Christ became a mere assertion.
   Their long-winded, obscure, and hazy deductions made in truth a
   miserable appearance alongside of the unambiguous, coherent, and frank
   avowals of their opponent. There are two natures, [329] but yet there
   is only one; there are not two Sons, but the divinity effects one
   thing, the humanity another; Christ possessed human freedom, and
   nevertheless He acted within the limits of divine necessity. On the
   other hand, the whole position of the later Monophysites, thought out
   to all its conceivable conclusions, is already to be found in
   Apollinaris; but his opponents had not yet at their command a fixed
   terminology whereby to preserve the contradiction and to protect it
   against disintegration. At bottom their views were the same as those of
   Apollinaris, they did not think of two strictly separate natures; but
   they were unwilling to give up the perfect human nature, and they had
   learned too much from Origen to sacrifice the thought of freedom to the
   constitution of the God-man. [330] Probably an historical and biblical
   element had a share in turning them against Apollinaris, the thought of
   the man Jesus as he is presented in the Gospels, this, however, not as
   something which had a well-understood religious value, but as a part of
   the tradition of the schools and as a relic of antiquity. None of the
   religious thoughts current at that time led to the idea of a "perfect
   man" with a free will, i.e., as an individual. The idea that the human
   vows cannot have been saved if Christ did not assume it too, was one
   which they themselves could not honestly believe in, for they stripped
   His humanity of the principle of individuality and of more than that.
   In Apollinaris, on the contrary, it was really the sovereignty of faith
   which supplied him with his doctrine. He merely completed the work of
   Athanasius inasmuch as he added to it the Christology which was
   demanded by the Homousia of the Logos. They both made a supreme
   sacrifice to their faith in that they took from the complicated and
   contradictory tradition regarding Christ those elements only which were
   in harmony with the belief that He was the Redeemer from sin and death.
   They neglected everything else: logos homoousios en sarki, (mia phusis
   sunthetos)--the co-substantial Logos in the flesh, (one composite
   nature)--was the watchword of Apollinaris, in the sense of a perfectly
   uniform being. This Apollinarianism dressed in orthodox garb exercised
   the strongest possible influence upon Church doctrine in the Fifth
   Century. The Church, however, rejected this particular form of unity
   and maintained the idea of "the perfect man", "the perfect humanity" in
   the unity. The Church knew what it wanted to do--to unite
   contradictions; there were not to be two sons, but two natures; not two
   natures, but one substance; though it certainly did not know how this
   was to be conceived of. Nor did it know how the contradiction was to be
   expressed. But while it thus loaded its own faith with a heavy burden
   and thereby weakened its power, by preserving the thought of the
   perfect humanity of Christ, it did an inestimable service to later
   generations. And there was further one good result which even those
   times got the benefit of. The Gnostic speculations regarding the
   heavenly origin of the flesh of Christ, the transformation of God into
   a man, and such like, were now forbidden, or at least were rendered
   excessively difficult.

   [286] The Valentinians themselves had already handled it with supreme
   technical skill, though no unanimity was attained in their own schools.
   With them the whole stress was laid on complicated distinctions within
   the person of Christ. On the other hand, all the elements of the
   composite nature of Jesus Christ were by some of the leaders of the
   schools elevated to the heavenly sphere.

   [287] See Tertull., de carne Christi.

   [288] So, above all, the Alexandrians.

   [290] For details see Vol. II., p. 369 ff.

   [291] Hilary (de trinit. X. 22) will not entertain the idea of a human
   soul. His view of the origin of souls is certainly, speaking generally,
   creationist. "He has taken the soul from Himself which, moreover, was
   never communicated by men as something emanating from those who
   beget. . . . The soul of the body (of Christ) must have been from God."

   [292] The detailed discussions of Hilary amongst other things (de
   trinitate) shew the length to which these doketic views had gone and
   the extent to which they had spread. According to him the body of
   Christ was exalted above all rah and always took these upon itself
   voluntarily only. The normal condition of the body of Christ was always
   the condition of glorification, the appearance in ordinary material
   form with the ordinary needs was on every occasion a voluntary act (X.
   23, 25: "in natura Christi corporis infirmitatem naturæ corporeæ non
   fuisse" etc.). Christ in Gethsemane did not tremble and pray for
   himself, but for his disciples (X. 37, 41) He did not feel pain; His
   sufferings affected Him as an arrow passes through fire and air (X.
   23). His nature was absolutely incapable of suffering. Amongst the
   confused ideas of Hilary, that of a depotentiation of the Logos by an
   act of self-emptying, is also met with. But the passages to which the
   modern supporters of the kenotic theory appeal (de trin. IX. 14, XI.
   48, XII. 6) are not in place; for when Hilary is dealing with the idea
   of self-humiliation he always takes back in the second statement what
   he has asserted in the first, so that the unchangeableness of God may
   not suffer. Hence the statement: "Christus in forma dei manens formam
   servi accepit." This statement must be taken along with the strongly
   kenotic statements of Hilary.

   [293] "Corpus cæleste" says Hilary himself, l.c. X. 18. The Pauline
   speculations regarding the second Adam and the heavenly man, had come
   to have very disastrous consequences for the theologians of the Fourth
   and Fifth Centuries as they had already had for the Gnostics before
   them. By the attention which was given to these speculations the
   problem, which was otherwise already a complicated one, got into the
   direst confusion. It was, however, doketism in particular, both in its
   coarse and in its refined forms, which turned them to account, and
   modern theologians have shown a fondness for fishing in these muddy
   waters in order to extract from them their very different fancies
   regarding Christ as the heavenly type of humanity and as the ideal-man.

   [294] See Vol. III., p. 299 ff.

   [295] That the Logos himself formed His own body (from Mary) seems to
   have been the almost universal opinion; see Hilary X. 18 (also 22)
   "Christ Himself is the source of His body."

   [296] See the peculiar doctrine of Marcellus in Zahn, Marcell., p. 177
   f., given differently by Dorner and Baur.

   [297] Examples of these disputed questions are supplied by all the
   writings of the Fathers dealing with the subject, down to the middle of
   the Fourth Century. A specially characteristic example is to be found
   in Philostorg., H. E., IX. 14. He tells us that in Constantinople, in
   the time of Valens, Demophilus, e.g., preached to soma tou huiou
   anakrathen te theoteti eis to adelotaton kechorekenai, as a drop of
   milk disappears when it trickles into the ocean.

   [298] See Vol. II., p. 280 ff. and above, p. 121.

   [299] The Westerns did the same after him; amid all the odd ideas that
   some of them produced they always clung to the humana et divina
   substantia, to the filius dei et filius hominis, and this distinction
   which had been supplied by the Creed, together with the unity of the
   person, became for them the rudder when it came to be a question of
   sailing through the stormy waves which had arisen in the East. See
   already Novatian, then Hilary, Ambrose, Augustin, Leo I. and also the
   less important theologians. It is extremely characteristic that
   Vincentius (Comm. 17, 18) still uses not the designation two natures,
   but two substances, and as against Apollinaris he finds the thesis
   perfectly sufficient "that Christ had two substances, the one divine,
   the other human, the one from the Father, the other from His Mother."
   Hilary very frequently employs the expressions "utraque natura",
   "persona"; he also writes de trin. IX. r4: "utriusque naturæ persona."
   In the "Statuta ecclesiæ antiqua" (Mansi III., p. 950) we have: "qui
   episcopus ordinandus est, antes examinetur . . . si incarnationem
   divinam non in patre neque in spiritu s. factam, sed in filio tantum
   credat, ut qui erat in divinitate dei patris filius, ipse fieret in
   homine hominis matris filius, deus verus ex patre, homo verus ex matre,
   carnem ex matris visceribus habens et animam humanam rationalem, simul
   in eo ambæ naturæ, i.e., deus et homo, una persona, unus filius, unus
   Christus." For details see below.

   [300] See Vol. II., p. 275 ff.

   [301] Nevertheless he strongly emphasised the thought of the
   deification of the human nature. On the other hand it is possible to
   attribute to him a doctrine of two natures.

   [302] Most instructive in this connection is the otherwise interesting
   Creed of Eudoxius of Constantinople (Caspari, Quellen IV., p. 176 ff.):
   pisteuomen eis hena, ton monon alethinon, Theon kai patera, ten monen
   phusin agenneton kai apatora, hoti medena sebein pephuken hos
   epanabebekuia; kai eis hena kurion, ton huion, eusebe ek tou sebein ton
   patera, kai monogene men, kreittona pases tes met' auton ktiseos,

   pathetos kai thnetos to kreittoni touton Theo, pathous te kai thanatou
   epekeina, dunatai einai homoousios. In the same way Eunomius, see
   Epiph. H. 69. 19, Ancor. 33.

   [303] Curiously enough Athanasius throughout merely touched on the
   Christology of Arius. He afterwards stated his views in greater detail
   in opposition to Apollinaris, see Atzberger, Logoslehre d. h. Athan.,
   p. 171 ff. In the "Orations against the Arians" the distinction between
   the divinity and humanity of Christ is brought prominently forward. The
   unity is next secured again by means of the deceptive formula that the
   flesh of the Logos was just his own flesh, his humanity (Orat. III. 32:
   hothen tes sarkos paschouses ouk en ektos tautes ho logos; dia touto
   gar autou legetai to pathos; see also the particularly characteristic
   word idiopoiesis used for the assumption of the flesh. In the case of
   Athanasius it may already be very clearly seen that it was not
   religious feeling, but solely the biblical tradition regarding Christ
   (His weakness and His capacity for being affected in a human way,)
   which led him in the direction of the doctrine of the two natures. That
   tradition was a serious stumbling-block. But Athanasius used neither
   the formula "duo phuseis" nor the other "mia phusis". (See also Reuter,
   Ztschr. f. K.-Gesch. VI., p. 184 f.) He speaks of divinity and humanity
   or of Theos logos and sarx. So far as I know the formula mia phusis was
   brought into use by Apollinaris, while, so far as I know, we first meet
   with the other, the duo phuseis, in Origen, and next in the mouths of
   the Arians who reproached the orthodox with their use of it--with the
   exception of a doubtful fragment of Melito, where, moreover, we have
   duo ousiai. The Cappadocians were the first to make use of the
   expression again in attacking Apollinaris, inasmuch as they made a
   sharp distinction between "two natures" and "two Sons". Owing to its
   use by the Cappadocians the formula of "two natures" had almost already
   become orthodox and had been regularly introduced into ecclesiastical
   language, or, to put it otherwise, the tradition which had come down
   from Origen and the presence of which is scarcely anywhere noticeable
   in Athanasius himself, penetrated into the Church in connection with
   this matter also by means of the Cappadocians. Cyril himself
   accordingly employed the expression. Thus the problem raised by Reuter,
   op. cit. 185 f., as to how it comes about that Cyril employs an
   Origenistic formula, which nevertheless is not to be found in
   Athanasius, is solved. We have to remember that there was a revival of
   Origenism in consequence of the theological work of the Cappadocians.
   For the rest "duo phuseis" as distinguished from "duo substantiæ" is to
   be regarded as a realistic speculative formula.

   [304] See especially lib. X. de trinit., Dorner I., pp. 1037-1071.

   [305] See the collection of passages referring to the matter in Dorner
   I., pp. 948-955. The Arian doctrine of the soma apsuchon of Christ had
   already been combated by Eustathius, see Dorner, op. cit. 966-969.

   u. Unters. z. Altchristl, Litt. Gesch, VII, 3, 4) in addition Jülicher
   in the Gött. Gel. Anz., 1893, No. 2.

   [308] According to Suidas, referring hack to Philostorgius, Athanasius
   seemed a child alongside of Apollinaris, Basil, and Gregory of
   Nazianzus.

   [309] The fullest account of the Apollinarian Christology (after Walch)
   is that given by Dorner I., p. 985 ff. (but cf. now Dräseke). Since
   that account was written, however, thanks to the labours of Caspari
   (Alte and neue Quellen z. Gesch. des Taufsymbols, 1879) and Dräseke, a
   new and rich supply of material has been brought forward. These
   scholars have shewn that the Apollinarians have foisted (from about
   400) writings by their master on recognised authorities, such as
   Gregor. Thaum., Athanasius, Felix of Rome, Julius of Rome, in order to
   accredit their theology. We still possess the greater part of these
   writings; see Caspari, Quellen, IV., p. 65 ff. (on the kata meros
   pistis); Dräseke in the Ztschr. f. K. Gesch. Vol. VI., VII., VIII.,
   IX.; Jahrb. f. protest. Theol., IX., X., XIII., Ztschr f. wiss. Theol.,
   XXVI., XXIX., XXX., collected together in the Monograph (Texte u.
   Unters. VII. 3, 4 by Loofs, Leontius von Byzanz, p. 92 ff.). The
   sources for Apollinaris previously known, i.e., the places where
   fragments are found, are besides Epiph., H. 77, Socrat., Sozom., the
   works of Athanasius (the genuineness of the work adv. Apoll. is
   disputed), of the Cappadocians, of Theodore and Theodoret.; see in
   addition the resolutions of Councils from 362 onwards, Mai, Script.
   Vet. nova Coll. T. VII. Spicil. X. 2 and catenas. Epiphanius treated
   Apollinaris in a friendly fashion, Athanasius corresponded with him,
   the Cappadocians at first revered him and always held him in high
   respect, while the Arian theologians extolled him as their ablest
   opponent. Cf. on this Vincent., Common. 15-20.

   [310] Gregor. Antir. 42. According to Apollinaris two knowing and
   willing beings could not possibly be united in one being. Here we can
   see the Antiochian tradition which had come from Paul of Samosata: duo
   teleia hen genesthai ou dunatai. (So Apollinaris according to what
   purports to be the work of Athanasius against him, I. 2 Migne, Vol. 26,
   p. 1096.)

   [311] Ei anthropo teleio sunephthe Theos teleios, duo an esan, heis men
   phusei huios Theou, heis de thetos (Dräseke, Texte u. Unters. VII. 3,
   4, p. 388).

   [312] There are three theses which Apollinaris everywhere attacks, and
   from these we can easily understand what his own theology is. He wishes
   to disown (1) the view that there are two Sons, (2) the idea that
   Christ was an anthropos entheos, the view he attributed to Marcellus,
   since heathens and Jews could also believe in a Christ of this kind,
   (3) the view that Christ was a free and therefore a changeable being.
   He accordingly directs his attacks (1) against the Gnostic division of
   Christ and Jesus, (2) against Paul, Marcellus, and Photinus, (3)
   against Origen and Arius.

   [313] Antir. 51.

   [314] Athan. adv. Apoll. I. 2: hopou teleios anthropos, ekei hamartia.
   It is just from the nous; that sin springs. In addition Antir. 40, 51:
   He sarx edeito atreptou nou, me hupopiptontos aute dia epistemosunes
   astheneian, alla sunarmozontos auten abiastos heauto . . . Ou dunatai
   sozein ton kosmon ho anthropos men on kai te koine ton anthropon
   phthora hupokeimenos. We must accordingly seriously accept the thought
   that in Christ the Godhead was not a force, but to hupokeimenon. Antir.
   39: Ou sozetai to anthropinon genos di' analepseos nou kai holou
   anthropou, alla dia proslepseos sarkos. Apollinaris was conscious that
   he was the first to perceive what the incarnation of God meant.

   [315] Apollinaris assumes the existence in Christ of what is indeed a
   composite nature, but which is nevertheless a nature possessing
   oneness. The mia phusis tou logou sesarkomene is his formula (see the
   letter to the Emperor Jovian in Hahn, Symbole 2, § 120: homologoumen
   . . . ou duo phuseis ton hena huion, mian proskuneten kai mian
   aproskuneton, alla mian phusin tou Theou logou sesarkomenen kai
   proskunoumenen meta tes sarkos autou mia proskunesei.) He, besides,
   expressly teaches that the sarkotheis ouk estin heteros para ton
   asomaton; he demands a perfect antimethistasis ton onomaton and he here
   reasons again mainly from the standpoint of Greek religious feeling:
   Alles kai alles ousias mian einai kai ten auten proskunesin athemiton,
   toutestin poietou kai poiematos, Theou kai anthropou. Mia de he
   proskunesis tou Christou, kai kata touto en to heni onomati noeitai
   Theos kai anthropos. Ouk ara alle kai alle ousia Theos kai anthropos;
   alla mia kata sunthesin Theou pros soma anthropinon, or adunaton ton
   auton kai proskuneton heauton eidenai kai me. Adunaton ara ton auton
   einai Theon te kai anthropon ex holoklerou, all' en monoteti sunkratou
   phuseos theikes sesarkomenes, see still other passages in Dorner I., p.
   999 ff. The flesh must therefore be adored also; for it constitutes an
   inseparable part of the one substance: he sarx tou kuriou proskuneitai
   katho hen esti prosopon kai hen zoon met' autou.

   [316] Mai VII., p. 70 (the letter of the Apollinarian Julian): Ek
   kinetou kai akinetou, energetikou te kai pathetikou, ton Christon einai
   mian ousian kai phusin suntheton, heni te kai mono kinoumenen
   thelemati; kai mia energeia ta te thaumata pepoiekenai kai ta pathe,
   monos kai protos ho pater hemon Apollinarios ephthenxato, to
   kekrummenon pasi kataphotisas musteprion; see also l.c., p. 301, where
   Apollinaris himself has developed the thought of the one being (hen
   zoon) composed of the ruling moving principle of activity, and the
   soma, the passive principle: sarx, Theou sarx genomene, zoon esti meta
   tauta suntetheisa eis mian phusin. P. 73: Oudemia diairesis tou logou
   kai tes sarkos autou en theiais pheretai graphais; all' esti mia
   phusis, mia hupostasis, mia energeia.

   [317] Apollinaris has not himself put in words those furthest reaches
   of his speculations in any of the numerous confessional formulæ of his
   which we possess. (See, e.g., the two Confessions in the kata meros
   pistis.) Much, too, of what is said by Gregory in his letters to
   Kledonius and by Gregory of Nyssa in the Antir. may be exaggerated, but
   as regards the main point Apollinaris's own words prove that he really
   went the length of attributing the moment of the sarx in some form or
   other to the Logos in the pre-temporal existence. He conceived of the
   nature of the Logos as that of the mediator; it was only by so
   conceiving of it that the mia phusis could get justice done to it, and
   he accordingly does not hesitate to take something from the Godhead
   itself, without detriment to its homousia. The essential characteristic
   of the pneuma which the Logos is, consists in this, that it includes
   the idea of the mediator, i.e., the type of humanity. In this sense he
   could say: he theia sarkosis ou ten archen apo tes parthenou eschen
   (Antir. 15), or (c. 13), prouparchei ho anthropos Christos, ouch hos
   eterou ontos par' auton tou pneumatos, tout' esti tou Theou, all' hos
   tou kuriou en te tou theanthropou phusei theiou pneumatos ontos. The
   Logos was already man before He appeared on earth, since the statement
   holds good: auten tou huiou theoteta ex arches anthropon einai. This
   conception, however, which was not meant to take from the historical
   fact of the incarnation, but was intended, on the contrary, to make its
   reality certain, now led him further to the idea that neither is the
   Godhead present in the Logos, in its totality: oudemia mesotes
   hekateras echei tas akrotetas ex holoklerou, alla merikos
   epimemigmenas. As the middle colour between black and white has not
   merely the white in it in an imperfect way, but also the black, as
   spring is half winter and half summer, as the mule is neither wholly
   horse nor wholly ass, so the mixture of divinity and humanity in the
   Logos, at least in the Logos as appearing on the earth, is of such a
   kind that neither element is entirely perfect: oute anthropos holos
   oute Theos. How far the doctrine of Apollinaris did actually lead to
   this conclusion--and we have here a clear example of the imperfect way
   in which the Homousia was understood amongst the neo-orthodox of the
   East; how far his opponents, including not only the Gregories, but also
   Theodoret, H. F. IV. 8, were justified in asserting that his Trinity
   was composed of a great, a greater, and a greatest; how far he made use
   of the old traditional image of the sun and the sunbeam in order to
   build up on the basis of the Homousia a graduated Trinity, are points
   which still require to be thoroughly investigated in the light of the
   new material we now possess. But if his Christ actually was the middle
   being his opponents represent it to have been, one can only be
   astonished to observe how in the case of Apollinaris speculation
   regarding Christ has returned to the point it started from. For this
   Christ is actually the Pauline Christ, the heavenly spiritual being (en
   morphe Theou), who assumed the body, i.e., the flesh, neither ho Theos
   nor man, but as God and as a man, who is nevertheless the mediator or
   reconciler between God and man because being without sin He has done
   away with sin and death in His body and consequently for humanity
   generally--the second Adam, the heavenly man. It cannot be doubted
   either but that Apollinaris formed his views chiefly on the New
   Testament; for he was above all an exegete--though unfortunately what
   is his in the numerous collections of passages, in those of Cramer
   pre-eminently, has up till now not been ascertained nor has any test
   been applied to find out what belongs to him--and he endeavoured to be
   true to the words of the Bible without applying the allegorical method
   of Origen, as his notable adherence to the primitive Christian
   eschatology, the reign of a thousand years, proves.

   [318] The confessional formulæ of Apollinaris and his pupils emphasised
   as a rule only the homousia of the Logos, the assumption of flesh from
   Mary and the perfect unity (hen prosopon kai mian ten proskunesin tou
   logou kai tes sarkos). The somewhat long creed in the k. m. pistis is
   the most instructive, see Caspari IV., p. 18, there too, p. 20, will be
   found the shorter one, and at p. 24 that of the Apollinarian Jobius. In
   the latter we have: homologo ton kurion Iesoun Christon, ex aionos men
   asarkon Theon logon, ep' eschaton de aionon sarka ex hagias parthenou
   henosanta heauto, einai Theon kai anthropon, hena kai ton auton,

   all' autou tou Theou logou, tou demiourgou, tou homoousiou to Theo,
   toutestin te asomato ousia tou arretpu patros. It is difficult to say
   whether the long Creed printed by Caspari, p. 163 f., and which in its
   formalism bears a resemblance to the Athanasian, is Apollinarian or
   Monophysite.

   [319] Apollinaris did not deny the homousia of Christ with humanity,
   but he conceived of it as a likeness in nature = homoioma. The later
   Apollinarians even emphasised the homousia, but they were thinking of a
   body and the psuche sarkike.

   [320] See Dräseke, Texte and linters. VIII. 3. 4., p. 28 f.

   [321] Athan. Tom. ad. Antioch. 7. He first establishes the truth that
   the Word of God did not come in Christ to a holy man as it came to the
   prophets, on the contrary: autos ho logos sarx egeneto, kai en morphe
   Theou huparchon elabe doulou morphen, ek te tes Marias to kata sarka
   gegenetai anthropos di' hemas, kai houto teleios kai holokleros to
   anthropinon genos eleutheroumenon apo tes hamartias en auto kai
   zoopoioumenon ek ton nekron eisagetai eis ten basileian ton ouranon.
   Then it is further said: homologoun gar kai touto, hoti ou soma
   apsuchon oud' anaistheton oud' anoeton eichen ho soter, oude gar hoion
   te en, tou kuriou di' hemas anthropou genomenou, anoeton einai to soma
   autou, oude somatos monou, alla kai psuches en auto to logo soteria
   gegonen. Finally, however, the identity of the Son of God and the Son
   of man is strongly emphasised. It was the same person who asked about
   Lazarus and who raised him from the dead. He asked anthropinos, He
   raised from the dead theikos.

   [322] In the way in which it kept firmly together, in its veneration
   for the master, in its activity and vivacity and finally in the efforts
   made by the members of it to carry their point in the Church, the
   school of Apollinaris reminds us of the school of Lucian. Like the
   latter it was chiefly an exegetical school, and at the same time like
   it it was a school for theologico-philosophical method after the manner
   of the Aristotelian dialectic. Such conditions always give rise to a
   peculiar arrogance and to a confident feeling of superiority to
   everybody else. "It was our father Apollinaris who first and who alone
   uttered and put in a clear light the mystery which had been hidden from
   all--namely, that Christ became one being out of the moving and the
   immovable": it is thus that one Apollinarian writes to another and in
   so doing shews that the real interest of the school was in the
   methodical and the formal. The fact that afterwards falsification was
   carried to such an extraordinary extent in the school is a sign that
   the Epigoni aspired to secure power at all costs.

   [328] See several letters of Basil, the two letters of Gregory of
   Nazianzus to Kledonius and his ep. ad. Nectar. sive Orat. 46, also the
   Antirrhet. of Gregory of Nyssa and his work ad Theophil. They enter
   upon an examination of the Scripture proofs of Apollinaris and also of
   his argument that the Logos could not have assumed a rational, free
   nature, since in this case he must necessarily have destroyed freedom,
   which is not, however, the Creator's way of doing: phthora tou
   autexousiou zoou to me einai autexousion; ou phtheiretai de he phusis
   hupo tou poiesantos auten; ouk ara henoutai ho anthropos Theo (Antirrh.
   45). Gregory's remarks on this are extremely weak. The only striking
   thing is to be found in the detailed arguments in which it is shewn
   that the picture of the Christ of the Gospels includes a human soul;
   for it was neither the God-Logos nor the irrational flesh which was
   sad, which trembled, feared, etc., but the human spirit; see also
   Athan. c. Apoll. I., 16-18.

   [329] The definite formula "duo phuseis" without some qualifying clause
   is rarely met with in the East before the time of the great
   Antiochians, though it is otherwise in the West. But expressions such
   as that of Eusebius, H. E. I. 2, 1, are, however, frequent: Dittou
   ontos tou kat' auton tropou, kai tou men somatos eoikotos kephale he
   Theos epinoeitai, tou de posi paraballomenou, he ton en hemin anthropon
   homoiopathe tes hemon auton heneken hupedu soterias, genoit' an hemin,
   etc. The Arian theologians always reproached the orthodox with teaching
   the doctrine of duo phuseis.

   [330] It is unnecessary to give any summary of the numerous different
   forms in which the Cappadocians set forth their view as against
   Apollinaris (see Ullmann, Gregor. v. Naz., p. 276 ff.; Dorner I., pp.
   1035 f., 1075 f.; Schwane II., pp. 366-390), for what they wish and do
   not get at--the unity, namely--is obvious, while their terminology on
   the other hand is still uncertain. At this time expressions and images
   of the most varied kind were in use (duo phuseis, duo ousiai, mia
   phusis, sarkosis, enanthropesis, theanthropos, henosis ousiodes,
   henosis phusike, henosis kata metousian, sunkrasis, mixis, sunapheia,
   metousia, enoikesis, the humanity of Christ was described as
   katapetasma or parapetasma as naos, as oikos, as himation, as organon.
   In the writings of the Cappadocians most of these terms are still found
   side by side; the only idea which is definitely rejected is that of the
   change into flesh whether by kenosis or by actual transmutation. The
   unchangeable; the divinity, remains unchangeable; it merely takes to
   itself what it did not possess. How the unlimited united with the
   limited is just the point which is left obscure. We might imagine we
   were listening to a teacher of the period before Irenæus when we hear
   Gregory of Nazianzus say that the unlimited dealt with us through the
   medium of the flesh as through a curtain, because we were not capable
   of enduring His pure Godhead (Orat. 39, 13, similarly Athanasius). He
   also teaches that Christ by assuming humanity did not become two out of
   one (masc.), but out of two became one (neut.). We can imagine it is
   Apollinaris who is speaking when he further declares that God is both,
   the one who assumes and what is assumed, and uses the word sunkrasis in
   this connection (Orat. 37. 2, this word is frequently met in
   Methodius). This thought is expressed in an almost stronger form in
   Orat. 38. 13 (see Orat. 29. 19): "Christ is one out of the two opposite
   things, out of flesh and spirit, of which the one deifies while the
   other was deified, o tes kaines mixeos, o tes paradoxou kraseos! The
   eternally existing comes into being, the uncreated is created, the
   unlimited limits itself, since--and now the thought takes an
   Origenistic turn--the rational soul is the means whereby a union is
   brought about between the Godhead and the gross flesh." As if it were
   possible to stop short at this function of the human soul, as if the
   human soul did not include the free will regarding which Gregory here
   maintains a prudent silence. On the other hand, however, Gregory
   maintains in opposition to Apollinaris that "there are undoubtedly two
   natures, God and man; soul and body are also in Him, but there are not
   two Sons or Gods, since there are not two men in one, because Paul
   speaks of an inner and an outer man"--this argument is specially weak
   since it is just the argument which Apollinaris could make use of. "To
   put it in a word: He is one and again He is another, in so far as He is
   Saviour, but He is not one person and again another person--God forbid.
   For both exist in the union which has been accomplished since God is
   made human and man is made divine, or however it may be expressed" (Ep.
   ad. Cledon. I.). Gregory as a pupil of Origen sees no difficulty in
   putting two different substances together into one. But neither does he
   follow the Chalcedonian Creed since with him it was not a question of a
   union of divinity and humanity in a third, but a question of fusion,
   and this spite of the duo phuseis. In their struggle with Apollinaris
   the Cappadocians nowhere intentionally arrived at the line of thought
   followed by the school of Antioch at a later time, though, what is very
   rare, a formula here and there has an Antiochian appearance. They are
   at bottom Monophysites, although they were the first to make the
   ominous "two natures" of Origen fit for church use. It was only because
   they were compelled that they trouble themselves about the question of
   freedom in Christ, and the thought once occurred to Gregory of Nyssa
   (Antir. 48) that Christ would not have possessed any arete if He had
   been without autexousion. What most strongly impressed the Christian
   world in general was certainly the view that Christ had to give His
   body as a ransom for our body, His soul for our soul, His spirit for
   our spirit. There was undoubtedly some real justification for this
   thought since Apollinaris, or his pupils, seem to have carried their
   Paulinism so far (for so at least it would appear from some undoubtedly
   uncertain indications in the work of Athan. adv. Apollo, sec. I., 2
   sq., II. 11) as to assert that Christ had only done away with the sin
   and death belonging to the flesh and thus renewed the flesh, but that
   the purification of the spirit was something which each individual had
   to carry out for himself by the imitation of Christ on the basis of
   that purification; in this sense redemption was not yet perfect. Sarkos
   men kainoteta Christos epidedeiktai kath' homoiosin, tou de phronountos
   en hemin ten kainoteta dia mimeseos kai homoioseos kai apoches tes
   hamartias hekastos en heauto epideiknutai (I. 2) or te homoiosei kai te
   mimesei sozesthai tous pisteuontas kai ou te anakainisei (II. 11). In
   opposition to this thesis, which probably really originated with
   Apollinaris since it is in harmony with the traditions of the school of
   Antioch, his opponents had certainly good reason for emphasising the
   full extent of the work of Christ if the whole structure of the faith
   of that time were not to be rendered insecure. Kenotic statements such
   as we meet with in Hilary are, so far as I know, not to be found in the
   writings of the Cappadocians.

CHAPTER III.

  THE DOCTRINE OF THE PERSONAL UNION OF THE DIVINE AND HUMAN NATURES IN THE
  INCARNATE SON OF GOD.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The course of theological development in ecclesiastical antiquity may
   in some parts be compared to the windings of a descending spiral.
   Starting from any given point we seem to be always getting further
   away, and finally we come back to it again; only we are a stage lower
   down. The great Trinitarian controversy of the Fourth Century has its
   starting-point in the Christological doctrine of Paul of Samosata:
   Christ, the deified man inspired by the power of God and one with God
   in loving affection and in energy of will. Opposed to this doctrine was
   the belief that Christ is co-substantial with God, the Theos
   homoousios, who has become man. This article of faith established
   itself after Arianism and other middle doctrines had been rejected. But
   when in the course of the development both the perfect Godhead and the
   perfect humanity of Christ had been elevated to the rank of an article
   of faith, it looked as if the unity could be secured only by once more
   following the path taken by Paul of Samosata, by emphasising the
   spiritual and moral unity of God and man. This idea of the unity was
   indeed made more difficult now that the God in Christ had to be
   conceived of as a personal being, but any other unity no longer offered
   itself to thinking people who were unwilling to give up clear views on
   the subject. And it was still permissible to hold this view of the
   unity; for though the doctrine of Apollinaris had been repudiated, no
   fixed idea was thereby arrived at as to the nature of the union of the
   divine and the human. All the conceivable forms in which the conception
   of the union of the divine and the human might be put, were still at
   anyone's disposal, especially as no single term was yet in regular use.

   As it was the Antiochian Apollinaris who worked out to its logical
   conclusion the doctrine of the Trinity as regards Christology, so it
   was his compatriots who worked out to its logical conclusion the
   formula "perfect God and perfect man." This conclusion was indeed the
   opposite of the doctrine of Apollinaris. He had shewn every clear
   thinker that it was impossible to carry out the idea of the incarnation
   without deducting something from the essence of humanity, and that the
   incarnate one could have only one nature (mia phusis). But if the human
   nature in the incarnate one was nevertheless to be complete,--and the
   Church maintained that it was,--then the conception of the incarnation
   would have to get a new form. And if piety should suffer in the
   process, well, there was and there still is a stronger interest than
   that of piety--namely, that of truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 1. The Nestorian Controversy.

   I. The most zealous opponents of Apollinaris were his compatriots and
   scientific friends, the Antiochian theologians, distinguished by
   methodical study of Scripture, sober thinking in imitation of
   Aristotle, and the strictest asceticism. They alone had during many
   decades worked out the Christological dogma in a scientific way in
   opposition to Arius and Apollinaris. Following the example of Diodorus
   of Tarsus, Theodorus of Mopsuestia treated it with the greatest fulness
   by making use of the philosophical theological fundamental conceptions
   which Paul of Samosata had already employed, and by turning to account
   the biblical results of the exegetical labours of the school of
   Antioch. The Antiochians based their position on the Homoousios and did
   not wish either to interfere with the divine personality of the Logos.
   But at the same time they fully accepted the perfect humanity of
   Christ. The most important characteristic of perfect humanity is its
   freedom. The thought that Christ possessed a free will was the
   lode-star of their Christology. To this was added the other thought
   that the nature of the Godhead is absolutely unchangeable and incapable
   of suffering. Both of these thoughts have at least no concern with the
   belief in the real redemption of humanity from sin and death through
   the God-man. The Christology of the Antiochians was therefore not
   soteriologically determined; on the contrary, the
   realistic-soteriological elements were attached to it by way of
   supplement. [331]

   In the view of the Antiochians it followed from the premises above
   mentioned, that Christ possessed, strictly speaking, two natures and
   that the supposition of a natural union (henosis phusike, henosis kath'
   hupostasin) was prejudicial both to the humanity and the divinity of
   Christ, as the doctrines of Arius and Apollinaris shewed. It was, on
   the contrary, necessary to maintain that the God-Logos assumed a
   perfect man of the race of David and united him with Himself. He dwelt
   (enoikesis) in the man Jesus from the time of the conception. This
   indwelling [332] is to be conceived of according to the analogy of the
   indwelling of God in men generally. It is not a substantial indwelling,
   not kat' ousian, for this involves a transmutation or else limits the
   God-head. Nor is it any mere indwelling of inspiration, but a gracious
   indwelling,kata charin (kat' eudokian), i.e., God out of grace and in
   accordance with His own good pleasure has united Himself with the man
   Jesus in the way in which He unites Himself with every pious soul, only
   that in the case of Jesus the union was besides a perfect one in virtue
   of the perfection of his piety. It is to be thought of as a species of
   combination (sunapheia), or we may express it thus: God dwells in the
   man as in a temple. [333] The human nature, therefore, as nature
   remains purely unchanged, for grace leaves the nature as it is. This
   nature, then, like all human nature, was also a free self-developing
   nature. As man Jesus Christ had to pass through all the stages of moral
   growth as a free self-acting agent. Over him and in him God did
   undoubtedly always hold sway as a supporting power, but He did not
   interfere with the development of the character belonging to his human
   nature, which by independent action confirmed itself in the good.

   In accordance with this the union was only a relative one (henosis
   schetike) and was at the outset only relatively perfect, i.e., the
   God-Logos united Himself with the man Jesus as early as the time of his
   conception, forseeing of what sort he would be (kata pro?gnosin hopoios
   tis estai), but this union merely began then in order to become a more
   intimate union at every stage of the human development. [334] It
   consisted in the common feeling and energy of the two natures as well
   as in the common direction given to the will; it was therefore
   essentially a moral union. By means of it, however, there appeared at
   the close of the human development of Jesus and in virtue of the
   elevation which was granted to him as the reward of his perseverance, a
   subject or individual worthy of adoration, (I separate the natures, I
   unite the adoration: chorizo tas phuseis, heno ten proskunesin). Still
   we must not speak of two sons or two lords, but, on the contrary, we
   have to adore one person, whose unity, however, is not a substantial
   one, but kata charin. The formula of the distinction of the natures and
   the unity of the person is to be found in Theodore. But the unity of
   the person is the unity of names, of honour, of adoration. [335] Since,
   however, each nature in Christ is at the same time person, it was here
   that the peculiar difficulty of the Antiochian Christology made its
   appearance. The union does not at bottom result in any unity of the
   person; it is merely nominal. The Antiochians had two persons in
   Christ, a divine and a human (duo hupostaseis or prosopa). When, spite
   of this, they spoke of one, this was really a third, or rather, to put
   it more correctly, it was only in the combination (sunapheia), and
   indeed in the last resort it was only in the relation of believers to
   Jesus Christ that the latter appeared as a unity.

   It was in accordance with this that the conception of the Incarnation
   took its shape. Two natures are two subjects; for a subjectless or
   impersonal spiritual nature does not exist Since accordingly one
   subject cannot become the other, for if it did it would either have to
   cease to exist itself or would have to transform itself, it is also
   impossible that the Logos can have become man. It is only in appearance
   that He became something through the incarnation, through "becoming
   man"; in reality He assumes something in addition to what He had. Since
   the sphere of the unity is solely the will, the attributes,
   experiences, and acts of the two natures are to be kept strictly apart.
   It was the man only who was born; it was he who suffered, trembled, was
   afraid, died. To maintain that this could be said of God is both absurd
   and blasphemous. So too accordingly Mary is not to be called the mother
   of God, not at least in the proper sense of the term. [336] But the
   Christian adores Jesus Christ as the one Lord, because God has also
   raised to divine dignity the man who in feeling was united with the
   Logos so as to form a unity.

   In accordance with this conception, though certainly invitis autoribus,
   the humanity in the person of Christ came again to the front as a
   humanity which experienced merely the effects produced by the divine
   Logos who remained in the background. Since the distinction between
   person and nature was not fundamental, was not made in a realistic way,
   that is, and since the possibility of the substantial union of two
   persons was denied as we can see already from the case of Paul of
   Samosata, since further, in opposition to Paul, the Godhead in Christ
   was recognised as being a substantial Godhead, unity was not attained,
   as opponents at a later time justly observed. When again, as in the
   case of the Antiochians, an approach was made towards this unity, then
   the divine factor, contrary to the pre-supposition which was strictly
   clung to, threatened to become an inspiring and supporting power, and
   hence the reproach brought against them of Ebionitism, Somosatenism,
   Photinianism, or of Judaising. It would appear that the Antiochians
   rarely took the doctrine of redemption and perfection as the
   starting-point of their arguments, or when they did, they conceived of
   it in such a way that the question is not of a restitution, but of the
   still defective perfection of the human race, a question of the new
   second katastasis. The natural condition of humanity, of which
   liability to death forms a part, can be improved; humanity can be
   raised above itself by means of a complete emancipation from the sense
   life and by moral effort. This possibility, which lies open to everyone
   who summons up courage to raise himself by the exercise of free will
   above his inherited nature, has become a fact through Christ the second
   Adam. This fact has an immeasurable significance, for its effects now
   uphold everyone who honestly strives so to raise himself. The second
   Adam who has already appeared will once more appear from heaven epi to
   pantas eis mimesin agein heautou--in order to bring all to imitate him.
   He already points out to all "the path to the angelic life", and,
   judging from the way in which they sometimes work out the thought, it
   almost looks as if in the view of the Antiochians the whole thing
   reduced itself to this alone. The hints given here towards a spiritual
   conception of the redemption through Christ have not, as one can see,
   resulted from perceiving that everything depends on a transformation of
   the feelings and will, and in the case of the Antiochians themselves
   they have by no means entirely displaced the realistic and mystical
   conception of redemption. In the indefinite form which is peculiar to
   them, they were thoughts of reason and results of exegesis, but not
   thoughts of faith. We hail them as cheering proofs of the fact that the
   feeling of the spiritual character of the Christian religion had not at
   that time wholly died out amongst the Greeks; but there can be no doubt
   of this, that these Antiochians were further away from the thought of
   redemption as the forgiveness of sins and regeneration than from the
   idea of a realistic redemption. While in Christology they illustrated
   in an admirable way the weak side and in fact the impossibility of this
   idea, they did not understand how to point these out in reference to
   soteriology itself. The latter was with them always vague and tinged
   with a strongly moralistic element. Its connection with the Christology
   was loose and indefinite, while the development of the latter in the
   form of positive doctrines was no less questionable, contradictory and
   uncouth than the theses of their opponents; for the Antiochians out of
   one being made two and thereby introduced an innovation into the Church
   of the East. Only Gnostics had before them taught the doctrine of two
   strictly different natures in Christ. The fact too that the redemption
   work of Christ was essentially attributed to the man Jesus and not to
   God was a further innovation. It was a flagrant contradiction that
   Theodore would not entertain the idea of two Sons although he assumed
   the presence of two natures and rejected the thought of an impersonal
   nature. But though we might criticise the Christology of the
   Antiochians still more severely, we must not forget that they held up
   before the Church the picture of the historical Christ at a time when
   the Church in its doctrinal formulæ was going further away from Him.
   One has indeed to add that they also directed attention to the
   incomprehensible essence of the God-Logos which ostensibly remained
   behind this picture, and did not on that account possess the power of
   presenting the historical Christ to the minds of men in a forcible way.
   But still that these theologians should have done what they did at that
   time was of immeasurable importance. It is to them the Church owes it
   that its Christology did not entirely become the development of an idea
   of Christ which swallowed up the historical Christ. And there is still
   something else for which these Antiochians are to be praised. Although
   they professed to preserve the traditional elements of dogma as a
   whole, they nevertheless essentially modified them by perceiving that
   every spiritual nature is a person and that what gives character and
   value to the person is feeling and will. This view, which was inherited
   from the Adoptionists and Paul, restores to the Christian religion its
   strictly spiritual character. But the Antiochians as Easterns were able
   to get possession of this knowledge only in a way which led from
   religion to moralism, because they based the spiritual on freedom,
   while again they understood freedom in the sense of independence even
   in relation to God. It was Augustine in his thought of liberty as
   "adhærere deo" and as "necessitas boni" who first united the most
   ardent piety with the recognition of Christianity as the
   spiritual-moral religion. It is, however, worth remembering that alone
   of all the Easterns the Antiochians and the theologians who sympathised
   with them took an interest in the Augustinian-Pelagian
   controversy--though they undoubtedly sided with Pelagius. For this
   interest proves that spite of the Eastern fog of mysteries, they were
   accessible to the freer air in which that controversy was fought out.
   Their opponents in the East wished to have mystery and spiritual
   freedom side by side; they, however, strove to lift the whole of
   religion up into the sphere of the latter--and they led it in the
   direction of moralism. [337] What confused the Antiochian theology and
   involved it in contradictions was apparently the load of tradition,
   i.e., the adhesion to the belief that Jesus Christ possessed a divine
   nature. This belief, however, constituted the strong foundation of the
   theology of their opponents. Their Christology was built up on this
   thesis. For the Antiochians it was simply a fact to which they had to
   adapt themselves, although they had not themselves felt its truth in
   this form.

   The view adopted by the Alexandrians, above all by Cyril, is
   undoubtedly the ancient view, that namely of Irenæus, Athanasius, and
   the Cappadocians, even when we make allowance for the falsification of
   tradition by the Apollinarians. The interest they had in seeing in
   Christ the most perfect unity of the divine and human, and therefore
   their interest in the reality of our redemption, determined the
   character of the development of the doctrines. Up till the year 431,
   and even beyond that time, this was wanting in formal thoroughness and
   scientific precision. This is as little an accident as the fact that
   Athanasius supplied no scientific doctrine of the Trinity. The belief
   in the real incarnation of God was only capable of the scientific
   treatment which Apollinaris had given it. If this were forbidden then
   theologians were debarred from all treatment of the subject with the
   exception of the merely analytic and descriptive or scholastic mode of
   treatment. This latter was not, however, yet in existence. But also
   apart from this, belief in the real incarnation simply demanded a
   forcible and definite statement of the secret, nothing more: siope
   proskuneistho to arreton--let the secret be adored in silence. We must
   live in the feeling of this secret. This is why Cyril also stated his
   faith in what was essentially a polemical form only; he would not have
   taken long to have given a purely positive statement of it. Therefore
   it is that without knowing it he has recourse to Apollinarian works
   when he wishes to bring forward a plain and intelligible formula in
   opposition to the Antiochians and so to make the mystery clearer--and
   he is continually in danger of over-stepping the limits of his own
   religious thought--and therefore it is finally, that his terminology
   has so little fixity about it. [338] Still he vindicated the religious
   thought of Greek piety: ("If the God-Logos did not suffer for us in a
   human way then He did not accomplish our salvation in a divine way, and
   if He was only man or a mere instrument then we are not truly
   redeemed." "Our Immanuel would not in any way have benefited us by His
   death if He had been a man; but we are redeemed because the God-Logos
   gave His own body to death.") Neither Cyril's personal character nor
   the way in which he devised and carried on the controversy ought to be
   allowed to lead us astray as regards this fact: for his Christianity
   did not succeed in making him just.

   It was as easy for Cyril to formulate the thought of faith as it was
   for Athanasius and the Cappadocians. Faith does not in his case start
   from the historical Christ, but from the Theos logos, and is occupied
   only with Him. By the Incarnation the God-Logos incorporated with
   Himself the whole human nature and still remained the same. He did not
   transform Himself, but He took up humanity into the unity of His
   substance, without losing any of it; on the contrary, He honoured it
   and raised it into His divine substance. He is the same with human
   nature as He was before the Incarnation, the one indivisible subject
   which merely added something to itself just in order to take up into
   its nature this something thus added. Everything which the human body
   and the human soul of the God-Logos endured, He Himself endured, for
   they are His body and His soul. [339] The characteristic moments in
   this conception are "one and the same" (heis kai ho autos) that is, the
   God-Logos, "the making the flesh His own by way of accommodation"
   (idian poiein ten sarka oikonomikos), "He remembered who He was"
   (memeneke hoper en), "out of two natures one" (ek duo phuseon heis), or
   "the joining of two natures in an unbroken union without confusion and
   unchangeably" (suneleusis duo phuseon kath' henosin adiaspaston
   asunchutos kai atreptos), "the Logos with His own flesh" (ho logos meta
   tes idias sarkos), hence the "physical union" (henosis phusike) or
   "hypostatic union" (kath' hupostasin), and finally, "one nature of the
   God-Logos made flesh" (mia phusis tou Theou logou sesarkomene), [340]
   yet "not so that the difference of the two natures is done away with by
   the union" (ouch' hos tes ton phuseon diaphoras aneremenes dia ten
   henosin). Cyril scarcely touched upon the distinction between phusis
   (ousia) and hupostasis, which had nevertheless already come to be
   current among the Antiochians so far as Christology was concerned;
   still he never says "of two hypostases" (ek duo hupostaseon) or "a
   union in nature" (henosis kata phusin). [341] He was not able to make
   that distinction, because in his view phusis and hupostasis meant the
   same thing as applied to the divine nature, but not as applied to the
   human. What rather is really characteristic in Cyril's position is his
   express rejection of the view that an individual man was present in
   Christ, although he attributes to Christ all the elements of man's
   nature. [342] For Cyril, however, everything depends on the possibility
   and actuality of such a human nature, on the fact, namely, that in
   Christ a hypostatic union was reached and that this union forthwith
   purified and transfigured human nature generally. Christ can be the
   second Adam for men only if they belong to him in a material sense as
   they did to the first Adam, and they do belong to Him materially only
   if He was not an individual man like Peter and Paul, but the real
   beginner of a new humanity. Cyril's view, moreover, was determined as a
   whole by the realistic thought of of redemption. [343] Still it is not
   a matter of accident that he so frequently uses sarx for "human
   nature", although in opposition to Apollinaris he acknowledged the
   human conscious soul in Christ. It was only sarx, that he could freely
   employ straight off in this connection, not pneuma and psuche. The
   proposition that before the Incarnation there were two phuseis, but
   after it only one, is, however, of special importance for Cyril's
   conception of the Incarnation. This perverse formula, which Cyril
   repeats and varies endlessly, regards the humanity of Christ as having
   existed before the Incarnation, and therefore in accordance with the
   Platonic metaphysic, but does not do away with the humanity after the
   Incarnation, on the contrary, it merely transfers it entirely to the
   substance of the God-Logos. Both natures are now to be distinguished
   theoria mone--a phrase which he uses very frequently, i.e., it is in
   virtue of the physical or natural unity that the Logos has actually
   become man. This physical unity does not, however, mean that the
   Godhead thereby becomes capable of suffering: but the Logos suffers in
   His own flesh and was born of Mary as regards His own humanity. He is
   thus God crucified, (Theos staurotheis)--the Logos suffered without
   suffering, i.e., in His flesh (epathen o logos apathos, i.e, en
   sarki)--and Mary is theotokos, in so far as the sarx, which she bore
   constitutes an indissoluble unity with the Logos. (What belonged to the
   Logos thus became the property of the humanity, and again what belonged
   to the humanity became the property of the Logos--gegone toinun idia
   men tou logou ta tes anthropotetos, idia de palin tes anthropotetos ta
   autou logou). Therefore this sarx of Christ can in the Lord's Supper be
   the means of producing divine life, although it has not disappeared as
   human flesh. [344]

   Is this conception Monophysitism? It is necessary to distinguish here
   between the phraseology and what is actually stated. As regards their
   actual substance all conceptions may be described as Monophysite or
   Apollinarian which reject the idea that Christ was an individual man;
   for between the doctrine of the hypostatic union and the most logical
   Apthartodocetism there are only grades of difference. No hard and fast
   line can be drawn here, although very different forms of monophysitism
   were possible according as the consequences of the Incarnation for the
   divinity of Christ on the one hand, or for His humanity on the other
   were conceived of in a concrete way and definitely stated. But
   according to ecclesiastical phraseology only those parties are to be
   described as monophysite who rejected the deliverance of the Council of
   Chalcedon. But this deliverance presupposes the existence of factors
   which did not yet lie within the mental horizon of Cyril. In these
   circumstances we must content ourselves with saying that nowhere did
   Cyril intentionally deviate to the right hand, or to the left, from the
   line of thought followed by the Greek Church and its great Fathers in
   their doctrine of redemption. He was a Monophysite in so far as he
   taught that the Logos after the Incarnation continues to have as before
   one nature only; but as the opponent of Apollinaris he did not wish to
   mix the human nature with the divine in Christ. [345] The assertion of
   a perfect humanity, unmingled natures, must be allowed to stand, for it
   is really impossible to put in an intelligible form any part of these
   speculations which treat of substances as if they had no connection
   whatever with a living person. It is really not any more difficult to
   put up with the contradiction here than it is to tolerate the whole
   method of looking at the question. Both constitute the great mystery of
   the faith. Monophysitism, which limits itself to the statement that in
   Christ out of two perfect natures, divinity and humanity, one composite
   or incarnate divine nature has come into existence, and which will have
   nothing to do with the idea of a free will [346] in Christ, is
   dogmatically consistent. It has indeed no longer the logical satisfying
   clearness of the Apollinarian thesis; it involves an additional
   mystery, or a logical contradiction, still in return for this it
   definitely put into words the by no means unimportant element of
   "perfect humanity". But this Monophysitism, when distinctly formulated
   as henosis phousike, certainly made it plain to the Greeks themselves
   that it was no longer possible to reconcile the Christ of faith with
   the picture of Christ given in the Gospels; for the idea of the
   physical unity of the two natures and of the interchange of properties,
   which Cyril had worked out in a strict fashion, swallowed up what of
   the human remained in Him. Arrived at this point three possible courses
   were open. It was necessary either to revise the doctrine of redemption
   and perfection which had the above-mentioned statement as its logical
   result--a thing which was not to be thought of,--or else theologians
   would have to make up their minds still further to adapt the picture of
   the historical Christ to the dogmatic idea, i.e., to destroy it
   altogether, which was logical Monophysitism, or finally, it would be
   necessary to discover a word, or a formula, which would mark off the
   dogma of faith from Apollinarianism with still greater sharpness than
   had been done by the catchword "perfect humanity". It was therefore
   necessary to intensify the contradictions still further, so that it was
   no longer only the concrete union of the natures which appeared as the
   secret, but the conception of the union itself already involved a
   contradictio in adjecto and became a mystery. If it could be maintained
   that the natures had become united without being united, then on the
   outside everything seemed to be as it should be, and Apollinaris was as
   certainly beaten as Paul of Samosata--and this was maintained. But
   certainly no pupil of Athanasius or Cyril hit on a notion such as this,
   which paralysed the force of the thought: logus sarkotheis. A danger
   lurked here which had finally a momentous result. The expression of the
   faith which was constantly being burdened with fresh contradictions so
   that no legitimate element might be wanting to it, had to forfeit its
   strength. [347] Its place was finally taken by a complicated formula
   which it was no longer possible to make one's own through feeling, the
   mystery of conceptions put in the form of concrete ideas. If
   theologians might no longer teach as Apollinaris taught and in fact no
   longer quite in the way in which Cyril taught, they saw themselves
   under the necessity of using a complicated formula. But to begin with
   it seemed as if Cyril had carried his point. [348]

   The controversy broke out in Constantinople and was throughout carried
   on with ambitious designs and for the purposes of ecclesiastical
   policy. In the person of Nestorius an ascetic Antiochian was again
   raised to the dignity of Bishop of Constantinople (428). The bishop of
   the capital just because he was the bishop was an object of jealousy to
   the Alexandrian Patriarch and as an Antiochian he was doubly so. A
   conceited preacher and one who plumed himself on being an enemy of
   heretics, but not a man with any meanness about him, Nestorius, who was
   supported by his presbyter Anastasius, gave offence in the capital by
   using the catchwords of the Antiochian dogmatic and by the contest he
   engaged in against the description of Mary as theotokos. With great
   frankness Nestorius described the statements regarding the God who was
   wrapped in swaddling clothes and fastened to the Cross, as heathen
   fables. His Christology [349] was that of Theodore; it cannot be said
   that he developed it further; on the contrary, one can see the
   influence of Chrysostom. Nestorius seems scarcely to have mentioned the
   human development of Jesus, and he seems to have laid greater emphasis
   on the idea of the union than Theodore ("one Christ"), if also only in
   the form of the sunapheia and proskunesis; but he was, above all,
   concerned in getting rid of "the corruption of Arius and Apollinaris."
   Cyril took advantage of the excitement in the Capital, which would
   perhaps have quieted down spite of some unruly priests and monks, in
   order to stir up the Egyptian monks, the Egyptian clergy in
   Constantinople, and the imperial ladies. The result was an angry
   correspondence with Nestorius, who was, moreover, protected by the
   Emperor. Cyril wrote in a more dignified way than his rival, but the
   hierarchs since the days of Cyprian had always known better how to take
   up an outwardly dignified attitude than their opponents. The
   narrow-minded patriarch of the capital was characterised by a simple
   pride. [350] He expressed himself in an inconsiderate and imprudent way
   in his letters, and his conduct in his diocese was no less
   inconsiderate and imprudent, for there he went on with the work of
   deposition and attacked "Apollinarianism" as if it had been a red rag.

   The formula employed by the two opponents were no longer very
   different. Everything depended on how they were accentuated. Both spoke
   of two natures and one Christ, and the one wished as little to be an
   Apollinarian as the other did to be a "blasphemous" [351] Samosatene.
   Cyril did not deny that the God-head was incapable of suffering, and
   Nestorius was prepared to use even the formula theotokos with a
   qualification. [352] But in reality they were undoubtedly separated
   from each other by a deep gulf represented in the former case by the
   henosis phusike, (the physical union,) and in the latter by the henosis
   kata sunapheian, (the union by combination,) and they can scarcely be
   blamed if they indulged in specious arguments; for both views were
   intelligible only when one went behind the formulæ, and in the case of
   many if not actually in that of the leaders, ideas which went a great
   deal further were as a matter of fact concealed behind the formulæ.
   [353] Nestorius addressed himself to the Roman bishop Coelestin as a
   colleague of co-ordinate rank, Cyril did the same soon after as an
   informant moved by a sense of duty, and therewith the controversy came
   to have a universal importance. But owing to the interference of the
   Roman bishop on behalf of Cyril it also took a wholly unexpected turn;
   for there is not perhaps in the history of dogma a second fact of equal
   importance which so thoroughly deserves to be pronounced a scandal nor
   one which at the same is so little to the credit of its author, as the
   interference of the Pope on behalf of Cyril.

   He had indeed sufficient reason for doing this. Since the time of
   Athanasius and Julius, and in fact from the days even of Demetrius and
   Fabian, it had always been the traditional dogmatic policy of the Roman
   Chair to support the Alexandrian Patriarch, as conversely the latter in
   his struggle against the ambitious patriarch of New Rome necessarily
   looked for his natural ally in old Rome. [354] Further Nestorius had
   shewn himself unwilling to excommunicate right off the Pelagians who
   had been condemned by the Pope and who had fled to Constantinople.
   Finally, he had not in his writing generally given token of the
   submission which the Apostolic Chair already demanded. But what does
   that signify in face of the fact that Coelestin in interfering on
   behalf of Cyril disowned his western view and in the most frivolous
   fashion condemned Nestorius without having considered his teaching.
   That he did both things may be easily shewn. In his letter to the Pope
   Nestorius laid before the latter the formula "utraque natura quae per
   conjunctionem summam et inconfusam in una persona unigeniti adoratur"
   [355] ("the two natures which, perfectly joined together and without
   confusion, are adored in the one person of the only-begotten"). This
   was substantially the Western formula, and Coelestin himself held no
   other view. [356] He did not, however, trouble himself about the
   formula, put his own Christology on one side and declared in favour of
   Cyril, while he made everything depend on the one point "theotokos" in
   order at least to produce an appearance of difference, although this
   was just the very point regarding which Nestorius was prepared to make
   concessions.

   The Pope had determined to put down Nestorius. A Roman Synod (430)
   demanded of him immediate recantation on pain of excommunication. As if
   by way of insult Cyril was charged by the Pope himself with the duty of
   carrying the sentence out. Nestorius himself, whose Church was
   revolutionised, now urged the Emperor to call a General Council, and in
   addition to this collected a number of accusations against Cyril for
   the way in which he had discharged the duties of his office. To the
   twelve anathemas which an Alexandrian Council under the presidency of
   Cyril had served on him, and which embodied the teaching of Cyril in
   sharply cut phrases (theotokos gegenneke sarkikos sarka gegonota ton ek
   Theou logon--henosis kath' hupostasin--henosis phusike--sarx tou kuriou
   zoopoios,--the mother of God bore flesh born after the manner of flesh,
   the Logos of God--hypostatic union--natural union--the life-giving
   flesh of the Lord) he replied by twelve counter-anathemas. [357] This
   sealed the breach. The Emperor, displeased with Cyril, summoned a
   Council to meet at Ephesus at Whitsuntide 431. Cyril who appeared with
   some 50 bishops, here shewed how an Emperor, such as Theodosius was,
   ought to be treated. Without waiting for the arrival of the Syrians
   under John of Antioch, the cautious friend (?) of Nestorius, [358] the
   Egyptian party supported by the bishop of Ephesus, Memnon, on its own
   authority and spite of the opposition of the Imperial commissioner,
   constituted itself the Council, treated Nestorius who naturally did not
   appear at this meeting, but waited in the city for the Syrians, as an
   accused person, approved of all Cyril's declarations as being in
   harmony with Holy Scripture and the Nicene Creed, pronounced the
   deposition of Nestorius and declared him to have forfeited priestly
   fellowship. In opposition to this petty assembly, which did not set up
   any new creed, but which on the contrary took up the position that the
   sole question had reference to the Nicene Creed which was in danger,
   Nestorius and his friends, as soon as the Syrians arrived, held the
   legal Council under the presidency of the Imperial Commissioner and
   pronounced sentence of deposition on Cyril and Memnon. It was only now
   that the Papal legates arrived in Ephesus and they at once took the
   side of Cyril. [359] In accordance with their instructions they
   reopened the case pro forma, in order to exalt the authority of the
   Apostolic Chair. Cyril's party complied with this, and the Legates then
   agreed to everything which had been done, after all the documents had
   been once more read over. [360] With the cry, "the whole Council thanks
   the new Paul Coelestin, the new Paul Cyril, Coelestin the guardian of
   the faith, Coelestin who concurs with the Council: One Coelestin, one
   Cyril, one faith of the Council, one faith of the whole world," [361]
   this assembly closed, which sought to maintain the ancient Nicene faith
   and did maintain it, at which, however, there was no discussion, but at
   which unanimity was reached solely on the basis of a selection of
   authorities. [362]

   The following will be found in the historical accounts. The Emperor,
   instead of standing up for the right, allowed himself to be overawed.
   At first it is true the resolutions of Cyril's Council were annulled,
   but thereafter the controversy was to be settled in true Byzantine
   fashion by the removal of the leaders. The Emperor gave the force of
   law both to the deposition of Cyril and Memnon and to that of
   Nestorius. The Alexandrians, however, were united and followed one
   master, but this was not the case with the opposite party. Nestorius
   who was violent but not tenacious, resigned; soon, however, his
   isolation was to change to imprisonment. In the eyes of the Emperor the
   doctrine which he represented was by no means condemned; but Cyril
   succeeded in getting permission to resume possession of his bishopric,
   and by means of intrigue and bribery his party continued more and more
   to gain ground at the Court and the capital. Still he could not reckon
   on a victory as regards the dogmatic question; he had to be content
   with knowing that a man who was acceptable to him occupied the chair of
   Constantinople. The Emperor sought to bring about a union, and the
   friends of Nestorius became disunited. One section under the leadership
   of John of Antioch was prepared to come to terms, and to this party
   Theodoret, [363] the most distinguished Antiochian scholar, also
   belonged, though undoubtedly with a certain reserve. Another section
   actively resisted. Cyril's behaviour in the year 432-433 is little to
   his credit. To him it was of more importance to get the condemnation of
   his mortal enemy, Nestorius, carried through in the Church, than to
   preserve his dogmatic system pure. Thus he subscribed the creed
   submitted by the moderate Antiochians, without, however, retracting his
   earlier opinions, and in return for this got some of the heads of the
   opposite party, above all, John of Ephesus, to abandon Nestorius. Cyril
   could save his consistency by interpreting this Antiochian creed in
   accordance with his Christology; the friends of Nestorius were not able
   to escape the disgrace which they had brought upon themselves by their
   treachery towards their ill-used friend. But in a question which was
   for him a matter of faith Cyril had agreed to a compromise, in proof of
   the fact that all hierarchs are open to conviction when they are in
   danger of losing power and influence. [364] He could, moreover, reckon
   on the victory of his opponents being a Pyrrhic victory. His own
   reputation and that of his dogmatic system went on increasing;
   thousands of monks were busy spreading it, and Cyril himself was
   constantly working at the Court and in Rome. The condemnation of
   Nestorius was followed by the most disgraceful treatment of the
   unfortunate bishop. In consequence of the confusion which arose because
   he was condemned while his teaching was tolerated by others, the whole
   party was weakened; the strict Nestorians separated from the others,
   [365] and since Cyril had not been under the necessity of retracting
   anything, he was able to direct his energies towards getting the
   decrees of his assembly accepted as orthodox, as ecumenical decrees,
   under cover of the union-creed. He did actually succeed in a few years
   in getting this done in the East; in the West they had ranked as such
   from the first. The situation continued to be perplexed and became more
   and more disingenuous.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [331] In respect of scientific method we may regard Paul of Samosata,
   Dorotheus, Lucian, the Lucianists such as Arius and Eusebius of
   Nicomedia, Eusebius of Emesa, Theodore of Heraklea, Eustathius,
   Marcellus, Cyril of Jerusalem, Apollinaris, Diodorus, Theodore,
   Polychronius, Chrysostom; Theodoret, etc., as forming a union of
   like-minded scholars as opposed to the school of Origen. Regarded in a
   theological aspect their differences are manifold. Diodorus of Tarsus
   (+ shortly before 394) and his school constitute a special group here.
   Diodorus "the ascetic who was punished in his body by the Olympian
   gods", was the recognised head. His numerous works, of which only
   fragments are preserved, are specified in the Diction. of Chr. Biogr.
   I., p. 836 sq. He was as prolific an apologist, controversialist, and
   dogmatist as he was an exegete. His most important pupils were Theodore
   of Mopsuestia (+ 428) and Chrysostom. The former is the typical
   representative of the whole tendency. Of the astounding mass of his
   works a good deal has been preserved. To what is printed in Migne, T.
   66, we have to add, above all, the edition of his commentary on the
   Pauline letters by Swete, 2 vols., 1882; the fragments of the dogmatic
   works are given in the second volume, pp. 289-339. Sachau edited, in
   1869, Syrian fragments with a Latin translation; in addition Bäthgen in
   the Ztschr. f. Atlich. Wissensch. V., p. 53 ff., Möller, in Herzog's
   R.-Encykl. XV. 2, P. 395 ff.; Gurjew, Theodor von Mopsu., 1890

   Hergenröther (1866). Specht, Theodor v. M. u. Theodoret, 1871; Kihn,

   thorough monograph on Theodoret in Russian (2 vols. 1890). Bertram,
   Thedoreti doctrina christologica. Hildesiæ, 1883. On Theodoret's
   brother, Polychronius, see Bardenhewer, 1879. Chrysostom did not take
   any part in the work of giving Christology a sharply outlined form.
   Theodoret taught the same doctrine as Theodore, but finally
   capitulated.

   [332] Athanasius also used the word in a natural way, e.g., de incarn.
   9.

   [333] Athanasius also employed this image, e.g., l.c. c. 20.

   [334] It was always and from the first dependent on God's good pleasure
   in the virtue of the man Jesus; for to Theodore the general proposition
   held good without any exception that God bestows grace solely in
   proportion to the free exercise of virtue. Grace is always reward; see
   the large fragment from the seventh book of the work peri
   enanthropeseos in Swete II., p. 293 sq. Theodore paid special attention
   to the baptism of Jesus also.

   [335] "Unam offer venerationem."

   [336] The designation theotokos was already quite current about 360.
   Instances of its use at an earlier period may be found in Pierius and
   Alexander of Alexandria, see accordingly Julian c. Christ., p. 276 E.

   [337] Compare, above all, the full Confession of Theodore in Mansi IV.,
   p. 1347 sq. (Hahn, § 139) which gives an admirable view of the
   Christology of Theodore and of its tendency. The word sunaptetthai
   (sunapheia) occurs more than a dozen times (so far as I know the word
   is first found within Christology in a fragment of Hippolytus [ed.
   Lagarde, p. 202]; hina ho prototokos Theou prototoko anthropo
   sunaptomenos deichthe, Julius Afr. in his letter to Aristides [ed.
   Spitta, p. 121] uses sunapheia in the sense of blood-relationship);
   logos anthropon eilephe teleion ek spermatos onta Abraam kai Dauid is
   the principal thesis (also teleion ten phusin). The exaltation is
   strongly emphasised; then we have: dechetai ten para pases tes ktiseos
   proskunesin, hos achoriston pros ten theian phusin echon ten
   sunapheian, anaphora Theou kai ennoia pases tes ktiseos ten proskunesin
   aponemouses. Kai oute duo phamen huious oute duo kurious . . . kurios
   kat' ousian ho Theos logos, ho sunemmenos te kai metechon theotetos
   koinonei tes huiou prosegorias te kai times; kai phia touto oute duo
   phamen huious oute duo kurious. In what follows the doctrine of the two
   sons is again disowned and this with a certain irritation, as is also
   the idea that our Sonship can be compared with that of Christ, (monos
   exaireton echon touto en te pros ton Theon logon sunapheia tes te
   huiotetos kai kuriotetos metechon, anairei men pasan ennoian duados
   huion te kai kurion). Theodore thus did not teach the doctrine of two
   sons, one natural and one adopted, but that of one son who communicated
   his name, his authority, and his glory to the man Jesus in virtue of
   the sunapheia. This was indeed the impossible shift of one in a
   dilemma. At the end of the Creed the doctrine of the two Adams--a
   specially Antiochian doctrine cf. Apoll.--and that of the two states
   are developed in detail. The commentaries of Theodore ought to be
   studied in order that it may be seen how gnome and mimesis--as opposed
   to phusis--were for him the main thing. Both in our case and in that of
   Christ everything was to depend upon freedom, disposition, and the
   direction of the will. In what follows I quote some passages from the
   dogmatic works of Theodore by way of explaining and illustrating the
   account given in the text; Diodorus is in complete agreement with
   Theodore so far as it is still possible for us to check his statements.
   Theodore, de myster. I. 13 (Swete, p. 332): "Angelus diaboli est
   Samosatenus Paulus, qui purum hominem dicere præsumpsit dominum J. Chr.
   et negavit existentiam divinitatis unigeniti, quæ est ante sæcula"; cf.
   adv. Apollin. 3 (Swete, p. 318), where Theodore places Paul together
   with Theodotus and Artemon and condemns him. Theodore, peri
   enanthropeseos 1. 1 (Swete, p.291): "præcipuum Christo præter ceteros
   homines non aliquo puro honore ex deo pervenit, sicut in ceteris
   hominibus, sed per unitatem ad deum verbum, per quam omnis honoris ei

   eighth Sermon of the "Catechism" Theodore has employed the Aristotelian
   category "secundum aliquid" in order to shew, that a thing may be a
   unity in one respect and a duality in another.

   [338] In many respects his language is more certain than that of the
   Cappadocians and Athanasius: he no longer speaks, so far as I know, of
   mingling, fusion and so on, but in other respects his language is not
   behind theirs in uncertainty, and in denying "freedom" to Christ, he
   comes nearer to Apollinaris than they, for they in fact made use also
   of the conception of "two natures." The works of Cyril are in Aubert.
   Vol. VI. and VII., Migne Vols. 75-77. Most of what bears on the subject
   under discussion will be found also in Mansi T. IV., V. Specially
   notable are his letters to the Egyptian monks, to Nestorius (3) to John
   of Antioch, to Succensus (2) to the Constantinopolitan and Alexandrian
   Churches, the liber de recta in Jesum fide addressed to Theodosius, the
   book and the oration on the same subject addressed to the Empress, the
   explanation of the 12 anathemas and their vindication as against
   Theodoret, the five books against Nestorius, the dialogue on the
   Incarnation of the only-begotten, the other dialogue: "Oti heis ho
   Christos and the tractate kata ton me boulomenon homologein theotokon
   ten hagian parthenon. On Cyril's theology see Dorner, Thomasius,
   (Christology) and H. Schultz. Koppalik, Cyril, Mainz 1881. That the
   work published by Mai (Script. Vet. Nova Coll. I., VIII.) peri tes tou
   kuriou enanthropeseos does not belong to Cyril has been shewn by
   Ehrhard (the work attributed to Cyril of Alex. peri t. t. kur; enanth.,
   a work of Theodoret of Cyrus. Tübingen, 1888). In this treatise will be
   found a full and thorough account of the Christological formulæ of
   Cyril.

   [339] I purposely cite no passages; they would not, taken separately,
   prove the doctrine here summarised, but would, on the contrary, point
   now in one direction and now in another. That the group of phrases
   given in the text embodies Cyril's view and in a measure embodies it
   completely, will be allowed by everyone acquainted with the subject.
   Nor as regards Christology can I hope much from a careful monograph on
   Cyril on the lines of a history of dogma, such as has recently been
   asked for; for beyond what is adduced above Cyril had no theological
   interest; his way of formulating his views might, however, easily lead
   to his having a very complicated "Christology" attributed to him.

   [340] According to an expression taken from a work of Apollinaris which
   Cyril considered as Athanasian, because the Apollinarians had fathered
   it on Athanasius.

   [341] See Loofs, Leontius, p. 45.

   [342] The Ep. ad Succens. supplies the most important proof-passages
   here. Cyril's thought is that the substance (ousia) of the human nature
   in Christ does not subsist on its own account, but that it is
   nevertheless not imperfect since it has its subsisting element in the
   God-Logos. This either means nothing at all or it is Apollinarianism.

   [343] Orat. ad imp. Theodos. 19, 20 (Mansi IV. 641): An apparent body
   would have been sufficient if the God-Logos had merely required to show
   us the path to the angelic life. But He became a perfect man, hina tes
   men epeisaktou phthoras to geinon hemon apallaxe soma, te kath' henosin
   oikonomia ten idian auto zoen enieis, psuchen de idian anthropinen
   poioumenos hamartias auten apophene kreittona, tes idias phuseos to
   pepegos te kai atrepton, hoiaper erio baphen, enkatachrosas aute.

   [344] Cyril connected the Christological dogma in the form in which he
   put it, with the Lord's Supper and also with baptism.

   [345] Similarly also Loofs op. cit., p. 48 f. As Loofs rightly remarks,
   the distinction between the natures which Cyril wished to have made was
   nevertheless not one solely in thought, but I cannot find any word
   which expresses what he wanted. It is obvious that as regards the
   docetic and Apollinarian ideas (apparent-humanity, krasis, sunchusis,
   trope), which were current and which were still widely spread at the
   time, Cyril's influence was of a wholesome kind. It is wonderful how
   firm he was here. Perhaps it is herein that his greatest significance
   lies. And yet the best of what he had he had got from Apollinaris.
   Moreover, before Cyril, Didymus in Alexandria had already put together
   and used the words atreptos, asunchutos in his formula for the
   Incarnation; see Vol. III., p. 299. They were therefore not a monopoly
   of the Antiochians.

   [346] Like Apollinaris, Cyril also regarded with the deepest abhorrence
   the thought that Christ possessed a free will. Everything seemed to
   them to be made uncertain if Christ was not atreptos. We can quite
   understand this feeling; for all belief in Christ as Redeemer is, to
   say the least of it, indifferent to the idea that Christ might have
   done other than He did. But that age was in the direst dilemma; for
   "freedom" was at that time the only formula for the "personality" of
   the creature, and yet it at the same time necessarily involved the
   capability of sin. In this dilemma the true believers resolved to deny
   freedom to Christ. With these accordingly the Apollinarians who had
   been excluded from the Church were able once more to unite. "All with
   the exception of a few," writes Theodoret H. E. V. 3, cf. V. 37, "came
   over to the Church and again took part in Church fellowship; they had
   not, however, all the same, got rid of their earlier disease, but still
   infected many with it who before had been sound. From this root there
   sprang up in the Church the doctrine of the mia tes sarkos kai tes
   theotetos phusis, which attributes suffering to the Godhead too of the
   only begotten."

   [347] Thomasius in his description of the Christology of Cyril sees
   only difficulties, but no contradictions. Nor has he fully understood
   the relation between Apollinaris and Cyril.

   [348] Cyril never sought subsequently to tone down in appearance the
   paradox of the mystery of the Incarnation by means of logical
   distinctions. In this connection it is important to note that he allows
   that Nestorius wishes a henosis ton prosopon (Ep. ad C P. Mansi IV., p.
   I005), but that he himself rejects such a union because the important
   thing is the union of the natures.

   [349] Some of his writings in Mansi IV., V., see also VI., VII., IX. On
   the beginning of the controversy Socrat. H. E. VII. 29 sq. cf. the
   letters of Coelestin and Vincent. Common. 17 sq. The sermons of
   Nestorius, above all, deserve attention. The history is in Hefele, op.
   cit. II. 2, pp. 141-288, who is indeed wholly biassed. See Walch,
   Ketzergesch., Vol. V.; Largent, S. Cyrille et le concile d'Éphèse (Rev.
   des quest. hist., 1872, July). Older accounts by Tillemont and Gibbon.

   [350] Luther ("Von den Conc. u. K K.", Vol. 25, pp. 304 ff., 307),
   falling back on Socrates, has rehabilitated Nestorius: "One can see
   from this that Nestorius, though a proud and foolish bishop, is in
   earnest about Christ; but in his folly he does not know what he is
   saying and how he is saying it, like one who was not able to speak
   properly of such things and yet wished to speak as if he knew all about
   it.

   [351] So Nestorius himself in the third letter to Coelestin.

   [352] This was the case from the first; see already the first letter to
   Coelestin. In the third letter he proposed to the Pope that the latter
   should see that neither theotokos nor anthropotokos was used, but
   christotokos; "This controversy about words," he adds moreover, "will
   not in my opinion occasion any difficult enquiry at the Council nor
   will it interfere with the doctrine of the divinity of Christ."

   [353] In this contest Nestorius directs his attack against
   Photinianism, as representing the idea that the Word had first
   originated with the Virgin, against Apollinarianism, against the idea
   that the flesh of Christ was no longer flesh after the Resurrection,
   and therefore against the "deificatio" of the flesh, and against the
   mingling of the natures (first letter to Coelestin). As a matter of
   fact nothing of all this applied to Cyril. The latter fought against
   Nestorius as if it were a matter of combating Paul of Samosata, and in
   this Coelestin made common cause with him (see his first letter to the
   Church of Constantinople c. 3). The real difference was: Did God become
   man or did He not?

   [354] The solidarity between Rome and Alexandria is emphasised also in
   the letters of Coelestin to Cyril (I. I), to John of Antioch (c. 2) and
   to Nestorius (c. II).

   [355] Ep. II. Nest. ad Coelest. (Mansi IV., p. 1024.)

   [356] It was substantially the Western formula: see on this above, p.
   145, and Reuter, Ztschr. fur K: G. VI., p. 156 ff. Augustine,
   Coelestin's authority, had taught the doctrine of una persona and two
   natures, or still more frequently the "duæ substantiæ" which
   corresponds more closely with the Western conception; he had further
   used "deus (ex patre) et homo (ex matre), or "verbum et homo" or
   "deus-homo." He had rejected every view which taught the changeableness
   of God, and explained that the "forma dei" remained together with the
   "forma servi" after the "assumptio carnis". He had not himself
   questioned the relative correctness of the idea of the indwelling of
   the Godhead in Christ after the fashion of the indwelling of the
   Godhead in believers, i.e., as in a temple, if he also clung to the
   view that the Word became flesh. It is undoubted that according to
   Augustine, "Christ is the collective person comprising a duality" in
   connection with which we have to distinguish between what relates to
   the forma dei and the forma servi. It is only with certain
   qualifications that the formula "God was crucified" is to be employed,
   the perfectly correct statement is only "Christus crucifixus est in
   forma servi." The passages in which Augustine speaks of "caro dei",
   "natus ex femina deus" etc., are extremely rare, and for him these
   formulæ have in my opinion no real importance; for the reconciling work
   of Christ belongs according to Augustine to his humanity; see above.
   Here he is therefore in agreement with the Antiochians. (The fact that
   in one passage Augustine, like Tertullian, speaks of "mingling", is of
   no importance). We meet with the same thing in Ambrose (de incarn.
   Sacram.) and again in Vincentius and Leo I. They all go back together
   to Tertullian (see above). Ambrose like Augustine speaks of two
   substances (natures) and he is "still more zealously intent than the
   latter in preserving the two in their integrity": "Servemus
   distinctionem divinitatis et carnis." Apollinaris has no more violent
   opponent than Ambrose. According to him the Johannine "becoming flesh"
   first gets its true meaning through "He dwelt among us." When we speak
   of the death and passion of Christ we ought to add "secundum carnem".
   And naturally in this connection emphasis is also laid on the "unus et
   idem", but the co-existence of the formæ dei et servi is maintained.
   And here, as in Augustine, we meet with the formula that the Logos
   assumed a man. In fact Ambrose, the keenest opponent of Apollinaris,
   turned against the antimetastasis ton onomaton as against a dangerous,
   Apollinarian mode of speech, and went so far in regard to the
   distinction of the natures as even to hazard (c. 2, § 13) the bold
   statement: "Fieri non protest, ut, per quem sunt omnia, sit onus ex
   nobis." (More detailed information in Förster, Ambrosius, p. 128 f.,
   136 f.) The remaining evidence, moreover, which we possess in the shape
   of Papal letters etc., proves that the Westerns since the time of
   Tertullian and Novatian--in the latter also we find the "utraque
   substantia" (not "natura") and the "sociatus homo et deus"--possessed a
   christological formula on which they were all agreed, based on their
   creed, and to which they had strictly adhered, (see the admirable
   remarks of Reuter op. cit. p. 191 f.). This form was closely akin to
   that of the Antiochians, although it rested on a different basis. The
   Antiochians, without being influenced by the West, had reached quite
   independently the formula "two natures, one person." Not only the
   "mild" Antiochians (Loofs op. cit., p. 49 f.), but Theodore also (see
   above) and Nestorius had employed it. We must certainly admit that
   there is a radical difference, the Antiochian formula would strictly
   have run thus: The two natures, which are two hypostases, constitute
   together one prosopon or person who is to be adored, i.e., in the view
   of the Antiochians nature and hypostasis coincided and the undivided
   subject possessed its unity only in the union, the name, in the
   position of authority and in adoration. On the other hand we should
   have to paraphrase the Western form of the doctrine which was outlined
   by Tertullian, developed by Ambrose and handed on to the theologians of
   subsequent times, thus: Jesus Christ as one and the same possesses two
   substances (properties) or two co-existent forms (status, forma). The
   difference is obvious at the first glance. The former formula is of a
   speculative kind and from general conceptions constructs a personal
   being, the latter on the contrary assigns "the state of life" to a
   person, it is, so to speak (see above), of a legal or political kind.
   The two formulæ are thus quite disparate (the Antiochian and
   Alexandrian are on the contrary formally similar) and therefore it is
   very possible that the Western form in fine, considered from the
   religious point of view, contains a side which is more akin to the
   Alexandrian than to the Antiochian form. But in the formulæ Nestorius
   was in agreement with Coelestin, and it cannot be proved that the Pope
   was able to look behind the formula (see the "simplicior" in Mansi V.,
   p. 702). In fact the opposite can be proved. In all his numerous
   letters he took good care in connection with this affair not to state
   his own Christological view. If anything escapes him it does not remind
   us at all of Cyril's views, see, e.g., the letter to the Church of
   Constantinople (Mansi IV., p. 1044): "Nestorius denies that the Logos
   assumed a man for our sakes." He fastens solely on the theotokos to
   which objection had been taken by Nestorius and he adduces a sort of
   argument in proof of its antiquity taken from a poem of Ambrose. Beyond
   this nothing else occurs in his letters to shew what was really to
   blame in the Christology of Nestorius. In place of this he from the
   very start loads him with abuse, with threats from the Bible and with
   imprecations of a wholly general character, denounces him to his Church
   as a heretic and writes him a letter (Mansi IV., p. 1026 sq.), which in
   its unfairness and bare-faced audacity is one of the vilest
   compositions we have of the fourth and fifth centuries. In his
   instructions to his legates too and in his letter to the Council, he
   carefully guarded against using any Christological formula at all, and
   he knew very well why. As Nestorius had expressed himself, particularly
   towards the end, his Christology came so near to that of Augustine that
   Coelestin at all events was not able to distinguish the one from the
   other. Coelestin's main concern, however, was by no means with the
   Christology, but rather with the person of Nestorius because the latter
   had not treated the Pelagians ad nutum papæ. He accordingly, instructed
   his legates simply to take Cyril's side, and in his letter to the
   Council contented himself with an exhortation to the members to
   preserve the old faith without saying what the old faith was. There is,
   however, not the slightest ground for the assumption that Augustine's
   affair with the Galilean monk and presbyter Leporius (about 426, Mansi
   IV., pp. 518, 519 sq.) probably had an influence upon Coelestin. This
   controversy, which was quickly settled, undoubtedly shews that on the
   basis of the formulæ of Tertullian and Novatian, discussions regarding
   the mystery of the person of Christ had been started in the West too,
   which led to considerable division of opinion, and that in opposition
   to this the Westerns held firmly to their "unus et idem" which,
   however, was something different from the Antiochian hen prosopon
   (Leporius would have nothing to do with the idea of a deus natus et
   passus; Augustine and Aurelius of Carthage forced him to recant: the
   Confession of Leporius is in Hahn, Symbole 2, § 138). But in the affair
   with Nestorius Coelestin nowhere referred to the heresy of Leporius and
   to his recantation. The commonitorium of Vincentius best shews how
   little disposed those in the West were to have their own Christological
   form of doctrine interfered with by the East or by the recognised
   Council of Ephesus. In this book, written soon after 431, the Creed of
   Ephesus is highly praised and Nestorius is abused, but at the same time
   the Christological formula of Tertullian and no other is used, and what
   is said exhibits complete uncertainty regarding the teaching of
   Nestorius.

   [357] Mansi IV., pp. 1081 sq., 1099 sq., Hahn, § 142, 143. In the third
   thesis of Nestorius the permanence of the difference of the two natures
   also after the Incarnation is strongly emphasised. The fifth thesis
   runs thus: "Si quis post assumptionem hominis naturaliter dei filium
   unum esse audet dicere, anathema sit." It is the most questionable one.

   [358] John of Antioch was perhaps also one of the false friends of
   Nestorius. The matter is still not quite clear--spite of the Coptic
   sources which are now at our command. Probably John came so late
   intentionally, in order to be able to turn the scale; from the first
   his attitude towards Nestorius had been an equivocal one. We may indeed
   assume that he wished to get rid both of Nestorius and of Cyril in
   order to secure for himself the supreme influence over the Church.

   [359] Otherwise the Westerns were not present at all.

   [360] Besides Coelestin's letter to the Council a similar one from the
   Carthaginian Archbishop Capreolus who excused the absence of the
   Africans was read again. This letter too is instructive because the
   bishop does not go beyond counselling that no change should be made on
   the ancient faith. He expresses no opinion on the question in dispute,
   (Mansi IV., p. I207 sq.).

   [361] Mansi l.c. p. 1287. At the close the Council did the Pope the
   further favour of condemning the Pelagians. Thus both parties were
   quits. Coelestin condemned Nestorius without knowing what his teaching
   was and thereby disparaged his own doctrine, and the followers of Cyril
   condemned the Pelagians without thoroughly examining their theses and
   condemned themselves in condemning them. We may put it thus and yet not
   mistake the peculiar solidarity which existed between the Antiochians
   and the Pelagians; for the Ephesian judges knew nothing of this. It was
   Cassian who first drew attention to it (libr. VII., de incarn. Chr.).

   [362] See the Acts in Mansi; Vicentius too in the so-called Second
   Commonitorium describes the procedure; they interrogated antiquity.
   "Peter of Alex., Athanasius, Theophilus of Alex., the three
   Cappadocians, Felix and Julius of Rome were quoted at Ephesus as
   teachers, councillors, witnesses and judges (what, however, was quoted
   from them originated with Apollinaris!), and also Cyprian and
   Augustine." According to Vincentius these constituted "the hallowed
   decalogue". But in addition to these the opinions of others were also
   adduced.

   [363] He was now the spiritual leader of the Antiochians. He fought
   untiringly for the view that God was incapable of suffering.

   [364] The Creed of Union is in Mansi V., pp. 781, 291, 303. (Hahn
   § 99). It was composed as early as the year 431, probably by Theodoret;
   and was sent from Ephesus to be submitted to the Emperor, Cyril
   subscribed it in the year 433. The Creed is a dogmatic work of art in
   which the Antiochians, however, could without much difficulty recognise
   their views, but not so Cyril. The second, and really important half
   runs thus: duo gar phuseon henosis gegone; dio hena Christon, hena
   huion, hena kurion homologoumen. Kata tauten ten tes asunchutou
   henoseos ennoian homologoumen ten hagian parthenon theotokon,
   [Nestorius had already admitted this, and he might in fact have
   subscribed this creed without any scruples of conscience] dia to ton
   Theon logon sarkothenai kai enanthropesai, kai ex autes tes sullepseos
   henosai heauto ton ex autes lephthenta naon. Tas de euangelikas kai
   apostolikas peri tou kuriou phonas ismen tous theologous andras tas men
   koinopoiountas, hos eph' henos prosopou, tas de diairountas, hos epi
   duo phuseon (Cyril admitted that!) kai tas men theoprepeis kata ten
   theoteta tou Christou, tas de tapeinas kata ten anthropoteta autou
   paradidontas. This formula of union which reflects no discredit on the
   Antiochians, especially as they, like the Arians and Semi-Arians before
   them, had a theological rather than a religious interest in the
   problem, is markedly different from the later Chalcedonian formula. It
   does not abandon an intelligible position as that was understood by the
   Antiochians. Cyril had to content himself with the words henosis and
   theotokos and had to put up with the absence of sunapheia. He naturally
   clung firmly to the mia phusis sesarkomene, declaring that the creed of
   union merely excluded the misinterpretations of the doctrine he had
   hitherto taught, misinterpretations which he had himself always
   disavowed; in fact he went so far as to assert that the Antiochians too
   understood the difference of the natures after the incarnation as being
   purely a distinction in thought.

   [365] This was a slow process which began with the emigration to Edessa
   and was concluded only at the end of the fifth century with the
   formation of a strictly exclusive Nestorian Church. It maintained
   itself in the extreme East of Christendom, in East Syria and Persia,
   and soon took on a national colouring; on the strongly marked national
   consciousness of the Nestorians in Church matters, see Horst, Elias von
   Nisibis, p. 112 ff. The Emperor Zeno put an end to their existence in
   the Empire in 489. All the successors of Theodosius II. persecuted
   them. How the latter came to have such a ferocious hatred of Nestorius
   whom he had once protected has not, however, been yet explained. The
   Emperor gave orders that all the writings of Nestorius were to be
   burned and that his followers were to be called "Simonists". The result
   was that the writings of Diodorus and Theodore were all the more
   eagerly circulated in the East and translated into other languages.
   Edessa in particular did a great deal in the way of getting the
   Greek-Antiochian literature put into Syrian (Persian, Armenian). Much
   that is of a free and antique character has been preserved in the
   Nestorian-Persian or Chaldean Church; Assemani, Bibl. Orient. III., 2;
   Silbernagl, Kirchen des Orients p. 202 ff.; Kattenbusch, op. cit. I.,
   p. 226 ff. For the history of dogma, in the strict sense of the word,
   the Nestorians are no longer of any importance.

   § 2. The Eutychian Controversy.

   Cyril died in the year 444; there were in his own party some who so far
   as he was concerned had never forgiven him the union of 433 which had
   led Cyril to agree to the expression "duo phuseis". [366] His successor
   was Dioscurus who, according to the testimony of his own adherents,
   though not indeed the equal of his predecessor, was also not unlike
   him. The Alexandrian bishops from Athanasius to Dioscurus have
   something in common. They strove to make themselves the masters of
   Egypt and the leaders of the Church of the East. [367] Their resistance
   to the power of the State was not less strong than their hatred of the
   parvenu, the bishop of New Rome, whose aspirations after power they
   wished to put a stop to. We can only compare them with the great Popes,
   and the comparison is so far a just one inasmuch as they aimed at
   making Egypt a sort of independent ecclesiastical State. Each bishop in
   the series from Athanasius to Dioscurus came nearer accomplishing this
   design. [368] In following out this policy they relied upon three
   powerful forces, on Greek piety and monasticism, on the masses of the
   lower classes, and on the Roman Bishop who had an equal interest in
   keeping down the bishop of Constantinople, and in making head against
   the State. In the respect first mentioned, Theophilus' change of front
   is specially characteristic. He abandoned science, i.e., Origenism, as
   soon as he perceived that a stronger force was present in the
   Church,--namely, the orthodoxy of the monks and of the religious
   communities. From that time onwards the Alexandrian bishop stood at the
   head of ecclesiastical traditionalism; he decisively rejected Greek
   science. But in doing this he surrendered what was an important element
   in the influence he could exercise on the rest of the churches, and the
   loss of this was a momentous one. He became a national Coptic bishop.
   This brings us to the second point. Like all despots, the great
   Alexandrian bishops sought the support of the masses. They were
   demagogues. They flattered the people and sought to please them, while
   they hampered and crushed the aristocracy composed of the bishops, the
   scholars and the upper classes.

   Athanasius had already begun this policy, in fact he was not in all
   probability the first to follow it. Each of his successors went a step
   further on these lines. But the Copts were not the Romans; the master
   of the eternal city could always think of ruling the world. A Coptic
   despot, however, who had rejected all that belonged to the Greek world,
   could only dream of world-empire. [369] Cyril had the Egyptian clergy
   and people completely under his power; but the less wise Dioscurus by
   his unconcealed despotism created an aristocratic reaction in the
   country. In him we see the downfall and overthrow of the policy of the
   Alexandrian chair. Had he been a man like Leo I., Christianity might
   perhaps have got a second Rome in Alexandria. [370] But there was no
   room in the world for two such chairs. The traditional policy of common
   action which had for so long united Rome and Alexandria, was bound to
   reach a point at which it turned into bitter enmity. The Byzantine
   patriarch accordingly turned this enmity to account. It is indeed
   possible to trace back the whole difference between the Roman and the
   Alexandrian bishop to the brusque and imprudent conduct of Dioscurus,
   or, with a still greater show of justice, to Leo's love of power; [371]
   but this would be to take a narrow view of the matter. About the middle
   of the fifth century the Alexandrian bishop was on the point of
   becoming master of Egypt and at the same time master of the East. Rome
   would not have been Rome if she had looked calmly on at a result such
   as this, to which indeed she had herself contributed so long as she was
   concerned in defending herself against a more powerful enemy. It is
   here that we have the key to the proper understanding of the direction
   taken by Roman policy in the East, and it is owing to it that the
   history of dogma too has taken a wholly unexpected turn. For once that
   opposition had sprung up between Rome and Alexandria it could not be
   but that the profound dogmatic difference between the two which
   Coelestin had disregarded in order to humble the Emperor and the
   Constantinopolitan bishop, should find expression. But if Rome came off
   victorious, then the dogmatic development of the East was bound to
   enter a new, and what was essentially, a foreign channel. Conversely
   again, the permanent victory of the Second Council of Ephesus (449)
   would, owing to the weakness of the State, have been equivalent to the
   victory of Egypt in the Church and probably also in the Empire; for
   Empire and Emperor had come to be entirely dependent on the Church
   which culminated in the Alexandrian chair and its monks. Pope and
   Emperor therefore made common cause; in the years 450-451 they had a
   common enemy and realised the solidarity of their interests. But the
   political victory of Rome did not correspond with the victory of Leo in
   the dogmatic question over the East under the leadership of Alexandria.
   The Emperor went about the matter in an extremely clever way. While
   making use of the Roman bishop in so far as he found him necessary in
   order to carry out his purpose, which was to deliver the Empire and the
   Church from the despotism of Alexandria based as it was on dogmatics,
   he at the same time deprived him of the power of extending in any way
   his influence in the East by raising his own court-patriarch to a
   position of equal rank and importance with the Pope. Simultaneously
   with the downfall of his Alexandrian colleague Leo I. had to direct his
   attention once more to his Constantinopolitan colleague, behind whom
   stood no less a person than the Emperor himself--the Byzantine idea of
   the state. He now promptly resumed the traditional policy of his chair
   and sought to form a connection with Proterius, the successor of
   Dioscurus. He, however, no longer found in Alexandria a powerful
   monarch, but only the shadow of such a ruler, the Melchitian bishop of
   a small party who soon fell a victim to the fanaticism of the
   Egyptians. But on the other hand the Emperor had dearly bought his
   victory over the hankering after independence on the part of the Church
   in the East, in the form in which it had been fostered by the monkish
   church of the Copts under the Alexandrian patriarchs. He plunged the
   East into a state of frightful confusion, and his policy, which was a
   clever one for the moment, resulted in being the direst calamity for
   the Eastern Empire, since it set free the centrifugal and national
   forces of the Eastern provinces. It was possible to overthrow the
   Egyptian ecclesiastical State, but this done, it was no longer possible
   permanently to retain Egypt. It was possible to deliver the Empire and
   Constantinople from the domination of a dogmatic which was hostile to
   the State, but it was not possible to force a foreign dogmatic on the
   people of the East. The Roman bishop, however, also soon saw that he
   was further from the attainment of his aim than ever, and the proud
   language employed by Leo's successors towards the Emperor and the East
   and which reminds us of the mediæval Popes, is not so much a token of
   actual power as a proof of the breach and estrangement between East and
   West which had occurred, and so of the actual powerlessness of Rome.
   The Emperor could no longer get at the Pope, but neither could the Pope
   get at the Emperor and the East; he came to have no influence. A
   section of the Easterns could come to terms with the dogmatic decree of
   Chalcedon--it is always possible to come to terms with dogmatic
   decrees--and while acknowledging its authority could nevertheless give
   expression to what was truly essential in the Faith of the East; but
   the twenty-eighth Canon of Chalcedon, which had reference to the Roman
   bishop, was no "noumenon" which could be got over by scholastic
   refinement. Rome had the satisfaction of having dictated its
   Christological formula to the Byzantine State-Church, just as it had
   previously taken the biggest share in the work of getting the
   Trinitarian formula accepted, but this very Church now took up a
   position of extreme isolation relatively to Rome and the West. The
   Byzantine Patriarch, although his power was always more and more
   restricted within the domain in the East over which he ruled, was an
   invincible opponent; for he was simply the exponent of all the peculiar
   powers still possessed at the time by the State of Constantine and
   Theodosius I. and by the Greek Church.

   This is the general outline of the circumstances we have to take into
   account in studying the history of the "Eutychian Controversy." What
   happened here was, mutatis mutandis, repeated in the controversy about
   images in so far as the State in this struggle in the same way resisted
   the authority of the Church which sought to crush it. It was successful
   in both instances. The power which had opposed the State in Egyptian
   Monophysitism and set itself against it in the matter of the adoration
   of images, was one and the same. But the nature of the victory was
   different in the two cases. In the middle of the Fifth Century the
   State, unfortunately for itself, did not possess the power of putting
   up with the dogmatic teaching of its opponent while humiliating the
   opponent himself; or shall we say: it did not think of the power it
   had, and to its own loss lent an ear to the suggestions of a foreign
   power, namely, the Roman bishop. In the ninth century, however, it was
   able to let its opponent have its own way in the domain of dogma and
   worship--for the adoration of images was restored,--and yet to make it
   submit to its laws and attach it to its interests. A powerful ruler,
   who would have accepted the dogmatic decree of the second Council of
   Ephesus but who would have been at the same time able to break the
   political power of Dioscurus and to compel the monks and Copts to
   submit--would perhaps--if it is permissible to make such a
   reflection--have been able to maintain the unity of the Empire of
   Constantius and to preserve for the Eastern provinces the
   Græco-Christian culture. Of what incalculable importance this would
   have been! But it is useless to pursue a line of thought such as this.

   It follows from these considerations that the history of dogma has to
   be regarded almost exclusively in its connection with politics, not
   merely after the Council of Chalcedon, but already previous to this.
   The forces which from 444 onwards determined the great decisions and
   actions were throughout political. It was individuals only who really
   thought of the Faith when they spoke of the Faith; they brought about
   crises, but they no longer determined the course things were to take.
   Nor is it the case that what was dogmatically "the right thing" gained
   acceptance here as if by a wonderful arrangement of things; for if, as
   is reasonable to suppose, "the right thing" here can only be what is in
   harmony with Greek religious feeling, then it did not gain entire
   acceptance. And in pronouncing an opinion on this, whether we take our
   stand at a very much earlier or at a very much later period, it may
   certainly be maintained that the decision of Chalcedon was the happiest
   amongst those that were at all possible at the time; but to see this
   can in no way alter the opinion that the Council of Chalcedon, which to
   distinguish it from the Robber Council [372] we might call the Robber
   and Traitor Council, betrayed the secret of Greek Faith. It is only
   with the forces of history that the historian is concerned; and so,
   from about 444 onwards, the political historian almost entirely takes
   the place of the historian of dogmas. If the latter is willing to keep
   strictly to his own domain but a small extent of ground is left to him,
   which, since what does not change awakens no interest, gets smaller and
   smaller from century to century.

   If it be asked, what is the saddest and most momentous event in the
   history of dogma since the condemnation of Paul of Samos ata, we must
   point to the union of the year 433. The shadow of this occurrence rests
   on the whole subsequent history of dogma. [373] It bore two sorts of
   evil fruit. In the first place it permanently prohibited Greek piety
   from establishing the formula which was alone appropriate to it: mia
   phusis theou logou sesarkomene--one incarnate nature of the divine
   Logos. (The relief which the Creed of Ephesus of 449 was supposed to
   bring, came too late.) In the second place it introduced such a
   stagnation into the dogmatic question that every one who attempted to
   state his Christological views ran the risk of being regarded as a
   heretic, while on the other hand people found it possible when they so
   desired, to give a favourable turn to every dogmatic utterance. It
   threw the East into a state of confusion and made of Christology an
   armoury of poisoned weapons for the warfare of ecclesiastical politics.
   A middle party was formed from each of the two sides. To one of these
   Theodoret belonged, and to another Dioscurus (Cyril). But the
   representatives of these middle parties were no nearer each other than
   the two extremes. If they employed the same formulæ they nevertheless
   gave them a different meaning, and they were at the same time intent
   upon protecting their extreme associates so far as possible.

   The Alexandrians had acquired the sovereignty of the East at the price
   of union. The "high-priest Emperor" and his eunuchs abandoned
   themselves more and more to their guidance. Under the feeble Theodosius
   the Empire was in danger of becoming an ecclesiastical state led by
   Alexandria. In addition to this, under cover of the formula of concord
   the doctrine of the one nature was propagated, and even the
   extravagances of earlier times again made their appearance. Cyril
   himself who was so cautious otherwise in his use of formulae, had not
   been able to avoid the use of the questionable Apollinarian conception,
   according to which the nature or hypostasis of the incarnate Logos is a
   "certain middle something", [374] and accordingly it is not astonishing
   to find that his followers went still further. The brave and
   indefatigable Theodoret [375] did indeed keep a look-out against the
   henosis phusike, "the suffering God", the krasis or mixture, in short,
   against the anathemas of Cyril, while at the same time he parried the
   attacks of Cyril on Theodore of Mopsuestia. But spite of the great
   prudence shewn by Theodoret in keeping to a middle path Dioscurus
   succeeded in calumniating him at the Court, after he had himself in his
   character as supreme bishop interfered in the affairs of Antioch. [376]
   Theodoret was instructed to keep to his diocese. Still greater was the
   hatred of the Alexandrians against the bold and worldly-minded Bishop
   Ibas of Edessa, Theodore's enthusiastic supporter. Dioscurus had
   apparently made up his mind to bring the East under his authority and
   gradually to exterminate all who in a half way or who wholly accepted
   the Antiochian theology. The formula: two natures or hypostases, one
   Christ, was to disappear from the Church.

   In the capital the old and respected Archimandrite Eutyches supported
   his views, taking his stand on the Christology of Cyril. Still it was
   no mere calumny when his opponents maintained that in the course of the
   violent attack on the Nestorians he had himself fallen into the error
   of making Apollinarian statements. Already in the year 448 Bishop
   Domnus of Antioch had denounced him on these grounds to the Emperor.
   But no action was taken until Bishop Eusebius of Dorylaum brought a
   similar charge against him before Flavian who was bishop of
   Constantinople at the time. Eutyches afterwards asserted that he had
   done this from personal hatred, and one cannot get rid of the suspicion
   that he was right; for Eusebius himself had formerly been one of most
   bitter opponents of Nestorius. In any case a certain obscurity hangs
   over the outbreak of the controversy, and the energy too with which
   Flavian at once took the matter up is strange. He was on bad terms with
   the court and particularly with the all-powerful Chrysaphius with whom
   Eutyches stood in high favour. The bishop probably felt that he was
   hampered by the Archimandrite and wanted to get rid of him. It is
   useless to look for any religious motives in the case of Flavian, whose
   Christological statements bear a pretty close resemblance to those of
   Cyril, though they did actually fall short of them. [377] The Council
   of Constantinople (448) which followed on this and with whose procedure
   we are well acquainted, shewed the frivolity of the attack on Eutyches,
   though it shewed too how the influential archimandrite set his bishop
   at defiance. In reference to the dogmatic question Eutyches acted with
   great prudence, and, though indeed with some hesitation, gave his
   assent to the formula of the Creed of Union, "of two natures, one
   Christ" (one hypostasis, one person). But one can plainly see that this
   formula, in so far as it was taken as implying the continued existence
   of the two natures after the union, was one which Eutyches would regard
   as objectionable. "Two natures after the union" was rightly felt to be
   Nestorian and above all to be an "innovation". Eutyches, indeed,
   corrected the incautious statements he had made at an earlier time,
   divergent from the middle path of the formula of unity--my God is not
   of the same substance with us; [378] He has no "body of a man" (soma
   anthropou), but only a "human body" (soma anthropinon). But this was of
   no avail. It was insisted that he taught a "blending" (sunkrasis) and
   "confusion" (sunchusis), and after the most disgraceful proceedings the
   records of which were besides falsified, he was deposed "amid tears" on
   account of Valentinian and Apollinarian heresy. This was done by people
   who themselves professed to acknowledge Cyril's second letter to
   Nestorius and its approval by the Synod of Ephesus, as well as the
   epistle of Cyril to John of Antioch. Both parties laboured to secure
   the favour of the Court, the capital, and the Roman bishop, and the
   Court sided with Eutyches. People's views were still everywhere ruled
   by the condemnation of Nestorius and there was no inclination to change
   sides. Flavian, "the moderate Antiochian" played a dangerous game when
   he sought to increase the authority of his chair in face of the court
   and the ruling system of dogma. Leo I. who was applied to by Eutyches
   first, was for some weeks uncertain which course to take (Leon. epp. 20
   sq.). He was disposed to regard the Constantinopolitan Patriarch as his
   born enemy; but he had soon to recognise the fact that his strongest
   enemy was to be looked for elsewhere. Dioscurus, who substantially
   agreed with Eutyches and who long ere this took an active part in
   different provincial Synods in the East as supreme bishop, had already
   annexed the question and moved the Emperor to summon a Council. The
   Pope's policy was now marked out for him. He must not strike either
   upon the Constantinopolitan Scylla or upon the Alexandrian Charybdis,
   but on the contrary, as his predecessor Julius had done, he must
   attempt to bring the true faith and with it himself to the East.
   Dioscurus was determined to use every means to exploit the Council in
   his own interests. It was to establish the authority of the Alexandrian
   Patriarch and of the Alexandrian Christology in the Church of the East.
   He was prudent enough all the same to employ no new formula while
   attempting this. The Nicene Creed was alone to be regarded as
   authoritative, of course according to the interpretation put upon it by
   the anathemas of Cyril. Whoever went a word beyond this was to be
   considered an innovator, a heretic. This was his standpoint and he
   found a pliant Emperor and a minister who were favourably disposed
   toward him and who were prepared to hand over the Church to him in
   order to humiliate the occupant of the episcopal chair of the capital
   for the time being whom they hated, a policy which was treachery to the
   State. [379] Dioscurus was equipped with full powers as master of the
   Synod. It was called together in accordance with his ideas, even a
   representative of the monastic order was present--a novelty at a
   Council--and Theodoret was excluded.

   Leo had meanwhile discovered that Eutyches was a heretic [380] (ep. 27)
   and bethought himself of the Western Christological form of doctrine
   which his predecessors, Coelestin and Sixtus, and he himself seem up to
   this time to have forgotten. The summoning of a Council caused him
   grave anxiety; Flavian, who had seriously displeased the Pope by his
   independent attitude, nevertheless suddenly became his dear friend who
   had been attacked, and along with the legates who attended the Council
   Leo sent numerous letters to all in the East concerned in the affair
   (epp. 28-38), to Flavian (28, 36, 38), to the Emperor (29, 37), to
   Pulcheria (30, 31), to the Constantinopolitan archimandrites (32), to
   the Council (33) and to Bishop Julian of Kos (34, 35). He repeatedly
   observes that a synodal decision was not at all necessary, and that the
   Council was superfluous. [381] But what he was now above all concerned
   with was to furnish Flavian with dogmatic instructions and to draw the
   attention of the Council to the unique dignity of the Roman Chair which
   had already decided the question. The latter of these two things he did
   in Epistle 33, which contains a daring attempt to misrepresent [382]
   the conditions under which the Council had come together, while he
   accomplished the former by the dogmatic epistle he sent to Flavian. It
   contains a paraphrase of the Christological section of the work of
   Tertullian adv. Prax. (cf. Novatian de trinitate) in accordance with
   the views, and in part in the words, of Ambrose and Augustine, with
   special reference to Eutyches, and in combating the views of the latter
   it accordingly undeniably goes a step beyond what had hitherto been
   accepted in the West, though not any further than the situation for the
   moment demanded. This document, which was highly lauded in subsequent
   times and is to the present day, contains nothing new. What, however,
   is of importance in it is that the West, i.e., the Pope, has here kept
   in view the peculiar character of its Church. It is consequently an
   evidence of power, and the Christology set forth in it may at the same
   time have actually corresponded with the inclinations of the Pope. But
   on the other hand it ought not to be forgotten that the situation, as
   represented by Nestorianism already condemned and Eutychianism about to
   be rejected, appeared directly to call for the old Western formula "duæ
   substantiæ (naturæ) in una persona", and that the Pope expressed
   himself more fully regarding it than tradition justified. [383] The
   Pope throughout puts the interests of our salvation in the foreground;
   he wants exactly what Cyril and Eutyches also want, but he goes on to
   give an explanation which Cyril at any rate would have entirely
   repudiated, [Cyril said that the idea of redemption demands the
   deification of the human nature, Leo went on to shew that this same
   idea demands a true human nature which remains absolutely unchanged],
   and which, so far, goes beyond the use and wont doctrine of the West
   and actually approaches Nestorianism, inasmuch as the Pope uses by
   preference "nature" in place of substance and speaks of a peculiar mode
   of action on the part of each nature, and thus really hypostatises each
   nature. In Leo's view the "Person" is no longer entirely the one
   subject with two "properties", but the union of two hypostatic natures.
   In a word, the unity is neither made intelligible by Leo nor did he
   consider what was the supreme concern of the pious Greeks in this
   matter, namely, to see in the humanity of Christ the real deification
   of human nature generally. Nor is there any trace in the doctrinal
   letter of anything like an express repudiation of Nestorius, not to
   speak of the Antiochian Christology. [384]

   The Council was opened at Ephesus in August 449. Dioscurus presided and
   assigned the second place to the representative of the Roman bishop.
   There were one hundred and thirty-five members present. The bishops who
   had sat in judgment on Eutyches were not allowed to vote, since the
   Synod meant to proceed with a revision of that process. Dioscurus put
   the Pope's letter to the Council amongst the Acts, but did not have it
   read out, and in fact treated Rome as non-existent. Not Rome but
   Alexandria was to speak. It was a bold stroke, but Dioscurus had got
   authority from the Emperor. As regards its proceedings the Council does
   not compare unfavourably with other Councils. What gave it its peculiar
   character was the fact that it was guided by a powerful and determined
   will, that of Dioscurus. The latter got the Council simply to resolve
   not to go beyond the conclusions come to at Nicæa and Ephesus. The
   affair of Eutyches was next taken up; he declared that he took his
   stand on the teaching of these Councils and repudiated Manes, Valentin,
   Apollinaris, and Nestorius. In the course of the debate it became
   evident that those present regarded the formula "after the Incarnation
   one nature", as alone orthodox--with the addition: "made flesh and made
   man" (sesarkomenen kai enanthropesasan), and that they condemned the
   doctrine of two natures after the Incarnation. In this sense Eutyches
   was declared by all to be orthodox. Rome's legates refrained from
   voting. Domnus of Antioch and Juvenal of Jerusalem also concurred, and
   even three of the bishops who had condemned Eutyches at Constantinople
   did the same. Dioscurus now proceeded to take aggressive steps. Each
   bishop was required to state in writing whether he considered that
   those should be punished who in the course of their theological
   investigations had gone beyond the Nicene Creed. Dioscurus got the
   answer he wished, and even the Roman legate did not oppose the question
   when put in this form. On the basis of this resolution the Council
   pronounced sentence of deposition on Flavian and Eusebius of Doryläum,
   Domnus and Juvenal concurring. Both of the deposed bishops were present
   and soon after appealed to the Pope, whose legates, moreover, had at
   least shewn some hesitation at the Council, though after the first
   session they took no further share in the proceedings. In the second
   and third sessions Dioscurus got the detested Ibas deposed (to whom the
   saying was currently attributed "I do not envy Christ because He became
   God; for I too can become God if I wish"), the Sabinian bishop of
   Perrha and several others; [385] also Theodoret, [386] the pillar of
   the East, and finally even Domnus of Antioch. [387] The fact that he
   had for so long sided with Dioscurus availed him nothing. He had
   latterly drawn back, was unwilling to take part in the
   ecclesiastico-political revision of the Canons of Nicæa and
   Constantinople which Dioscurus was contemplating, and was generally in
   his road.

   Never before at any Council had a Patriarch scored such a victory, The
   atmosphere was cleared; the triumph of the old Confession of Nicæa and
   Ephesus (431) which alone was recognised by the pious Greeks as
   embodying their faith, had been secured; the Christology of Cyril, the
   one incarnate nature of the God-Logos, had been acknowledged as the
   true one; those who opposed it had partly been deposed and partly had
   submitted; arrangements had already been made for securing suitable
   successors to those who had been deposed, and an Alexandrian priest,
   Anatolius, was appointed to Constantinople. The Church of the East lay
   at the feet of the Alexandrian Patriarch and he had attained everything
   with the concurrence of the Emperor. [388] He had doubtless made use of
   force; but it was the State in fact which stood behind him; the police
   and the monks of Barsumas had, to be sure, over-awed the Fathers; but
   far worse than the terrors of this Council were the calumnies spread
   regarding it on the part of those who two years later had to extenuate
   their dastardly treachery. If we consider who were present at the
   Council we must conclude that Dioscurus, to whom even Theodoret on one
   occasion (ep. 60) bore favourable testimony, cannot have found it
   necessary to employ any very great amount of actual force. That Flavian
   was trampled on and left half dead is anything but certain, and a
   Council which more than any other gave expression to the tradition of
   the religious feeling of the time and to what it considered of vital
   importance, does not deserve the name "Robber-Council" (Leo, ep. 95).
   Regarded from the standpoint of the Church of the East something of
   importance had actually been attained, and what had been thus attained
   had the guarantee of permanence so long as foreign elements did not
   come in to disturb it.

   But Dioscurus had not reckoned on the death of the Emperor which was
   near at hand, nor with the Roman bishop, nor finally on the widespread
   aversion felt towards the right wing of his army which was Apollinarian
   in disguise. He had rehabilitated Eutyches without, however, getting
   the questionable statements to which the latter had formerly given
   utterance, proscribed, though the allegation that he endorsed them is a
   falsehood asserted by his embittered opponents at Chalcedon. This was a
   blunder in policy which was calculated to bring on a reaction
   introduced from the outside, and the reaction taking its start from
   this, might in the state in which matters then were, overthrow the
   great work which had been accomplished without in appearance abandoning
   the position gained in the year 431. At first Dioscurus was still
   master of the situation. While all those who felt themselves injured by
   him betook themselves to Leo as the only refuge, [389] and while the
   latter hastened to reject the resolutions of the Council, Dioscurus
   pronounced sentence of excommunication upon Leo, [390] prepared now to
   measure his strength with the last remaining opponent too, whom he had
   treated at Ephesus as a nonentity. Leo was in an extremely difficult
   position, as letters 43-72 prove. If the decree of Ephesus were to
   become permanent it was all over with his orthodoxy as well as with the
   primacy of his chair. He assembled a Council and at the same time got
   all the members of the imperial family of the Western Empire, when they
   came to Rome, to write letters to Theodosius against the "episcopus
   Alexandrinus sibi omnia vindicans" (45, 2), against the Council in
   support of his just claim to be considered supreme judge in matters of
   faith, [391] and in favour of calling a new Council to meet in Italy.
   He saw himself under the necessity of repeatedly assuring the Emperor
   of the East that he also held firmly to the Nicene Faith; he took care
   not to mention what it was exactly that he found fault with in the
   dogmatic decrees of Ephesus; he simply insisted on the condemnation of
   Eutyches as a Manichean and a Doketist, and was slow about recognising
   the new bishop of Constantinople, the creature of Dioscurus. He yielded
   nothing as the successor of Peter, but neither did he gain anything.
   Theodosius stood firm, maintained that the Council had merely defended
   antiquity against the innovations of Flavian, and coldly replied to the
   letters of his imperial relations in the West, declining to take any
   action. A less politic Pope than he was, would have brought on a breach
   backed up as he would have been by the whole West and by the Emperor of
   the West, but Leo waited and did not wait in vain.

   Theodosius II. [392] died on the 28th of July, 450, and the situation
   was at once altered. Pulcheria who mounted the throne and offered her
   hand to Marcian, had always deplored her brother's miserable misrule,
   and his proteges were her enemies. She specially guided the
   ecclesiastical policy of the Government, while Marcian fought its
   enemies outside. The Court resolved to free itself and the State from
   the Alexandrian despot. This could not be done without the help of
   Rome, for--and this is a fact of the highest importance--the Council of
   449 had really pacified the Church of the East. Of course there were
   some who were discontented, but they were in the minority. The Court
   could not in carrying out its new policy reckon on the support of any
   united and reliable party. It was only in Constantinople that it was
   able to make way quickly, for there Flavian was not yet forgotten. The
   Church of the East had enjoyed peace since August. In order that the
   State might get back its independence, this Church which had been
   pacified, had to be disturbed anew and reduced to the most lamentable
   condition.

   Marcian, whose recognition as Emperor Dioscurus had sought to prevent
   in Egypt, at once addressed a letter to Leo. He formally handed over to
   the latter the primacy with which his predecessor had actually invested
   Dioscurus, and announced besides his readiness to summon the Council
   desired by Leo. [393] Soon after an epistle reached Leo from Pulcheria
   which announced the change of view on the part of the bishop of
   Constantinople. He had subscribed Leo's dogmatic letter, that sent to
   Flavian, and had condemned the erroneous doctrine of Eutyches; the
   Emperor had also ordered the recall of the bishops who had been deposed
   by the Council, and their reinstatement in office was reserved for the
   Council over which, if possible, Leo was to preside in person and which
   was to be held in the East. As a matter of fact in the capital itself,
   after a local Synod had been called, everything was already going as
   the Emperor, or rather, as the Empress, desired. The wretched toady,
   the patriarch, the creature and the betrayer of Dioscurus, was prepared
   to do everything the Court wished. In view of the completely changed
   circumstances Leo had no longer any wish for a Council, because a
   Council might always mean action which was dangerous for the Pope. He
   now took up the position that his letter was sufficient, that the
   bishops were individually to bind themselves to accept the doctrine set
   forth in it, and that by their return to orthodoxy and the erasure of
   the names of Dioscurus, Juvenal, etc., from the Diptychs, the
   Robber-Council would be rendered powerless for harm. He wished on his
   own initiative and apart from any Council, but with the assistance of
   his legates, to act the part of judge and to receive to favour or
   punish as impenitent each individual bishop; the bishop of
   Constantinople was to act with him in the matter as his mandatory. He
   therewith made an actual beginning with the business and it was now
   fairly on its way. And as a matter of fact Leo may have been naïve
   enough to imagine that the solution of the dogmatic difficulty of the
   East was contained in his sorry letter, for it seems never to have
   occurred to the Pope that there could be any other Christologies
   besides the "correct" one, Doketism, and the doctrine of Paul of
   Samosata. He had no appreciation of the subtle, though no doubt partly
   incorrect formulæ of the Greek theologians; but he was sure of his
   ground, and it was with this feeling that the letters 82-86 were
   composed, in which the Pope sought at all costs to prevent the calling
   of a Council as being unnecessary and inopportune. [394] But Marcian
   required the Council for himself and for the Eastern Church, in which,
   since the change of rulers, no one knew what he should believe, and in
   which, for the time, many bishoprics were held by two bishops or had no
   bishop at all. The Emperor had no desire to surrender to the Pope while
   claiming his help. He issued an edict ordaining the Council to meet at
   Nicæa in September 451, and Leo had to acquiesce, though with a very
   bad grace (ep. 89). He arranged to send four legates and deputed to one
   of them, Bishop Paschasinus, the duty of presiding in his stead; for
   Marcian had designated Leo himself as leader of the future Council, and
   so what Dioscurus had got for himself in 449 after a struggle, the Pope
   now secured without taking any trouble. [395] Still Leo was extremely
   uneasy. His numerous letters (89-95) prove that he was afraid of
   "innovations contrary to the Nicene Creed", i.e., divergences from his
   doctrinal letter. He accordingly kept constantly counselling mildness
   and forgiveness; whoever would only condemn Eutyches and recognise the
   Nicene Creed was to be regarded as orthodox. The controversy regarding
   the Faith was in no case to be renewed, everything was clear and
   finally decided. In his letter to the Council (93) he expressly guarded
   his position by hinting that besides the condemnation of Eutyches, that
   of Nestorius also in the year 431, must remain in force. This request
   was rather an act of self-justification than a demand; for there were
   very few in the East who were disposed to rehabilitate Nestorius, but
   then there was no actual repudiation of the "heretic" in the epistola
   dogmatica. But all this did not in fine constitute the Pope's greatest
   anxiety. What he dreaded above all was the restoration of the power of
   the bishop whom his predecessors in alliance with the Alexandrians had
   humbled, the bishop of Constantinople, behind whom was Constantius'
   idea of the State. Now, however, he was at enmity with the old ally and
   had in fact humiliated him to the dust, [396] but with the downfall of
   the enemy the support he had given disappeared too. The Pope's anxiety
   comes out in the precise instructions given to the legates: [397] "You
   may not permit the constitution set up by the holy Fathers (the sixth
   Canon of Nicæa according to the Roman forgery) to be violated or
   diminished by any rash action. . . . and if perchance some trusting to
   the dignity of their cities shall have attempted to appropriate
   anything for themselves, this you may check with befitting firmness."
   ("Sanctorum patrum constitutionem prolatam nulla patiamini temeritate
   violari vel imminui . . . ac si qui forte civitatum suarum splendore
   confisi aliquid sibi tentaverint usurpare, hoc qua dignum est
   constantia retundatis"). In order to ensure the Emperor's personal
   presence which the Roman legates insisted upon, the Council was at the
   last moment transferred to Chalcedon in the neighbourhood of the
   capital, and was opened on the eighth of October, 451.

   As regards the number of those who took part in it--between 500 and 600
   and perhaps over 600--no earlier Council can compare with this one,
   which was "politically and ecclesiastically one of the most important
   of all", [398] [399] a memorial of the restoration of the authority of
   the State accomplished by Pulcheria and Marcian, but for this very
   reason a memorial of the enslavement of the spirit of the Eastern
   Church which here, in connection with the most important doctrinal
   question, surrendered to the Western supreme bishop allied with the
   Emperor. We have no right at all to say that possibly the "authorised
   moment of truth" of the Antiochian Christology triumphed at Chalcedon
   over the dogmatic ideas of the Alexandrians and the monks, for the
   representatives of this Christology had long ere this succumbed to the
   power of the Alexandrian Confession. The unspeakably pitiful behaviour
   too of the Patriarchs of Antioch and of the largest section of the
   bishops who were theologians in sympathy with them,--the Antiochian
   middle-party which dates from 433--proves that the members of this
   school conscious of their miserable powerlessness, had of their own
   free will long ere this renounced all attempts to influence the Church.
   The disgrace attaching to this Council consists in the fact that the
   great majority of the bishops who held the same views as Cyril and
   Dioscurus finally allowed a formula to be forced upon them which was
   that of strangers, of the Emperor and the Pope, and which did not
   correspond to their belief. Judging by the Acts of the Council we can
   be in no doubt as regards the following points: [400] (1) that the
   views of the great majority of the Fathers assembled at Chalcedon
   agreed neither with those of Leo nor with those of Flavian who
   represented the Antiochian middle-party, that on the contrary they, and
   above all the Illyrian, Palestinian, and Egyptian bishops, wished for
   nothing else beyond the ratification of the Creeds of Nicæa and Ephesus
   as understood by Cyril; [401] (2) that for this reason the formula,
   "out of two natures Christ is," with the addition either expressed or
   understood, that after the Incarnation the God-Logos had only one
   nature which had become flesh, alone answered to the faith of the
   Constantinopolitan Patriarch Anatolius and of the majority of the
   bishops; (3) that far from Theodoret and his friends possessing the
   sympathy of the majority of the members of the Council, they had to
   endure the worst forms of abuse, being called "Jews", while Theodoret
   succeeded in saving his orthodoxy only by allowing his opponents to
   extort from him the condemnation of Nestorius; [402] (4) that the
   Imperial Commissioners directed all the proceedings and were resolved
   from the first to get the deposition of Dioscurus carried through at
   the Council, although they gave the Council the show of freedom; (5)
   that the Imperial Commissioners had been at the same time instructed to
   press for the establishment of a new doctrinal formula on the basis of
   Leo's letter in order to bring to an end the intolerable state of
   things which had prevailed in the Church of the East owing to the
   annulling of the resolution of 449; (6) that the Roman legates were at
   one with the Commissioners in their determination to get the Council to
   decree the deposition of Dioscurus and the setting up of a dogmatic
   confession, but that they differed from them so far in that they wished
   Dioscurus to be described as a heretic, in other words, as a rebel
   against the Pope, and at the same time exerted themselves simply
   towards getting Leo's ep. dogmatica accepted in the Church; (7) that
   Dioscurus had to submit to a judicial process of an extremely
   disgraceful and unjust kind, that he acquitted himself worthily, and
   firmly maintained his position as the successor of Athanasius, and that
   in the end he was in no sense deposed on the ground of heresy, nor on
   account of murder, but on the ground of certain irregularities,
   including contempt for the divine canon, and disobedience to the
   Council, [403] while his deceased opponent Flavian was on the other
   hand rehabilitated; [404] (8) that the bishops who had met together
   with him at Ephesus at first attempted to make out that the vote they
   gave there had been extorted by force, but that afterwards when they
   found they could not prove this they described themselves in the most
   dishonourable way as erring men who had gone wrong and begged
   forgiveness, although as a matter of fact they did not deny their faith
   at Ephesus in the year 449, but now at Chalcedon; [405] (9) that,
   considering the views of the faith prevailing at the time, the great
   majority of the bishops were able to comply with a new rule of faith
   even though it might be expressed in the usual terms, only by doing
   violence to their consciences, and that they finally deceived
   themselves by drawing the delusive distinction that it was not a
   question of an exposition (ekthesis) but of an interpretation
   (hermeneia); (10) that spite of all the pressure put on them by the
   Roman legates and the commissioners, the majority under the guidance of
   Anatolius while expressly emphasing the fact that Dioscurus was not
   deposed on account of heresy--Anatolius had always in his heart agreed
   with the views of Dioscurus--further attempted to set up a doctrinal
   formula in which the distinction between the two natures was made one
   in thought only, and which made it possible to speak of one nature
   after the Incarnation, [406] and that three statements particularly, in
   the third and fourth chapters of Leo's letter to Flavian, (see above)
   appeared to the bishops to be intolerably Nestorian; [407] (11) that
   the bishops abandoned their proposed formula only after the most
   violent threats on the part of the Emperor, among which too was a
   threat to transfer the Council to Italy, and that they outwardly
   reconciled themselves to the statements of Leo with which they had
   found fault by deluding themselves with the false idea that Cyril said
   very much what Leo said and that both were in agreement; (12) that the
   new doctrinal formula [408] would nevertheless not have been carried
   through if it had not finally been established under severe pressure at
   a secret commission, and that this formula is so far lacking in
   veracity in that it is intended to contain the genuine doctrine of
   Cyril and recognises the resolution of the Cyrillian Council of 431,
   while it gives it the go-bye in so far as it sets aside the unity and
   union of the natures.

   The imperial-papal formula was proclaimed and adopted at the fifth
   sitting. [409] It first of all confirms the decision of Nicæa a,
   Constantinople, and Ephesus, it then explains that the Creed which had
   been handed down is sufficient in itself, but that on account of the
   teachers of false doctrine who on the one hand reject the designation
   theotokos and on the other wish to introduce the idea of a confusion
   (sunchusis) and mixing (krasis) of the natures, "and absurdly fabricate
   only one nature for the flesh and the Godhead," [410] and consider the
   divine nature of the only-begotten to be capable of suffering, the
   Council has adopted both the letters of Cyril to Nestorius [411] and
   the Easterns, as well as the letter of Leo. It is therefore directed
   both against those who break up the mystery of the Incarnation into two
   sons, and also against those who consider the Godhead of the
   only-begotten to be capable of suffering, who imagine a mingling and a
   fusion and declare the human substance of Christ to be a heavenly
   substance: "those who on the one hand assert two natures in the Lord
   before the union and those on the other hand who imagine one after the
   union, be anathema." (kai tous duo men pro tes henoseos phuseis tou
   kuriou mutheuontas, mian de meta ten henosin anaplattontas,
   anathematizei). (This was the sacrifice of the thought of Faith.)
   "Following therefore the holy Fathers, we all agree in teaching plainly
   that it is necessary to confess one and the same Son our Lord Jesus
   Christ, perfect alike in His divinity and perfect in his humanity,
   alike truly God and truly man," (Hepomenoi toinon tois hagiois patrasin
   hena kai ton auton homologein huion ton kurion hemon I. Chr. sumphonos
   hapantes ekdidaskomen, teleion ton auton en theoteti kai teleion ton
   auton en anthropoteti, Theon alethos kai anthropon alethos ton auton).
   This is further developed in detail, then we have: "We acknowledge one
   and the same Christ in two natures unconfusedly, unchangeably,
   indivisibly, inseparably; nowhere is the difference of the natures
   annulled because of the union, but on the contrary the property of each
   of the two natures is preserved; each nature coming together into one
   person and one hypostasis, not divided or separated into two persons,
   but one and the same Son and only-begotten, God-Logos." (hena kai ton
   auton Christon . . . en duo phusesin [412] asunchutos, atreptos,
   adiairetos, achoristos gnorizomen; oudamou tes ton phuseon diaphoras
   aneremenes dia ten henosin, sozomenes de mallon tes idiotetos hekateras
   phuseos. kai eis hen prosopon kai mian hupostasin suntrechouses, ouk
   eis duo prosopa merizomenon e diairoumenon, alla hena kai ton auton
   huion kai monogene, Theon logou). The decree appeals in support of
   these statements to the Old Testament, to Jesus Christ Himself, and--to
   the Nicene Creed; at the close it is said that no one is to accept or
   teach any other creed, that on the contrary only this form of belief is
   to be handed down in connection with the instruction of Jews, heathen,
   and heretics.

   The Emperor had now got what he wished. He had shewn that he ruled the
   Church, and he had got a formula according to which he was able
   henceforth to decide what was orthodox and what was heretical. [413] An
   end was put to the uncertain state of things which permitted everyone
   to appeal to the 318 bishops and in doing this to think whatever he
   liked. In the full consciousness of his triumph Marcian appeared in
   person along with Pulcheria at the sitting immediately following (6),
   and addressed the Council, making express reference to Constantine. He
   was greeted with acclamations from the whole Council: "We all so
   believe; we are all orthodox; this Faith has saved the world; hail to
   Marcian, the new Constantine, the new Paul, the new David! You are the
   peace of the world; Pulcheria is the new Helena!" But the Pope too had
   got what he wanted, if not everything. His letter had not been given
   straight off the place of a doctrinal ordinance, but the
   Conciliar-decree had proceeded from this letter; his dogmatic teaching
   was acknowledged, and in his address to the Council Marcian had given
   expression to this fact. The truth is that without the help of the
   Papal legates Marcian could not have effected anything. But the Church
   of the East had been deprived of its faith. [414] The henosis phusike,
   the natural union, was not mentioned; no one could any longer
   unhesitatingly teach that the God-Logos had taken up the human nature
   into the unity of his unique substance and made it the perfect organ of
   His deity. The construction of a Christology based on the God-Logos was
   severely shaken; the "two hypostases" (duo hupostaseis) were not
   expressly condemned. In the "coming together" (suntrechein) each nature
   continues to exist in its own mode of being; the divinity has not
   absorbed the humanity nor has the humanity been exalted to the height
   of the divinity, but the human and divine natures are simply united in
   the person of the Redeemer, and therefore only mediately and in an
   individual (individuum). No pious Greek who had had Athanasius and
   Cyril for his teachers could acknowledge that to be "the right mean";
   it was not even a formula of compromise like that of the year 433; it
   was the abandonment of the work of developing the Christological
   formula strictly in accordance with soteriology. The latter itself now
   became uncertain. If humanity was not deified in Christ, but if in His
   case His humanity was merely united with the divinity by the prosopon
   or person, then what effect can a union such as that have for us? That
   formula can only be of advantage either to the detested "moralism" of
   the Antiochians, or to mysticism, which bases its hope of redemption on
   the idea that the God-Logos continually unites Himself anew with each
   individual soul so as to form a union. The four bald negative terms
   (asunchutos etc.,) which are supposed to express the whole truth, are
   in the view of the classical theologians amongst the Greeks, profoundly
   irreligious. They are wanting in warm, concrete substance; of the
   bridge which his faith is to the believer, the bridge from earth to
   heaven, they make a line which is finer than the hair upon which the
   adherents of Islam one day hope to enter Paradise. One may indeed say
   that the Chalcedonian Creed preserved for the East the minimum of
   historical conception which the Church still possessed regarding the
   person of Christ, by cutting short the logical results of the doctrine
   of redemption, which threatened completely to destroy the Christ of the
   Gospels. But the Fathers who accepted the Creed did not think of that.
   They in fact accepted it under compulsion, and if they had thought of
   this, the price which they paid would have been too dear; for a
   theology which, in what is for it the most important of all questions,
   has recourse to mere negatives, is self-condemned. Nor is it of any use
   to point to the fact that the Council merely gave the mystery a
   definite standing and thereby furthered the interests of the Greek
   Church and the Greek theology. The true mystery on the contrary was
   contained in the substantial union of the two natures themselves. It
   was seriously damaged by being banished from its place here, and when
   in place of it the conception of the union, a conception which was
   supposed at the same time to involve a state of separation, was raised
   to the position of the secret of faith. The real mystery was thus
   shoved aside by a pseudo-mystery which in truth no longer permitted
   theology to advance to the thought of the actual and perfect union.
   Monophysitism which holds to the statement that, without prejudice to
   the homoousia of the body of Christ with our body, the God-Logos made
   this body His own body and for this reason took it up into the unity of
   His substance, is without doubt the legitimate heir of the theology of
   Athanasius and the fitting expression of Greek Christianity. [415] The
   proposition, however, which was now to pass for orthodox, "each nature
   in communion with the other does what is proper to it," (agit utraque
   forma cum alterius communione, quod proprium est) actually makes two
   subjects out of one and betokens a lapse from the ancient faith. That
   the view we have here expressed is correct is attested by the previous
   history of the formula of the two natures and the one person. Up to
   this time scarcely anything had been known in the East of a "nature
   without hypostasis" (phusis anupostatos), although the Antiochians had
   distinguished between phusis and prosopon. It is attested further by
   the melancholy proceedings at the Council itself, and, as will be
   shewn, it is attested above all by the history which follows. A formula
   was now introduced which could ultimately be traced to a legal source
   and which for that reason could be transformed into a
   philosophical-theological formula only by a scholastic.

   At Chalcedon only a part of the deputation of monks who had approached
   the Council with the prayer that the ancient faith might not suffer
   harm, and also the majority of the Egyptian monks, remained firm. [416]
   We cannot say, however, whether the action of the latter was an
   instance of the courage of faith. Their request that the Council should
   not compel them to accept the formula since in this case they would be
   killed after their return to Egypt, their despairing cry, "We shall be
   killed, if we subscribe Leo's epistle; we would rather be put to death
   here by you than there; have pity on us: we would rather die at the
   hands of the Emperor and at your hands than at home," proves that they
   were still more afraid of Coptic fanaticism than of the Emperor's
   police. They were allowed to postpone their subscription till a new
   bishop should be appointed to Alexandria, since they had explained that
   without a new bishop they could do nothing. They were not, however, to
   stir from Constantinople till then.

   The Council was to be a Council of peace after the downfall of
   Dioscurus. All were pardoned, even Ibas himself, and on the other hand,
   the traitorous associates of Dioscurus at whose head stood Juvenal of
   Jerusalem. All were restored to their bishoprics so far as that was at
   all feasible. A series of Canons was then issued dealing with the
   regulation of ecclesiastical matters. The seventeenth Canon asserted in
   a blunt fashion what was a fundamental Byzantine principle: "let the
   arrangement also of the ecclesiastical districts follow that of the
   civil and state places." (tois politikois kai demosiois topois kai ton
   ekkklesiastikon paroikion he taxis akoloutheito). The twenty-eighth,
   under cover of an appeal to the third Canon [417] of 381, struck a blow
   at Rome by ordaining that the patriarch of Constantinople was to enjoy
   similar privileges to those possessed by the bishop of Rome, was to be
   second to him in rank, and was to get an enormous extension of his
   diocese--namely, over Pontus, Asia, and Thrace. The proceedings in
   connection with this matter do not belong to the history of dogma,
   although Leo combated the resolution with dogmatic arguments drawn from
   tradition. The Roman legates, we may note, entered their protest. The
   Emperor once more created for himself a patriarch primi ordinis, after
   that the patriarch of Alexandria had had to be overthrown, and it was
   the bishop of his own capital whom he put alongside of the Roman
   bishop. The Council had to ask the Pope to confirm the twenty-eighth
   Canon by way of return, as it was openly put, for the acknowledgment of
   his dogmatic letter in the East. [418] But the Pope remained firm; his
   letters 104-107 prove that he had no intention of surrendering the
   grand success he had secured just in the East. A primacy of the East in
   Constantinople was the greatest possible danger, and for this reason
   Leo at once again took up the cause of the chairs of Alexandria and
   Antioch. In fact he now even shewed some hesitation in giving his
   approval of the resolutions of the great Councils generally, so that
   the Monophysites came to be under the pleasing delusion that he was
   inclined to side with them. (!) [419] He soon entirely broke with
   Anatolius and entered into negotiations with the new bishop of
   Alexandria (ep. 129) and with the bishop of Antioch (ep. 119) whose
   position in their patriarchates he sought to strengthen, and whom he
   begged to send him more frequently information regarding their affairs
   that he might be able to render them assistance. Soon, however, the
   Constantinopolitan bishop Anatolius found himself in such a difficult
   position owing to the new dogmatic controversies, that he preferred to
   shelve the Canon complained of and once more to seek the friendship of
   Leo which he did indeed secure.

   p. 42 f.

   [367] See, above all, the Church History of Socrates, who thoroughly
   understood this aspiration of theirs.

   [368] Of all the great bishops of the Empire the Roman and Alexandrian
   bishops alone possessed a traditional policy which was strictly adhered
   to, and acted in accordance with it. They accordingly really became
   forces in history. The Chair of Antioch never had a policy; in the
   conflicts with the Arians it became a mere puppet after the Church
   already sixty years before this had had to come to its assistance, and
   it possessed no fixed traditions. The position taken up in the
   Nestorian controversy by the feeble and unreliable John is typical of
   the bishops of Antioch (see his letter to Sixtus of Rome). It is
   customary to complain of the hierarchial imperiousness of Athanasius,
   of the violent actions of Theophilus, Cyril, and Dioscurus, and of the
   unfeeling policy of the Roman bishops, and to contrast them with the
   Bishops of Antioch. But people do not reflect that when forces manifest
   themselves they have to adapt themselves to the material upon which
   they are to work, and quite as little do they try to imagine what
   appearance the history of the Church would have presented without the
   "violences" of the Roman and Alexandrian bishops. Those who at the
   present day complain, together with their dogmatic system, would not at
   all events have been here at all if these tyrannical and unfeeling
   princes of the Church had not existed, and the tame dogmatic of the
   present time would never have made its appearance apart from the
   fanatical dogmatic of those despots. It may be incidentally remarked
   that we ought hardly to conclude from Mansi VI., p. 1008, that
   Dioscurus wished to restore Origen's reputation.

   [369] Hellenism in the East received its death-blow owing to the
   downfall of the Alexandrian bishop in the year 451; with Theophilus the
   process of estrangement between the Church and Hellenism had
   undoubtedly already begun.

   [370] The unique position of the Alexandrian Chair till 450 and its
   policy, have up till now not had justice done them in our histories.
   The bishop of Alexandria ranked as the second in Christendom (see
   above, at the Council of 381) and corresponding to this position was a
   certain right which is indeed difficult to define--of oversight, or
   better, the exercise of an oversight over the churches of the East in
   the Fourth and Fifth centuries, which was being more and more widely
   recognised. The Alexandrian bishops attempted to develop the position
   which they thus occupied to a position of primacy.

   [371] Sixtus III., Coelestin's successor, as his letters prove,
   continued on the best of terms with Cyril and silently repulsed the
   attempt made by two Nestorian bishops, Eutherius and Helladius, to
   break up the union between Rome and Alexandria (see the letter of the
   two amongst the letters of Sixtus). His epistle to John of Ephesus
   proves (ep. 6) that he had inherited his predecessor's hatred of
   Nestorius. On the other hand the sole letter of Leo I. to Dioscurus
   which we possess, and which was written soon after his enthronement
   (445), surprises us by its tone which recalls the letters of Victor and
   Stephanus, and by its demands. Dioscurus could not have forgotten a
   letter such as this. Still it is not till the time of the Council of
   Ephesus that we have plain evidence of the dissension between the two
   bishops (see Leo's ep. 43 sq.). The way in which Dioscurus treated
   Leo's epistle and the legates secured for him the bitter enmity of the
   Pope. The question now was: Rome or Alexandria? Previous to this Leo
   himself, like his predecessors, had in Christology used a form of
   statement which was Cyrillian, or Tertullian-Augustinian. He says Serm.
   34. 4: "dei filius naturæ carnis immixtus", and 23. 1: "naturæ alteri
   altera miscebatur."

   [372] Thomasius (Dogmengesch. I. 2, p. 367) also pronounces the Council
   of Chalcedon "hardly less stormy" than that of the year 449.

   [373] The documentary material bearing on the Eutychian controversy has
   been for the most part printed in Mansi T. V. sq.; where also will be
   found the letters of Leo I. (cf. the edition of Ballerini) and those of
   Theodoret having reference to the subject. Historical accounts in
   Prosper, Liberatus, Facundus, in the hist. eccl. of Zacharias of
   Mytilene hitherto published only in Syrian, in the breviculus hist.
   Eutych. (Sirmond's App. ad Cod. Theodos.), in Euagrius, Theophanes, and
   many later Greek and particularly Oriental chroniclers. To these have
   been added in recent times, apart from Zacharias (see Krüger, Monophys.
   Streitigkeiten, 1884) first of all the hitherto unknown Appellations of
   Flavian and Eusebius of Doryläum to Leo I. (see Guerrino Amelini, S.
   Leone magno e l'Oriente. Roma 1882, Grisar i. d. Ztschr. f. Kath.
   Theo]. VII., 1883, p. 191 f., Mommsen, Neues Archiv. XI. 2, 1886, p.
   361 f.); second, the Acts of the Robber-Council according to a Syrian
   MS., in German by Hoffmann (Kiel 1873), in an English translation with
   rich additions from other Syrian MSS, by Perry, The Second Synod of
   Ephesus 1881, and previously published by the same writer, An Ancient
   Syriac Docum. etc., Oxford 1867; Martin, Actes du Brigand. d'Éphese,

   Pseudo-Synode connu dans l'hist. sous le nom de Brigandage d'Éphese,
   étudié d'après ses actes retrouvés en Syriaque, 1875, thirdly the
   publication of Révillout, Récits de Dioscore, exilé à Gangres, sur le
   concile de Chalcédoine, translated into French from the Coptic, (Rev.
   Egyptol. 1880, p. 187 sq., 1882, p. 21 sq., 1883, p. 17 sq.); see
   Krüger op, cit. p. 12 f. Accounts in Baronius, Tillemont, Gibbon,
   Walch, Schröckh, Neander and Hefele; cf. the works on Leo I. by
   Quesnel, Arendt, Perthel. Spite of these works we do not yet possess a
   critical account of the history of the Church and of dogma for the all
   important years previous to the Council of Chalcedon. The most
   important preliminary work in this direction would be a monograph on
   Theodoret, the man who in my opinion was the most truth-loving and the
   least guided by considerations of policy of the Fathers of that period.
   This has been done by a Russian, Glubokowski (see above); but it is
   unfortunately not accessible to German science.

   [374] See, e.g., de recte fida ad Theodos. (Mansi IV., p. 693): I. Chr.
   anthropinois te au kai tois huper anthropon idiomasin eis hen ti to
   metaxu sunkeimenos.

   [375] See, above all, his "Eranistes". The work of the Catholic
   Bertram, Theodoreti doctrina christologica, 1883, is painstaking but
   biassed; sec. Theol. Lit. Ztg., 1883, No. 24; Möller in Herzog's
   R.-Encyklop. sec ed. XV., p. 401 ff., The question of Theodoret's
   orthodoxy is certainly a very troublesome one for a Catholic.

   [376] Dioscurus treated the metropolitan Irenæus of Tyre, and Theodoret
   in the year 448, in the style of one who was primate of the whole Greek
   Church and was recognised by the Emperor as such.

   [377] Flavian takes his stand on the Union of 433 though he inclines to
   the Antiochian interpretation of it; see his confession in Mansi VI.,
   p. 541: kai gar en duo phusesin homologountes ton Christon meta ten
   sarkosin ten ek tes hagias parthenou kai enanthropesin, en mia
   hupostasei kai en heni prosopo (a distinction is thus drawn between
   phusis and hupostasis, while hupostasis and prosopon are regarded as
   parallel terms, and accordingly the way is paved for the Chalcedonian
   formula in the East also), hena Christon, hena huion, hena kurion
   homologoumen, kai mian men tou Theou logou phusin sesarkomenen mentoi
   kai enanthropesasan legein ouk arnoumetha--the letter is addressed to
   Leo, and Flavian was apparently not yet aware what Leo's views were and
   whether perhaps he did not adhere entirely to the doctrine of Cyril.
   The prudent patriarch accordingly "confesses" two natures after the
   incarnation also and yet one!--dia to ex amphoin hena kai ton auton
   einai ton kurion hemon I. ton Chr. Tous de duo huious e duo hupostaseis
   etc.; a condemnation of Nestorius follows. Here at all events the way
   is paved for the Chalcedonian formula but, characteristically enough,
   by a bishop who sought to take up a safe position relatively to both
   sides.

   [378] The statement when compared with Cyril's doctrine can scarcely be
   regarded as open to suspicion. Eutyches recognised the existence of two
   natures previous to the incarnation, i.e., allowed that the distinction
   in thought was an ideal moment, but he could not admit the perfect
   homousia of the body of the Logos with our body after the incarnation,
   since that body was to be thought of as having been deified. Cyril had
   not indeed openly said that the actual body of the Logos was not
   homoousios with our body, but still he could scarcely avoid that
   conclusion. Eutyches rejected as a calumny the charge brought against
   him of teaching that Christ brought his flesh from heaven, on the
   contrary indeed he was the first to declare in the course of the debate
   that the Holy Virgin is homousios with us and that from her our God
   became flesh. He wished in this way to escape making any direct
   admission.

   [379] See the letter of the Empress Eudokia to Theod. II. (Leo. ep 57):
   egraphe gar entautha pasan philoneikeian kekinesthai, hoste phlauianon
   ton episkopon ek ton anthropinon pragmaton eparthenai.

   [380] Leo's admission is amusing reading (ep. 34 I): "Diu apud nos
   uncertum fuit, quid in ipso Eutyche catholicis displiceret." Now
   Eutyches is the child of the devil who denies the reality of the body
   of Christ. Leo represents him in the bluntest fashion as the out and
   out doketist.

   [381] Ep. 36 ad Flav.: "Et quia clementissimus imperator pro ecclessiæ
   pace sollicitus synodum voluit congregari, quamvis evidenter appareat,
   rem, de qua agitur, nequaquam synodali indigere tractatu" etc.; ep. 37
   ad Theod. II.: "præsertim cum tam evidens fidei causa sit, ut
   rationabilius ab indicenda synodo fuisset abstinendum" etc.

   [382] Leo writes here as if in this affair of Eutyches the Emperor had
   had recourse to him first as the successor of Peter, and as if he had
   at once unfolded the true doctrine of the Incarnation on the basis of
   the confession of Peter and thereby refuted Eutyches ("religiosa
   clementissimi principis fides sciens ad suam gloriam maxime pertinere,
   si intra ecclesiam catholicam nullius erroris germen exsurgeret, hanc
   reverentiam divinis detulit institutis, ut ad sanctæ dispositionis
   effectum auctoritatem apostolicæ sedis adhiberet, tamquam ab ipso Petro
   cuperet declarari, quid in eius confessione laudatum sit, quando
   dicente domino: quem me esse dicunt homines filium hominis?" etc.). The
   Council is merely an opus superadditum, "ut pleniori iudicio omnis
   possit error aboleri." Thus the condemnation of Eutyches is already
   decided upon and the Council has merely to repeat it. The Pope enjoins
   this.

   [383] The letter to which not till a later date, however, (see Mansi
   VI., p. 962 sq.) though by Leo himself, proofs were appended from
   Hilary, Augustine, Gregory of Nazianzus, Chrysostom and Cyril, begins
   with a reference to the Roman Creed which in the view of Leo decides
   the whole question in its opening words; for the three statements:
   "Credere in patrem omnipotentem, et in Christum Iesum filium eius
   unicum dominum nostrum, qui natus est de spiritu sancto et Maria
   virgine", demolish "the devices of almost all heretics." They involve
   the nativitas divina, and the nativitas temporalis which in no way
   injures the former. We should not have been able to overcome the author
   of sin and death if the deus ex deo had not assumed our nature. If
   Eutyches was unable to recognise that this was taught in the Creed,
   then certain passages (which the Pope now adduces) ought to have
   convinced him--as if Eutyches had ever denied the truth of this
   thought! The idea of a non-human body of Christ cannot be proved from
   the miraculous birth; for the Holy Spirit merely gave the impulse; the
   reality of the body of Christ was got from the body of Maria semper
   virgo (c. 2). This is followed by the proposition in the style of
   Tertullian: "Salva igitur proprietate utriusque naturæ et substantiæ
   (both words should be noted) et in unam coeunte personam suscepta est a
   maiestate humilitas", attached to which we have a series of expressions
   which are supported by statements in Damasus, Ambrose, Augustine, and
   partly also in Tertullian; thus, "natura inviolabilis unita est naturæ
   passibili", "mediator dei et hominum homo Iesus Christus", "mori potest
   ex uno, mori non potest ex altero", "in integra veri hominis
   perfectaque natura verus natus est deus, totus in suis, totus in
   nostris", "assumpsit formam servi sine sorde peccati, humana augens,
   divina non minuens", "exinanitio inclinatio fuit miserationis, non
   defectio potestatis", "tenet sine defectu proprietatem suam utraque
   natura, et sicut formam servi dei forma non adimit, ita formam dei
   servi forma non minuit" This was the way in which God met the cunning
   of the devil, in order that we should not be lost contra dei propositum
   (c. 3). Next follow the old Western paradoxes of the "invisibilis
   factus visibilis" etc. The fourth chapter contains the detailed
   development of the doctrine. The human nature in Christ was not
   absorbed by the divine; on the contrary "agit utraque forma cum
   alterius communione, quod proprium est verbo scilicet operante quod
   verbi est et carne exsequente quod carnis est." The flesh never loses
   the "natura nostri generis". In accordance with this the evangelic
   history is apportioned between the human and the divine nature of him
   "qui unus idemque est". "Quamvis enim in domino T. Chr. dei et hominis
   (!) una persona sit, aliud tamen est, unde in utroque communis est
   contumelia, aliud unde communis est gloria". "Propter hanc unitatem
   personæ", as it is put in c. 5, "in utraque natura intelligendam et
   filius hominis legitur descendisse de coelo" etc., that means as Leo
   now shews, that we can and must interchange the opera. "That the Son of
   God was crucified and buried, we all confess in the Creed." Christ
   established this article of faith in the 40 days after the
   Resurrection, after Peter had already before this acknowledged the
   identity of the Son of God and the Son of Man. All ought accordingly to
   see that the "proprietas divinæ humanæque naturæ" "individua permanet"
   in Him, and consequently know that "Word" and "Flesh" are not the same,
   but that the one Son of God is Word and Flesh. Eutyches, who has by the
   most barefaced fictions emptied of its meaning the mystery to which
   alone we owe our redemption and separates the human nature from Jesus,
   incurs the sentence pronounced in 1 John IV. 2, 3. He must also
   necessarily deny the reality of the passion and death of Christ and
   thus subvert everything, the Spirit of sanctification, the water and
   the blood. In his concluding chapter Leo discusses the statement of
   Eutyches that before the union there were two natures and one after it
   and expresses his astonishment that "none of the judges censured such a
   foolish and perverse avowal and passed over such an absurd and
   blasphemous utterance as if they had heard nothing to which to take
   exception." The first half of the statement is as impious as the
   second; this statement which had been passed over ought "si per
   inspirationem misericordiæ dei ad satisfactionem causa perducitur," to
   be made a clean sweep of as a pestilential opinion. The Pope hopes that
   Eutyches will amend and in this case the greatest mercy will be shewn
   him. The statements in this twenty-eighth letter were further
   supplemented in letter 35 addressed to Julian. Here (c. 1) Nestorius
   too is regarded as a heretic; as against Eutyches the view is made good
   that it is not only a question of the Creator being known, but also of
   the creature being redeemed. Here we meet with the statement "in
   susceptione hominis non unius substantiæ, sed unius eiusdemque
   personæ", here the unity of the person is made intelligible (see Cyril)
   by pointing to unity of body and soul in man, and here finally the
   statement of Eutyches examined in the sixth chapter of letter 28 and
   which was not censured at Constantinople, is further dealt with. Leo
   understands it as meaning that the human nature of Christ had been
   already created before the Incarnation and accordingly classes it along
   with the statement of Origen regarding the pre-existence of the soul
   which had been already condemned. See also letter 59. A few remarks on
   the catchwords asunchutos, atreptos will perhaps not be out of place
   here. (The words adiairetos and achoristos do not require any special
   genetic explanation.) They have sprung from two sources in the history
   of dogma. The first of these is to be found in Tertullian's work adv.
   Prax. Tertullian c. 27 wrote in opposition to certain monarchian ideas,
   according to which the spiritus (= deus = pater = Christus) was either
   changed into the caro (= homo = filius = Jesus) or else was united and
   mingled with the caro so as to form a tertium quid and therefore a new
   being, and thus disappeared in the new being. The view thus developed
   became universally known through Novatian who adopted it in part, but
   particularly by means of Leo's doctrinal letter. It runs: "Si enim
   sermo ex transfiguratione et demutatione substantiæ caro factus est,
   una iam erit substantia ex duabus, ex carne et spiritu, mixtura quædam,
   ut electrum ex auro et argento et incipit nec aurum esse, id est
   spiritus, neque argentum, id est caro, dum alterum altero mutatur et
   tertium quid efficitur." Thus Jesus would be no longer either God or
   Man: ita ex utraque neutrum est; aliud longe tertium est quam utrumque.
   But both the passages in the Psalms (LXXXVII. 5) and the Apostle (Rom.
   I. 3) teach de utraque eius substantia. Videmus duplicem statum, non
   confusum sed coniunctum, in una persona, deum et hominem Iesum . . . Et
   adeo salva est utriusque proprietas substantiæ, ut et spiritus res suas
   egerit in illo, i.e., virtutes et opera et signa, et caro passiones
   suas functa sit, esuriens sub diabolo, sitiens sub Samaritide . . .
   denique et mortua est. Quodsi tertium quid esset, ex utroque confusum,
   ut electrum, non tam distincta documenta parerent utriusque substantiæ.
   Sed et spiritus carnalia et caro spiritalia egisset ex translatione aut
   neque carnalia neque spiritalia, sed tertiæ alicuius forma ex
   confusione . . . Sed quia substantiæ ambæ in statu suo quæque distincte
   agebant, ideo illis et operæ et exitus sui occurrerunt." The second
   source is to be found in the Eastern and Western authors who wrote
   against Apollinaris; these maintained the asunchutos and atreptos, and
   this was quite the current view in the time of Cyril. Cyril, in a great
   number of passages asserts that according to his doctrine the two
   natures are joined together asunchutos, atreptos, analloiotos,
   ametabletos, without there having been any kind of mingling (sunchusis,
   sunkrasis, sunousiosis) (see adv. Nest. 1. 5, c. 4--ad Theodos. n. 6,
   10--ep. 3 ad Nestor. Migne, Vol. 77, p. 109--adv. neg. deip. n.

   Pusey c. 6, 7, III., p. 587 sq. Cyril devoted a special work to this
   subject entitled kata sunousiaston which I regard as one of his last).
   Nevertheless he defended the word krasis as against Nestorius (adv.
   Nestor. c. 3) as an expression used by the fathers to bring out the
   closeness of the union of the two natures, and unhesitatingly employs
   certain forms of speech compounded of it or its synonyms. (Ehrhard op.
   cit., p. 44.) Further, both of these, the amplifications of Tertullian
   and those of the anti-Apollinarian Greek fathers, refer back to
   philosophical usage, but this usage explains at the same time why Cyril
   and others could indeed adopt the expression krasis but not sunchusis.
   The Stoics (see Zeller. Philos. d. Griechen III. 3, p. 127) drew a
   distinction between parathesis, mixis, krasis and sunchusis. "The
   parathesis is the somaton sunaphe kata tas epiphaneias, as in the case
   of the mixing of different kinds of grain"--they have the Nestorians in
   view--: mixis on the contrary is duo e kai pleionon somaton
   antiparektasis di holon, hupomenouson ton sumphuon peri auta poioteton,
   as in the case of the union of fire with iron and of the soul with the
   body; but speaking more accurately a mingling of this sort of dry
   bodies should be called mixis, and of fluid bodies krasis (the krasis
   di holon of the Stoics presupposes the permeability of the bodies and
   assumes that the smaller body when mingled with a larger body spreads
   itself over the entire extent of the latter and is thus to be found in
   every particle of it [hos meden morion en autois einai me metechon
   panton ton en to migmati], but that both preserve their own
   peculiarities in the mingling; thus the "mixtio" does not exclude, but
   on the contrary includes the salva proprietas utriusque substantiæ).
   The sunchusos finally is duo e kai pleionon poioteton peri ta somata
   metabole eis heteras diapherouses touton poiotetos genesin, i.e., the
   old substances and their qualities cease to exist (phtheiresthai) and a
   third body comes into existence." Tertullian, the Stoic, rested his
   ideas apparently on these philosophical theorems and first of all
   applied this materialistic view to the relation of the two substances
   in Christ (he and Novatian, who was also a Stoic, accept the mixis and
   reject the sunchusis; but along with this Tertullian has further a
   juristic set of conceptions (una persona, duæ substantiæ). In his
   treatise "Ammonius Sakkas and Plotinus" (Archiv. f. Gesch. d. Philos.
   VII. Vol. H. 3) Zeller, however, has called attention to the fact that
   Ammonius Sakkas (Plotinus) described the relation of body and soul in
   man in the sense of the Stoic krasis (mixis) (the soul entirely
   permeates the body and unites itself with it so as to form one
   substance, but nevertheless remains unchanged and retains its
   proprietas salva) and that Nemesius expressly says that this view of
   the matter, in support of which he appeals to Porphyry, is to be
   applied to the relation of the two natures in Christ. Now, however, not
   only the Eastern bishops but also Leo I. expressly appeal in support of
   their Christology to the relation between body and soul. There can
   therefore be no doubt but that this is to be traced back to the
   Neo-Platonic school which had adopted a Stoic terminology. Plotinus
   calls the soul not only apathes but also atreptos (because in the union
   it undergoes no change); but, as Zeller observes, he never speaks of
   asunchutos. This word, however, once more occurs in Porphyry and is
   used to designate the union. Consequently so far as the Easterns are
   concerned the atreptos is to be referred to Plotinus and the asunchutos
   to Porphyry (Zeller), while the West through Tertullian took the "non
   confusus" direct from the Stoa.

   [384] It may also be said that the speculations of Cyril and the
   Alexandrian theologians begin where Leo leaves off, and for this reason
   it is altogether astonishing to read in Thomasius (Dogmengesch., Vol.
   I., p. 365) that Leo in his epistle seeks to gather up both negatively
   and positively the results of the Christological movement so far as it
   had gone. Leo did not think of this. He contents himself with making
   the thought definite and confessing with full assurance that Christ was
   perfect God and perfect man, and points out that redemption demands the
   divinity and the humanity. But the question as to the relation into
   which the divinity and the humanity have come to each other, was one
   which really never gave him any concern when he thought of redemption.
   This, however, was the main question with Cyril, Eutyches and
   Dioscurus. It cannot accordingly be said that Leo and they are in
   direct contradiction. On the contrary, Cyril and his followers further
   developed the problem in concrete fashion in the name of the Faith, ex
   necessitate fidei so to speak, while with Leo it was in true Western
   fashion left in the indefinite form of conceptions. This is how the
   matter stands on a favourable view of Leo's position; for as soon as we
   take his development of the doctrine in a concrete sense and transfer
   it into the region of the Eastern controversy it can be understood only
   as Nestorian. With Leo it is not at all a question of a union of the
   two natures. It may, however, help towards forming a fair and correct
   estimate of Leo's position to note that he (mistakenly) saw in
   Eutychianism the recurrence of a danger which he had so energetically
   warded off in his struggle with Manichæism (see his sermon). He in fact
   opposes "Eutychianism" as if it were Manichæism.

   [385] This has reference to the proceedings of the year 448 (Irenæus of
   Tyre) into which I cannot enter. The Syrian Acts first threw light on
   them as well as on the Councils of Tyre and Berytus.

   [386] See Martin, op. cit. p. 186 sq.

   [387] See Martin, p. 196 sq.

   [388] The charges brought against him by Egyptians at the third sitting
   of the Council of Chalcedon (Mansi VI. p. 1006-1035) even after making
   all due allowance for the calumnies in them, afford interesting proofs
   of how he disregarded the imperial authority in Egypt and how he
   weakened the authority of the State there and also of the extent to
   which he was master of Egypt and now threatened to become master of the
   State. Tillemont XV. p. 589, very justly says: "Dioscore règne
   partout." See, above all, p. 1032: Dioskoros panta akathosiotos
   pratton, nomizon te anotero panton einai, oute tous theious tupous oute
   tas megistas apophaseis sunechoresen ekbibasthenai, heautou ten choran
   mallon e ton kratounton einai legon.

   [389] See Theodoret's letters 113 and ff. Theodoret speaks in terms of
   high praise of Leo's ep. dogmatica, and as a matter of fact he had no
   reason for suspecting it in any way. In letter 121 he expressly says
   that Leo's letter agrees with tois par' hemon kai sungrapheisi kai ep'
   ekklesias keruchtheisin aei.

   [390] See the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon in Mansi VI., p. 1009;
   the matter is, however, not quite certain. It is even probable that
   Dioscurus did not excommunicate Leo till shortly before the Council of
   Chalcedon.

   [391] Valentinian III. writes to Theod. II. (ep. Leon. 55): "The Faith
   must get into confusion, hen hemeis apo ton progonon paradotheisan
   opheilomen meta tes prosekouses kathosioseos ekdikein kai tes idias
   eulabeias ten axian to makario apstolo Petro atroton kai en tois
   hemeterois chronois diaphulattein, hina ho makariotatos episkopos tes
   Rhomaion poleos, ho ten hierosunen kata panton he archaiotes paresche,
   choran kai euporian echein peri te pisteos kai hiereon krinein. Flavian
   was right in appealing to him. It is a curious spectacle! Both Emperors
   are entirely in the hands of their Patriarchs, the one in the hands of
   Dioscurus, and the other as here in the hands of Leo. Never yet had the
   State been so much under priestly authority. The Emperors who were
   powerless to do anything themselves played the one primate against the
   other.

   [392] He had, however, begun to shew a certain amount of hesitation
   during the last months, as is evident from the recall of Pulcheria and
   the banishment of his minister Chrysaphius. See Krüger, op. cit. p. 56.

   [393] Marcian ep. in Leon. epp. 73: "Pro reverenda et catholica
   religione fidei Christianorum tuam sanctitatem principatum in
   episcopatu divinæ fidei possidentem sacris litteris in principio justum
   credimus alloquendam . . . omni impio errore sublato per celebrandam
   synodum te auctore maxime pax circa omnes episcopos fidei catholicæ
   fiat!" It was in these terms that Marcian wrote to Leo! But he had in
   view merely an Eastern Council; see the second letter (ep. 76).

   [394] The Westerns could not come, he writes, because of the distress
   occasioned by the Huns.

   [395] Still the presidency was only an honorary presidency; even Hefele
   admits that "the official conducting of the business" was looked after
   by the Imperial Commissioners. As a matter of fact the Romish Legates
   were merely the first to record their vote.

   [396] One of the instructions given by Leo to his legates is to the
   effect that Dioscurus ought not to have a seat in the Council, but
   should only be heard as a defendant; Mansi VI , p. 580 sq.

   [397] Mansi VII., p. 443.

   [398] Ranke, Weltgesch. IV. 1, p. 324.

   [399] Luther, who is, speaking generally, not favourably disposed
   towards the Chalcedonian Council, says of it (von Conciliis and
   Kirchen, Erl. Ed., Vol., 25, p. 351): "The Fourth Council of Chalcedon
   had 630 members, almost as many as all the others, and yet they were
   quite unequal to the Fathers at Nicæa and Constantinople."

   [400] From the Récits de Dioscore (Krüger op. cit. 12 ff. 61-68) we
   gather--what was hitherto not known--that Dioscurus was to be won over
   in a friendly way by the Court after he had arrived at Constantinople
   from Alexandria. accompanied by fewer bishops than he had intended to
   have with him, in consequence of an intrigue. We now know that he was
   conducted to a meeting of ecclesiastical notables and that there he
   also met the Emperor and Pulcheria. Every effort was made to get him to
   agree to the ep. Leonis; but he remained firm and it is said that by
   his glowing words against the two natures he for the time being again
   won over the bishops (Anatolius, Juvenal, Maximus of Antioch and
   others) as well as the Senate to his doctrine. This is very probable.
   The story given in Krüger, p. 62, shews by what a spirit of rebellion
   against the State and Emperor he and his followers were animated. It
   follows from the Acts that during the first session of the Council of
   Chalcedon he was still a power.

   [401] Those too who held Antiochian views were undoubtedly no small
   number, namely, bishops from Syria, Asia, Pontus, and Thrace; they
   could accept Leo's letter: but (1) they were in the minority. (2)
   Partly by their repudiation of Nestorius and partly by what they did at
   Ephesus in 449 they had made the sacrifcium intellectus fidei and were
   thus spiritually demoralised. Others might without trouble have gained
   all they wanted so far as they were concerned.

   [402] The threatening and abusive language ("Whoever divides Christ
   ought to be divided himself; dismember them, cast them out, etc.") used
   at Chalcedon was not any milder than that used at Ephesus in 449.
   Theodoret condemned Nestorius at the eighth sitting, Mansi VII., p. 185
   sq. From the time of Leo I., moreover, the orthodox and those whose
   views were more of the type of the school of Antioch, applied the worst
   term of abuse, "Jew", to the Eutychians (Monophysites) because they
   ostensibly denied the Incarnation.

   [403] Dioscurus protested that he did not assume that there was any
   mixing of the natures; and nobody was able to prove the opposite
   against him; see Mansi VI., p. 676: Dioskoros eipen; oute sunchusin
   legomen oute tomen oute tropen. anathema to legonti sunchusin e tropen
   e anakrasin. On the other hand he was not refuted when he (p. 683)
   asserted: "Flavian was justly condemned because he still maintained two
   natures after the union. I can prove from Athanasius, Gregory, and
   Cyril that after the union we ought rather to speak only of one
   incarnate nature of the Logos. I will be rejected together with the
   Fathers, but I am defending the doctrine of the Fathers, and yield on
   no point." He approved of the expression "out of two natures"; one can
   readily understand how as early as the second session he no longer
   wished to appear at the Council.

   [404] In connection with this affair Juvenal and the Palestinian
   bishops changed their opinion in the most disgraceful fashion.

   [405] Some of them had agreed with Flavian in 448, with Dioscurus in
   449, and now they agreed with the Council! Even the Imperial
   Commissioners blamed the bishops for the contradiction in which they
   entangled themselves when they gave out that their vote of the year 449
   had been purely extorted from them; see Mansi VI., p. 637 fin. It has
   to be noted, moreover, that throughout the proceedings it was much
   more--in fact it was almost exclusively--a question of persons, of
   their standing, or of the right or wrong of their condemnation, and
   therefore as to Nestorius, Cyril, Flavian, Eutyches, Theodoret,
   Dioscurus, Leo, than a question of the actual matter in hand. In the
   first place everyone took care not to touch the real point or to have
   anything to do with constructing formula., and in the second place the
   personal question was with most of them the main thing.

   [406] See the proceedings in Mansi VII., p. 97 sq.

   [407] The expression so frequently used by the Westerns, God has
   assumed "a man", was also found fault with, but not officially.

   [408] The formula was probably already drawn up when the Chalcedonian
   Council began; that commission cannot have got it ready in the short
   time it had; it even appears to follow from what is said in the Récits
   de Dioscore that it had already been laid before the Court previous to
   the meeting of the Council.

   [409] See Mansi VII., p. 107 sq.

   [410] Rarely had any one to my knowledge expressed himself in this way
   after Apollinaris (mian einai tes sarkos kai tes theotetos phusin), but
   the Bishops had first to distort the faith which they themselves had
   avowed and which they now nevertheless rejected, in order to turn it
   into a heresy. The "Eranistes" of Theodoret, however, attacks those who
   "make the divinity and humanity into one nature."

   [411] The Anathemas of Cyril are also implicitly to be understood as
   included in these; see Loofs, op. cit. p. 50 f.

   [412] It is here that the difficulty occurs which has been so much
   discussed, namely, that the Greek text gives ek duo phuseon and the
   Latin "in duabus naturis". Judging from all that preceded this, one
   cannot but hold that Tillemont, Walch, Gieseler, Neander, Hefele and
   others are right (as against Baur and Dörner) and look for the original
   reading in the latter phrase. The form in which we have the Greek text
   is of course not a mere error, but is an ancient falsification. In the
   period from the fifth to the seventh century the falsification of acts
   was an important weapon for the defence of what was sacred.

   [413] This prospect was indeed a delusive one; for since the Council
   had expressly appealed both to Cyril and to Leo, its decree could be
   interpreted according to the views either of the one or of the other,
   and consequently the old trouble was really there again. The three
   decrees of February 7th, March 13th, and July 28th, 452, (Mansi VII.,
   pp. 476, 477, 501) are a proof of the energy and vigour with which the
   Emperor purposed to enforce the Chalcedonian Creed. According to the
   first of these all controversy was to cease, nobody was to dispute
   publicly regarding the faith. Whoever does this is looking in broad
   daylight for a false light, commits an act of sacrilege, insults the
   holy Council and betrays the secret to the Jews and the heathen. He
   must accordingly expect severe punishment, which has been already fixed
   and which will he of different degrees for the separate classes of the
   community. According to the third edict Eutychians and Apollinarians
   are forbidden to have pastors; those who contravene this order are to
   be punished with confiscation of their goods and exile. The right of
   assemblage, the right of building churches, and of being together in
   monasteries, is withdrawn from them. Their property is to go to the
   Exchequer. So too they are deprived of the power of inheriting anything
   and of bequeathing anything. Eutychian monks are to be treated as
   Manicheans, are to be driven from their "stalls" and removed from the
   soil of the Empire. Eutychian writings are to be burned, etc. Eutyches
   and Dioscurus themselves must go into exile.

   [414] In respect of its relation to the orthodox faith and of the fact
   that it owed its origin to the Emperor, the Chalcedonian Creed may be
   compared with the decrees of the last Councils of Constantius. It is
   true that orthodoxy afterwards found it easier to reconcile itself to
   the two natures than to the "likeness". Still perhaps it might have
   come to terms with the latter also.

   [415] We can only adduce one consideration here, namely, that it was
   essential to this Christianity which had the New Testament beside it,
   that it should never, just because of this, develop in a logical way as
   a mystical doctrine of redemption. Understood in this sense no
   objection can be taken to the statement that the logical development of
   the monophysite faith even in its least extravagant form, was bound to
   come into conflict with certain elements of the ecclesiastical
   tradition, or with certain New Testament passages which could not be
   given up.

   [416] See the proceedings of the fourth sitting.

   [417] The Romans before this had no official knowledge whatever of this
   Canon, and in praxi it had not been entirely enforced, even in the East
   itself, as the Robber-Synod shews.

   [418] Leo, ep. 98. The letter is full of flattery of the Pope; see c.
   I. It follows too from the formally very submissive epistle of
   Anatolius to Leo (ep. 100) that an attempt had been made to induce Leo
   by flattery to acknowledge the 28th Canon. We gather from Marcian's
   epistle to Leo (ep. 100) that the Emperor considered that Canon as the
   most important ordinance of the Council together with the doctrinal
   decision. For details see Kattenbusch, op. cit. I., p. 87 ff., where
   the Canons 9 and 17 are discussed.

   [419] See ep. 110; the approval followed in ep. 114, with certain
   reservations because of Canon 28; see ep. 115-117.
     __________________________________________________________________

   § 3. The Monophysite Controversies and the Fifth Council. [420]

   I. The severest condemnation of the Chalcedonian Creed as decree wrung
   from the Eastern Churches, is to be found in the history of the next 68
   years. These years are not only marked by the most frightful revolts on
   the part of the populace and the monks, particularly in Egypt,
   Palestine, and a part of Syria, but also by the attempts of the
   Emperors to get rid of the decree which had been issued with a definite
   end in view, and which was a source of difficulty and threatened the
   security of the Empire. [421] They were all the more under the
   necessity of making these attempts, that in the East energetic
   theologians who could defend the Chalcedonian Creed were entirely
   lacking. At this period it maintained its position only by means of the
   great importance given to it by the imposing Council, by the majority
   of the clergy in the capital, and by the Roman bishop. These were
   strong forces; but the strength of the opposition to it, which was
   supported by the increasing aversion to the Byzantine Emperor and his
   Patriarch, by national aspirations and personal antipathies. [422] was
   also great. In addition to this the pious-minded felt as much aggrieved
   by the fact that a new formula had been introduced at all as by what
   was in the formula itself. [423] The Encyclical letter (enkuklion) of
   the usurper Basilikus (476) which abrogated the Chalcedonian Creed and
   decided in favour of Monophysitism, had certainly only a passing
   importance. [424] But state-policy was successful in uniting a section
   of the Chalcedonians and Monophysites by means of a Henoticon (482),
   which, when issued as an imperial edict by Zeno, virtually annulled the
   decree of 451. [425] The result was that soon instead of two parties
   there were three; for not only did the strict Monophysites renounce
   their allegiance to the Alexandrian patriarch Peter Mongus who had
   concluded a union with his Constantinopolitan colleague Acacius, but
   the Roman bishop too, Felix II., (see the epp.) rejected the Henoticon
   and pronounced sentence of excommunication on Acacius. Old and New
   Rome, which were already separated by political circumstances, now came
   to be divided ecclesiastically, and this schism lasted from 484 to 519.
   Since the Henoticon soon shewed itself to be ineffective, it would have
   been brought to an end sooner if Rome had not insisted on the
   condemnation of Acacius by his successors. The Monophysites soon came
   forward again openly rejecting the Chalcedonian Creed, and those in the
   Eastern Empire who adhered to it, and also the Henotics, had at first
   difficulty in preventing the new Emperor Anastasius from formally doing
   away with the unfortunate decree. [426] The confusion was now greater
   than it had ever been. People who used one and the same Christological
   formula were often further apart and more bitter against one another
   than were those who were separated by. the wording of the formulæ. If
   the Emperor had not been a capable ruler, things in the Empire would
   have got out of joint. He was meanwhile always approaching nearer to
   Monophysitism with which he was personally in sympathy, and on the side
   of which stood not only the more fanatical, but also the more capable
   theologians, such as Philoxenus of Mabug, and Severus. In Syria and
   Palestine the Monophysite cause already triumphed amid terrors of all
   sorts; but the capital, Constantinople, and Thrace, with the true
   instinct of self-preservation held to the Chalcedonian Creed against
   the Emperor, the patron of heretics, and Vitalian, [427] a fierce
   general, a semi-barbarian, and rebel who was yet the forerunner of
   Justinian who taught him politics, made common cause with the
   Chalcedonians against his monarch. The Emperor had to submit to the
   powerful general; but it was not possible, even by making all sorts of
   concessions in regard to the dogmatic question, to get Rome, which put
   forward exorbitant claims, to agree to a policy of oblivion in
   reference to Acacius. Anastasius did not come to any agreement with the
   Pope Hormisdas. But what he did not succeed in doing was successfully
   accomplished by his successor Justin, or rather by the nephew and
   director of the new Emperor Justin, Justinian, in conjunction with
   Vitalian. They saw that for the re-establishment of the authority of
   the Emperor and the state in the Empire, the re-establishment of the
   Chalcedonian Creed and of the league with Rome, was indispensable.
   After that the authority of the four Councils had been once more
   solemnly recognised in Constantinople, everywhere throughout the Empire
   the orthodox raised their heads. Hormisdas did not himself appear in
   the capital; but his legates succeeded in getting almost everything he
   had asked. Again did the Roman bishop, like Leo before him, help the
   Byzantine State to gain the victory over the ecclesiastical movements.
   Orthodoxy was again restored and the names of the authors and defenders
   of the Henotikon, from Acacius and Zeno downwards were erased from the
   sacred books (519). The purification of Syria and its chair from the
   monophysite heresy meanwhile created some difficulty. The attempt to
   get the more determined Monophysites out of the way was, it is true,
   successful, but as soon it became a question as to who were to be their
   successors, it at once became evident again that the Chalcedonian Creed
   was understood in a different way in Rome and in the East respectively,
   and that the East had not got rid of the suspicion of Nestorianism so
   far as Rome was concerned.

   This difference emerged in a very characteristic fortn in the so-called
   Theopaschitian controversy. [428] The formulæ, "God has suffered", "God
   was crucified", were time-honoured forms [429] of speech in the Church
   and had never been quite forgotten. But after there had been so much
   speculation regarding the Trinity and the Incarnation, these formula
   came to be discussed too. Still, even after the formation of the
   Chalcedonian Creed, it seemed to be impossible to disapprove of them;
   for if Mary was to be called theotokos this meant that they were
   approved of. Nevertheless opposition soon shewed itself when the
   Monophysite patriarch of Antioch, Petrus Fullo, with the approval of
   his co-religionists, formulated the Trishagion as follows: Holy God,
   Holy the mighty one, Holy the immortal one who was crucified for us:
   hagios ho Theos, hagios ischuros, hagios athanatos, ho staurotheis di'
   hemas. The Emperor approved of this innovation which, however, at once
   met with opposition in Antioch itself, and which cost one of those who
   had to do with it his life. In the capital a controversy broke out when
   some Scythian monks, whose soundness in the faith was unimpeachable,
   defended the orthodoxy of the formula, "one of the Trinity was
   crucified--suffered in the flesh" ("unum de trinitate, esse
   crucifixum--passum carne"), about the year 518. The legates of Pope
   Hormisdas, bearing in mind Leo's doctrinal letter, opposed it as being
   incompatible with the Catholic Faith! The Pope himself was now
   concerned in the matter. A decision was necessarily urgently
   desired--on the part of the Emperor too; for the relations had become
   so strained that any sudden movement might throw the whole Church into
   confusion. Hormisdas hesitated about giving an answer; he neither
   wished to disavow his legates nor too openly to reject the formulæ. The
   decision which he finally gave in a letter to the Emperor Justin (521),
   was to the effect that everything was already decided, without,
   however, saying what was to be regarded as authoritative. This
   declaration which shewed his perplexity roused just indignation not
   only in Constantinople but also in North Africa. Justinian, who at
   first did not approve of the formula,--so long, that is, as he still
   followed in the wake of Vitalian,-- afterwards held to it all the more
   strongly, the more he urged the strictly Cyrillian interpretation of
   the Chalcedonian Creed. When he had the power he got the Popes too to
   acknowledge it, had the faithful but impolitic partisans of Rome, the
   Akoimetan monks in Constantinople, excommunicated, and finally got the
   formula sanctioned at the Fifth Ecumenical Council, that our Lord who
   was crucified in the flesh, Jesus Christ, was one of the Trinity. [430]

   It is apparently necessary to make a sharp distinction between the
   attempt of the Monophysites to give an extension to the Trishagion in a
   Theopaschitian sense, and the assertion of the Scythian monks that the
   doctrinal formula: "One of the Trinity suffered in the flesh", was
   orthodox. That attempt was rejected because it involved an innovation
   in worship and because it could be interpreted in a Sabellian sense.
   Orthodoxy putting this meaning on it, gave the name "Theopaschitian" a
   permanent place in its collection as a heretical name. On the other
   hand it was, to begin with, purely owing to Roman obstinacy that the
   formula proposed by the Scythians, and which, moreover, rather
   justifies than adopts the monophysite formula, was objected to. But it
   has been recently very justly remarked [431] that the cause of the
   offence which the formula gave, even to some of the Chalcedonians, is
   not to be looked for within the Christological, but on the contrary
   within the Trinitarian, domain. This brings us to a complete change
   which took place in the theology of that period and which claims the
   most serious attention.

   Attention has been already drawn to the fact, (Vol. III., p. 154 and
   above p. 126) that in the course of the transition from the fifth to
   the sixth century Aristotelianism once more became the fashion in
   science. This revolution helped to bring about the naturalisation of
   the Chalcedonian Creed in the Church, or what amounts to the same
   thing, contributed towards reconciling Greek religious feeling to it.
   While up to the beginning of the sixth century orthodoxy was without
   any theologians, we come across a man in the first half of the century
   who both as theologian and student of dogma was as able as he was
   prolific, and in the case of whom one feels that while he believes and
   thinks as Cyril believed and thought, his determined defence of the
   Chalcedonian Creed was nevertheless not in any way forced out of
   him--Leontius of Byzantium (c. 485-543). [432] When, however, we try to
   find out by what means he, as a theologian of the school of Cyril,
   succeeded in accommodating himself to the Chalcedonian Creed, it
   becomes clear that he was helped to this by the Aristotelian conceptual
   distinctions, and therefore by scholasticism. Leontius was the first
   scholastic. [433] While, owing to his faith, he stood in an intimate
   relation to Greek religious feeling, the Chalcedonian formula presented
   itself to him as an inviolable doctrine promulgated by the Church. But
   while he unweariedly defended it against Nestorians, Apollinarians, and
   Severians, dogmatic and religious considerations were put entirely into
   the background; their place was taken by an exposition of doctrine
   based on philosophical conceptions. [434] He treated of substance,
   genus, species, individual being, of the attributes which constitute
   the substance, of inseparable accidents and of separable accidents.
   [435] It was on the result of these discussions that the conceptions of
   the natures and the hypostasis in Christ were based; the Aristotelian
   deutera ousia, or second substance, was given a place of prominence,
   and thus the Chalcedonian Creed was justified. All the Aristotelian
   splitting of conceptions did not, it is true, cover the most crucial
   point of all--namely, the exposition of the unity. Here, however,
   Leontius had recourse to the idea of the Enhypostasis of the human
   nature; thus proving in the clearest way that he wished to keep the
   Chalcedonian definition on the lines laid down by Apollinaris and Cyril
   and not on those laid down in Leo's doctrinal letter. [436] In the
   whole way in which Leontius transferred the Nestorian-Monophysite
   controversy into the region of Philosophy, we may accordingly see a
   momentous revolution. This much, however, is certain, that his violent
   metabasis eis allo genos was the condition of the gradual
   reconciliation of the East with the Chalcedonian Creed [437] and that
   in intrinsic importance it may be classed along with the method of
   counting up authorities. Only in this way was it possible for Leontius
   to accept the formula as authoritative, and, spite of the dry form in
   which it was put, to regard it with respect from the religious point of
   view and at the same time to see in it an inexhaustible subject for the
   display of dialectical skill. It is undeniable that Chalcedonian
   orthodoxy was first firmly established in the East in the age of
   Justinian, that is to say, inner agreement with the Chalcedonian Creed
   was then first secured to any large extent, and this without abandoning
   Cyril's religious theology, but on the contrary while emphasising it
   and giving it the preference. [438] If this is so then the only
   possible explanation of these facts is that supplied by the entrance of
   Aristotelian scholasticism into the Church. The Chalcedonian dogma is
   lost in philosophical theology. The Faith and the Church were to a
   certain extent relieved, feeling reassured by the knowledge that the
   dogma was in safe keeping and in good hands, as it were. One can forget
   the scruples to which it gives rise, when one is confident that there
   are scholars who are able by the aid of a definite set of technical
   terms to make everything right. Here, too, for this reason, the work of
   the historian of dogma ceases; his place is taken by the historian of
   theology.

   Leontius was himself one of the Scythian monks. [439] The fact that
   this great opponent of the Monophysites championed the Theopaschitian
   formula and his criticism of the Antiochian theology, prove how far
   removed he was from Nestorianism. But the formula by its characteristic
   difference from the older conception, that of Petrus Fullo, further
   proves that the introduction of the Aristotelian philosophy into
   theology called for a restatement of the docttine of the Trinity. The
   "unus ex trinitate" is opposed to the "thrice holy" who was crucified
   for us. Tritheistic tendencies were not wanting at that period, and
   this is true of both sides in so far as attention was given to the
   Aristotelian philosophy. That Petrus Fullo, who as a Monophysite so
   energetically made the Trinity into a unity, was, it is true, no
   Aristotelian, but neither is his formula in any way typical of
   Monophysitism as a whole.

   The latter on the contrary for the two or three generations after the
   Chalcedonian Creed, shews that it had in it sufficient life and vigour
   to be accessible to the influence of the most varied movements and
   thoughts. It shews during this period that it was the expression of
   spiritual and theological life in the East generally. The state of
   petrifaction, barrenness, and barbarism into which it afterwards got,
   did not yet actually exist, although signs of its approach were evident
   amongst the fanatical masses and the ignorant monks. It is significant,
   to begin with, that Monophysitism did not allow itself to be carried to
   extremes by the blow dealt it by the Chalcedonian Creed. That is a
   proof of the goodness of its cause and of its power. The Monophysites
   were strongly bent on keeping clear of "Eutychianism". Anything like
   mingling or transformation was out of the question, in fact Eutyches
   himself was abandoned to his fate. [440] Then the readiness shewn by a
   large section of the Monophysites to come to terms with orthodoxy if
   only the Chalcedonian Creed and the objectionable dogmatic development
   in Leo's doctrinal letter were got out of the way, is a proof that they
   really strictly maintained the position of Cyril. This is true very
   specially of the most important champion of Monophysitism--Severus. The
   attempt has indeed been to draw a distinction, as regards doctrine,
   between Cyril and Severus, but the attempt does not seem to me to have
   been successful. [441] Cyril, equally with Severus, would have objected
   to Leo's assertion that each nature in Christ effects what is peculiar
   to it, though in conjunction with the other. The emphasis laid by
   Severus on the one energy is genuinely Cyrillian, and the expression
   borrowed from the Areopagite, energeia theandrike, "theandric energy",
   by no means approaches so near the limits of the permissible as the
   expression theotokos. But neither is there any difference in the
   formulæ, mia phusis tou logou sesarkomene, "one incarnate nature of the
   Logos" and mia phusis tou logou sesarkomenou, "one nature of the
   incarnate Logos"; for Cyril too, logically attributed one nature not
   only to the God-Logos but also to the Christ. The communication of
   properties according to him, involves in every respect the natures. But
   there is not even any trace of a theological difference between Severus
   and Leontius. [442] The difference consists purely in the extent to
   which each was desirous of accommodating his views to the Chalcedonian
   Creed and interpreting Leo's doctrinal letter in bonam partem, and also
   in the philosophico-theological terminology employed. The statements of
   Severus regarding the one composite nature, the metastoicheiosis [443]
   or transformation etc., express absolutely nothing else than what is
   found in the formulæ of Leontius which are in part expressed in an
   entirely different and in fact in an opposite way. Leontius accepts the
   enhypostasis of the human nature in Christ, and Severus strictly
   defends himself against the supposition that he teaches that the human
   nature in any way loses its natural peculiarity in the union. It is
   simply that unfortunate Chalcedonian Creed which stands between the
   opponents, and what separates them therefore is the question as to
   whether the Western terminology is to be followed or not. That this is
   the case is proved by the attitude taken up by Severus to the Extreme
   Right of his party. The Henoticon had already split up the Egyptian
   Monophysites. One section of them had renounced connection with Petrus
   Mongus (akephaloi). But in Syria, too, at the beginning of the Fifth
   Century we find several tendencies amongst them. The blow dealt them
   after the restoration of orthodoxy in 519 drove them to Egypt, and
   there actual splits took place. Even the strictest party amongst them
   did not put forth the catchword "transformation"; but in seriously
   reflecting on the problem as to how a human nature must be constituted
   after a God had made it His own, they arrived at propositions which
   were perfectly logical and which for this very reason referred back to
   Irenæus, Clemens Alex., Origen, Gregory Nyss., Hilary, Apollinaris, and
   to some utterances of Dioscurus and Eutyches. Their leader, Julian of
   Halicarnassus who was opposed by the Severians, developed the doctrine
   of the one nature into the doctrine of the identity of the substance
   and properties of the divinity and the humanity in Christ. The
   hypothesis of the indestructibleness of the body of Christ from the
   moment of the assumptio, became the shibloleth of the "Julianists" or
   Gaians, who, now nicknamed Aphthartodoketæ and Phantasiasts by the
   Severians, retorted with the word "Phthartolatry". The Julianists,
   whose point of view was determined solely by the thought of redemption,
   did not shrink from maintaining the perfect glorification of the body
   of Christ from the very first, and in accordance with this saw in the
   emotions and sufferings of Christ not the natural--though in reference
   to the Godhead the voluntary--states consequent on the human nature,
   but the acceptance of states kata charin, which were regarded as having
   no inner connection with the nature of the Redeemer as that of the
   God-man. This nature being entirely free from all sin was also supposed
   to have nothing in common with suffering and death. [444] In opposition
   to this view the Severians laid so much stress on the relation of the
   sufferings of Christ to the human side of Christ's nature in order to
   rid them of anything doketic, that no Western could have more
   effectively attacked doketism than they did. [445] We find in general
   amongst the Severians such a determined rejection of all doctrinal
   extravagances--though these are not to be regarded as absurdities, but
   as signs of the settled nature of the belief in redemption--that we are
   glad to be able clearly to see how unnecessary it was in the East to
   adopt the Chalcedonian Creed, and to replace the mia phusis of Cyril by
   the doubtful doctrine of the two natures. One section of the
   Monophysites nevertheless went the length of asserting that the human
   soul of Christ was not omniscient ("Agnoetæ"), so that as regards the
   one energy of the God-Man, a distinction is to be drawn even in the
   sphere of knowledge between what it did as possessed of divine
   knowledge and what it did as humanly ignorant. This idea yields to none
   of the Monophysite eccentricities in absurdity, [446] and indeed it
   differs from them for the worse by the fact of its having no religious
   thought as its basis. While one section of the Monophysites thus did
   the work of criticising their own party better than any Chalcedonian
   could have done without incurring the reproach of Nestorian-ism, a
   philosophy of identity made its appearance amongst certain individuals
   in the party itself, which might have raised the fear that it would
   turn into Pantheism, if there had been any danger of its doing this at
   the time. On the mystical side, this had indeed been accomplished long
   ago, but this was very far from involving an intellectual mode of
   conceiving of things. Still it is of importance to note that an
   approach was made in this direction from two sides. First there were
   Monophysites who took up with the thought that the body of Christ from
   the moment of the assumptio was to be considered as untreated, the view
   of the Aktistetæ. If the Father can communicate to the Son the
   attribute of unbegottenness, and at that time no one any longer doubted
   that he could, why should the Logos not also be able to give His body
   the attributes of the uncreated; and in fact if it is His body, could
   He help doing this? Here already we meet with the thought that
   something created can nevertheless be something eternal. We hear no
   more of a flesh which was brought hither from heaven, but a kindred
   idea takes the place of this heretical thought. In the second place
   there were people, the Adiaphorites, [447] who refused to make any
   distinction between the divinity and the humanity in Christ, and this
   denial of all distinction further led some Syrian and Egyptian monks to
   the speculative idea, or to put it otherwise, gave increased strength
   to the speculative idea, that Nature in general is of one substance
   with God (see Vol. III., p. 302), a thought which had points of contact
   with mystical religious practices. [448] If all these movements
   illustrate the inner life of Monophysitism which within itself once
   more passed through old forms of development, the attention it gave to
   the Aristotelian philosophy and such excellent works as those published
   by Joh. Philoponus, finally proves too that it did not in any way
   shrink from contact with the great spiritual forces of the time. The
   tritheistic controversy was in all essential respects fought out on its
   own ground, and the boldness and freedom shewn by the scholarly
   Monophysites, in the face too of tradition, [449] bears witness to the
   fact that in the Chalcedonian Creed a foreign power had imposed itself
   on the Church of the East. [450]

   2. The restitution of orthodoxy in the year 519 coincides with the
   successful efforts of the theologians who were skilled in the
   Aristotelian philosophy, to furnish the Church which clung to the
   Chalcedonian Creed with a good conscience. It is possible to accept the
   Chalcedonian Creed as authoritative and at the same time to think
   exactly as Cyril thought: this was the result arrived at by the "new
   Cappadocians", the "new Conservatives", as Leontius and his friends
   came to be called, who made terms with the two natures in the same way
   as the oriental scholars in the Fourth Century did with the homoousios;
   and it is this conviction which lies at the basis of Justinian's policy
   in reference both to the Church and the State. If the efforts of former
   emperors in so far as they favoured Monophysitism were directed towards
   getting rid of the Chalcedonian Creed or consigning it to oblivion, the
   policy of the Emperor, which had the support of the new conservative
   theology, was to make use of the power which every fait accompli, and
   therefore too a Council, supplies, and at the same time to do justice
   to the old tendencies of Greek piety. It was the Roman bishop who was
   hardest hit by such a policy. For the second time he had contributed
   towards giving the Emperor of the East a firmer position in the
   country, this time by doing away with the schism. But the friend had
   not become any more harmless than he was in the year 451. As at that
   time he was, after having done what was required of him, quietly pushed
   back within his own boundaries by the 28th Canon of the Council, so on
   this occasion too he was to get a poor reward for his services. It was
   not intended that Rome should triumph in the East, but that the Emperor
   of the East should once more become the Lord of Rome. The dogmatic
   union with the West represented the terms on which it was to be made
   ecclesiastically and politically subject to the Emperor.

   Justinian's policy has in it an element of greatness. He once more set
   up the world-empire and pacified the Church, and yet his civil and
   ecclesiastical policy of conquest was unsound and its results lacked
   permanence. He did not know how to win over the Monophysites, and by
   his Western policy he did harm to the much more important Eastern
   policy. Some years after his accession Justinian arranged a grand
   religious discussion in Constantinople between the Severians and the
   Theopaschitian Orthodox (531). It is of some importance because it
   shews the extent of the advances made by the Orthodox towards the
   Monophysites under the guidance of Hypatius of Ephesus in conformity
   with the wish of the Emperor. [451] The orthodox held firmly to the
   Chalcedonian Creed, but allowed that the Council had also approved of
   the phrase, one incarnate nature (!); [452] on the other hand they
   rejected as Apollinarian forgeries the testimonies of their opponents
   in reference to the condemnation of the words "in duabis naturis" on
   the part of the ancient fathers. [453] About the same time the Emperor
   issued several edicts regarding the true Faith (533), which in thesi
   were based on the Chalcedonian Creed, but did not reproduce its
   formulæ; on the contrary they evaded the use of them and contained
   besides, the addition that it is necessary to believe that the Lord who
   suffered was one of the Holy Trinity. [454] The Emperor, who had
   himself an interest in dogma, already here shewed what his policy was,
   namely, to take back the Church in all that was essential entirely to
   Cyril, but to allow the Chalcedonian Creed to remain authoritative.
   Thus as matters stood, the formula: hena tes hagias triados peponthenai
   sarki, "one of the Holy Trinity suffered in the flesh", was a
   henotikon. But the Empress went still further. She had always favoured
   the Monophysites, one cannot even say secretly; the various threads of
   the undertaking the object of which was to assist "the pious doctrine"
   to triumph, all met in her cabinet, and it appeared not impossible that
   the Emperor might in the end be got also to agree to the formal
   abandonment of the Chalcedonian Creed and consequently to a new actual
   henotikon. [455] The appointment of Anthimus, a Monophysite in
   disguise, as patriarch of the Capital, and the admission of Severus to
   the Court, prepared the way for the final blow which was to be struck
   at the Chalcedonian Creed. But once more did the Roman bishop, who was
   informed of what was going on by Ephraem of Antioch, save orthodoxy. In
   the year 536 Agapetus appeared at the Court of the Emperor and
   succeeded in getting Anthimus removed from his post and excommunicated.
   A Council which was held under the presidency of the new patriarch
   Mennas at Constantinople in the year 536, after the death of Agapetus
   who died in the capital, and which has left behind an extensive
   collection of Acts, [456] put an end to the Monophysitism which was
   making overtures in an underhand way, acknowledged anew the expression:
   "en duo phusesi", "in two natures", and deposed and anathematised
   Anthimus. It is important that the Council which followed in the track
   of the theology of Leontius and upon which Leontius himself had some
   influence, roundly declared through its leader that nothing whatever
   ought to be done in the Church contrary to the will and command of the
   Emperor, but at the same time also added the following: "We both follow
   and obey the apostolic throne (Rome) and we regard those in communion
   with it as in communion, and those condemned by it we also condemn":
   hemeis to apostoliko throno exakolouthoumen te kai peithometha kai tous
   koinonikous autou koinonikous echomen, kai tous hup' autou
   katakrithentas kai hemeis katakrinomen. [457] The days when the names
   of Marcian and Leo were mentioned together, seemed to have returned.
   But the Pope at this time was no Leo, and Justinian was more than
   Marcian. Besides Anthimus, Severus, about whom the very worst calumnies
   were spread--that he was a heathen in disguise--and the heads of the
   Monophysite party of conciliation, were condemned. Justinian confirmed
   this sentence [458] by a decree (Aug. 536), while he threatened all
   adherents of the accused with exile and ordered the books of Severus as
   also those of Porphyry, [459] to be burned. At the first glance it
   seems paradoxical that the Emperor, who was himself not without
   Monophysite leanings, was now so genuinely furious at Severus and
   accused him at once of Nestorianism [460] and Eutychianism. But after
   what has been remarked above, (p. 241) the charge of Nestorianism is
   quite intelligible, and we can understand too the aversion felt by the
   Emperor who had himself an interest in dogma. A Monophysitism, such as
   that of Severus, which merely rejected the Chalcedonian Creed, but
   which, moreover, in combating Aphthartodoketism got the length of
   teaching in the most definite way the "division" of Christ, when once
   it was thoroughly understood, could be regarded only with antipathy by
   the Imperial theologian who had on the contrary always wished to have
   the Chalcedonian Creed and Aphthartodoketism. A Jerusalem Council
   repeated the decrees of the Council of Constantinople; [461] but it was
   impossible to restore tranquillity in Egypt. The Severian Theodosius
   had to make way for the Julianist Gajanus as Patriarch, and the
   Patriarch sent by the Emperor so seriously compromised his patron that
   he had to be excommunicated. [462]

   In the measures he took the Emperor, however, never lost sight of his
   design which was to win over the Monophysites, and it is at this point
   that the humiliation of the Roman bishop begins, though he was himself
   undoubtedly mainly to blame. The theology of Antioch was still
   something highly objectionable in the eyes of all pious-minded persons.
   It seemed to be favoured by Leo's doctrinal letter and in fact to be
   put in a place of honour, and yet a large section of the Eastern
   Orthodox were at one with all Monophysites in holding that the great
   Antiochians "would have betrayed the secret". People hated it for the
   same reason that they hate the Liberals in the Church at the present
   day, and the Emperor certainly did not hate it least, not to speak of
   the Empress, the patroness of all pious monks. The Antiochians got the
   blame of "denying the divinity of Christ" and of dividing the one
   Christ into two. The influential bishop, Theodorus Askidas of Cæsarea
   in Cappadocia, is said to have advised the Emperor to make use of this
   widespread hatred in the interest of his ecclesiastical policy. This
   man, an enthusiastic pupil of Origen, had suffered seriously from the
   condemnation of the latter [463] to which he had assented against his
   will, and in order to divert attention from Origen (Euagr. E. H. IV.
   38) he got the Emperor persuaded to believe that a great many
   Monophysites could be won over if a blow was struck at the Antiochians.
   [464] As a matter of fact what had given most serious offence to the
   Monophysites in connection with the Council of Chalcedon, was that it
   pronounced Ibas and Theodoret orthodox and was silent about Theodore.
   [465] The Emperor, supported by Theodora, who had long ago established
   a Monophysite branch-regime which made its influence felt as far as
   Rome, issued, apparently in 543, an edict, [466] in which the person
   and writings of Theodore, the Anti-Cyrillian writings of Theodoret, and
   the letter of Ibas to the Persian Maris, [467] were condemned. This was
   the edict of the tria kephalaia, the three points or chapters. The
   orthodox found themselves placed by it in a most painful position. It
   was a political move on the part of the Emperor forced on him by the
   circumstances in which he was placed, and a better one could not have
   been contrived. [468] The faithful adherents of the Fourth Council had
   to face the alternative either of actually departing from orthodoxy by
   the rejection of heterodox doctrines--for it was evident that a
   revision of the Chalcedonian Creed was intended, which limited freedom
   in the interpretation of it--or of having to defend what was
   questionable by way of protecting doctrinal unity; for nobody could
   deny but that Theodore in particular had actually taught heterodox
   doctrine. At the same time a sort of question du fait was to be decided
   in addition. The question as to the views held by the Council regarding
   things which it had not discussed, was to be settled. The Emperor
   dictated what these views were. Distinctions were to be made between
   what the whole Council had approved of and what had been approved of
   merely by individual members; for example, in reference to the letter
   of Ibas. It was plain that all this was bound only to be to the
   advantage of the Monophysites. It might be easy to point out to the
   Western opponents of the imperial decree that they had been too
   sharp-sighted in hunting for traces of Monophysite leaven, but as
   regards the main point they were entirely in the right. The
   condemnation of the three chapters, so far as its tendency was
   concerned, involved a revision of the Chalcedonian Creed. But the
   Emperor was in the right too; for he corrected the conciliar-decree in
   accordance with the spirit of the Eastern Church, which had been
   repressed at Chalcedon itself. He destroyed the Western influence; he
   carried the Chalcedonian Creed back to Cyril; he restored the dogmatic
   thought of the two Councils of Ephesus, without meddling with the Creed
   of Chalcedon. All four patriarchs of the East took offence at the
   condemnation of the Three Chapters and all four signed it after a brief
   hesitation. Thus powerfully did the Emperor make his rule felt in the
   Church; there had been no such monarch since Constantius and Theodosius
   I. The patriarchs worked their bishops and they too all submitted,
   although they felt it difficult to consent to the condemnation of a
   bishop who a hundred years before this had died at peace with the
   Church. What, however, they did not feel, was the desolation created by
   this imperial measure. Origen was already condemned; the condemnation
   of the Antiochene theology now followed on his. It was now that the
   Church first fully provided itself with a falsified tradition, by
   shutting out its true Fathers as heretics under the patronage of
   Justinian. It is pretended that its theology had always been the same,
   and any one who at an earlier period had taught otherwise, was no
   Father and Shepherd, but an innovator, a robber and murderer. This
   Church tolerated no recollection of the fact that it had once allowed
   room within it for a greater variety of opinion. Justinian who closed
   the School of Athens, also closed the schools of Alexandria and
   Antioch! He is the Diocletian of theological science and the
   Constantine of scholasticism! In doing this he did not, however, impose
   anything on the Church; on the contrary he ascertained what were the
   true feelings of the majority, probably realised them himself, and by
   satisfying them made the Church obedient to the State; for the
   World-Church is to be feared only when provoked; when satisfied it will
   allow any kind of yoke to be imposed upon it.

   The outbreak of the controversy of the Three Chapters which followed on
   this and its history, have an interest for the history of dogma merely
   owing to the fact that the North African bishops and, speaking
   generally, most of the Western bishops made such an energetic
   resistance to the condemnation of the Three Chapters. The conduct of
   the Africans and especially the work of Facundus "pro tribus
   capitulis", are honourable pages in the history of the Punic Churches.
   On the other hand in the conduct of the Roman Bishop we have a tragedy,
   the hero of which was no hero, but on the contrary a rogue. Vigilius,
   the creature of Theodora, the intellectual murderer of his predecessor,
   the man who was Monophysite or Chalcedonian in accordance with orders,
   constantly changed his opinion in the course of the controversy,
   according as he considered compliance with feeling in the West or
   compliance with the commands of the Emperor, the more necessary. Twice
   over he was forced by the Emperor to appear before the tribunal of the
   Church as a liar when Justinian produced secret explanations of his
   which contradicted his public utterances. His conduct both before the
   great Council and after it was equally lamentable. The poorest of all
   the Popes was confronted with the most powerful of the Byzantine
   Emperors. [469]

   Justinian considered a great Council to be necessary although he
   himself, about the year 551, issued a second edict dealing with the
   affair of the Three Chapters. This edict [470] which was framed by the
   Emperor himself who was always theologically inclined, contains in the
   most verbose form the strictly Cyrillian interpretation of the
   Chalcedonian decree. The Cyrillian formula of the "one nature" is
   approved of, attention being, however, directed to the fact that Cyril
   made no distinction between nature and hypostasis. Christ is one
   "composite hypostasis"--hupostasis sunthetos. The Antiochian theology
   is rejected in strong terms, the three chapters are condemned in this
   connection; but it is asserted that we must abide by the Chalcedonian
   Creed. In order to sanction this edict, the Fifth Ecumenical Council
   was opened at Constantinople in May 553, Vigilius protesting. The
   patriarch of the capital presided. The Acts have not come down to us in
   their original form; we have only part of them in a Latin translation.
   But we know from the proceedings of the Sixth Council that
   interpolations were put into the Acts in the 7th century (on the part
   of the Monothelites?) and that these interpolations were traced at the
   time by means of palæographic investigations, though the documents
   which had been foisted in were in no sense forgeries. The proceedings
   of the Council which consisted of about 150 members amongst whom there
   were very few Westerns, were unimportant; all it had to do was to throw
   the halo of the Church round the imperial edicts. It condemned Origen,
   as Justinian desired; [471] it condemned the Three Chapters and
   consequently the Antiochian theology as Justinian desired; it
   sanctioned the theopaschitian formula as Justinian desired, and in its
   14 long-winded anathemas it adopted the imperial edict of 551 as its
   own. But amongst those who thus said yes to everything, there were few
   who spoke contrary to their convictions. The Emperor was really the
   best dogmatist of his time and of his country--if it is the duty of the
   dogmatist to ascertain the opinions of the majority. While giving a
   position of exclusive authority to the interpretation of the
   Chalcedonian Creed on the lines of the theology of Cyril, he hit upon
   the sense in which it was understood by the Church of the East, i.e.,
   by the majority in it. [472] The importance of the dogmatic finding of
   553 ought not to be underrated. In a certain sense the blow which the
   West gave to the East at the Fourth Council was parried by the Fifth
   Council--in the fashion in which this is done in general in matters of
   dogma. Rome had given the formula of the two natures to the East, but a
   hundred years later the East dictated to the West how this formula was
   to be understood, an interpretation of it which in no way corresponded
   to the actual wording of the formula. At first undoubtedly the decree
   of the Fifth Council called forth serious opposition in the West. [473]
   But first Vigilius submitted, [474] then five years later the African
   Church followed his example. [475] Still the position of the successor
   of Vigilius, Pelagius I., was very seriously endangered in the West.
   The Churches of Upper Italy under the guidance of Milan and Aquileia
   renounced their allegiance to Rome. Never in antiquity was the
   apostolic chair in such a critical condition as at that time. Its
   occupant appeared to many in the West in the light of a State bishop at
   the beck of Constantinople and deprived of ecclesiastical freedom. The
   Lombard conquests set him free and rescued him from his position of
   dependence on Byzantium. Gregory I. having once more regained strength
   politically and his help being regarded as indispensable by those in
   Upper Italy who were threatened by the Arians and the pagans, again
   gained over the larger part of Upper Italy together with the Archbishop
   of Milan, though indeed it was at the price of a temporary disavowal of
   the Fifth Council. [476] Another part stood aloof from Rome for a whole
   century. But in the West too at the same period there was a decay of
   all independent interest in theological questions; when it once more
   revived, the Church had the Fifth Council and the Cyrillian Dogmatics,
   The East had revenged itself.

   And yet one may doubt if Justinian's policy was the right one which in
   dogmaticis aimed at a mean between the Western and the Egypto-Syrian
   dogmatic. It stopped half-way. For the sake of the West and of the
   basis supplied by the Council of 451, the Emperor had adhered to the
   Chalcedonian Creed; for the sake of the Monophysites and of his own
   inclinations he decreed the Theopaschitian formula and the rejection of
   the Three Chapters. But in doing this he roused the West against the
   spirit of Constantinople and against the Byzantine State, at the very
   moment when he was making friendly overtures to it, and yet he did not
   gain over the Monophysites. [477] He could not find the right dogmatic
   formula for the World-Empire which he created; what he did settle was
   the specific formula for the patriarchate of Constantinople and its
   immediate belongings. He, however, saw that himself; he wished to
   sanction Aphthartodoketism (564) [478] which was in harmony with his
   own dogmatic views and which might perhaps win over the Monophysites.
   His policy was a logical one, and the Emperor set about carrying it out
   with his wonted energy, beginning as usual by deposing the patriarch of
   the capital. We cannot now say what would have happened; the opposition
   of the Bishops, led this time by the Patriarch of Antioch, Anastasius
   Sinaita, would perhaps have been overcome; but the Emperor died in
   November, 565, and his successor Justin II. did not continue this
   policy. Still, under Justin II. the attempts to gain over the
   Monophysites, by dragonnades and by friendly methods, did not cease.
   [479] Even at that time the Imperial bishops were throughout kept from
   acceding to the extreme demands of the Monophysites by their desire to
   preserve communion with the West. The vacillation in the imperial
   policy, its partial success and partial failure, and the divisions
   among the Monophysites themselves, etc., belong to Church-History. The
   way was being prepared for renouncing entirely the authority of
   Byzantium--and here the political-national movement everywhere preceded
   the other,--and for the organisation in each case of a separate
   ecclesiastical constitution. These aims were not definitely
   accomplished till the seventh century, under entirely altered political
   conditions. [480]

   but see Gieseler, Comment., qua Monophys. opin. illustr., 2 parts,
   1835, 1838; Krüger, Monophys. Streitigkeiten, 1884 and Loofs, op. cit.;
   Kleyn, Bijdrage tot de Kerkgeschiedenis van het Oosten gedurende de
   zesde Eeuw, 1891 (from the chronicle of Dionysius of Tellmahre, who
   made extracts from the Church History of John of Ephesus. Kleyn gives
   the portions referring to the 6th century; they are identical with the
   second and third parts of John's Church History. Kleyn has published
   for the first time the sections for the years 481-561 [in Dutch]; they
   are of great importance for the history of Monophysitism, its spread,
   and the persecution it underwent).

   [421] Leo I., Martian's successor, had already made a beginning with
   this, though he proceeded cautiously; see Leon. papæ ep. 145-158,
   160-165, 169-173. One can see here what trouble it cost the Pope to
   maintain the Chalcedonian Creed. The opposition parties made the
   strongest efforts to prove that the Chalcedonian Creed was Nestorian.
   Of the memorial of Timotheus Aelurus (Heruler? hardly) the Monophysite
   Patriarch of Alexandria, Gennadius says (de vir. inl. 73): "librum
   valde suasorium, quem pravo sensu patrum testimoniis in tantum roborare
   conatus est, ut ad decipiendum imperatorem et suam hæresim
   constituendam pæne Leonem, urbis Romæ pontificem, et Chalcedonensem
   synodum ac totos occidentales episcopos illorum adminiculo Nestorianos
   ostenderet." The fact that the Emperor Leo called for an expression of
   opinion regarding the Chalcedonian Creed, was a step towards getting
   rid of it.

   [422] Monasticism which was hostile to the State, the aspirations after
   independence on the part of the Egyptians, and jealousy of the
   influence of the Byzantine Patriarch, all played a part behind
   Monophysitism. This feeling of jealousy was shared by the Roman bishop
   who, however, felt himself under the necessity primarily of guarding
   the dogmatic formula.

   [423] See the opinion of a Pamphylian Council supplied to the Emperor,
   printed in Mansi VII. p. 573-576. We can see from this that not only
   was the new definition which went beyond the Nicene Creed felt to be
   objectionable by the bishops, but that they disapprove too of the
   distinction of nature and person, prefer to speak with Cyril of one
   nature and wish to make the Chalcedonian Creed authoritative only in
   connection with controversies as being a formula which originated in
   and was rendered necessary by controversy, but not for the instruction
   of ordinary Christians. The Armenian Church has kept to this position;
   it is not Monophysite, but Cyrillian; see Arsak Ter Mikelian, Die
   Armenische Kirche in ihren Beziehungen zur Byzantischen vom. 4-13
   Jahrh., Leipzig 1892, cf. Karapet, Die Paulikianer, (Leipzig 1893) p.
   54 ff.

   [424] Basilikus had the ep. Leon. ad Flav. and the Chalcedonian Creed
   condemned. About 5oo bishops of the South and West actually subscribed
   it, but not Acacius; see Euagr. h. e. III. 4. The decree takes its
   stand upon the Nicene Creed and the two following Councils, but orders
   the Chalcedonian canons to be burned. Basilikus afterwards withdrew it
   (Euagr. III. 7), see also the epp. Simplicii papæ.

   [425] The Henotikon (Euagr. III. 14) declares in the first part that
   the sole authoritative creed is the Nicene-Constantinopolitan, and
   excludes all the other sumbola or mathemata; it then expressly condemns
   Nestorius and Eutyches while accepting the anathemas of Cyril. Then,
   however, there further follows a full Christological Confession in
   which the following statements are specially worthy of note:
   homologoumen ton monogene tou Theou huion . . . hena tunchanein kai ou
   duo; henos gar einai phamen ta te thaumata kai ta pathe haper hekousios
   hupemeine sarki . . . he sarkosis ek tes theotokou prostheken huiou ou
   pepoieke. memeneke gar trias he trias kai sarkothentos tou henos tes
   triados Theou logou . . . panta de ton heteron ti phronesanta e
   phronounta, e nun e popote e en Kalchedoni e hoia depote suoodo
   anathematizomen. An appeal on behalf of union is then made to the
   Egyptians to whom the epistle is addressed. Its dogmatic substance is
   not orthodox; the insincere way, however, in which the Council of
   Chalcedon is not condemned, but ignored, shews that there was a desire
   to tolerate Monophysitism. The Emperor. indeed cannot be blamed for
   issuing the edict; in doing this he simply did his duty. But Petrus
   Mongus played a double game, and so too did Acacius.

   [431] See Loofs, op. cit., pp. 53, 231 f., 248 ff., whose splendid
   investigations have been made use of is what follows.

   [432] Loofs was the first to throw light on his works, his personality,
   and his history.

   [433] This description is to be taken with the qualification that in
   his theological thinking he still shewed a certain freedom. While the
   proofs alleged by Loofs in favour of the view that the "Origenist"
   Leontius is identical with the Byzantine (pp. 274-297) are indeed not
   absolutely decisive, though to my mind they are convincing, one can see
   that Leontius held the great master in veneration without following him
   in his doubtful statements. But nothing is more characteristic of the
   period upon which the Church had now entered than the fact that even
   this academic veneration for Origen was no longer tolerated. Leontius
   was described as "Origenist" and Loofs' conjecture is quite correct (p.
   296) that Joh. Damascenes, that in a certain sense the Eastern Church
   itself, consigned this theologian of theirs to oblivion because he was
   still too liberal.

   [434] See Loofs, p. 60: "It is neither exegetical, nor religious
   arguments which are given a foremost place, but philosophical, and the
   philosophical theory upon which the arguments of our author rest, has a
   decidedly Aristotelian and not a Platonic origin. Our author is a
   forerunner of John of Damascus."

   [435] See the explanations given by Loofs of the apparatus of
   conceptions used by Leontius, p. 60-74. The entire distinction between
   the Western conception and that which combines the views of Cyril and
   Leontius is to be found in scientific form in the statement of
   Leontius: ouk esti phusis anupostatos . . . anupostatos men ou phusis,
   toutestin ousia, ouk an eie pote. The Western legal fiction of a
   distinction between person and nature is here pitched aside. I do not
   enter into further detail regarding the theology of Leontius because in
   an outline of the History of Dogma it must suffice to ascertain its
   tendency and methods. Anything further belongs to the history of
   theology.

   [436] The expedient of the enhypostasis was adopted in order to meet
   the objection urged by the Monophysite Severus against the Chalcedonian
   Creed and Leo's doctrine, that two energies necessarily lead to two
   hypostases. Leontius, following up a hint of Cyril herewith shews that
   if the relative standards of criticism are once abandoned, all Greeks
   who start from the doctrine of redemption, must be Apollinarians in
   disguise. Leontius was the first who definitely maintained that the
   human nature of Christ is not anupostatis nor on the other hand an
   independent hupostasis, but that it has its hupostenai en to logo.
   Leontius refers to the mode of the existence of the poiotetes ousiodeis
   in the ousia. The comparison is naturally defective since these
   poiotetes do not in themselves constitute a phusis. In fact all
   comparisons are defective. Neither Plato nor Aristotle is responsible
   for this philosophy. A pious Apollinarian monk would probably have been
   able to say with regard to the hupostenai en to logo: "Apollinaris says
   pretty much the same thing only in somewhat more intelligible words."

   [437] Loofs, p. 72 ff. shews that the Chalcedonian element is strongly
   represented in the doctrine of Leontius and that in the efforts he made
   to do it justice we see the presence of the modern element of
   personality as distinguished from physic, though indeed only as a kind
   of shadow of it.

   [438] The energetic opposition to the Antiochian theology is specially
   worthy of note in this connection. lip to the beginning of the Sixth
   Century the Chalcedonians were in such a state of alarm owing to the
   decree, that they could find no. fixed point from which to carry on the
   old and to them supremely important struggle against the
   "dismemberment". Leontius was the first to resume Cyril's attack on it
   and to carry on the interrupted work of repelling the most dangerous of
   all enemies.

   [439] See Loofs, p. 228 ff.

   [440] See Martin, Pseudo-Synode, p. 53.

   [441] See Loofs, p. 53 ff. The sources of information regarding the
   Christology of Severus are given there, p. 54. I refrain from giving
   any account of it (see Gieseler, op. cit. I., Dorner II., p. 166 ff.),
   since its identity with Cyril's doctrine seems to me to follow from the
   evidence brought forward by Loofs. It is interesting to note that
   Severus deduces from the Chalcedonian Creed the hypothesis of two
   natural energies and two wills, and further employs this deduction
   against his opponents as an argumentatio ad absurdum. No one in the
   East knew just at that time what was still to come in the succeeding
   century. The statement of Severus: ouk energei pote phusis ouch
   huphestosa, from which he concludes that in Leo's view there are two
   hypostases, is highly noteworthy and is quite in accordance with
   Cyril's ideas. Gieseler, op. cit. I., p. 9.

   [442] See the 30 kephalaia of Leontius kata Seuerou (Migne 86, 2, p.
   1901 sq.). See the notice in Loofs, p. 79 ff. It is highly amusing to
   notice how two authors whose ideas are exactly the same appear to have
   absolutely distinct views owing to the different terminology, "one
   nature", "two natures". In Thesis XI. where the Trinity and Christology
   are treated together in a scientific way, Leontius says: "If, according
   to Gregory, we have in the case of the Holy Trinity the reverse of what
   we have in the oikonomia kata ton sotera, then in the case of the
   latter we must have two natures and one hypostasis, just as in that of
   the former we have three hypostases and one nature."

   [443] See Gieseler, op. cit. II. p. 3.

   [444] The extremely instructive second treatise of Gieseler supplies us
   with abundant material. Gieseler has brought out two things at the same
   time (1) that these Julianists (see the sixth anathema of Julius, p. 6)
   started from the idea of redemption, according to which the Logos
   assumed our flesh (homoousios), but that as it (second Adam) was not
   subject to sin so neither was it subject to corruptio, and that in the
   moment of the assumptio He raised it to the state of the Divine. A
   homousia of the body of Christ with our body after the Incarnation
   would do away with all the comfort and the certainty of redemption. For
   the Logos assumed our nature just in order that He might free it from
   phthora; if therefore the human nature of Christ had been still subject
   to phthora then redemption would be rendered uncertain. Gieseler has
   shewn (2) that this idea is identical with the idea of the classic
   fathers of the Church, that while they undoubtedly shewed some
   hesitation as regards the conclusions to be drawn from it, still all
   the conclusions drawn by the Julianists, or by Philoxenus, are
   represented in one or other of the classical witnesses. Above all the
   Julianist and Philoxenian statement that in the case of Christ all
   passiones were not assumed naturally, but in the strictest sense
   voluntarily, kat' oikonomian or kata charin, (Gieseler, p. 7) is merely
   the vigorous echo of the oldest religious conviction. It was the
   sharper distinction between the divinity and the humanity in the
   incarnate one, worked out in the Arian controversy, that first
   endangered this conviction. Apollinaris sought to give some help here,
   but it was no longer of any avail. Gieseler very rightly calls
   attention to the fact that in the Apollinarian school the dispute
   between the Polemians and Valentinians corresponds exactly to the
   dispute between the Julianists and Severians, i.e., in the case of the
   former the same conclusions had been already drawn and had in turn been
   denied, which the Monophysites afterwards drew. Of these some went the
   length of assuming the divinity of Christ's blood and spittle (see
   besides, Athanasius, ad Serap. IV. 14; "Christ spat as a man, and His
   spittle was filled with the Godhead"), and, strictly speaking, the
   Church itself never could nor would dispense with this ancient idea
   spite of its doctrine of the two natures. The very same people who got
   excited about Aphthartodoketism had never any scruples in speaking
   about the blood of God, and in thinking of that blood as actually
   divine. We cannot therefore avoid seeing in Aphthartodoketism the
   logical development of the Greek doctrine of salvation, and we are all
   the more forced so to regard it that Julian expressly and ex
   necessitate fidei acknowledged the homousia of the body of Christ with
   our body at the moment when the Logos assumed it, and rejected
   everything of the nature of a heavenly body so far as its origin was
   concerned.

   [445] The passages are in Gieseler I. p. 20. The distinctions which
   were made are highly significant in view of the period of scholasticism
   which was approaching. There are two sorts of phthora; Christ was
   subject to the natural pathe of the body, but not to the phthora as he
   eis ta ex hon sunetethe to soma stoicheia dialusis. (Gieseler, p. 4).

   [446] Thomasius indeed finds it "remarkable" (p. 375) that the majority
   of the orthodox teachers of the Church, Jerome, Ambrose, the Patriarch
   Eulogius, the Roman Gregory, rejected the doctrine of the Agnoetæ and
   attributed to Christ an absolute knowledge which he concealed
   temporarily only kat' oikonomian. These Fathers had not yet succeeded
   in doing what the Agnoetæ and the modern theologians can manage and
   do--namely, to imagine a Christ who at the one and the same time knew
   as God what he did not know as man and was yet all the while one
   person.

   [447] See Möller, R.-Encykl. X., p. 248. Stephanus Niobes is mentioned
   as the originator of this line of thought.

   [448] Frothingham in his Stephen bar Sudaili (1886) has now given us
   information regarding the Syrian Pantheistic thinkers amongst the
   Monophysites about the year 500 and further down. All Scotus Erigena is
   in Barsudaili. The Pantheistic mysticism of this Syrian and his friends
   merits the serious attention not of the historian of dogma, but of the
   historian of philosophy and culture. Scotus and the Pantheistic Mystics
   of the Middle Ages stand in closer connection with these Syrians than
   with the Areopagite. 1 Cor. XV. 28 supplies the central doctrine here.

   [449] See Stephanus Gobarus in Photius, Cod. 232. He is also
   Aristotelian and Tritheist; noteworthy also for his bold criticism of
   tradition.

   [450] On the Tritheists, see Schönfelder, Die Kirchengesch. des Johann
   v. Ephesus, p. 267 ff. The works of Philoxenus, Bishop of Hierapolis,
   who has lately been termed the best Syrian stylist, have been hitherto
   wholly neglected and still await an editor.

   [451] See the Acts in Mansi VIII., p. 817 sq., Loofs, p. 263 f.
   Leontius took part in the discussion and it was dominated by his
   theology.

   [452] See 823: "Sancta synodus utrosque sermones (two and one natures)
   pari honore suscepit et pertractat."

   [453] It was here that the Areopagite was first cited as an
   authority--by the Severians, p. 820; his writings were, however,
   described by the orthodox as doubtful.

   [454] Cod. Justinian (ed. Krüger), de summa trinit. 6-8. The words:
   henos kai tou autou ta te thaumata kai ta pathe, haper hekousios
   hupemeinen sarki . . . oute tetartou prosopou prostheken epidechetai he
   hagia trias, are worthy of note. Pope John II., 534, had to approve of
   the Theopaschitian addition.

   [455] Loofs, p. 304 f., has shewn, however, that at this time Justinian
   was following the lead of Leontius.

   [463] On this (in the year 544) see the concluding chapter. Since in
   the conflict with Origenism Christology did not constitute the main
   cause of offence, we can leave it out of account here. Still it must be
   admitted that certain features of the Christology of Origen were
   acceptable to the Monophysites and to the monks with Monophysite
   tendencies, and the discussions about Origen in the sixth century took
   their start from here.

   [464] Regarding the Three Chapters' dispute and the Fifth Council,
   there has been a great controversy in the Catholic Church, which dates
   very far back and which is still continued. We owe this controversy to
   the writings of the Jesuit Halloix (for Origen; and unfavourable to the
   Fifth Council); the Augustinian Noris (Diss. historica de synodo V., in
   favour of the Council) the Jesuit Garnier, in the 17th century, and
   later, to those of the Ballerini. In more recent times Vincenzi has
   sought in a big work which falsifies history (In S. Gregorii Nyss. et
   Origenis scripta et doctrinam nova defensio, 5 Vols. 1864 sq.) to
   justify the theses of Halloix, to rehabilitate Origen and Vigilius, and
   on the other hand partly to "re-model" the Council and partly to bring
   it into contempt. The Romish Church is not yet quite clear as to the
   position it should take up in reference to the older Antiochians and
   Theodoret, and further, to Origen and Vigilius. I am not acquainted
   with the work of Punkes, P. Vigilius und der Dreicapitelstreit, München
   1865. The fullest Protestant account is still that of Walch, Vol. VIII.
   The most thorough study of the chief opponent of the imperial policy,
   Facundus of Hermiane in North Africa, has been published by a Russian,
   Dobroklonskij (188o); see on his work Theol. Lit. Ztg. 1880, n. 26.

   [465] Theodore had still in the East and even in the monasteries some
   secret adherents, apart from the Nestorians; see Loofs, pp. 274-297,
   304.

   [466] No longer preserved.

   [467] Mansi VIII., p. 242 sq.

   [468] Loofs, op. cit. has shewn that Justinian's policy, which struck
   at once at Origen and at Theodore, was occasioned by the disturbances
   in the monasteries of Palestine where both had their sympathisers who
   had already come into sharp conflict with each other. "The explanation
   of the fact that Justinian pretty much about the same time struck at
   Origen with the one hand and at the Three Chapters with the other, is
   to be found not in the ill-humour of Theodorus Askidas, but in the
   state of things in Palestine." The energetic attack already made by
   Leontius on Theodore in the years 531-538 had prepared the way for a
   decree which enjoined that the Chalcedonian Creed must positively not
   he interpreted in the sense in which it was understood by Theodore; see
   Loofs, p. 307. The resolution to add the writings of Ibas and
   Theodoret, seems only to have been come to at the last moment.

   [469] Duchesne, Vigile et Pélage, 1884.

   [470] Mansi IX., p. 539 sq. Loofs has briefly indicated the nature of
   the Emperor's theological writing (p. 310 f.) and has shewn how closely
   it is related to that of Leontius.

   [471] So with reason Noris, the Ballerini, Möller (R. Encykl. XI., p.
   113) and Loofs (pp. 287, 291) as against Hefele and Vincenzi.

   [472] The anathemas so far as their positive form is concerned come
   very near Monophysitism without actually falling into it--the most
   distinct divergence is in No. 8. No. 7 goes furthest in the direction
   of meeting Monophysitism: ei tis en duo phusesi legon, me hos en
   theoteti kai anthropoteti ton hena kurion hemon Iesoun Christon
   gnorizesthai homologei, hina dia toutou semane ten diaphoran ton
   phuseon, ex hon asunchutos he aphrastos henosis gegonen, houte tou
   logou eis ten tes sarkos metapoiethentos phusin, oute tes sarkos pros
   tou logou phusin metachoresases--menei gar hekateron hoper esti te

   amphotera--all' epi touto kechretai to arithmo, hos kechorismenas kai
   idioupostatous echei tas phuseis; ho toioutos anathema esto. Observe
   how the conception of number too gets a new meaning in Dogmatics and
   how in the dogmatic sense the conception of number is to be taken in
   one way in connection with the dogma of the Trinity and again in a
   different way in connection with the Christological dogma. There we
   have already the whole of scholasticism! In the same way "theoria" is
   now a conception which has first to get a new form for Dogmatics. All
   throughout in these conceptions things which are irreconcileable must
   be shewn to be reconciled.

   4. The Monergist and Monothelite Controversies. The Sixth Council and
   Johannes Damascenus. [481]

   Paul of Samosata equally [482] with the old Antiochians [483] had
   affirmed the doctrine of the one will (mia thelesis) in reference to
   Jesus Christ. The statement of the former, "the different natures and
   the different persons have one single mode of union,--agreement in
   will, from which it plainly appears that there is a unity as to energy
   in the things thus joined together," (hai diaphoroi phuseis kai ta
   diaphora prosopa hena kai monon henoseos echousi tropon ten kata
   thelesin sumbasin, ex hes he kata energeian epi ton houtos
   sumbibasthenton allelois anaphainetai monas), lies at the basis of the
   Antiochene Dogmatic even after it had taken definite shape as a
   doctrine of two natures. They were thus Monothelites. On the other
   hand, Gregory of Nyssa, Cyril, and the Areopagite had taught the
   doctrine of one energy in Christ, the latter with the definite addition
   "theandrike". [484] The Antiochians and those last mentioned meant,
   however, something different by their respective statements. The view
   of the Antiochians was that the human nature by placing itself at the
   service of the divine was wholly filled with the divine will--their mia
   thelesis was not the product of a physico-psychological, but of an
   ethical, mode of regarding Christ. The Alexandrians regarded the
   God-Logos as the subject of the God-Man who had made the human nature
   His own and used it as his organ; they thus thought of a unity of
   energy having its roots in the unity of the mysterious constitution of
   the God-Man. In Leo's doctrinal letter there was what was for the East
   a new conception of it--"Agit utraque forma quod proprium est", "each
   nature does what is peculiar to it", though undoubtedly "cum alterius
   communione"--"in union with the other". This way of conceiving of it
   was indirectly sanctioned by the Chalcedonian decree. In the century
   following it gave great offence; it besides rendered it necessary to
   consider the nature of the energy, the willing and the acting of
   Christ, and as a matter of fact it was the most serious stumbling-block
   for the Severians whose thesis "one composite nature" (mia phusis
   sunthetos) naturally demanded the "one energy" (mia henergeia). But
   still owing to the Chalcedonian Creed a theory gradually got a footing
   in the Church according to which each nature was considered by itself
   while the unity was consequently conceived of as a product, and the
   doctrine of the Agnoetæ (see p. 239) which made its appearance amongst
   the Severians proves that even this party could not avoid what was a
   sort of splitting up of the one Christ. The neo-orthodox theology of a
   Leontius and Justinian spite of its Cyrillian character required that
   Christ should be conceived of as having two energies, although it is
   going too far to maintain that already in the time of Justinian the
   question had been decided [485] in accordance with the later orthodox
   view. [486]

   One might try to explain the fact that the question was raised in the
   seventh century at all, from the "inner logic" of the matter; but the
   dogma in the form in which it was settled under Justinian, still left
   room for the raising of countless other questions which were not less
   important. As a matter of fact it was a purely political consideration,
   the desire, namely, to win back the Monophysite provinces, which
   conjured up the controversy. The latter accordingly essentially belongs
   to political history and it will be sufficient here to fix the most
   important points, since the doctrine of one will equally with that of
   two wills would have been in harmony with the decisions of the Fourth
   and Fifth Councils.

   The patriarch of the capital, Sergius, advised his emperor, the
   powerful and victorious Heraclius, (610-641) to secure the conquests he
   had once more made in the South and East by meeting the Monophysites
   half way with the formula that the God-Man consisting of two natures
   effected everything by means of one divine-human energy. In support of
   this doctrine Sergius collected together passages from the Fathers,
   large numbers of which belonging both to ancient and recent times, lay
   to hand, won over influential clergy in Armenia, Syria, and Egypt, and
   succeeded in conjunction with the Emperor in filling the eastern
   Patriarchates with men whose views were similar to his own and actually
   laid the foundation of a union with the Monophysites (633). But a
   Palestinian monk named Sophronius, who was afterwards bishop of
   Jerusalem, came to Egypt, declared the mia energeia to be
   "Apollinarianism", seriously embarrassed the imperial Patriarch, Cyrus,
   in Alexandria, and impressed even Sergius to whom he had recourse. As
   on the one hand, however, there was a desire not to abandon again the
   position gained in reference to the Monophysites, and as on the other
   it was necessary to avoid the appearance of endangering orthodoxy,
   Sergius now declared that all discussion of the question of energies
   was to cease, and signified his wish in this matter to his colleagues
   in Alexandria and to the Emperor himself. He wrote at the same time to
   Bishop Honorius of Rome. [487] The latter at that time published the
   celebrated letter which played such an important part in 1870 and the
   treatment of which in the second edition of Hefele's History of the
   Councils has justly occasioned so much surprise. [488] Honorius in this
   letter describes Sophronius as a man who is stirring up new
   controversies, praises Sergius for his great prudence in discarding the
   new expression (mia energeia) which might be a stumbling-block to the
   simple, declares that Holy Scripture makes no mention either of one
   energy or of two energies, that the latter expression is suggestive of
   Nestorianism and the former of Eutychianism, and incidentally states as
   something self-evident that "we confess one will of the Lord Jesus
   Christ" (hen thelema homologoumen tou kuriou Iesou Christou), that is,
   the one will of the Godhead. This was not yet in any sense a
   controversial question; but Sergius in his letter to Alexandria had
   regarded it as likewise self-evident that in putting the question of
   the energies into the background he could not in any case agree to the
   doctrine of two wills. [489] Meanwhile Sophronius in his character as
   the new bishop of Jerusalem had issued a work definitely based on the
   Chalcedonian Creed as interpreted by Leo's doctrinal letter. Two
   energies are to be recognised in the one Christ who is in both the
   same. One and the same Christ followed the energy both of his divine
   and also of his human nature. Still Sophronius does not say anything of
   two wills. He likewise had recourse to Rome, and Honorius, like
   Sergius, made an effort to bring about union between the contending
   parties in the Eastern Church by dissuading them from employing the
   formula. Heraclius gave his support to these efforts and published an
   edict drawn up by Sergius (638), the Ecthesis, which forbade the use
   both of mia energeia and of "two energies" as equally dangerous
   expressions. The latter expression, it was maintained, leads to the
   assumption of two conflicting wills in Christ, while Christ has only
   one will since the human nature acts only in accordance with the
   God-Logos who has assumed it. [490] The personality of the Redeemer
   thus appears, in strict accordance with the theology of Cyril, as built
   up on the basis of the God-Logos.

   But already Rome and the West once more bethought themselves of their
   dogmatics. Every attempt to meet the views of the Monophysites always
   brought the Byzantine Emperor into conflict with Rome. Pope John IV. as
   early as the year 641 condemned Monothelitism at a Roman Council.
   Immediately thereafter Heraclius died, putting the responsibility of
   the Ecthesis on to Sergius. The latter had died previously to this;
   Pyrrhus, who held similar views, took his place. After severe struggles
   in the palace, which Pyrrhus had to pay for by his deposition, Constans
   II., a grandson of Heraclius, became emperor. Those at the Court were
   resolved to maintain the Ecthesis and not to submit to the Roman
   bishop, Theodore. [491] Meanwhile North Africa had become the second
   headquarters of the Dyothelites. The Byzantine governor there, Gregory,
   the patron of the monks, who was on bad terms with the Court, made use
   of the African dislike of Byzantium and its dogmatics in order, if
   possible, to detach the Province from Constantinople, and with him
   sided the most learned Chalcedonian of the East, Maximus (Confessor)
   and many other Easterns, monks especially, who had fallen out with the
   Emperor. [492] Pyrrhus too took up his quarters in North Africa and was
   easily converted to dyotheletism. In Rome he completed his change of
   opinion and was recognised by Theodore as the legitimate bishop of
   Constantinople. The Emperor was flooded with addresses from North
   Africa the aim of which was to induce him to enter the lists on behalf
   of orthodoxy. But the defeat of Gregory by the Saracens weakened the
   courage and interfered with the plans of the Anti-Byzantine coalition.
   Pyrrhus with all possible speed once more made his peace with the
   Emperor and with the Imperial dogmatics; but the Roman bishop stood
   firm, condemned Pyrrhus, and pronounced sentence of deposition on Paul
   who was at the time occupying the Byzantine chair. The Emperor, on the
   advice of Paul and in order to pacify the Empire, issued in the year
   648 the Typus, which bears the same relation to the doctrine of the
   wills as the Ecthesis does to the doctrine of the energies. It simply
   prohibits under severe penalties all controversy regarding the question
   as to whether it is necessary to believe in one will and one energy or
   in two wills and two energies, and forbids the prosecution of any one
   because of his position on this question. For the sake of the Westerns
   the Ecthesis was removed from the principal church of the capital.
   [493]

   But Rome was far from accepting this part-payment as a full discharge.
   It had wholly different plans. The situation seemed a favourable one
   for estranging from the Emperor the entire orthodoxy of the East and
   binding it to the successor of Peter, in order to shew the Byzantine
   ruler the power of the Apostolic chair. What Justinian had done to the
   latter was to be requited, although Constans was the Sovereign of Rome.
   The new Pope, Martin I., who, like many of his predecessors, had
   formerly been the Papal Apokrisiar in Constantinople, got together a
   large Council in the Lateran in October 649. Over a hundred Western
   bishops attended; they were surrounded by numerous Greek priests and
   monks who had fled from Constans, first to North Africa, and then after
   the catastrophe there, to Sicily, Calabria, and Rome. The Council was a
   conspiracy against Constantinople, and he who was at the head of it was
   raised to the throne without the imperial sanction. We have here a
   continuation of the policy of Gregory I., but in a more energetic and
   menacing form. The dyothelite doctrine after a discussion lasting over
   several sittings, was made a fixed dogma by the help of the huge
   patristic apparatus contributed by the Greeks, [494] and finally a
   symbol was adopted which added on to the Chalcedonian Creed the words,
   "two natural wills" ("duas naturales voluntates") "two natural
   operations" (duas naturales operationes), without detriment to the
   unity of the person ("one and the same Jesus Christ our Lord and God as
   willing and effecting divinely and humanly our salvation"--"eundem
   atque unum dominum nostrum et deum I. Chr. utpote volentem et operantem
   divine et humane nostram salutem"), and allowing in fact the validity
   of the proposition when correctly understood; "one incarnate nature of
   the divine Logos"--mia phusis tou Theou logou sesarkomene. The twenty
   canons attached to the Creed define the doctrine more precisely and
   cover the whole of Christology. In the eighteenth canon Origen and
   Didymus are reckoned amongst the other "nefandissimi hæretici". In
   addition, the fathers of Monothelitism, of the Ecthesis and the Typus,
   Theodore of Pharan, Cyrus of Alexandria, and also the three
   Constantinopolitan patriarchs, Sergius, Pyrrhus, and Paul were
   condemned. Monothelitism was designated as Monophysitism, while the
   Typus again was described as the godless decree which robbed Jesus
   Christ of His will, His action, and consequently of His natures
   generally. Maximus Confessor too stated this brilliant thought with
   many variations. [495] When we read the resolutions of this Council the
   impression produced is that of a polemic encounter arranged with some
   secret end in view.

   Martin now made the most strenuous endeavours to get authority over the
   Churches of the East by the help of the decision of the Council. Like a
   second Dioscurus he interfered with Eastern affairs, made use of the
   desperate state of the Churches in the East which were in part in the
   possession of the Saracens and consequently were no longer in
   connection with Constantinople, in order to play the roll of supreme
   bishop, and accordingly worked in direct opposition to the imperial
   interests and perhaps even conspired with the Saracens. The Emperor now
   proceeded to take energetic measures. The first attempt to seize the
   Pope miscarried, it is true, owing to the faithlessness of the Exarch
   who was sent to Italy. But the new Exarch succeeded in getting Martin
   into his power (653). As a traitor who had secretly made common cause
   with the Saracens and as a bishop who had been illegally appointed, he
   was brought to Constantinople. Dishonoured and disgraced he was then
   banished to the Chersonesus where he died in the year 655. At the same
   time proceedings were taken against the dogmatic theologian of
   Dyothelitism, the monk Maximus, the mystic and scholastic, who for the
   sake of scholasticism was unwilling to do without the complicated
   formuke of the two natures, two wills, two operations in the one
   person, and who had actually made a profound study of them. In Rome
   Eugenius was now chosen as Pope and he was disposed to come to some
   arrangement. At the same time the most reasonable proposal was made
   which could possibly have been made in the circumstances: It was
   allowable to speak of two natural wills which, however, in accordance
   with the hypostatic union, become one hypostatic will. Maximus probably
   endeavoured to prevent the West from falling into this "heresy", but
   the successor of Eugenius (+ 657) Vitalian, gave in without any
   explanations and once more restored the communion with Constantinople
   which had for so long been interrupted. Constans himself visited Rome
   in the year 663; the peace lasted till the violent death of the Emperor
   (668) when he was staying at Syracuse. Rome's lofty plans seemed to be
   destroyed.

   The revolution in policy which now followed in Constantinople is not
   perfectly comprehensible spite of the obvious explanation that the
   Monophysite provinces were lost and that consequently there was no
   longer any reason for shewing any enthusiasm on behalf of Monothelitism
   or for opposing the establishment of Dyothelitism. Then we may reflect
   further that, as a matter of fact, the Chalcedonian Creed the more it
   was regarded from the outside demanded the doctrine of two wills, and
   that this doctrine alone possessed in Maximus a theologian of weight.
   But these considerations do not entirely clear up the facts of the
   case. Constantine Pogonatus seems really to have held the memory of
   Pope Vitalian in honour because the latter had supported him in putting
   down the usurpers. For this very reason he hesitated to comply with the
   wish of the Eastern Patriarchs that Vitalian's name should be erased
   from the diptychs--the bishop of Constantinople could never desire to
   enter into alliance with Rome. [496] It was perhaps a real love of
   peace or still more a perception of the fact that Italy must not be
   lost to the Empire, and that Italy, moreover, could be retained only by
   an alliance with the Roman see, which induced the Emperor to arrange a
   meeting and a conference of the opposing parties. In the year 678,
   taking up an entirely impartial attitude, he requested the Roman bishop
   to send representatives to the capital to attend a gathering of this
   kind. Rome, i.e., the new bishop Agatho, said nothing at first; why is
   not quite clear. At any rate he once more set afloat in the West
   certain declarations in favour of the doctrine of two wills. Meanwhile
   the Patriarch Theodore of Constantinople and Macarius of Antioch who,
   however, resided in the Capital, succeeded in getting the Emperor's
   sanction for erasing Vitalian's name from the diptychs. Finally, Agatho
   sent the desired deputies, together with a very comprehensive letter
   which was modelled in imitation of Leo's doctrinal letter, and in which
   at the same time the infallibility of the Roman see in matters of faith
   was expressed in a supremely self-conscious fashion. [497] From this
   time onwards the Emperor was resolved to yield to the Pope in
   everything (why?). By means of an edict addressed to George, the new
   patriarch of the Capital, who had shewn himself pliable, he now
   summoned a Council to meet, which though it was not originally intended
   by the Emperor himself to be ecumenical, did nevertheless come to be
   this. It lasted from November 680 to September 681, had 18 sittings and
   was attended by about 170 bishops. (The Byzantine East was already very
   seriously curtailed owing to the Mohammedan conquests.) It was presided
   over by the Emperor, or, what is the same thing, by the imperial
   representatives, while the Roman Legates voted first. It may be called
   the Council of antiquaries and palæographists; for really dogmatic
   considerations were hardly adduced. On the contrary, operations were
   conducted on both sides by the help of the voluminous collections of
   the Acts of earlier Councils and whole volumes of citations from the
   Fathers, which, however,--and this is in the highest degree
   characteristic--were after delivery sealed until the exact time when
   they were to be read out, so that they might not be secretly falsified
   at the very last moment. Moreover, palæographic investigations were
   conducted which were not without result. [498] Monothelitism had not a
   few supporters; the most energetic of these was the Patriarch of
   Antioch, Macarius, who amongst other things appealed to Vigilius, but
   was forbidden to do so; the letters, it was alleged, were tampered
   with, which was not the case. Other fathers expressed a desire that it
   should not be permissible to go beyond the conclusions of the Five
   Councils in any direction. A proposal was also made at the sixteenth
   sitting to grant two wills for the period of Christ's earthly life, but
   to allow of only one after the Resurrection. [499] But the new
   "Manichean" and "Apollinarian" was promptly expelled from the place of
   meeting. The experiment made by another Monothelite and which he
   carried on for two hours, of laying his creed on the body of a dead
   person in order to restore him to life and thus to prove the truth of
   the doctrine of one will, miscarried. [500] The Council knew what the
   will of the Emperor was, and following the lead of the Patriarch of the
   Capital, placed itself at the disposal of "the new David" who "has
   thoroughly grasped the completeness of the two natures of Christ our
   God"! Vitalian's name was restored; in accordance with the wish of
   Agatho a long series of Constantinopolitan patriarchs from Sergius
   downward together with Macarius and other Monothelites were condemned,
   amongst whom Pope Honorius too was put. [501] Finally a creed full of
   coarse flattery of the Emperor was adopted, [502] and this completed
   the triumph of the Pope over Byzantium. Two natural theleseis e
   thelemata were acknowledged and two natural energies existing
   indivisibly (adiairetos), unchangeably (atreptos), undividedly
   (ameristos), unconfusedly (asunchutos) in the one Christ. They are not
   to be thought of as mutually opposed, on the contrary, the human will
   follows the divine and almighty will and far from resisting or opposing
   it, is in subjection to it. The human will is thus not done away with;
   but there is on the other hand a certain interchange; it is the will of
   the divine Logos, just as the human nature without being done away with
   has nevertheless become the nature of the divine Logos. The Conciliar
   epistle to Agatho extols the latter as an imitator of the prince of the
   Apostles and as the teacher of the mystery of theology. [503] The
   Monothelites who had been condemned by the Council were handed over to
   him to be further dealt with--an unheard of act hitherto. In the West
   the decrees were universally accepted--in Spain too, where, soon after,
   the Augustinian interpretation of the Chalcedonian Creed was advanced
   yet a stage further (as we see in Adoptianism). In the East again the
   adoption of Dyothelitism which, backed up by the authority of Rome had
   gained the victory, did not by any means proceed smoothly. Not only did
   a Monothelite reaction ensue, which was, however, definitely disposed
   of [504] in the year 713, but there was, above all, a reaction against
   the penetration of the Roman spirit into the East. This which began
   with the second Trullan Council in 692 was continued in the age of the
   iconoclastic Emperors and of Photius. Apart, however, from the
   controversy about the "filioque" which was dragged in and which has
   already been treated of above p. 126, it belongs entirely to political
   history, or to that of worship and discipline.

   It is incontrovertible that Rome at the Fourth and Sixth Councils
   permanently gave her formula to the East and that this formula admits
   of a Græco-Cyrillian interpretation only by the use of theological
   artifice. But this interpretation had been given to it already at the
   Fifth Council and had an effect on Rome herself, who from this time
   onward had to tolerate also the mia phusis tou Theou logou
   sesarkomene--the one incarnate nature of the divine Logos. [505] This
   circumstance explains on the one hand the strange lack of vigour shewn
   by the Easterns in combating Dyothelitism, and on the other hand the
   paradoxical fact that the ablest of the Eastern theologians, even the
   Mystics, supported the doctrine of the two wills. But in order to
   explain the action of the Mystics it is necessary further to point to
   the fact that it was no longer possible to do without the scholastic
   theology of the neo-orthodox, Leontius and Justinian, which had the
   "duality" as its presupposition, and in conjunction with Mysticism
   presented a subject for endless speculations. To this was added the
   fact that the Eucharist and the whole system of worship, already
   satisfied in a much more certain and more living way than did the
   system of dogma which had become purely "sacred antiquity", the feeling
   of the Church as to what was of direct concern and of supreme
   importance in the past--namely, the thought of deification. This is
   shewn by the nature of the discussions in the Sixth Council. The
   impression we get that at that time believing thought, in the sense of
   a direct and living interest in the spiritual and religious substance
   of the Faith, had been entirely blighted, very strongly induces us to
   look for the life of this Church in some other sphere. And if we ask
   where we are to look for it, the image-controversies on the one hand,
   and the scholastic investigations of Johannes Damascenus on the other,
   supply the answer. The dogma which had been already settled at the
   Fifth Council and which at the Sixth Council had been once more revived
   and--not without danger--meddled with, embodied itself in cultus and
   science.

   The Christological propositions which are worked out in the Dogmatics
   of Johannes Damascenus, especially in the third book, are--even
   according to Thomasius--stated in "what is pretty much a scholastic
   form". It is the idea of distinction which dominates the method of
   treatment. Christ did not assume human nature in its generic form--for
   John as an Aristotelian is aware that the genus embraces all
   individuals--but neither did he unite himself with a particular man; on
   the contrary he assumed the human nature in such a way that he
   individualised what he assumed and what is not a part but the whole.
   This is the kind of cross which had already been recognised by
   Leontius, which has no hypostasis of its own and yet is not without it,
   but which possessing its independent existence in the hypostasis of the
   Logos is enhypostatic. Thus Christ is the composite hypostasis. The
   "centaur" and "satyr" against which Apollinaris had warned the Church,
   have thus not been avoided The hypostasis belongs to both natures and
   yet belongs wholly to each of them. But the divine nature preponderates
   very considerably (cf. the old deceptive analogy of the relation
   between soul and body in man, III., 7) and it has been correctly
   remarked that with Johannes Damascenus the Logos is at one time the
   hypostasis and then again the composite being of Christ as something
   between. In any case the humanity is in no way considered as formally
   entirely homogeneous with the divinity. This is shewn too in the
   doctrine of the interchange (metadosis), appropriation, exchange,
   (oikeiosis, antidosis) of the peculiarities of the two natures, which
   John conceives of as so complete that he speaks of a "coinherence or
   circumincession of the parts with one another"--eis allela ton meron
   perichoresis. The flesh has actually become God, and the divinity has
   become flesh and entered into a state of humiliation. This exchange is
   to be conceived of as implying that the flesh also is permitted to
   permeate the divinity, but this is allowed only to the flesh which has
   itself first been deified; i.e., it is not the actual humanity which
   permeates the divinity; hence the Logos too remains entirely untouched
   by the sufferings. Everything is accordingly in this way assigned to
   the two wills and the two operations. The religious point of view of
   the whole system is that of Cyril, but this point of view cannot be
   perfectly realised by means of the "duality" already laid down in the
   dogma. Just for this reason a certain amount of room is left for the
   human nature of Christ and for the work of the philosophers. That is
   why the Christology of Johannes Damascenus has become classical. [506]

   [486] According to anathema No. 3 of the Fifth Council the active
   principle in the Redeemer is the undivided person who as such performs
   miracles and suffers. No. 8 is undoubtedly opposed to this: menouses
   hekateras phuseos, hoper estin, henosthai sarki nooumen ton logon. The
   dispute as to whether there was one will or two, dates at least as far
   back as the beginning of the 6th century; but the assertion of two
   wills is as a rule charged against the orthodox by their opponents as
   the logical result of their views.

   [487] Shortly before this the controversy between Rome and Byzantium
   regarding the title "Ecumenical Patriarch" had been going on; see

   contrary it acted only when and how and in the way the Logos wished."

   [491] John IV. had already, moreover, attempted to hush up the conduct
   of Honorius, to excuse it, that is.

   [492] Battifol, L'abbaye de Rossano, Paris, 1891, has given us
   information of first-rate quality regarding the exodus of the Greek
   monks and priests to (North Africa) Sicily and Calabria. Lower Italy
   underwent at that time a new Hellenisation.

   [493] Mansi X., p. 10t9 sq. The form of the Typus as distinguished from
   the Ecthesis is worthy of note. It no longer speaks the theological
   language which Justinian above all had naturalised. Constans in fact
   more and more gave evidence of possessing qualities which make him
   appear akin in spirit to the iconoclastic Emperors of a later time.
   Conversely, amongst the most outstanding monks and priests of the
   seventh century we already meet with that enmity to the State, in other
   words, that desire to see the Church independent of the State, which
   occasioned the frightful struggle in the eighth and ninth centuries. In
   this respect the position taken up by Maximus Confessor who contested
   the right of the Emperor to interfere in dogmatic questions and
   disputed his sacerdotal dignity, is specially characteristic.

   [494] "We have a library, but no manuscripts," wrote the Pope in that
   same year to Bishop Amandus.

   [495] The Acts of the Council, which even yet enjoys a special
   authority in the Romish Church, are in Mansi XI., the Creed, p. 1150;
   see also Hahn 2, § 110.

   [496] There was once more friction between Rome and the patriarch of
   Constantinople, and this threatened to make the old controversy a
   pretext for quarrelling.

   [505] Why in accordance with this the use of the formula hen thelema
   theandrikon not allowed together with the doctrine of the two wills, is
   a point that is not easily understood. It was owing to Romish
   obstinacy.

   [506] It is characteristic of the way in which John works out the
   doctrine, that his arguments throughout are based on passages quoted
   verbally from the Fathers, though the names of the authors are
   frequently not given. A mosaic of citations lies at the basis of the
   scholastic distinctions; Leontius is most frequently drawn upon, but he
   is never mentioned by name. John is also dependent to a very great
   extent on Maximus. How scholasticism has stifled theology is most
   strikingly shewn in proposition III. 3 (ed. Lequien 1712, I., p. 207):
   alla touto esti to poioun tois hairetikois ten planen, to tauto legein
   ten phusin kai ten hupostasin. I imagine that as late as the fifth
   century any theologian who would have drawn the inference of heresy in
   this fashion, would have made himself ridiculous. That was the
   achievement of the neo-orthodox, the Aristotelians from Leontius
   onwards. A detailed description of the Christology of the Damascene
   belongs to the history of theology. But it may not be without use to
   mention the topics which he dealt with here: III. 2: How the Word was
   conceived and concerning his divine incarnation. 3: Of the two natures
   in opposition to the Monophysites. 4: On the nature and mode of the
   antidosis. 5: On the number of the natures (ho arithmos ou diaireseos
   aitios pephuken, p. 211). 6: That the whole divine nature in one of its
   hypostases united itself with the whole human nature and not a part
   with a part. 7: On the one composite hypostasis of the divine Logos. 8:
   Against those who say that the natures of the Lord must be brought
   under the category either of continuous or discrete quantity. 9: An
   answer to the question whether there is an enhypostatic nature (here,
   p. 218, the enhypostasis). 10: On the Trishagion. 11: peri tes en eidei
   kai en atomo theoroumenes phuseos kai diaphoras, henoseos te kai
   sarkoseos kai pos ekklepteon, ten mian phusin tou Theou logou
   sesarkomenen (one of the main chapters from the scholastic point of
   view). 12: On theotokos as against the Nestorians. 13: On the
   properties of the two natures. 14: On the wills and the autexousia of
   Christ (the fullest chapter together with 15: On the energies which are
   in Christ). 16: Against those who say: as man has two natures and two
   energies, so we must attribute to Christ three natures and the same
   number of energies--a very ticklish problem. 17: On the deification of
   the nature of the flesh of the Lord and of His will. (As is the case
   throughout the discussion here starts from the contradictio in adjecto
   and conceals it under distinctions: the flesh has become divine, but in
   the process has undergone neither a metabole, nor trope nor alloiosis
   nor sunchusis; it has been deified kata ten kath' hupostasin
   oikonomiken henosin or kata ten en allelais ton phuseon perichoresin.
   The old image of the glowing iron). 18: Once more regarding the wills,
   the autexousia, the double-understanding, the double-gnosis, the
   double-wisdom of Christ. 19: On the energeia theandrike. 20: Of the
   natural and blameless feelings (Christ possessed them, but the number
   of them given is very limited). 21: Of the ignorance and servitude of
   Christ (because of the hypostatic union neither ignorance nor servitude
   can be attributed to Christ relatively to God). 22: On the prokope in
   Christ (as a matter of fact the idea of prokope is plainly rejected:
   the "increase in wisdom" is explained: dia tes auxeseos tes helikias
   ten enuparchousan auto sophian eis phanerosin agon. This is genuine
   docetic Monophysitism; to this it is added that "he makes man's advance
   in wisdom and grace his own advance." John is here in the most patent
   perplexity). 23: Of fear (the fear which Christ had and which he did
   not have. He had natural fear "voluntarily"). 24: Of the Lord's praying
   (He prayed, not because there was any need for Him to do it, but
   because He occupied our place, represented what was ours in Himself,
   and was a pattern. Thus the prayer in Matt. XXVI. 39 was meant merely
   to convey a lesson; Christ wished at the same time to shew by it that
   He had two natures and two natural but not mutually opposed wills--this
   is just the explanation formerly given by Clemens Alex. when he stated
   that Christ, whom he himself conceived of in a docetic fashion,
   voluntarily did what was human, in order to refute the Docetae. Christ
   spoke the words in Matt. XXVII. 46 purely as our representative). 25:
   On the oikeiosis (this chapter too begins, like most of them, with the
   distinction, that there are two forms of assumption, the phusike and
   prosopike or schetike. Christ assumed our nature phusikos, but also
   schetikos, i.e., took our place by way of sympathy or compassion, took
   part in our forlorn condition and our curse and "in our place uttered
   words which do not suit His own case"). 26: Of the sufferings of the
   body of the Lord and of the absence of feeling in His godhead. 27: That
   the divinity of the Word was not separated from the soul and the body
   even in death, and continued to be an hypostasis. 28: Of the corruption
   and decay (as against Julian and Gajan; but here again a distinction is
   drawn between two kinds of phthora). 29: Of the descent into Hades. The
   contents even of the Fourth Book are still Christological, but this may
   be due to an oversight. One may admire the energy and formal dexterity
   of Johannes, but still what we have is merely one and the same method
   of distinction, which, once discovered, can be easily and mechanically
   employed, as the application of a new chemical method to an indefinite
   number of substances. Even this brief synopsis will, however, have
   brought out one thing, if it was still necessary that this should be
   done--namely, that in Greek Dogmatics in their religious aspect
   Apollinaris had triumphed. The moderate docetism which the latter
   expressed in a plain, bold and frank way forms the basis of the
   orthodox idea of Christ, though it is indeed concealed under all sorts
   of formulæ. As regards these, orthodoxy approaches much nearer to the
   Antiochians than to Apollinaris; but as regards the matter of the
   doctrine, all that was preserved of the Antiochian doctrine was the
   statement that Christ had a real and perfect human nature. This
   statement came to have a great importance for the future, not of the
   East, but of the West; but, if I am not mistaken, it helped to preserve
   the Byzantine Church too from getting into that condition of desolation
   into which the Monophysite Churches got, though it is true that in the
   case of the latter other causes were at work.

   C. THE ENJOYMENT OF REDEMPTION IN
   THE PRESENT.

CHAPTER IV.

  THE MYSTERIES AND KINDRED SUBJECTS.

   There is an old story of a man who was in a condition of ignorance,
   dirt, and wretchedness and who was one day told by God that he might
   wish for anything he liked and that his wish would be granted. And he
   began to wish for more and more and to get higher and higher, and he
   got all he wanted. At last he got presumptuous and wished he might
   become like God Himself, when at once he was back again in his dirt and
   wretchedness. The history of religion is such a story; but it is in the
   history of the religion of the Greeks and the Easterns that it came
   true in the strictest sense. They first wished to have material goods
   by means of religion, then political, æsthetic, moral, and intellectual
   goods, and they got everything. They became Christians and desired
   perfect knowledge and a supra-moral life. Finally they wished even in
   this world to be as God in knowledge, bliss, and life, and then they
   fell down, not all at once, but with a fall that could not be stopped,
   to the lowest stage in ignorance, dirt, and barbarity. Any one who at
   the present day studies the condition of Greek religion amongst the
   orthodox and the Monophysites, and not merely the religion of the
   untrained masses, but also the ritual of worship and the magical
   ceremonies practised by the ordinary priests and monks and their ideas
   of things, will with regard to many points get the impression that
   religion could hardly fall lower. [507] It has really become
   "superstitio", a chaos of mixed and entirely diverse but at the same
   time rigidly fixed maxims and formula;, an unintelligible and
   long-winded ritual of a patchwork kind, which is held in high esteem,
   because it binds the nation or the tribe together or unites it to the
   past, but which is still a really living ritual only in its most
   inferior parts. [508] If we were to imagine that we knew nothing,
   absolutely nothing, of Christianity in its original form and of its
   history in the first six centuries, and had to determine the genesis,
   the earlier stages, and the value of the original religion from a
   consideration of the present condition, say, of the Jacobite or of the
   Ethiopian Church, how utterly impossible this would be. [509] What we
   have here is a forbidding and well-nigh dead figure of which only some
   members and these not the principal members are still living, whose
   nobler parts are so crusted over that so far as their essence is
   concerned they defy any historical explanation. [510] Islam which swept
   violently over Christianity in this form was a real deliverer; for
   spite of its defects and barrenness it was a more spiritual power than
   the Christian religion which in the East had well-nigh become a
   religion of the amulet, the fetish, and conjurers, above which floats
   the dogmatic spectre, Jesus Christ. [511]

   Many factors contributed to this final result, and above all, the stern
   march of political history and the economic distress. Closely connected
   with this was the abolition of the old distinctions between
   aristocrats, freemen, and slaves, and following upon this the
   penetration into the higher ranks of the religious and intellectual
   barbarism which had never been overcome in the lower ranks.
   Christianity itself contributed in the most effective fashion towards
   the decomposition of society; but having done this, it was not able to
   elevate the masses and to build up a Christian Society in the most
   moderate sense of the word, on the contrary it made one concession
   after another to the requirements and wishes of the masses. The fact,
   however, that it thus soon became weak and allowed the "Christian
   religion of the second order" which originally had been merely
   tolerated, to exercise an ever increasing influence on the official
   religion, is to be explained from the attitude which the latter itself
   had more and more come to take up.

   The general idea of redemption which prevailed in the Greek Church had
   an eschatological character; redemption is deliverance from
   perishableness and death. But in Vol. III., pp. 163-190, attention was
   drawn to the fact that at all periods of its history the Greek Church
   was aware of possessing a means of salvation which already exists in
   the present and had its origin in the same source from which future
   redemption flows--namely, the incarnate person of Jesus Christ. The
   conception of this present means of salvation was originally of a
   spiritual kind; the knowledge of God and of the world, the perfect
   knowledge of the conditions attached to the future enjoyment of
   salvation, and the power of doing good works, in short "teaching of
   dogmas and good works" (mathema ton dogmaton kai praxeis agathai)
   (Cyril of Jerus.), and in addition power over the demons (Athanasius).
   True, however, to the general mode of conceiving things and also to the
   heathen philosophies of religion of that period, this knowledge in
   reference to divine things soon came to be regarded not as in its
   nature a clear knowledge, or as having an historical origin, or as in
   its working something to be spiritually apprehended, but on the
   contrary as a sophia or wisdom, which being only half comprehensible
   and mysterious, originates directly with God and is communicated by
   sacred initiation. [512] The uncertainty which in consequence seemed to
   attach to the content of this knowledge was more than counter-balanced
   by the consciousness that the knowledge so acquired and communicated,
   establishes a fellowship amongst those possessed of it and leads to
   real union with God and is thus not merely individual reflection.

   This magical-mystical element which attaches to knowledge as the
   present possession of salvation, is certainly also to be considered as
   a clumsy expression of the view that the summum bonum is higher than
   all reason. [513] But the truth which the Eastern Christians wished to
   grasp and to retain, was not securely established by mystical
   rationalism. The combination, however, of the natural theology which
   had never been given up with mysticism, [514] with the magical and
   sacramental, entailed above all this serious loss that less and less
   attention was given to the positive moral element, while the downfall
   of pure science made it possible for the theologians to take up with
   all sorts of superstition. It was not that the superstitio of the
   masses was simply forced upon them; in their own theology they
   endeavoured in ever increasing measure to reach a transcendental
   knowledge which could be enjoyed, as it were, in a sensuous way. Like
   their blood-relations the Neo-Platonists, they were originally
   over-excited, and their minds became dulled, and thus they required a
   stronger and stronger stimulant. The most refined longing for the
   enjoyment of faith and knowledge was finally changed into barbarity.
   They wished to fill themselves with the holy and the divine as one
   fills oneself with some particular kind of food. In accordance with
   this the dogma, the mathesis, was embodied in material forms and
   changed into a means of enjoyment--the end of this was the magic of
   mysteries, which swallows up everything, the sacred images, the sacred
   ritual. Christianity is no longer mathesis and praxeis agathai, it is
   mathesis and mustagogia, or rather for the great majority it was to be
   only mustagogia. The image-controversy shews us where the supreme
   interests of the Church are to be looked for.

   The development of what belongs to the sphere of mysteries and of
   cultus from the time of Origen to the ninth century does not form part
   of the History of Dogma. Together with the conceptions of baptism, the
   Lord's Supper, sacraments, and images it constitutes a history by
   itself, a history which has never yet been written, [515] and which
   runs parallel with the History of Dogma. In the Greek Church there was
   no "dogma" of the Lord's Supper any more than there was a "dogma" of
   grace. And quite as little was there up to the time of the
   image-controversy a "dogma" of the saints, angels, and images; it was
   the theotokos only that was found in the Catechism. But ritual was
   practised here with all the more certainty. There was a holy ritual; it
   was already firmly established in the days of Athanasius when the State
   united with the Church, and it was closely followed by a mystagogic
   theology. This mystagogic theology starting from a fixed point moved
   with the greatest freedom in the direction of a definitely recognised
   goal.

   The fixed starting-point it had in common with dogma. It was the idea
   that Christianity is the religion which has made the Divine
   comprehensible and offers it to us to be possessed and enjoyed. The
   definitely recognised goal was the establishment of a system of divine
   economy of a strictly complete kind as regards time and place, the
   factors of which it was composed and the means it employed, and which,
   while existing in the midst of what is earthly, allows the initiated by
   the help of sensuous media to enjoy the divine life. Those who above
   all developed this system did so with a certain reservation--it was not
   absolutely necessary. He who has speculation and ascetic discipline has
   in these as a personal possession, means which render it unnecessary
   for him to go in quest of sensuous signs and initiation in common. This
   was the view of Clemens and Origen, and after them the same opinion was
   expressed by the most important mystagogues of the earlier period, that
   is, by all those who created mystagogy; for no one creates anything
   without having the consciousness of being above his creation. But the
   Epigoni receive everything which has come to be what it is under the
   form of authority, and accordingly it becomes more and more impossible
   for them to distinguish between end and means, actual things and their
   substitutes, between what occupies a ruling place and what is
   subordinate. The spiritualism which, partly in self-protection and
   partly following its craving for fantastic creations and sensuous
   pictures, creates for itself in the earthly sphere a new world which it
   fills with its own ideas, is at the last menaced and crushed by its own
   creations. But then the spirit which has been artificially enclosed in
   it vanishes too, and there is nothing but a dead, inert remainder. On
   it accordingly that veneration is ever more and more bestowed which
   formerly was supposed to belong to the spirit which had been confined
   within the matter. Herewith polytheism in the full sense of the word is
   once more established, it matters not what form dogmatics may take.
   Religion has lost touch with spiritual truth. When for it a definite
   space is sacred--in the strictest sense of the word,--and in the same
   way a definite place, definite vehicles, bread, wine, images, crosses,
   amulets, clothes, when it connects the presence of the Holy with
   definite persons, vessels, ceremonies, in short with the exact carrying
   out of a carefully prescribed ritual, then though this ritual may have
   the form it always had and may even include in it the most sublime and
   exalted thoughts, it is played out as spiritual religion and has fallen
   back to a low level. But this was the final fate of the religion of the
   Greeks, which adorns itself with the name "Christian". The private
   religion of thousands of its adherents, measured by the Gospel or the
   Christianity of Justin may be genuinely Christian,--the religio publica
   has only the incontestable right to the Christian name,--and in
   possessing the Holy Scriptures it has what cannot be lost, the
   capability of reforming itself. Its fundamental dogma, which in the end
   determined its entire practice, namely, that the God-man Jesus Christ
   deified the human substance and in accordance with this attached a
   system of divine forces to earthly media, did not enable it to overcome
   the old polytheism of the Greeks and barbarians, but on the contrary
   rendered it incapable of resisting this.

   This is not the place to discuss the question as to the extent to which
   religion succumbed to it and the consequences of this, nor as to the
   influence exercised by the Neo-Platonic ecclesiastical science and by
   the ancient religions and mysteries respectively. All we can aim at
   doing is to establish the fact that the mustagogia which the mathesis
   had in view, gradually brought about the decay of the latter. It is
   only now that we are able perfectly to understand why such a determined
   resistance was made in the Greek Church to all fresh attempts to give
   dogma a fixed form, a resistance which could be overcome only by the
   most strenuous efforts. It was not only the traditionalism native to
   all religions which thus offered resistance, but the interests bound up
   with the ritualistic treatment of dogma and to which serious injury was
   done by the construction of new formulae. If the practical significance
   of dogma lay not only in the fact that salvation was attained hereafter
   on the basis of this Faith, but also in the fact that on the basis of
   this Faith Christians were already initiated in this world,--in
   worship,--into fellowship with the Godhead and were able to enjoy the
   divine, it was necessary that the expression of this truth should be
   raised above all possibility of change. The liturgical formula which is
   constantly repeated, is what can least of all stand being altered.
   Accordingly it is only when we consider how dogmatic controversies have
   necessarily always been controversies about words which demanded
   admission into the liturgy, as was the case with the foreign Nicene
   catch-words, the theotokos, the theopaschitian formula etc., and
   finally the "filioque", that we can understand the suspicion which they
   necessarily roused. We can still see in fact from the state of things
   in our own churches at the present time how such a liturgy or such a
   book of praise which in no way corresponds to the creed, causes no
   difficulty, while even the best innovation has a most disturbing
   effect. The value of the ritual of worship lies always in its
   antiquity, not in its dogmatic correctness. Thus the mustagogia which
   rested on the fundamental thoughts of the mathesis, and which in fact
   issued from it, was the stoutest opponent of a doctrina publica which
   was advancing to greater precision of statement. In the end it actually
   reduced it to silence. In the controversy of Photius with Rome in
   reference to the Holy Spirit the charge brought against the West of
   having altered the wording of the Creed was urged quite as strongly as
   the charge of having tampered with the doctrine. One may in fact say
   that the Greeks regarded the former as worse than the latter. This is
   the most telling proof of the fact that the daughter became more
   powerful than the mother, that the mustagogia had come to occupy a
   place of central importance. This, however, took place long before the
   days of Photius. The dogmatic controversies of the seventh century are
   in truth only a kind of echo of no importance, which merely gave dogma
   the illusory appearance of an independent life. The nature of the
   controversy makes it evident to any one who looks at the matter more
   closely, that the dogma had already become a petrifaction and that the
   kindred ideas of antiquity and of the stability of worship already
   dominated everything. It is the age of Justinian which brings the
   independent dogmatic development to an end. At that time the liturgy
   too received what was practically its final revision. The final
   completion of dogma ensued under the guidance of scholasticism which
   now established itself in the Church. Mystagogic theology, which now
   first began to spread widely, followed the completed liturgy. In this
   connection we may mention Leontius on the one side and Maximus
   Confessor who belonged to the seventh century on the other. Dogma as
   treated in the scholastic and ritualistic fashion is no longer mathesis
   at all, in the strict sense of the word. It is, like the Eucharist or
   the "authentic" image, a divine marvel, a paradoxical, sacred datum,
   [516] which scholasticism labours to elevate to being mathesis, and
   which mysteriosophy exhibits in worship as something to be enjoyed.

   We might content ourselves with these hints regarding the fate of
   dogma. It will, however, be proper to select two subjects from the rich
   and complicated material of the history of worship and the mysteries
   and by means of them to give a somewhat more precise outline of the
   course of development. These are the ideas of the Lord's Supper in
   connection with which we have to pay attention to the mysteries in
   general, and the worship of angels, saints, the Virgin Mary, martyrs,
   relics, and images. As regards the latter, the action ensued in the
   eighth and ninth centuries which brings to an end the history of dogma
   or the history of religion in the Eastern Church generally. From this
   date onwards it has had merely an outward history, a history of
   theology, of mysticism, and ritualism.

   § I.

   At the beginning of the Fourth Century the Church already possessed a
   large series of "mysteries" whose number and limits were, however, not
   in any way certainly defined. [517] They are teletai, mystic rites,
   which are based on logia tou Theou, words of God; amongst these
   Baptism, together with the practice of anointing which was closely
   connected with it, and the Lord's Supper, [518] were the most highly
   esteemed; while from them a part of the other mysteries had also been
   developed. Symbolic acts, originally intended to accompany these
   mysteries, got detached and became independent. It was in this way that
   Confirmation originated [519] which is already reckoned by Cyprian as a
   special "Sacramentum", which Augustine designates [520] a "Sacramentum
   Chrismatis", and which is called by the Areopagite a "mystery of the
   mystic oil" (musterion teletes murou). Augustine too knows of a
   "Sacramentum Salis" as well as many others, [521] and the Areopagite
   makes special mention of six mysteries: of enlightenment (photismatos),
   of coming together or communion (sunaxeos eit' oun koinonias), of the
   mystic oil (teletes murou), of priestly consecrations (hieratikon
   teleioseon), of monastic consecration (monachikes teleioseos), and the
   mysteries in reference to the holy dead (musteria epi ton hieros
   kakoimemenon). [522] This enumeration is not, however, in any way
   typical, and its author can hardly have intended it to be taken as
   absolutely complete. "Mysterium" is every symbol, any material thing,
   in connection with which anything sacred is to be thought of, every
   action done in the Church, every priestly performance. [523] These
   mysteries correspond to the heavenly mysteries which have their source
   in the Trinity and in the Incarnation. [524] As every fact of
   revelation is a mysterium in so far as the divine has through it
   entered into the sphere of the material, so conversely every material
   medium, and thus too the word or the action, is a mysterium as soon as
   the material is a symbol or vehicle of the divine. But even in the
   earliest times no strict distinction was made between symbol and
   vehicle. The development consists in this that the symbol more and more
   retreated behind the vehicle, that new heathen symbols and ritual
   actions were adopted in increasing numbers and that finally the vehicle
   was no longer conceived of as a covering for or outward embodiment of a
   truth, but as a deified element, as something essentially divine. [525]

   It is obvious that this way of regarding the "mysteries", amongst which
   the sign of the cross, relics, exorcism, marriage, etc., were reckoned,
   made it impossible to think of them as having a marked and lofty
   dogmatic efficacy. The rigid dogmatic even forbade such an assumption.
   As Greek theology regards the Church as an institute for salvation only
   when it is thinking of heathen and lapsed members or members who are
   minors, because the doctrine of freedom and redemption does not allow
   of the thought of a saving institute or of a community of believers
   chosen by God, in the same way and for the same reasons it knows
   nothing of a means of grace for those who are already believers, so far
   as by this is meant the sin-destroying, reconciliatory activity of God
   attached to a material sign and always strictly limited in its range,
   and which has for its object the re-establishment of justice and
   charity or of the filial relation. The ancient Church knew nothing of
   such means of grace. Accordingly since it desired to have mysteries,
   believed it possessed them in actions which had been handed down, and
   was strongly influenced by the dying heathen cultus, it had to content
   itself with the inexpressibleness of the effect of the mysteries. This
   conception forms the basis even where, following the directions of the
   New Testament, [526] regeneration, the forgiveness of sins, the
   bestowal of the spirit, etc., are deduced in rhetorical language from
   separate sacraments. The assumption that the sacramental actions had
   certain inexpressible effects--the doctrine of freedom prevented the
   magical-mystical effects which were specially included under this head
   from being embodied in a dogmatic theory--logically led, however, to
   these being performed in such a way that the imagination was excited
   and the heavenly was seen heard, smelt, and felt, as for example in
   incense and the relics and bones of martyrs. The enjoyment of salvation
   on the part of him who participated in these rites, was supposed to
   consist in the elevating impression made on the imagination and the
   sensuous feelings. He was supposed to feel himself lifted up by means
   of it into the higher world, and in this feeling to taste the glory of
   the super-sensuous, and for this reason to carry away the conviction
   that in a mysterious fashion soul and body had been prepared for the
   future reception of the immortal life. Such being the theory it was an
   easy step from this to combine all the mysteries into one great mystery
   in worship, and this was what actually took place. With this as the
   starting-point the "Church" too accordingly became a holy reality, the
   institution for worship, the holy mechanism, which supplies the
   believer with heavenly impressions and raises him to heaven. The idea
   of the Church which had the most vitality in the East was that of
   something which, regarded as active, was "the lawful steward of the
   mysteries" ("ho gnesios ton musterion oikonomos") and conceived of as
   passive, was the image of the "heavenly hierarchy."

   In strict logical fashion it developed from beginnings which already
   foreshadow the end. Although the beginnings are characteristically
   different, we find them in Antioch as well as in Alexandria and thus in
   both the centres of the East. In the case of the former of these cities
   the beginnings are to be looked for in Ignatius, the author of the Six
   Books of the Apostolic Constitutions, the editor of the Eight Books,
   and in Chrysostom, and together with them in Methodius. In the case of
   the latter the starting-point was supplied by Clemens, Origen, (Gregory
   of Nyssa) and Macarius. In the former everything from the first was
   intimately associated with the bishop and with worship, in the latter
   with the true Gnostic originally, then next with the monk. In the
   former the bishop is the hierurge and the representative of God, the
   presbyters represent the apostles, and the deacons Jesus Christ. This
   is the earthly hierarchy, the copy of the heavenly. Already with
   Ignatius the cultus dominates the entire Christian life; the holy meal
   is the heavenly meal, the Supper is the "medicine of
   immortality"--pharmakon athanasias. By means of the one Church-worship
   we mount up to God; woe to him who takes no part in it. All this is put
   in a stronger form in the Apostolical Constitutions, and is developed
   in a worthy and sensible fashion in the work of Chrysostom peri
   hierosunes. But in all this the attitude of the laity is a passive one;
   they make no effort, they allow themselves to be filled. [527] The
   influential Methodius viewed the matter from a different standpoint.
   Although he is the opponent of the Alexandrians, he does not deny the
   influence which he had received from them. His realism and
   traditionalism are, however, of a speculative kind. They constitute the
   substructure of the subjectivity of the monkish mysticism. Christ must
   be born "rationally" (noetos) in the believer; every Christian must by
   participating in Christ become a Christ. Methodius knew how to unite
   the ideas of a powerful religious individualism with the Mysticism
   which attaches itself to objective traditions. While protecting these
   latter against the inroads of a heterodox idealism, he nevertheless
   intended that they should merely constitute the premises of an
   individual religious life which goes on between the soul and the Logos
   alone.

   This was the fundamental thought of the great theologians of
   Alexandria. But they rarely connected the substructure of their
   theosophy with earthly worship, and still more rarely with earthly
   priests. Nevertheless their substructure was of a much richer kind than
   that of the Antiochians. There is probably no single idea connected
   with religion or worship, no religious form, which they did not turn to
   account. Sacrifice, blood, reconciliation, expiation, purification,
   perfection, the means of salvation, the mediators of salvation,--all
   these, which were connected with some symbol or other, played a rôle in
   their system. It was the hierarchical element alone which was kept very
   much in the background, nor was much prominence indeed given to the
   idea of the ritual unity of the Church which was a leading one with the
   Antiochians. Everything is directed towards the perfection of the
   individual, the Christian Gnostic, and everything is arranged in
   stages, a feature which is wanting in the system of the Antiochians.
   The Christian does not merely allow himself to be filled with the Holy;
   on the contrary he is himself here always engaged in independent effort
   inasmuch as he advances from secret to secret. At every stage some
   remain behind; each stage down to the last presents a real thing and
   the covering of a thing. Blessed is he who knows the thing or actual
   fact, still more blessed he who presses on to the next stage, but he
   too is saved who grasps the thing in its covering only. But with the
   stages of the mysteries the stages of the knowledge of the world
   further correspond. He who makes the mysteries his own, thinks at the
   same time on the progressively ordered world. He advances from the
   external world upwards to himself, to his soul, his spirit, to the laws
   of the world and the world-spirits, to the one undivided Logos who
   rules the universe, to the incarnate Logos, to the highest Reason,
   which lies behind the Logos, to what is above all reason--to God. The
   Cosmos, the history of redemption, the Bible are the great graduated,
   ordered mysteries which have to be traversed: all divine things and all
   human things--panta theia kai panta anthropina. When we have once
   reached the end aimed at, all helps may be dispensed with. There is a
   standpoint viewed from which every symbol, every sacrament, every thing
   that is holy, which appears in a material covering, becomes profane,
   for the soul lives in the Holiest of all. "Images and symbols which set
   forth other things were of value so long as the truth was not present,
   but when the truth is present, it is necessary to do the things of the
   truth and not of the image or representation of it," (hai eikones kai
   ta sumbola parastatika onta heteron pragmaton kalos eginonto, mechri me
   paren he aletheia; parouses de tes aletheias ta tes aletheias dei
   poiein, ou ta eikonos). This holds good of the aspiring theologian; it
   holds good also in the main of the humblest, barbarous monk. But
   Christianity would not be the universal religion if it did not present
   salvation in the symbolic form at all stages. This thought separates
   the ecclesiastical theosophs of Alexandria from their Neo-Platonic and
   Gnostic brethren. In it the universalism of Christianity finds
   expression, but the concession is too great. It sanctions a
   Christianity which is bound up with signs and formulæ, the Christianity
   of the "eikones". The most sublime spiritualism, as happened in
   expiring antiquity, made terms with the grossest forms of the religion
   of the masses,--or rather, here is expiring antiquity. That it could do
   this is a proof that a naturalistic or polytheistic element was
   inherent in itself. Because it did it, it was itself stifled by the
   power which it tolerated. The issue reveals the initial capital
   blunder.

   The mystical cultus of Antioch which culminates in the priest and
   divine service, and the philosophical mysticism of Alexandria which has
   ultimately in view the individual, the gnostic and the monk, already
   converge in Methodius and the Cappadocians; [528] they next converge in
   the works of the pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. [529] It was owing to
   Maximus Confessor that in this combination they became the power which
   dominates the Church.

   Everything was grouped round the Lord's Supper, [530] and as was the
   case in an earlier period, it still continued to be regarded from a
   twofold point of view, the sacrificial and the sacramental. [531] The
   mystery with which it came to be increasingly surrounded and the
   commemorations which took place at its celebration, preserved to the
   Lord's Supper in wholly altered conditions within the world-Church
   which embraced the Empire, its lofty and at the same time familiar,
   congregational character. [532] No rigidly doctrinal development of the
   Lord's Supper followed on this. But probably the presence of changes in
   the conceptions formed of the Lord's Supper both in its sacrificial and
   in its sacramental aspect, might be proved. These changes, however,
   take place throughout within the limits which were already fixed in the
   third century. The blend of a sublime spiritualism and a sensuous
   realism was already in existence in the third century. Any progress
   which took place could consist only in this, that religious materialism
   advanced further and further and forced spiritualism to retire. Its
   advance was, however, furthered above all by the fact that the dogma of
   the Incarnation was brought into connection with the Lord's Supper.
   This is the most important fact connected with this development, for
   now the Lord's Supper became, as it were, the intelligible exponent of
   the entire dogmatic system, and at the same time the hitherto vague
   ideas regarding the kind and nature of the body of Christ in the Lord's
   Supper, came to have a firmly fixed form. If previous to this
   Christians had never of set purpose thought of the body of the
   historical Christ when speaking of the body of Christ in the Lord's
   Supper, but of His spirit, His word, or the remembrance of His body
   offered up, or of something inexpressible, something glorified which
   passed for being His body, now the idea emerged that the material
   element which is potentially already the body of Christ according to
   Gregory of Nyssa, is by priestly consecration or more correctly, by the
   Holy Spirit who also overshadowed Mary, changed with the real body of
   Christ or else taken up into it. The Incarnation is not repeated in the
   Lord's Supper, but it is continued in it in a mysterious fashion, and
   the dogma is practically attested in the most living and marvellous way
   through this mystery. The priest is here, it is true, the minister
   only, not the author; but in connection with such a transaction to be
   the servant who carries out what is done, means to be engaged in an
   inexpressibly lofty service which raises one even above the angels. The
   whole transaction, which is based on the Incarnation, is thus beyond a
   doubt itself the mystery of the deification (theosis). The connection
   is exceptionally close; for if the act gets its essence and its
   substance from the Incarnation, while the latter again has in view the
   deification, it is itself the real means of the deification. It is the
   same thought as that which had already been indicated by Ignatius when
   he described the holy food as the "medicine of immortality" (pharmakon
   athanasias); but it is only now that this thought is taken out of the
   region of uncertain authority and has fixity given to it by getting a
   thoroughly firm foundation. But perhaps the point that is most worthy
   of note is, that in reference to the elements phrases were used by the
   Greek Fathers of a later period, which, as applied to the dogma of the
   Incarnation, had to be discarded as Gnostic, doketic, Apollinarian, or
   Eutychian and Apthartodoketic! People speak naïvely--up to the time of
   Johannes Damascenus, at least--of the changing, transformation,
   transubstantiation of the elements into the Divine. No attempt is made
   to form definite ideas regarding the whereabouts of their material
   qualities; they are wholly and entirely deified. In a word, the views
   held regarding the Lord's Supper were for a long time
   Apollinarian-monophysite, and not dyophysite. But this makes it once
   more perfectly plain that what was regarded by the Greek Church as of
   real importance from the religious point of view, was adequately
   represented only by the teaching of Apollinaris and Monophysitism, and
   that the reasons which finally led to the adoption of Dyophysitism had
   no strict connection with the dogmatic system.

   As regards the sacrificial aspect of the holy action, the most
   important development consists in the advance made in the
   transformation of the idea of sacrifice, for which the way had been
   already prepared in the third century. The offering of the elements,
   the memorial celebration of the sacrifice of Christ in the sacrifice of
   the Supper, the offering of the gifts (prospherein ta dora) and the
   offering of the memorial of the body (prospherein ten mnemen tou
   somatos) was changed into an offering of the body, (to soma
   trospherein) a propitiatory memorial sacrifice. "The sacrifice of His
   Son on the Cross was, as it were, put before God's eyes and recalled to
   memory in order that its effects might be communicated to the Church."
   Thus, owing to the influence of the heathen mysteries and in
   consequence of the development of the priestly notion, the idea crept
   in that the body and blood of Christ were constantly offered to God
   afresh in order to propitiate Him. And the more uncertain men became as
   to God's feelings, and the more worldly and estranged from God they
   felt themselves to be, the more readily they conceived of the Supper as
   a real renewal of the Sacrifice of Christ and of His saving death.
   Christians had formerly made it their boast that the death of Christ
   had put an end to every sort of outward sacrifice; they had spoken of
   the "bloodless and rational and gentle sacrifice" (anaimos kai logike
   kai prosenes thusia) or of the "immaterial and mental sacrifice"
   (thusia asomatos kai noera). These modes of expression continued to be
   used in the third and fourth centuries, but the desire for a sensuous
   expiatory sacrifice, which had been present, though in a hidden form,
   at an early date, became stronger and stronger, and thus "flesh and
   blood"--namely, the flesh and blood of Christ--were described as
   sacrificial offerings. Thus men had once more a bloody sacrifice,
   though indeed without visible blood, and what it seemed not to have
   certainly accomplished when offered once, was to be accomplished by a
   repetition of it. And thus, as the act regarded as a sacrament was
   connected in the closest way with the Incarnation, and appeared as a
   mysterious, real representation of it, as something to be enjoyed by
   the believer, so, regarded as a sacrifice, it was now finally brought
   into the most intimate connection with the death of Christ, but in such
   a way that in it the saving sacrificial death likewise appeared to be
   continued, i.e., repeated. Is it possible to give the sacramental act a
   loftier position than this? Assuredly not! And yet it was nothing but
   pure Paganism which had brought this about. Since these developments
   took place most of the Churches of Christendom in the East and West
   have been fettered and enslaved by a "doctrine of the Supper" and a
   "ritual of the Supper", which must be reckoned amongst the most serious
   hindrances which the Gospel has experienced in the course of its
   history. Neither the calling out of elevated feelings, nor the
   superabundance of intellectual force, of acuteness and "philosophy"
   which has been expended in connection with this, can undo the mischief
   which has been incalculable and which is still going on. And as in the
   fifth and sixth centuries the Supper was conceived of as the resultant
   of the system of dogma as a whole (the Trinity and the Incarnation),
   and was supposed to be equivalent to it, and to give a lively
   representation of it, so the same is still the case at the present day.
   The "doctrine" of the Supper has been treated in such a way as in the
   first place to sanction the dogma of the Incarnation, and in the second
   place to gather up to a point the entire confessional system of
   doctrine and the conception of the Church. In the whole history of
   religions there is probably no second example of such a transformation,
   extension, demoralisation and narrowing of a simple and sacred
   institution!

   Sure and logical as was the course of the development of the ritual and
   doctrine of the Supper in the Greek Church, no dogma in the strict
   sense of the word was set up, because there was no controversy unless
   about points of no importance. But just for this very reason the
   doctrinal pronouncements scarcely ever get beyond the stage of
   unfathomable contradictions and insoluble oracles. Christians felt so
   comfortable in the darkness of the mystery; they laid hold of this or
   the other extravagant form of expression without being afraid of being
   corrected or being forced to pay respect to a fixed form of words
   sanctioned by ecclesiastical usage. Anything that sounded pious and
   edifying, profound and mysterious, could be freely used in connection
   with the mystery. And since the words which were used in this
   connection, such as spirit (pneuma), spiritually (pneumatikos), flesh
   (sarx), body (soma) had a three-fold and a manifold meaning [533] in
   ecclesiastical usage, since Scripture itself supplied various
   allegories in connection with this matter, using flesh of Christ as
   equal to the Church, flesh of Christ as equal to His words, etc., since
   John VI. as compared with the words of institution supplied endless
   scope for speculation and rhetoric, since the consequences and the
   terminology of the dogma of the Incarnation were on the same
   lines,--and in addition, the doctrine of the Holy Spirit and certain
   ideas of the Church,--since finally the sacramental and sacrificial
   elements were at one time kept strictly separate and at another ran
   into one another, the utterances of the Greek Fathers in reference to
   the Supper constitute as a rule the most forbidding portions of their
   works. But to give a logical solution and orderly reproduction of their
   thoughts is not at all the historian's business, for in attempting such
   a task he would constantly be in danger of missing the meaning of the
   Fathers. For this reason we here renounce any such attempt. It will be
   sufficient to note the tendency and progress of the development in the
   Fathers who are to be referred to in what follows. [534] That the
   increasingly complex form taken by doctrine was of no advantage to real
   religion may be inferred from the one fact that the effects of the
   Supper were always described in an absolutely vague fashion. Nor did
   the theosis, that process to which was attached this high-sounding
   name, really mean anything, for it was impossible to understand it in
   any serious sense. The idea that freedom was the basis of all that was
   good, was in the way of this. This theosis, which is experienced in
   imagination, threatened, in the case of the Greeks themselves, to
   change into a mere play of fancy; for as soon as they realised that
   they were moral beings, they thought of nothing else save of the
   exalted God, of His demand that they should renounce the world and do
   good, and of the duty which lay upon man of living a holy life in order
   to die a blessed death. For this very reason they were also unable to
   reach any complete confidence in the promise of the forgiveness of sins
   given in the Supper. In place of this, however, religious materialism
   went to absurd lengths, while at the same time the ascetic theosoph was
   always free respectfully to ignore the whole transaction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Only a few hints regarding the course taken by the development of the
   doctrine can fitly be given here: Origen supplies the starting-point.
   "In his view the eucharistic body was only the Word of God or of the
   Logos as being a substitute for his appearance in the flesh; the
   shew-bread was for him the type of the Word in the old Covenant; for as
   this was placed, as it were, before the eyes of God as a propitiatory
   memorial object, so the Church also puts a bread before God which has a
   great propitiatory power--namely, the commemoration, the word regarding
   His passion and death with which Christ introduced and founded the
   Supper. But the bread of blessing was in his view the symbol only of
   this word, only of His eucharistic body, but not of His body offered up
   on the Cross, and if he does once call the latter "the typical and
   symbolic body", he did this only in the sense referred to. This is just
   what is peculiar and characteristic in his standpoint, that whenever he
   speaks of the Supper or indeed in a more general sense of the eating of
   the flesh or of the drinking of the blood of Christ, he does this
   without any reference to the body which He had as man or to the blood
   which flowed in the veins of this body." [535] The body and blood of
   Christ are knowledge, life, and immortality, not, however, as a mere
   thought or as a symbol, but in inexpressible reality. In Eusebius we
   already note an advance, and in fact in the "Demonstratio" and in the
   work "de eccles. theologia" he has several new categories. In his case
   already the offering of the memorial of the body (mnemen tou somatos
   prospherein) passes over into the offering of the body (to soma
   prospherein). He has the propitiatory memorial sacrifice. But from the
   sacramental point of view the consecrated elements are still for him
   symbols of the mystical body of Christ, i.e., of His word: only from
   the sacrificial point of view do they already possess the value of
   mysterious symbols of the actual body, the body which was once offered
   up. [536] It is impossible to extract a doctrine from the confused
   statements of Athanasius, nor will it do to make him a "symbolist".
   [537] Probably, however, Athanasius comes nearer to Origen in his
   conception of the Supper than in any other part of his doctrine. [538]
   The statement of Basil (ep. 8, c. 4) is genuinely Origenist: "We eat
   the flesh of Christ and drink His blood in that by His Incarnation and
   His life which was manifest to the senses, we become partakers of the
   Logos and of wisdom. For he described His whole mystical appearance as
   flesh and blood and thereby indicated the doctrine which is based on
   practical, physical, and theological science, and by which the soul is
   nourished and is meanwhile prepared for the vision of the truly
   existent." But the Cappadocians likewise had already advocated a
   theurgy of the most palpable kind--in all the Fathers the
   spiritualistic amplifications of the doctrine occur, always with
   reference to John VI. As regards the doctrine of the Supper, "Realism"
   and Real Presence of the true body of Christ (or transubstantiation)
   are for us at the present day equivalent. In ancient times, however,
   there was a "realism" which had no reference whatever to that real
   presence, but which on the contrary regarded a spiritual mystical
   something as really present. Hence the controversy on the part of
   historians of dogma and of ecclesiastical parties regarding the
   doctrine of the Supper held by the Fathers. They are "Symbolists" in
   respect of the real presence of the true body; indeed as regards this
   they are in a way not even symbolists, since they had not that body in
   their minds at all. But they know of a mystical body of Christ which is
   for them absolutely real--it is spirit, life, immortality, and they
   transferred this as real to the celebration of the Supper. [539]
   According to Macarius too, Christ gives Himself and the soul to be
   eaten spiritually (hom. 27, 17), but this spiritual eating is the
   enjoyment of something actual. Macarius, however, while he had the
   individual soul in view always thought of the Church; for to this
   noteworthy Greek mystic who, moreover, knew something of sin and grace,
   as to Methodius, the soul is the microcosm of the Church and the Church
   is the macrocosm of the soul. But the statements made by him and
   Methodius in respect to this point, were not further followed out.
   [540] The influence of the sacrificial conception of the consecrated
   elements, as being the antitypes of the broken body of Christ, on the
   sacramental conception, can be traced already in Eustathius and in the
   Apostolical Constitutions; [541] its presence is perfectly apparent in
   the mystagogic catechetics of Cyril of Jerusalem. But I suspect that in
   their catechetical instruction Basil and Gregory did not express
   themselves differently from him. Besides the many other passages having
   reference to the subject, Catech. V., 7 is specially important. "And
   next after we have sanctified ourselves (through prayer), we pray the
   gracious God that He will send down His Holy Spirit on the elements
   presented, in order that He may make the bread into the body of Christ
   and the wine into the blood of Christ; for' what the Holy Spirit
   touches is wholly sanctified and transformed (metabebletai)." Here
   therefore we have a plain assertion of the metabole which is effected
   by the Holy Spirit in the Supper, and Cyril in fact appeals to the
   miracle of Cana. At the same time "Cyril is the first church-teacher
   who treats of baptism, the oil, and the Eucharist, in their logical
   sequence, and in accordance with general principles." The element which
   may be termed the symbolic, or better, the spiritual element, is
   nowhere wanting in his theology, and in fact it still quite clearly
   constitutes its basis; but we see it supplemented by that "realism"
   which already regards the details of the act of ritual as the special
   subject of instruction. The epiklesis or invocation, brings with it a
   dynamic change in the elements in the Supper as in all mysteries. By
   partaking of the holy food one becomes "a bearer of Christ"; the flesh
   and blood of Christ is distributed amongst the members of the body. In
   Cyril's view the elements in their original form have after
   consecration wholly disappeared. "Since now thou art taught and
   convinced that the visible bread is not bread, although to the taste it
   appears to be such, but the body of Christ; and that the visible wine
   is not wine, although to taste it seems to be such, but the blood of
   Christ, comfort thine heart," (Catech. V., 9). But still we might make
   a mistake if we were to attribute to the theologian what is said by the
   catechist. Extravagances of this sort still belonged at that time to
   the liturgical and catechetical element, but were not a part of
   theology. [542] But the miracle of Cana and the multiplication of the
   bread now became important events for teachers, as indeed is evident
   from the sculpture of the Fourth Century, and even such a pronounced
   Origenist as Gregory of Nyssa for whom indeed sumbolon was equivalent
   to apodeixis (a setting forth) and gnorisma (mark or token) and who
   laid down the principle "Christianity has its strength in the mystic
   symbols" (en tois mustikois sumbolois ho christianismos ten ischon
   echei), [543] as catechist propounded a physiological philosophically
   constructed theory regarding the spiritual nourishing power of the
   elements which were changed into the body of the Lord, which in
   religious barbarity far outstrips anything put forward by the
   Neo-Platonic Mysteriosophs. It makes it plain to us that in the fourth
   century Christianity was sought after not because it supplied a worship
   of God in spirit and in truth, but because it offered to men a
   spiritual sense-enjoyment with which neither Mithras nor any other god
   could successfully compete. Gregory wished for a spiritual and corporal
   "communion and mixing" (metousia kai anakrasis) with the Redeemer. The
   only help against the poison which has crept into our body is the
   antidote of the body of Him who was stronger than death. This antidote
   must be introduced into the body. It accordingly transforms and alters
   our body (metapoiein kai metatithenai; metastasis, metastoicheiosis,
   alloiosis). The actual body of Christ as immortal is thus the remedy
   against death; it must therefore, like other sorts of good, be partaken
   of bodily. This partaking takes place in the Supper; for through the
   act of consecration the bread and wine are changed into the flesh and
   blood of the Lord (metapoiesis) in order that through partaking of them
   our body may be transformed into the body of Christ (metastoicheiosis;
   see Justin). These transubstantiations are proved by a philosophical
   exposition of matter and form, potentiality and actuality; at this
   point Aristotle had already to be brought forward to furnish the
   necessary proof. The paradox was held to be not really so paradoxical.
   The body of the Logos, it was affirmed, itself consisted of bread; the
   bread was virtually (dunamei) the body etc. But more important than
   these dreadful expositions of a pharmaceutical philosophy was the close
   connection which Gregory formed by means of them between the Eucharist
   and the Incarnation. He was the first, so far as I know, to do this.
   The older Fathers also, indeed, while by the eucharistic body they
   understood the word and the life, always regarded the Incarnation as
   the fundamental condition, which alone made that use of it possible.
   But since they did not entertain the idea of the real body of Christ,
   the Incarnation and Eucharist--apart from some attempts by
   Athanasius--still remained unconnected.

   It was otherwise with Gregory. For him the transformation of the
   consecrated bread into the body of Christ was the continuation of the
   process of the Incarnation. "If the existence of the whole body depends
   on nourishment while this consists of food and drink; if, further,
   bread serves for food, and water mixed with wine for drink, and if the
   Logos of God, as has been already proved, is united (sunanekrathe) in
   his character as God and Logos with human nature, and, having entered
   our body, produced no different or new constitution for human nature,
   but rather sustained his body by the usual and fitting means and
   supported life by food and drink, the food being bread; then, just as
   in our case, he who sees the bread to some extent perceives the human
   body therein, because when the bread enters the latter it becomes part
   of it, so in that case the body which conceals God within it, and which
   received the bread is to a certain extent identical with the bread
   . . . for what is characteristic of all was also admitted regarding the
   flesh of Christ, namely, that it was also supported by bread, but the
   body was by the residence in it of the Divine Logos transformed
   (metepoiethe) to a divine sublimity and dignity. We accordingly are now
   also justified in believing that the bread consecrated by the word of
   God is transformed into the body of the God-Logos. For that body was
   also virtually bread, but was consecrated by the residence in it of the
   Logos, who dwelt in the flesh. Accordingly as the bread transformed in
   that body was invested with divine energy we have the same thing
   happening here. For in the former case the grace of the Word sanctified
   the body which owed its existence to, and to a certain extent was,
   bread, and similarly, in the present instance, the bread, as the
   apostle says, is made holy by God's Word (Logos) and command; not that
   it is first changed into the body of the Logos by being eaten, but that
   it is at once transformed into his body by the Logos (by its
   consecration) in accordance with the saying of the Logos, This is my
   body'." Gregory argues similarly as regards the wine and blood, and
   then continues: "Since then that flesh which received God also received
   this portion (wine, blood) into its substance, and God made manifest by
   that means interfused himself in the perishable nature of men, in order
   that by communion with deity the human might be deified; therefore he
   implants himself in all who have believed in the dispensation of grace,
   by means of the flesh whose substance consists of both wine and bread,
   condemning himself to the bodies of believers, so that by union with
   that which is immortal man also might become a participator in
   immortality. And these things he grants to the power of the blessing,
   having therefore transformed the nature of the phenomena (Epei oun kai
   touto to meros [wine, blood] he theodochos ekeine sarx pros tee
   sustasin heautes paredexato, ho de phanerotheis Theos dia touto

   ho anthropos tes athanasias metochos genoito. Tauta de didosi te tes
   eulogias dunamei pros ekeino metastoicheiosas ton phainomenon ten
   phusin). It was henceforth impossible for any other theory to outbid
   this one, which followed the practice. It is the foundation for all
   farther developments, especially the liturgical, and is responsible for
   nominally Christian heathenism. It sprang from Gregory the
   "spiritualist", the disciple of Origen! It explains why all purer
   science necessarily ceased. No independent theology could long hold its
   ground side by side with such an intoxicating speculation. [544] For
   the rest, Gregory did not teach transubstantiation in the later Western
   sense. According to him only the form (eidos)of the elements, not the
   substance, was changed. His theory is therefore rightly described as
   one of transformation. Nor was he quite clear about the relation of the
   eucharistic to the real--transfigured--body. He did not entertain the
   idea of a complete identity, but only of a qualitative unity. The
   consecrated elements were qualitatively identical with the body, which
   the Logos had employed as his organ.

   Chrysostom, on the contrary, spoke of a complete identity, and did not
   shrink from the boldest and most repugnant expressions. "In proof of
   his love he has given us the body pierced with nails, that we might
   hold it in our hands and eat it; for we often bite those whom we love
   much." [545] "Christ permits us to glut ourselves on his flesh."
   Chrysostom won't remove our horror of cannibalism by spiritualising the
   rite. "In order then that the disciples might not be afraid, he drank
   first, and thus introduced them undismayed into the Communion of his
   mysteries; therefore he drank his own blood." "Reflect, that the tongue
   is the member with which we receive the awful sacrifice." "Our tongue
   is reddened by the most awful blood." "He has permitted us who desire
   it not merely to see, but to touch and eat and bury our teeth in his
   flesh, and to intermingle it with our own being." [546] The fact that
   at the same time the benefit contained in the Lord's Supper is
   described as being perceived by the mind, a noeton, hardly affects the
   result, for of course the body, however real, of a God is a noeton.
   Like Gregory, Chrysostom speaks of a refashioning and transforming
   (metarruthmizein and metaskeuazein) of the elements, which Christ, the
   Holy Ghost, effects through the priest by means of the invocation--not
   of the words of institution which do not constitute the medium among
   the Greeks. Very instructive, moreover, is the reference to the
   Incarnation. "The Church sees the Lord lying in the crib wrapped in
   swaddling-clothes--an awful and wonderful spectacle; for the Lord's
   table takes the place of the crib, and here also lies the body of the
   Lord, not wrapped in swaddling-clothes, but surrounded on all sides by
   the Holy Ghost." Chrysostom, accordingly, went decidedly farther in
   this point also than Gregory, with whom he agreed in the assumption of
   an essentially corporeal effect of the participation. [547]

   To Dionysius, who was thoroughly Neoplatonic, the ethical central
   notion consists in mystical union [= theosis (deification) =
   aphomoiosis (likeness) + henosis (union)]. The complicated
   "hierarchies" in heaven and in the Church--"purifying, illuminating,
   perfecting" = deacons, priests, and bishops--act as intermediaries.
   This they accomplish by the mysteries which likewise are graded; to the
   bishops is reserved the consecration of the priests, the consecration
   of the anointing oil and of the altar. So the Lord's Supper, as in the
   case of Cyril of Jerusalem, is no longer treated apart; it has its
   place along with five other mysteries. Dionysius was enabled to evolve
   a mystical doctrine dealing with each mystery by a close examination of
   its ritual performance. A deeper sense is given to each little detail;
   it has a symbolical significance; "symbolical" is indeed not a strong
   enough term. There is really a mystery present; but this conception
   does not prevent the expert in mysteries from after all regarding
   everything as the covering of a single inner process: the return of the
   soul from multiplicity to unity, from finitude and disunion to the
   ocean of the divine being. The Eucharist which accompanies and
   completes the process contributes to that which was begun in baptism.
   The liturgical performance is rendered symbolical in every part.
   Moreover, the consecrated elements are themselves treated as symbols.
   The realistic view of Chrysostom is not found in Dionysius. The realism
   consists, so to speak, in the fixity and integrity of the liturgical
   performance. Otherwise it is true of the Lord's Supper, what Dionysius
   says generally of all mysteries: "The majority of us do not believe in
   what is said regarding the divine mysteries; for we only see them
   through the sensible symbols attached to them. We ought to strip the
   symbols off and behold them by themselves when they have become naked
   and pure; for thus seeing them we should revere the spring of life
   pouring into itself, both beholding it existing by itself and being a
   kind of single force, simple, self-moved, self-acting, not abandoning
   itself, but furnishing the science of all sciences, and ever itself
   seen by itself." [548] And it is characteristic that it was precisely
   the consecration of the monk which constituted the highest mystery.
   Nothing but the tradition of the Church prevented Dionysius ranking it
   actually above the Eucharist. Dionysius does not discuss the
   Eucharistic sacrifice at all. [549]

   The following period was set the task of combining the crass realism of
   Gregory of Nyssa and Chrysostom with the ritualism of Dionysius,
   without at the same time wholly destroying the hidden spiritual element
   which depreciated all rites in comparison with the inner feeling and
   exaltation. But from the beginning of the fifth century conceptions of
   the Eucharist were very decidedly influenced by the Christological
   differences. If the conception of the Eucharist was connected with that
   of the Incarnation, then it could not be a matter of indifference to
   the former, whether in the latter the two natures were held to be fused
   in one or to remain separate. Monophysites and Orthodox, however, had
   always been and remained of one mind regarding the Lord's Supper. Cyril
   argued over and over again from the Lord's Supper in support of the
   Incarnation and vice versa, and it was strictly due to him that the
   Church learned the connection between the two and never lost it. Even
   Leo I. can discuss it. [550] Nay, the incorruptibility of the
   Eucharistic body was now accepted without question, while this view,
   when applied to the Incarnation, was called, at least in later times,
   Aphthartodoketism. Cyril had no fixed doctrinal formula for the Lord's
   Supper; he did not go so far as Chrysostom. [551] But since the body
   was to him, because of the one nature made flesh (mia phusis
   sesarkomene), God's body, it was in the full sense of the term
   "life-giving" (zoopoios). Accordingly he also maintained that it was
   not, as Nestorius taught, the body of a man that lay on the altar, but
   the body of God. [552] When we partake of the flesh of Christ, he
   implants it in us; he does not thereby become man in us--this mystical
   inference is rejected,--but our body is transformed and becomes
   immortal. We do not yet find in Cyril, however, the contention that the
   real body of Christ is present in the eucharistic body; it is rather
   only an operative presence that is meant; the eucharistic body is
   identical in its effects with the real. [553] It was the strict
   Monophysites who could bring the eucharistic and the earthly body quite
   closely together, because they also held the earthly body to be
   imperishable; [554] while the Severians still kept the two apart. But
   even the strict Monophysites did not, so far as is known, advance
   beyond identity in operative power. [555] The decisive step was taken
   in the age of the orthodox renaissance under the shield of Aristotle,
   accordingly by the scholastics of the sixth century. Here we have above
   all and first to name Eutychius, Patriarch of Constantinople in the
   time of Justinian. He based his view "on the conception derived from
   the system of Dionysius, that the cause exists by itself apart from its
   effects, but multiplies itself potentially in them and enters wholly
   into each, and proved that the ascended body abides complete [in
   substance] and undivided in itself [in heaven], and yet is received
   completely by each communicant in the portion of bread dispensed to
   him." Eutychius teaches a real multiplication of one and the same body
   of Christ in its antitypes--for as such he still describes the
   consecrated elements; but this multiplication is not one of substance,
   but of power. At any rate the separate existence of the eucharistic
   body side by side with the real is here for the first time given up.
   [556] Even before this, Isidore of Pelusium had demonstrated that the
   eucharistic body passed through the same stages of deification
   (theosis) as the real. "It is partaken as capable of suffering and
   mortal; for it is broken and is bruised by our teeth; yet it is not
   destroyed, but is transformed in the communicant into the immortal
   body." [557]

   John of Damascus settled this question also. [558] In the 13th chapter
   of Book IV. of his system of doctrine he gave a theory of the
   mysteries--Baptism and the Lord's Supper--based on that of Gregory of
   Nyssa, but at the same time he was the first to perfect the conception
   of the identity of the eucharistic and the real body of Christ. John
   begins with the corruption of humanity and the Incarnation. From the
   latter we obtain the new birth and the twofold food, that we may become
   sons. and heirs of God. The birth and food required to be spiritual as
   well as corporeal, for we are both. As regards the food, he himself in
   the last night ate the ancient passover, and then gave the New
   Testament. God is all powerful and creates by word and spirit. As he
   sent forth the light, as his spirit formed a body from the flesh of the
   virgin and without seed, so the same spirit, falling like rain on the
   field, changes bread and wine into the flesh and blood of Christ; an
   analogy drawn from the process of nourishment as in Gregory of Nyssa.
   We may ask here as Mary did: How can that be? And we must once more
   answer: The Holy Spirit comes upon it. And in fact God has taken for
   his purpose the commonest things that we through the common and natural
   may be transplanted into the supernatural. But he now writes: "The body
   is truly made one with the deity, the body which came from the holy
   virgin, not that the body which was assumed comes down from heaven, but
   the very bread and wine are transformed into the body and blood of God.
   And if you ask how this happens, it is enough for you to hear that it
   is by the Holy Spirit, just as the Lord also by the Holy Spirit assumed
   flesh for himself and in himself." [559] In what follows the view is
   expressly rejected that it is a different body of Christ that is in
   question: there are not two bodies, but one. Further: "The bread and
   wine are not types of the body and blood of Christ; not so, but the
   very body of the Lord deified." [560] The bread of the communion is not
   simple bread, but is united with the deity; it has accordingly two
   natures. The body united with the deity is, however, not one nature,
   but the one is that of the body, the other that of the deity combined
   with it, so that the two together constitute not one nature but two.
   Only the not yet consecrated elements, moreover, are to be called
   "antitypes"; in this way Basil also used the word (!). The mystery,
   however, is called "participation" because through it we possess a
   share in the deity of Jesus, but "communion" first, because we have
   communion with Christ, and secondly, because by the holy food we are
   united with one another, one body of Christ, members in his body, and
   therefore of one another. Therefore we have anxiously to watch lest we
   "participate" with heretics, or allow them to "participate" with us.
   Finally, it is still to be noticed that, according to John, the sacred
   food was not subject to the natural processes in the body.

   This is the classical doctrine of the Lord's Supper in the Greek Church
   up to the present day. By the Holy Ghost bread and wine are received
   into the body of Christ. The eucharistic body is that which was born of
   the virgin, not, however, by a transubstantiation, as if the body of
   Christ descended suddenly from heaven and took the place of the
   elements, but by transformation and assumption, just as in the
   Incarnation. The bread-body is received into the real body and is thus
   identical with it. [561] That is the last word of the Greek
   Church--only now was the mystery perfect. Only now was the real
   presence of the true body originated, the doctrine which the Churches
   of to-day, except the Reformed, wrongly assign to antiquity, nay, to
   the Apostolic age itself. It is true that Scholastics and Mystics have
   taught much that was original on the Lord's Supper in the Greek
   Churches since John; spiritualism also was not abolished; but the
   history of dogma can give no place to these individual pronouncements.
   [562] The sacrificial character and the reference to the crucifixion,
   which are so strikingly neglected by John, were again made prominent in
   after times. [563] The physical and liturgical miracle was never,
   however, so logically analysed or reduced to the categories of being
   and phenomenon, substance and accident, in the Greek Church as in the
   West. Attempts at this were made; but they never obtained any
   far-reaching importance in the official doctrine. The second Nicene
   Council of A.D. 787 took its stand on the conception of John. The last
   exclamations of the assembled Fathers were: "Whoever does not confess
   that Christ, on the side of his humanity, has an unlimited form, let
   him be anathema. May the memory of Germanus (of Constantinople) and of
   John (of Damascus) endure for ever." [564]

   § 2. Christianity of the Second Rank.

   There existed in Christendom, ever since there was a doctrina publica,
   i.e., from the end of the second century, a kind of subsidiary
   religion, one of the second rank, as it were subterranean, different
   among different peoples, but everywhere alike in its crass
   superstition, naïve doketism, dualism, and polytheism. "When religions
   change, it is as if the mountains open. Among the great magic snakes,
   golden dragons and crystal spirits of the human soul, which ascend to
   the light, there come forth all sorts of hideous reptiles and a host of
   rats and mice." Every new religion invigorates the products of the
   ancient one which it supersedes. In one aspect of it we know very
   little of the "Christianity" of the second rank, for it had no literary
   existence; [565] in another we are thoroughly familiar with it; for we
   only need to set before us, and to provide with a few Christian
   reminiscences, the popular conditions and rites with which Christianity
   came in contact in different provinces, [566] as also the tendencies,
   everywhere the same, of the superstitious mob, tendencies inert in the
   moral sphere, exuberant in the realm of fancy. Then we have this
   second-class Christianity. It consisted in worship of angels--demigods
   and demons, reverence for pictures, relics, and amulets, a more or less
   impotent enthusiasm for the sternest asceticism--therefore not
   infrequently strictly dualistic conceptions--and a scrupulous
   observance of certain things held to be sacred, words, signs, rites,
   ceremonies, places, and times. There probably never was an age in which
   Christendom was free from this "Christianity", just as there never will
   be one in which it shall have been overcome. But in the fully formed
   Catholic Church as it passes over into the Middle Ages, this
   Christianity was not only dragged along with it as a tolerated, because
   irremovable, burden, but it was to a very large extent legitimised,
   though under safeguards, and fused with the doctrina publica.
   Catholicism as it meets us in Gregory the Great and in the final
   decisions of the seventh Council, presents itself as the most intimate
   union of Christianity of the first order with that subterranean,
   thoroughly superstitious, and polytheistic "Christianity"; and the
   centuries from the third to the eighth mark the stages in the process
   of fusion, which seems to have reached an advanced point even in the
   third and was yet reinforced from century to century to a most
   extraordinary extent.

   It is the business of the historian of the Church and of civilisation
   to describe these developments in detail, and to show how in separate
   provinces the ancient gods were transformed into Christian saints,
   angels, and heroes, and the ancient mythology and cultus into Christian
   mythology and local worship. This task is as aesthetically attractive
   as that other which is closely allied to it, the indication of the
   remains of heathen temples in Christian Churches. The temple of Mithras
   which became St. George's Church, proves that St. George was Mithras;
   in St. Michael the ancient Wotan had been brought to life again, just
   as Poseidon in St. Nicholas; the different "mothers of God", who were
   honoured with all sorts of sacred offerings--one preferred fruits,
   another animals--only show that Demeter, Venus, Juno, and countless
   other great mothers and holy or unholy virgins, had merged in the one
   mother.--The provincial calendars and various "Church Years" conceal
   significant reminiscences from the old heathen times. Here, however, we
   are only interested in the questions of principle, how far all this had
   forced its way into the doctrina publica, and how it was possible for
   that religion, whose strong point had once been a horror of idols, to
   admit this stuff as something sacred.

   As regards the second question, the points of contact existed in the
   doctrina publica itself. The following may have been the most
   important. In the first place, the doctrina had been constructed by the
   aid of Greek and Roman intellectual culture and philosophy. These,
   however, were connected by a thousand ties with mythology and
   superstition, which were not got rid of by assigning a "noumenon" to
   everything. We need only recall the single instance of Origen to see
   that the father of free and spiritual theology was at the same time the
   patron of every superstition that would admit of receiving the least
   grain of spiritual contents. Secondly, the doctrina publica sanctioned
   the Old Testament. Before this, indeed, and even to some extent in the
   time of the conflict with Gnosticism great pains had been taken to
   prove that the Old Testament was a Christian book, and to allegorise
   all its ceremonial features. But the power of interpretation had
   weakened more and more in comparison with the strength of the letter.
   What a wealth was embraced in the book of material drawn from the most
   varied stages of religious history! This material was sacred. No one
   indeed now got circumcised, or offered bloody sacrifices, or refrained
   from eating pork, but what did that signify if everything else
   gradually came somehow or other to be accepted? From the third century
   the Church needed infinitely more than a doctrina publica; it needed a
   sacred constitution, holy priests and a holy ritual. The Old Testament
   from which pretty nearly anything can be legitimised also legitimised
   this. Thus, side by side with revelation in the form of sacred
   doctrine, there arose an indefinitely increasing mass of sacred things
   which could be justified from the Old Testament alone. For its sake the
   old strict exclusion of the literal meaning of the book and of its
   ceremonies was abandoned, slowly indeed, but surely. At first the
   attempt was made to proceed circuitously, and to attribute the
   ceremonial decrees to the Apostles, because men were still unwilling to
   appeal directly to the Old Testament commands; but they then became
   bolder, and finally felt no scruple about using the Old Testament down
   to matters of detail, the special points of the Temple ritual--the
   cherubim being cited, for example, in support of the right to worship
   pictures.

   Thirdly, the sacred rites of Baptism, and especially of the Eucharist,
   offered points of contact for the intrusion of Christianity of the
   second rank into official Christianity. The public doctrine had
   already, at a very early date, treated and regarded these rites as
   mysteries in the ancient sense. Thus the door was thrown wide open to
   the inrush of everything of the character of a mystery, magic,
   liturgical miracles, and fetishes. Fourthly, devil, and angels had
   played a great part even in primitive Christianity. The official
   doctrine, however, at first paid comparatively little heed to them; yet
   they had always employed the imagination even of the most enlightened.
   Round these traditions the popular conceptions now gathered, and the
   doctrina publica was almost defenceless against them. When in the
   fourth and fifth centuries the masses streamed into the Church, it was
   not in a position, in spite of catechetical instruction, to exercise
   any control over them, or to examine the (mental) luggage of those
   desiring admission. Nay, more, the monks, who in the same period had
   with such extraordinary rapidity obtained full charge of piety, moved
   in this world of demons and angels, and cherished the ancient mythology
   under a Christian name. To live in the sphere of pure and impure
   spirits, to be visited, refreshed, strengthened by the former, and to
   be tempted and assailed by the latter, soon was held to be a sign of a
   heroic Christianity; and to this the official doctrine had to
   accommodate itself. Besides the cultus, men obtained their edification
   from a pious light literature whose dualism and exotic character might
   lead the critic to assign it wrongly to the Gnosticism of the second
   century. [567] But the Church was perhaps even more strongly influenced
   by the Neoplatonic doctrine of spirits. In devoting itself to a lofty
   intuition, and, like the Gnostics of old, seeing between God and the
   world hosts of graded moons (angels) who as the "heavenly
   hierarchy"--in reality as cosmical powers --reduced the many to the
   one, this doctrine legitimised the superstitious and barbarous
   conceptions of demigods and genii. The one God, whom the people had
   never understood, threatened to disappear, even in the views of refined
   theologians, behind the whole complicated intermediaries who appeared
   more tangible and therefore more trustworthy. Who can wonder that now
   the cultured Christian, if a mystic, also preferred in his religious
   difficulties to resort to these courts rather than to turn directly to
   God? If the supreme God had appointed and set these courts between
   himself and his world, then it would be presumption and aimless effort
   to ignore them. Only the strict ascetic might venture that. But he also
   would rather dwell in fancy in the magnificent, beautifully ordered
   world of spirits, where the golden buckets ascend; [568] he would
   rather picture the fulness and variety of the immortal life than dwell
   for ever on the desolate and terrifying thought of the One, who was so
   incomprehensible, that not even his Being could be conceived.

   Fifthly, as a residuum of the idea that all Christians were "saints",
   and that the Church possessed apostles, prophets, and spiritual
   teachers, the conviction had remained that there had been a Heroic Age,
   and that those who had then won a name for themselves were "saints".
   They were added to the Patriarchs and Old Testament Prophets, and they
   continued to receive successors in the martyrs and great ascetics. The
   most cultured theologians had already set up theories of the power of
   these heroes to intercede with God, and of their special relation to
   Christ. The anniversaries of the birth or death of the saints were
   celebrated, and thus they offered themselves in the most natural way to
   take the place of the dethroned gods and their festivals. They fell
   into line with the angelic powers, and were held to be more trustworthy
   than the latter. Among them Mary came to the front, and the course of
   the development of dogma specially favoured her, and her alone. A
   woman, a mother, made her appearance in proximity to the deity; and
   thus at last it became possible to include in Christianity the
   recognition of that which had been most foreign to primitive
   Christianity--homage paid to sex, the sacred, the divine, in a female
   form. The Gospel to the Hebrews had already, indeed, made the Lord say,
   "My mother the Holy Ghost"; but this thought was yet sexless, so to
   speak, and was besides never made use of in the great Church. Mary now
   became the mother, the bearer, of God.

   Sixthly, from the earliest times the Christians had looked on death as
   holy; it was the birth-hour of the true life; for in this world life
   meant for the Christians to practise dying, and to have died was to
   live in immortality. Accordingly, everything connected with blessed
   death, had already been touched by the breath of immortality. The
   martyrs exhaled this breath; therefore their very bones were more
   precious than gold or jewels. The worship of the dead began early, and
   only a few opposed it. The heathen use of fetishes and amulets revived
   in the cultus of the dead and of relics; in this form it was destitute
   of the aesthetic charm which antiquity knew how to give to its amulets
   and little sanctuaries, and for this reason the refined taste of
   enthusiastic Epigoni rose in disgust against the veneration of bones
   and corpses (see Julian's attacks). But the Christians satisfied
   themselves from the contrast between the sensuous appearance and its
   religious value that their faith was unique and elevated. since it
   found the divine in the very dust and fragments of death. Therefore
   they were certain of not being heathen in revering those amulets and
   relics; for heathenism sought and found its sacred things in the bloom
   of life, but Christianity in death. With the service of the relics was
   most intimately connected the veneration of the saints, and the two led
   to the veneration of pictures and idols.

   For, seventhly, the doctrina publica, as has been shown in our whole
   account, contained to an increasing extent the impulse to transform the
   mathesis (doctrine) into mysteries; this impulse it followed
   continually in the treatment of the Eucharist. But in doing so, it
   opened up the way to the boundless desire to enjoy the holy everywhere
   and with the whole five senses, and it then obeyed this desire itself.
   The Lord's Supper became the centre of an ever extending circle of
   material sacred things which could be seen, heard, tasted, smelt, and
   touched. The religious was much more closely connected with the
   material than with the moral. That, however, meant the relapse to
   religious barbarism and the worship of images. This might be
   transfigured in poetry--everything now showed a trace of God; it could
   even be spiritualised pantheistically--God is the world, and the world
   is the deity revealed; but within Christianity it was nothing but
   apostasy. But further, the senses which seek to perceive and therefore
   do perceive that which is holy, become dull and blind in presence of
   that which is actually perceptible, and dazzle the reason. The reason
   became accustomed to a fabulous world of wonders, and more and more
   lost all rational standards. Even the most cultured Fathers from the
   fifth century ceased to be capable of distinguishing between the real
   and unreal; they were defenceless against the most absurd tales of the
   miraculous, and lived in a world of magic and enchantment. Then there
   once more emerged practices which date from the earliest age of
   civilisation. Soothsaying, auguries, examination of sacrifices,
   inquiries at oracles of every sort:-- they had lost their name and
   their ritual, but they were now revived in all that was essential as
   Christian, though in new forms. Bibliomancy, questioning the Bible like
   a book of oracles, arose. Synods at first denounced it, but even great
   doctors of the Church favoured the evil habit. Ordeals, which were by
   no means originated by the Germans, came into vogue. Two clerics of
   North Africa were suspected of a scandalous act; both denied the
   charge; one must have been guilty; Augustine sent them over sea to the
   grave of S. Felix of Nola. There they were to repeat their assertions;
   Augustine expected that the saint would at once punish the liar. At the
   sixth Council a Monothelite offered to prove the truth of his
   confession by writing it and placing it on the breast of a dead man,
   when the dead would rise up. The Fathers of the Council accepted the
   test. In cases of sickness questions were addressed to this or that
   saint; the patient slept in his chapel; on certain days lodging in the
   chapel was more effective than on others, etc., etc. The sources of the
   fifth to the eighth century contain hundreds of such cases; not only
   did the foolish multitude take part in them, but, as the above passages
   have shown, the spiritual leaders themselves. The impulse to mystagogy,
   and the misguided craving to feel the proximity of the deity, without
   being or becoming a new man, were to blame for this decline and fall.
   Only two points can be cited. First, the better Christians still
   continued to seek and find an object of thought (noeton) in the
   thousand liturgical sacred things, the thought and its envelopment
   interchanged with each other in an attractive play. Thus these men
   defended themselves against the charge of worshipping idols. Secondly,
   the honour to be assigned to idols was and continued to be uncertain;
   it was not equal to that of God or of Jesus Christ or to the authority
   of Holy Scripture, and one might even finally disown them; any one
   might confine himself to the doctrina publica, and privately interpret
   in his own way its sensuous and magical portions, if only he did not
   attack them. But the poor common people knew nothing of this secret
   privilege of the learned, nor might they share in it. And even scholars
   were themselves burdened with an immense amount of stuff to which they
   had to dedicate their piety. It is the same to-day. The pious regard
   which is required by the whole complex of ecclesiasticism, intimately
   interwoven as it is with nationality, restricts the capacity to win
   independent power in religion, and to take earnestly and devoutly what
   is really earnest and holy. No religion gains anything through time; it
   only loses. If a hurricane does not pass over it and purify it again
   and again, it gets stifled in its own withered foliage. No hurricane
   has yet swept over the Churches of the East. And yet they possess in
   the Gospel, which they too read, an element of movement which perhaps
   in some future time will bring life to the dry bones.

   On the worship of angels, see Vol. III., Chap. IV. and Schwane,
   Dogmengeschichte II., pp. 299-328. The seventh general Synod decided
   that angels must also be portrayed because they were finite in form,
   and had appeared to many in a human shape. The theologoumenon of
   Dionysius, who was not the first to teach it, concerning the nine
   choirs of angels, obtained general acceptance. The conception of the
   manifold guardian ministry of the angels became more and more
   important. Even Schwane confesses here: "the doctrine that every man
   possessed such a guardian spirit appears to have been allied to the old
   heathen idea of genii, but was also founded on Holy Scripture" (p.
   315). The worship and invocation of angels became established; but the
   Church held in principle to the position that the angelic cultus was
   not identified with the worship of God. [569]

   In reference to the Saints, Cyril says in his fifth mystagogic
   catechism (c. 9); "Then we also remember those who have already fallen
   asleep, first the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and martyrs, that God
   through their prayers and intercession may accept our supplication." So
   also Augustine. This circle was extended after the fifth century by the
   addition of holy bishops, monks, and nuns. The power of the Saints to
   intercede was always the reason why honour and invocation (time kai
   epiklesis) were due to them. The ancient little martyr-chapels of the
   saints now became great Churches. The complete apotheosis of the saints
   was denied in principle. The offerings brought on the anniversaries of
   Saints and Martyrs were always meant for God. But the connecting of the
   service of the Saints with the eucharistic sacrifice gave the former an
   extraordinary value. Banquets were regularly held on their
   anniversaries--a genuinely heathen custom, and in vain did men like
   Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory of Nazianzus inveigh against them. The
   ideas of the communion of the Saints, and its typical import--every
   class gradually obtained its Saint--were certainly very valuable, and
   in this sense the worship of the Saints was not entirely unjustifiable;
   but the harm was greater than the benefit. The worship of God suffered,
   and crass superstition was introduced, especially in connection with
   the relics. This was first perceived by the Gallican priest Vigilantius
   who had witnessed the gross disorder prevalent at the sacred sites of
   Palestine, [570] Vigilantius (end of the fourth century) went to the
   roots of the worship of the Saints with his criticism, not only
   disputing the power of their intercession, but denying its existence,
   since the Saints were not yet in heaven with Christ. Against him Jerome
   maintained (c. Vigil. 6) a "ubique esse" of the saints, Apostles, and
   Martyrs, since they were wherever Christ was. Augustine also, who
   refers to similar contentions, showed that the Saints continued to have
   the power and the will to participate in earthly things. Vigilantius
   had rightly perceived the danger of an actual fusion of the service of
   God and of the Saints, and his attack resulted, at least, in a sharper
   distinction being drawn in theory. This was also, however, done by the
   Greeks; they reserved worship (latreia) to God, and described the
   veneration of the Saints, in language already used by Cyril of
   Alexandria, as a becoming honour (time schetike). [571]

   Most offensive was the worship of relics. [572] It flourished to its
   greatest extent as early as the fourth century, and no Church doctor of
   repute restricted it. All of them rather, even the Cappadocians,
   countenanced it. The numerous miracles which were continually wrought
   by bones and relics seemed to confirm their worship. The Church
   therefore would not give up the practice, although a violent attack was
   made upon it by a few cultured heathens, and besides by Manichæans.
   Moreover, in the Church itself a scanty opposition arose here and
   there. The strict Arians (Eunomians) appear to have been more backward
   about this worship (c. Vigil, 8), and Vigilantius assailed the
   worshippers of relics, with Julian-like acuteness, though he was moved
   by the thought of the divine worship in spirit and truth. He called the
   adorers of relics "suppliants to refuse and servants of idols." He
   would have nothing to do with the lights kindled before relics, the
   praying and kissing, or the pomp with which they were surrounded (c.
   4). But that did as little good as his unsuccessful attacks on
   pilgrimage to the holy sites of Palestine. Men continued to seek the
   living among the dead, and soon it was enjoined as an universal
   command--and first in the West--that every altar must have its relics;
   see Canon 17 of the 6th Synod of Carthage, and Canon 2 of a Parisian
   Council in Hefele III., p. 70. The altar was no longer merely the table
   of the Lord, but at the same time the memorial of some Saint or other.
   Yet in France it was still necessary for a long time to defend the
   practice against Vigilantius who had obtained no ally in Augustine,
   although that great theologian well knew that God required a spiritual
   service. [573] In the East, after Constantine Copronymus had attacked
   the relics along with the images, their worship was expressly enjoined
   by the seventh Synod; see the transactions at the fourth and seventh
   sittings (Hefele III., pp. 466, 472) as also the seventh Canon of the
   Council: "As every sin is followed by others in its train, the heresy
   of the iconoclasts dragged other impieties after it. They have not only
   taken away the sacred pictures, but they have abandoned other usages of
   the Church, which must now be renewed. We order therefore that relics
   be deposited with the usual prayers in all temples which have been
   consecrated without possessing any. But if in future a bishop
   consecrates a Church not having relics he shall be deposed." On the
   worship of saints and relics in the modern Greek Church, see Gass,
   Symbolik, p. 310 ff., Kattenbusch l.c. I., p. 465 f. Along with relics
   and pictures the sign of the cross--this from an early date: see even
   Justin--the volume of the Gospels, the eucharistic vessels and many
   other things were held to be especially holy. On the cross and the form
   in which it was to be made, on which great stress is placed, see Gass,
   p. 184 f.

   Mary takes the first place among the saints. She came into notice even
   in the first three centuries. [574] So early began the legends and
   aprocryphal narratives that dealt with her; her place in the Symbol
   next the Holy Spirit insured a lofty position to her for all time.
   Pierius, Alexander of Alexandria, and Athanasius, already called her
   mother of God, and her virginity was maintained before, during and
   after the birth, the birth itself being embellished with miracle, as in
   the case of the Gnostics. But Mary obtained her chief, her positively
   dogmatic significance from the fact that the dogma of the Incarnation
   became the central dogma of the Church. Even the arguments of Irenæus
   are in this respect very significant (Mary and Eve); but it was only
   from the fourth century that the consequences were drawn. It would lead
   us too far to give here a history of mariolatry even in outline. [575]
   The orthodox Fathers of the Greek Church in the fourth century were
   still comparatively reserved. Ambrose and Jerome, above all, in their
   controversy with Jovinian, initiated the Church in the worship of Mary.
   [576] Ambrose who exerted so strong an influence upon Augustine is
   especially to be mentioned as patron of this worship. He taught that
   Mary took an active share in the work of redemption, and already
   applied Gen. III., 3 to the holy virgin. In his time, again, the fables
   about Mary, which had long been in existence, began to be recognised as
   authoritative in the Church. All that had been sung in her praise by
   extravagant Latin, Greek, and Syrian poets and novelists, was
   consolidated into a kind of doctrine. It was believed as early as the
   end of the fourth century that Mary had not died, but had been removed
   from the earth by a miracle. Yet the Arabian Collyridians, who
   presented her with offerings of bread-cakes, as if she had been a
   goddess, were anathematised (Epiph. H. 78). The Nestorian controversy
   brought Mary into the centre next Christ. She was the rock from which
   was hewn the deified body of the God-Logos. Nestorius cried in vain to
   Cyril, and with him to the whole Church, "Don't make the virgin into a
   goddess"; at Ephesus Cyril exalted her for ever in the Catholic Church
   above all creatures, above Cherubim and Seraphim, and set her at the
   right hand of the Son. He started the permutatio nominum by which
   everything held true of the Son might be said to a great extent of the
   mother, because without her there would have been no God-man. She now
   really became a factor in dogma, which cannot be said of any saint or
   angel; for the name "she who bore God" (bride of the Holy Spirit) was
   thoroughly meant. It may be said in many respects that the orthodox now
   taught regarding Mary what the Arians had taught regarding Christ; she
   was a demi-god mediating between God and men. John of Damascus
   summarised the Greek theory in De fide orth. III., 12 and in the three
   homilies devoted to Mary. "The name Bearer of God' represents the whole
   mystery of the Incarnation. The Holy Spirit purified Mary with a view
   to the conception." John adopted the whole mass of legend up to the
   Ascension. Her share in the work of redemption is strongly emphasised;
   her body remained uncorrupted. Yet it is noteworthy that John was much
   more cautious in his dogmatic work than in his homilies.

   The Synod of A.D. 754, hostile as it was to saints and pictures, did
   not venture to interfere with mariolatry; indeed it expressly avowed
   its orthodoxy on this point; but that was not enough for the
   opposition. Theodorus Studita described the iconoclasts as opponents of
   the worship of Mary--see his enkomion eis ten koimesin of Mary; and it
   was only by the Synod of 787 that feeling in the East was satisfied.
   But in spite of all the extravagances with which she was honoured--the
   successive rise of numerous festivals, the annunciation, birth, death,
   reception, introduction into the temple--she is only recognised after
   all in Greek dogmatics as the great patroness and intercessor for men.
   There is not a word of her having been free from the stain of original
   sin. It has been rightly said that she soon took a much more
   independent position in Western piety. "The prayers to Mary in the
   Greek Euchologion have a very uniform tone, because they dwell
   persistently on the desire for support and help." (Gass, l.c. p. 183).
   In a word, although she is also called "Lady" by the Greeks, she is not
   the "Queen" who rules Christendom and the world, and commands in
   heaven. She is not the "Mother of sorrows"; that itself gives a
   different meaning to the feeling in the two Churches. But the
   superstition which is practised among the masses in connection with her
   pictures is perhaps worse in the East than in the West.

   The distinctive character of the Greek Church was most clearly
   expressed in the worship of pictures, in the form in which it was
   dogmatically settled after the controversy on the subject. [577] There
   had been pictures from early times, originally for decorative purposes,
   and afterwards for instruction, in the grave-yards, churches, memorial
   chapels, and houses, and fixed to all sorts of furniture. Opposition
   had existed, but it came to an end in the Constantinian age. The people
   were to learn from the pictures the histories they depicted; they were
   looked on as the books of the unlearned. [578] At the same time the
   picture was to adorn holy places. But still another interest gradually
   made itself felt, one that had formerly been most strenuously resisted
   by early Christianity. It is natural for men to desire relics and
   images of venerated beings, to withdraw them from profane use, and to
   treat them with deep devotion. Christianity had originally resisted
   this impulse, so far as anything connected with the deity was
   concerned, in order not to fall into idolatry. There was less
   repugnance, however, to it, when it dealt with Christ, and almost none
   from the first in the case of martyrs and heroic characters. From this
   point the veneration of relics and pictures slowly crept in again. But
   from the fifth century it was greatly strengthened, and received a
   support unheard of in antiquity, through the dogma of the incarnation
   and the corresponding treatment of the Eucharist. Christ was the image
   (eikon) of God, and yet a living being, nay, a life-giving spirit
   (pneuma zoopoion); Christ had by the incarnation made it possible to
   apprehend the divine in a material form, and had raised sensuous human
   nature to the divine: the consecrated elements were eikones of Christ
   and yet were his very body. These ideas introduced thought to a new
   world. It was not only the Areopagite and the mystics who saw in all
   consecrated finite things the active symbol of an eternal power, or
   perceived the superiority of the Christian religion to all others in
   the very fact that it brought the divine everywhere into contact with
   the senses. They merely raised to the level of a philosophic view what
   the common man and the monk had long perceived, namely, that everything
   secular which has been adopted by the Church became, not only a symbol,
   but also a vehicle of the sacred. But amid secular things the image,
   which bore as it were its consecration in itself, appeared to be least
   secular. Pictures of Christ, Mary, and the saints, had been already
   worshipped from the fifth (fourth) century with greetings, kisses,
   prostration, a renewal of ancient pagan practices. In the naïve and
   confident conviction that Christians no longer ran any risk of
   idolatry, the Church not only tolerated, but promoted, the entrance of
   paganism. It was certainly the intention to worship the divine in the
   material; for the incarnation of deity had deified nature (phusis). A
   brisk trade was carried on in the seventh and beginning of the eighth
   century in images, especially by monks; churches, and chapels were
   crowded with pictures and relics; the practice of heathen times was
   revived, only the sense of beauty was inverted. It was not fresh life
   that seemed fair, but, though a trace of the majestic might not be
   lacking, it was the life consecrated to asceticism and death. We do not
   know how far artistic incapacity, how far the dogmatic intention,
   contributed to the Byzantine ideal of the saints. "Authentic" pictures
   were in existence, and numberless copies were made from them. By their
   means, monkish piety, engaged in a stupid staring at sacred things,
   ruled the people, and dragged Christianity down to deeper and deeper
   depths.

   But this monkish piety, which prevailed from the Bishops down, had
   become more and more independent in relation to the State. None of his
   successors had mastered the Church, like Justinian; and it was the aim
   of the iconoclastic emperors to reduce it to complete subjection to the
   State, to make it a department of the State. They sought at the same
   time to have a State Church into which they could force the sects, Jews
   and Mohammedans, without imposing what was most obnoxious to them, that
   which made official Christianity into heathenism --the worship of
   images. They meant therefore to decide what was Christian, and how the
   cultus ought to be framed, and in doing so they were aided by the fact
   that it could be shown without any difficulty that the worship of
   images was something relatively novel and alien. We cannot say more;
   for they themselves were violent and rude barbarians, military
   upstarts, who depended on the sword. They had abandoned the idea of the
   Church as the chief support of the empire; it was to be the chief
   servant. Instead of priests they had soldiers. They merely wished that
   the Church should not give trouble, and that it should be possible in
   any given case to make whatever use of it the State might require.
   Image-worship may look like religious barbarism; but it was associated
   with all the spiritual forces still possessed at that time in
   Christendom. The iconoclastic imperial power was much more barbarous,
   though we have to admit that Constantine Copronymus possessed brilliant
   gifts as a ruler. However, the emperors found bishops who made common
   cause with them, and it cannot be denied that some of these had
   religious motives for attacking the images. Here and there the
   hostility of the Jews and of Islam may have set them thinking about the
   matter; others sought for means of winning or conciliating the
   Mohammedans. Their opponents described the Arabians as the teachers of
   the iconoclastic emperors.

   In A.D. 726 Leo the Isaurian took the matter in hand. [579] A general
   opposition at once arose. "The king must not decide concerning faith"
   (me dein basilea peri pisteos logon poieisthai). This general idea
   accompanied the whole dispute. From the days of Maximus Confessor, the
   leaders of the Greek Church insisted on the independence of the Church
   in relation to the State, and the Roman Bishops supported them in their
   efforts. They were for that very reason on the side of image-worship,
   just as, conversely, Charlemagne and his Franks were averse from it. At
   the same time the influence of other motives than those of
   ecclesiastical politics should not be denied. [580] It was perhaps the
   greatest and the least expected crisis ever experienced by the
   Byzantine Church. [581] The issue deprived it of any further
   independent history, of middle ages, or of a modern era. The
   image-worshippers, with the Pope at their head, replied to the imperial
   edict by referring to express divine statutes, to the Labarum of
   Constantine, and to the great Fathers of the fourth century, who had
   taught that the worship passed from the image to its prototype. [582]
   They appealed to a picture at Paneas of which Eusebius had spoken, but
   above all to the incarnation of the Logos. "Had God not become man, we
   would not portray him in a human form." The prohibitions of the Old
   Testament signified nothing to the contrary; for idols are only
   pictures of things which do not exist. We do not worship idols like the
   golden calf. He who makes use of the Old Testament in the Jewish
   fashion and charges the Church with idolatry is a reprobate Jew.
   Besides, Israel had possessed divine images of its own; it only refused
   to value them--Moses' rod, the golden pitcher, the cover of the ark
   etc.; had it worshipped these, it would not have fallen down before
   idols. All sculpture made in the name of God was venerable and holy.
   [583] These were the most important arguments.

   But the Emperor appointed a Patriarch favourable to him in
   Constantinople, and sought to get the Pope of Rome into his power. The
   latter, in his letters to him [584] defending the images, emphasized
   the points, first, that there were cheiropoieta (images made with
   hands) which had been prompted by God, and were therefore sacred and,
   secondly, acheirpoieta (not made with hands), as e.g., the picture
   which Christ had sent to Abgar. The latter, the acheiropoieta, played a
   great, indeed the decisive, role in the Church of the East. Moreover,
   we see from the Pope's letters that the imperial edict not only
   affected image worship as the veneration of idols, stones, walls, and
   boards, but also the veneration of martyrs as polytheism, and that the
   military Emperor plumed himself on his likeness to Josiah (Hezekiah).
   Thereupon the Pope wrote him that the dogmas of the Church were the
   affair of Bishops and not of the Emperor; as the former might not
   interfere in civil matters, so neither might the latter in
   ecclesiastical. The Emperor replied that he was at once Emperor and
   Priest. But Gregory was not to be dismayed; his second letter was even
   more forcible than his first. John of Damascus, securely protected by a
   Khalif, also raised his voice in three apologies on behalf of the
   images. [585] In these the adoration of images is made to form an
   integral part of the dogmatic theory of the Incarnation. We adore the
   Creator who became a creature; with him is inseparably connected the
   purple garment of the body. Therefore, while God himself cannot be
   portrayed, the incarnate God can. The Mosaic law only forbade the
   adoration of service' (proskunesis latreias), but not adoration
   (proskunesis) in general. Images are visible forms representative of
   the invisible; the Son alone indeed is a perfect (identical) copy; but
   other images are also connected with the subject they portray, and from
   eternity one of every creature has existed in the presence of God.
   Gregory and John have a very great deal in common in their arguments,
   so that we see clearly how dependent the former was on Greek writers,
   [586] but not only is the whole subject more thoroughly treated in
   John, but it is more strictly based on dogmatics. He even goes so far
   as to see in the rejection of images Manichæism, the contempt of matter
   which the God-Logos had hypostatically united with himself. We find a
   frightful confusion of ideas in an apparently simple and solid
   argument. All dogma, wherever John lays his hands on it, culminates in
   the images. The doctrines of the Holy Ghost, of death, unction and the
   cross, all require this worship.

   But the freedom of the Church from the State was also strongly
   emphasised by the subject of the Khalif, so that once more the
   parallelism with Gregory's letters is striking, so much so as almost to
   cast doubt on the genuineness of the latter or of John's apologies. It
   was the prerogative not of Emperors but of Councils to control Church
   affairs. The power of binding and loosing had been granted not to
   Emperors, but to Apostles, Bishops, and Doctors. In the second address
   John assails the Emperor still more sharply. At the same time, he now
   maintains that the Church is governed by the written and unwritten
   institutions of the Fathers; the worship of images belongs to the
   latter. It was difficult to produce proof from tradition, and many
   patristic passages could be instanced against it. Hence "unwritten"
   tradition. The adoration of the cross and of relics was always embraced
   in the defence, and even the Old Testament analogy was cited in its
   support. In the third address it is again declared that adoration is
   due only to God and the body united with the Deity, and that the
   incarnate God is alone to be portrayed. Then the abandonment of
   Scriptural evidence for images is made up for by an indirect proof.
   Here it occurs to the apologist, that in fact all the catchwords of
   orthodox dogma do not exist in the Bible. Next, we have a detailed
   philosophy of images: the Son is the perfect resemblance of God, and
   the Holy Ghost of the Son. Images are the ideas of things; man is the
   likeness of God; the word is the image of thought; recollection of the
   past and representation of the future are images. Everything is an
   image, and the image is everything. The saints themselves are
   worshipped in their pictures. This is followed by the treatment of the
   Eucharist, next by a long section on the degrees of worship; it is
   abasement in presence of the object revered. To this is appended the
   mention of the curative shadow of the Apostles, the handkerchief, and
   the boys who ridiculed Elisha. Thus we are led up to relics, saints,
   and pictures, the crib,. Golgotha, the cross, nails, sheets,
   swaddling-clothes, and vesture, and again to books of the Gospels,
   sacred vessels, candlesticks and crosses etc. in the Church. Even the
   adoration of princes is recalled. Numerous patristic passages, some of
   them forged, are quoted.

   After the death of Leo, and the overthrow of an anti-emperor supported
   by those friendly to images, the son of the former, Constantine
   Copronymus, carried out his father's policy with an iron hand. He
   summoned the general Synod, already planned by his father, to
   Constantinople A.D. 754. Three hundred and thirty-eight bishops
   assembled, but the Patriarchs were absent. Archbishop Theodosius of
   Ephesus presided. [587] The proceedings are only in part known, through
   those of the seventh general Council. [588] In the decision (horos) of
   the Synod Christianity is abruptly contrasted with idolatry, but the
   veneration of images is idolatry. There were hardly many Bishops, who
   could or dared use such language honestly or from the heart. The
   majority played the hypocrite from dread of the emperor in declaring
   that the veneration of images was a work of Satan, introduced into the
   Church of the pure doctrine, in order to seduce men from the lofty
   adoration of God, or in describing painting as the sinful art by which
   the incarnation of Christ was blasphemed. But it sounds strangest of
   all to hear that these Bishops charged the image worshippers at once
   with Nestorianism and Eutychianism. They were Nestorians since it was
   of course only possible to represent the humanity of Christ, and thus
   his divinity and humanity were sundered; and they were Eutychians in so
   far as they sought at the same time to represent his divinity and
   accordingly confounded it with his humanity. The only image
   allowed--and this is an important declaration--were the bread and wine
   in the Lord's Supper. Starting from the prohibition of the portrayal of
   Christ, images in general were argued against. Further, Christianity
   rejected along with heathenism not only sacrificial, but pictorial,
   worship. The saints live with God; to recall them to earthly life by
   means of a dead art was blasphemy. Men ought to continue to worship and
   invoke them, but to condemn their pictures. No reference seems to have
   been made to relics. We have now a series of excellently chosen
   passages from the Bible and the Fathers. In conclusion, stringent
   penalties were attached to the worship of images, and a string of
   anathemas crowns the whole. "We also believe that we speak
   apostolically and have the Holy Spirit." They had in fact uttered fine
   propositions, and used words which had ceased for centuries to be heard
   so distinctly in the Greek Church; but did they themselves believe in
   these words?

   They were under the yoke of the Emperor. The clergy obeyed when the
   decrees were published; but resistance was offered in the ranks of the
   monks. Many took to flight, some became martyrs. The imperial police
   stormed the Churches, and destroyed those images and pictures that had
   not been secured. The iconoclastic zeal by no means sprang from
   enthusiasm for divine service in spirit and in truth. The Emperor now
   also directly attacked the monks; he meant to extirpate the hated
   order, and to overthrow the throne of Peter. We see how the idea of an
   absolute military state rose powerfully in Constantinople, how it
   strove to establish itself by brute force. The Emperor, according to
   trustworthy evidence, made the inhabitants of the city swear that they
   would henceforth worship no image, and give up all intercourse with
   monks. Cloisters were turned into arsenals and barracks, relics were
   hurled into the sea, and the monks, as far as possible, secularised.
   And the politically far-seeing Emperor at the same time entered into
   correspondence with France (Synod of Gentilly, A.D. 767) and sought to
   win Pepin, History seemed to have suffered a violent rupture, a new era
   was dawning which should supersede the history of the Church.

   But the Church was too powerful, and the Emperor was not even master of
   Oriental Christendom, but only of part of it. The orthodox Patriarchs
   of the East (under the rule of Islam) declared against the iconoclastic
   movement, and a Church without monks or pictures, in schism with the
   other orthodox Churches, was a nonentity. A spiritual reformer was
   wanting. Thus the great reaction set in, after the death of the Emperor
   (A.D. 775), the ablest ruler Constantinople had seen for a long time.
   This is not the place to describe how it was inaugurated and cautiously
   carried out by the skilful policy of the Empress Irene, [589]
   cautiously, for a generation had already grown up that was accustomed
   to the cultus without images. An important part was played by the
   miracles performed by the re-emerging relics and pictures. But the
   lower classes had always been really favourable to them; only the army
   and the not inconsiderable number of bishops who were of the school of
   Constantine had to be carefully handled. Tarasius, [590] the new
   Patriarch of Constantinople and a supporter of images, succeeded, after
   overcoming much difficulty, and especially distrust in Rome and the
   East, after also removing the excited army, in bringing together a
   general Council of about 350 bishops at Nicæa, A.D. 787, which annulled
   the decrees of A.D. 754. [591] The proceedings of the seven sittings
   [592] are of great value, because very important patristic passages
   have been preserved in them which otherwise would have perished; for at
   this Synod also the discussions turned chiefly on the Fathers. The
   decision (horos) restored orthodoxy and finally settled it. The first
   six Synods with their anathemas and canons were first confirmed, and it
   went on: "We decide with all precision and fitness to set up, along
   with the form of the precious and life-giving cross, the august and
   holy images made with colours or of stone or other suitable material,
   in the holy churches of God, on sacred vessels and garments, on walls
   and tablets, in houses and on the streets: both the image of our Lord
   and God and Saviour Jesus Christ, and of our undefiled Lady, the holy
   mother of God, and of the august angels, and all saintly and pious men;
   for the prototypes being constantly seen represented in images, the
   spectators are excited to remember and long for them, and to bestow
   reverence and due veneration on the images, not indeed the true worship
   according to our faith which is due to God alone; but (as it becomes
   us) to make an offering of incense and lights in their honour to the
   form of the precious and life-giving cross, to the holy Gospels, and
   the other sacred erections, as was the pious custom of the ancients;
   for the honour paid to the image passes to the prototype; and he who
   adores the image adores in it the being or object portrayed." [593]

   Just as at Trent, in addition to the restoration of mediæval doctrine,
   a series of reforming decrees was published, so this Synod promulgated
   twenty-two canons which can be similarly described. The attack on
   monachism and the constitution of the Church had been of some use. They
   are the best canons drawn up by an OEcumenical Synod. The bishops were
   enjoined to study, to live simply and be unselfish, and to attend to
   the care of souls; the monks to observe order, decorum, and also to be
   unselfish. With the State and the Emperor no compromise was made; on
   the contrary, the demands of Maximus Confessor and John of Damascus are
   heard, though in muffled tones, from the canons. [594] Still, though
   the Byzantine Church possessed in the next period an abbot--Theodorus
   Studita [595] --who championed, as none but a Nicholas or Gregory
   could, the sovereignty over princes of God's law and the Church, it did
   not win freedom and independence. However, the repeated and for decades
   successful attempts made by military Emperors in the ninth century to
   get rid of the image-worship which had only brought defeat to the
   State, were finally frustrated. [596] The great Theodore maintained the
   orthodox cause unflinchingly against Leo the Armenian and Michael the
   Stammerer. Their successor Theophilus was a relentless foe to images
   and the monks. Then came an Empress, Theodora, who finally restored the
   worship. This took place at the Synod held at Constantinople A.D. 842.
   This Synod decreed that a Feast of Orthodoxy (he kuriake tes
   orthodoxias) should be celebrated annually, at which the victory over
   the iconoclasts should be regularly remembered. Thus the whole of
   orthodoxy was united in image-worship. [597]

   In this way the Eastern Church reached the position which suited its
   nature. We have here the conclusion of a development consistent in the
   main points. The divine and sacred, as that had descended into the
   sensuous world by the incarnation, had created for itself in the Church
   a system of material, supernatural things, which offered themselves for
   man's use. The theosophy of images corresponded to the Neo-platonic
   conception, connected with that of the Incarnation, of the one
   unfolding itself in a plurality of graded ideas (original types) down
   to the earthly. The theme had, as the image-worshippers said, been
   already touched on by Basil ("the knowledge of the prototype comes
   through the image": di' eikonos he gnosis tou archetupou ginetai);
   Gregory of Nazianzus ("it is the nature of the image to be a copy of
   the prototype and of what is said": haute eikonos phusis mimema einai
   tou archetupou kai hou legetai); the Areopagite ("truly visible images
   are the seen [representatives] of the unseen" alethos emphaneis eikones
   eisi ta horata ton aoraton); Theodoret ("sin alone has no copy") and
   others. [598] All that had been wanting was a correct understanding and
   a bold carrying out of the truth. And lastly, that nothing be left out,
   Aristotelian scholasticism found its account here also. It had been
   maintained long ago, and supported by reference to the pictures "not
   made with hands" (acheiropoieta), that not painting, but the tradition
   and law of the Church created the types--see also the decision of the
   seventh Council. But Theodorus Studita went still further. [599] To him
   the picture was almost more important than the correct dogmatic
   formula; for in his view the relation of the copy to the original was a
   necessary one, and there was complete identity in so far as while the
   material was different, the form (the hypostasis) was the same.
   Theodore maintained that the material was indifferent, but that in the
   form of the authentic pictures one possessed the real Christ, the real
   Mary, and the real saints. They all bore their prototype in themselves,
   and this prototype was independent of the personal impress; it went on
   imprinting itself from picture to picture, at first spontaneously--for
   these men caught at the absurdity of images not made with hands
   (eikones acheiropoietoi), then through the artist, if he reproduced the
   type faithfully. [600]

   With this science of images composed of superstition, magic and
   scholasticism we may fitly close the development. The Greek Church has
   almost entirely excluded plastic representations, and its practice of
   art has, in consequence of the ban placed on it by the "authentic"
   picture, never been anything but stunted. No one can deny that the
   image-worshippers had some justification in their controversy with the
   iconoclasts; and for Greek Christianity, as it was, image-worship was a
   vital question. But in the great conflict waged for a century by the
   Byzantine Church with the State, not only did its distinctive
   character, but its freedom, depend on the issue. Great monks had tried
   to educate the Church up to the idea of freedom. In the fight to retain
   its character it was victorious; but in that for liberty it succumbed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [507] That an honest and genuine faith can live and does live within
   these husks is not to be denied.

   [508] Even in these, as experience teaches us, religion may still
   continue to live for some. Thus the symbol and cult of the Cross in the
   Greek Church keeps alive a feeling of the holiness of the suffering of
   the righteous one and a reverence for greatness in humility.

   [509] This impossibility may serve as a warning to us in regard to the
   interpretation of other religions, of their mythologies and ritual
   formularies. We know most religions only in the form of "superstitio",
   i.e., in the form in which they have come down to us they are for the
   most part already in an entirely degenerate state, or have become
   petrified. Who therefore would make bold to set about explaining these
   forms in the absence of all knowledge of the previous stages? It is an
   audacious undertaking.

   [510] This judgment must stand although much that is ancient, genuine,
   and edifying is contained in the prayers and hymns of the liturgies of
   all the peoples belonging to the Greek Church. But it has become a
   formula and as a rule is not understood by the people. In this respect
   the orthodox churches are in a more favourable position, and much is
   now being done in order to make the liturgy more intelligible.

   [511] See Fallmerayer, Fragmente aus dem Orient, 1877, further the
   descriptions of the Easter festivals kept by the different
   ecclesiastical parties in Jerusalem and their image worship. By the
   Mohammedans too the Christian priest is frequently regarded as a
   conjurer and when they happen to be living in the same place with
   Christians, and are in dire distress, they visit the holy places and
   have recourse to the miracle-working reliques and images.

   [512] The beginnings of this transformation are, it is true, to be
   found far back in the past. We can already trace them in Justin, and
   perhaps in fact even in the Apostolic Age missionaries like Apollos
   regarded religion in this way.

   [513] See Vol. I., p. III, Vol. II., p. 349, n. 2.

   [514] See Vol. III., p. 253, and p. 272 f. Mysticism as a rule is
   rationalism worked out in a fantastic way, and rationalism is a faded
   mysticism.

   [515] The best treatment of the subject is in von Zerschwitz, System
   der Kirchl. Katechetik, Vol. I.; see also his article "Liturgie" in
   Herzog's R.-Encyckl., and ed., and cf. the investigations of the
   disciplina arcana by Rothe, Th. Harnack and Bonwetsch.

   [516] The description of the doctrine, i.e., the fides quæ creditur, as
   musterion (sacrament), dated back to ancient times, hence too the
   practice of keeping the Creed secret.

   [517] See Kattenbusch, op. cit. I., p. 393 ff. "The mysteries represent
   by their form the dogma" . . . "It is in this connection too that the
   comparison of the details in the Liturgy with the life of Jesus as
   known to us from the Gospel and for which Sophronius of Jerusalem had
   already prepared the way, first appears in the true light. The
   arrangement of the Liturgy represents the history of the Incarnation.
   In this way the whole form of the Liturgy came to share in the value
   attached to the dogma. Only he who acknowledges the orthodox Liturgy is
   a Chalcedonian."

   [518] There are many passages which prove how closely Baptism and the
   Lord's Supper were linked together, and regarded as the chief
   mysteries. What Augustine de pecc. mer. et remiss. remarks (24, 34) can
   hardly be held to apply only to the Punic Christians. "Optime Punici
   Christiani baptismum ipsum nihil aliud quam salutem' et sacramentum
   corporis Christi nihil aliud quam vitam' vocant, unde nisi ex antiqua,
   ut existimo, et apostolica traditione" etc. It was chiefly through the
   Lord's Supper that the element of mysteries found an entrance into the
   religion of spirit and truth. This way of treating the elements used in
   it, which are nevertheless expressly described as symbols, supplied the
   point of departure for the development of the greatest importance.

   [519] Cypr. ep. 72. I. We find it first amongst the Gnostics alongside
   of Baptism and the Lord's Supper; see Excerpta ex Theodoto, the
   Coptic-gnostic writings and the ritual of the Marcianites. Cf. on this
   sacrament Schwane, Dogmengesch. II., p. 968 ff.

   [520] C. litt. Petiliani II., c. 104, 239.

   [521] De pecc. merit. II., 42.

   [522] See de eccles. hierarch. 2-7. To the author the most of these
   mysteries are not separate mysteries, but represent a whole series of
   different mysteries. The last mentioned has nothing to do with extreme
   unction, but designates certain practices in connection with the
   treatment of the corpse.

   [523] The "aliud videtur, aliud intellegitur" (Augustine) is the best
   definition of the sacrament or mystery.

   [524] The orthodox Greek Church came to reckon the sacraments as seven
   owing to the influence of the West, i.e., gradually from the year 1274
   onwards. Still the number seven never came to have the importance
   attached to it in the West.

   [525] In Athanasius we already meet with both modes of expression: (1)
   "The Logos became flesh, in order that he might offer his body for all,
   and we by participating in his spirit may be made divine" (de decret.
   synod. Nic. 14); (2) "We are made divine inasmuch as we do not
   participate in the body of a man, but receive the body of the Logos
   Himself" (ad. Maxim. phil. 2).

   [526] Here already at this early stage the difficult question emerges
   which even at the present day troubles many amongst ourselves, as to
   whether the ceremonies of the Old Testament, circumcision for instance,
   were sacraments.

   [527] I here leave out of account the Syrian mysticism of the fifth and
   sixth centuries of which we first really got some idea from the
   admirable work of Frothingham, Stephen bar Sudaili, 1886. The
   philosophico-logical element is not entirely absent from the views of
   these Syro-Monophysite mystics who had relations with Egypt too, but
   still it always was kept in the background. We have in their case
   Pantheism of a strongly marked character represented by the
   consubstantiality of God and the universe, and in accordance with this
   they had a fondness for the "Origenistic" ideas of the history of the
   universe and of the restoration of all things.

   [528] Gregory of Nazianzus (in laud. Heron. c. 2) thus speaks from the
   altar to Hero "Approach hither, near to the Holy places, the mystic
   table and me, to dia touton mustagogounti ten theosin, hois se prosagei
   logos kai bios kai he dia tou pathein katharsis."

   [529] The article by Möller in Herzog's R.-Encyklop. III., p. 616 ff.
   enables us to understand how the Dionysius question stood in the year
   1878 (the best analysis is by Steitz, in the Jahrhb. für deutsche
   Theol., 1866, p. 197 ff; there are valuable if not quite convincing
   discussions by Hipler, 1861 and in the Kirchenlex. 2 III., p. 1789 ff.,
   cf. the work of Engelhardt, Die angebl. Schriften des A. Dionysius,
   Sulzbach, 1823). Within recent years, however, several new publications
   based on the sources, and discussions, have appeared, which shew that
   nothing has really yet been certainly established; see Pitra, Analecta
   Sacra III., on this Loofs in the ThLZ., 1884, Col. 554 f.; Frothingham,
   Stephen bar Sudaili, the Syrian Mystic and the Book of Hierotheos,
   1886; in addition Baethgen in the ThLZ, 1887, No. 10; Skworzow,
   Patrologische Untersuchungen, 1875; Kanakis, Dion. d. Areopagite, 1881;
   Dräseke (Ges. Patrist. Abhandl., 1889, p. 25 ff.; Dionysios v.
   Rhinokolura, in addition Gelzer in the Wochenschrift f. Klass. Philol.,
   1892, separate impression); Jahn, Dionysiaca, 1889; Foss, Ueber den Abt
   Hilduin von St. Denis and Dionysius Areop. in the Jahresbericht des
   Luisenstadt. R.-Gymnasiums z. Berlin, 1886. The most ancient testimony
   to the existence of these works is to be found in the Church History
   attributed to Zacharias of Mitylene (Land, Anecd. Syr. III., p. 228).
   Severus quoted them at a Council at Tyre which cannot have been held
   later than the year 513. Still older would be Cyril's testimony in the
   work against Diodorus and Theodore, which even if it ought not to be
   attributed to Cyril, belongs to the fifth century. "Although the
   manuscript reading in Liberatus Brev. 10 is corrupt still it ought
   probably to be emended thus: Dionysii Areopagitæ, (Dionysii)
   Corinthiorum episcopi" (Gelzer). Hipler, Pitra, Dräseke, Möller,
   Kanakis (who wishes to fix the date of the writings definitely for
   about 120) have pronounced against the old assumption of a (pious)
   fraud, and have referred the writings to the second half of the fourth
   century. They have besides sought to shew that we ought probably to
   make a distinction between the several works which now bear the name of
   Dionysius, and that the oldest of the writings bearing this name are in
   all probability not forgeries, though forgers and interpolators did
   seize upon them in the fifth or sixth century, and that therefore, as
   is so frequently the case, it was not the author, but tradition which
   first committed the forgery. But if Frothingham is right, the writings
   ought to be put later, and Gelzer as against Dräseke has advanced some
   very strong arguments in favour of the idea of an original pia
   fracas--after the analogy of the Neo-Platonic interpolations--that is
   in support of the hypothesis "that the author of these writings
   purposely intended from the first to secure a loftier authority from
   them than they would otherwise have had by means of the prestige
   attaching to works contemporary with the Apostles." "The author of the
   Dionysian writings was merely following the usages of the schools, in
   transferring his works to the apostolic age." The question of date is
   consequently not yet settled, (second half of the fourth and fifth
   century). The period previous to 400 seems to me the more probable, but
   there are so many points connected with these writings which are still
   obscure that one must refrain from pronouncing an opinion until a new,
   thorough, and comprehensive investigation has been made.

   [530] Baptism may be left out of account; for the views held regarding
   it did not undergo any actual development within the period we treat of
   (see Vol. II., 140.) Naturally the general and changing ideas of the
   mysteries exercised an influence upon baptism, but it was rarely
   studied ex professo. It besides occupied an isolated position since it
   could never be brought into intimate connection with worship. What was
   certain was that baptism actually purifies from sins committed previous
   to it, i.e., destroys them, and consequently constitutes the beginning
   of the process which makes the mortal man imperishable. It is thus the
   source and beginning of all gifts of grace. But as was the case in
   regard to the other mysteries, so here too there were theologians who,
   in imitation of Origen, held the view that there was a mysterious
   purification of the soul, and regarded the water as a symbol, but all
   the same as the absolutely necessary symbol, which just for this very
   reason is not simply a "symbol" in the modern sense of the word (see
   the Cappadocians). The intellectualism of these theologians and their
   inability to believe in an actual forgiveness of sins, led them in the
   case of baptism to prefer the idea of a photismos--the primitive
   designation of the sacrament--and thus of a physical purification
   (katharsis) or else to think of the proof it gave of such a
   purification. Other theologians, however, from the days of Cyril of
   Alexandria downwards, in accordance with their ideas of the Lord's
   Supper with which, following John XIX. 34, baptism was always ranged
   (Johannes Damascenus still gives prominence to these two sacraments
   only), assumed that there was an actual metastoicheiosis of the water
   into a divine material, which took place by means of the descent of the
   spirit which followed the invocation of God. Tertullian (de bapt.) and
   Cyprian had already taught similar doctrine in the West. Cyril of
   Jerusalem too (cat. III. 3, 4) held the view that there was a dynamic
   change in the water. But it is Cyril of Alexandria (Opp. IV., p. 147)
   who first says: Dia tes tou pneumatos energeias to aistheton hudor pros
   theian tina kai aporreton metastoicheioutai dunamin, hagiazei de loipon
   tous en hois an genoito. Still the Church did not get the length of
   having distinct and definite formulæ for the sacramental unity of water
   and spirit, for the moment, and for the means whereby this unity was
   produced. Although the statement held good that baptism was absolutely
   necessary to salvation, still people shrank more from the unworthy
   reception of it than from the danger of definitely dispensing with it.
   In the fourth century people kept postponing it repeatedly--so as not
   to use this general means till the hour of death. Baptism was
   accordingly regarded by many in praxi not as initiation into the
   Christian state, but as the completion of it. Some very characteristic
   passages in Augustine's Confessions, e.g., show this (e.g., Confess.
   VI. 4): it was possible in the fourth century to rank as a Christian,
   though one was not yet baptised. But the great Church-Fathers of the
   fourth century defended the practice of infant-baptism which had been
   already handed down, and this was established in the fifth century as
   the general usage. Its complete adoption runs parallel with the death
   of heathenism. As regards baptism by heretics, the view held in the
   Eastern Church at the beginning of the fourth century was that it was
   not valid. But it gradually, though hesitatingly, receded somewhat from
   this position (see the decisions of 325 and 381). A distinction was
   made between those sects whose baptism was to be recognised, or was to
   be supplemented by the laying on of hands, and those whose baptism had
   to be repeated (this is still what we have in the ninty-fifth canon of
   the Trullan Synod 692). The Church did not, however, arrive at any more
   fixed view on the matter, since just those fathers of the fourth
   century who where held in the highest esteem generally demanded
   re-baptism. Whether one ought to re-baptise the heretic or to anoint
   him or merely to lay the hand upon him, is a point that is not
   certainly decided up to the present time. The Greek Church very
   frequently still repeats baptism at the present clay; see Höfling,
   Sacr. der Taufe, 1848; Steitz, Art. "Ketzertaufe" in Herzog's
   R.-Encykl. 2nd ed.; Kattenbusch, op. cit. I., p. 403 ff.

   [531] See Vol. II., p. 136, and p. 146.

   [532] It is very worthy of note that already in the fourth century the
   Lord's Supper was regarded as the expression of a particular form of
   Confession. Philostorgius (H. E. III. 14) tells us that up to the time
   of Aëtius the Arians in the East had joined with the orthodox in
   prayers, hymns, etc., in short in almost all ecclesiastical acts, but
   not in the "mystic sacrifice." In the commemorations from that time
   onwards connection with the Church found public expression. Cancelling
   of Church membership was regularly expressed by erasure of the name in
   the commemoration from the diptychs.

   [533] Let any one take a proposition such as this from Athanasius:
   pneuma zoopoioun he sarx esti tou kuriou, dioti ek pneumatos zoopoiou
   sunelemphthe, in order to form an idea of how one may twist and turn
   the words.

   [534] In the essays by Steitz on the doctrine of the Supper in the
   Greek Church (Jahrbb. f. deutsche Theol. IX., pp. 409-481; X., pp.
   64-152, 399-463; XI., pp. 193-253: XII., pp. 211-286; XIII., pp. 3-66)
   we possess an investigation of the subject which is as comprehensive as
   it is thorough. The author, however, does not seem to me always to have
   hit the mark in the judgments he passes. He makes too many
   distinctions, and in particular his view as to the existence of a
   strictly distinct symbolic doctrine of the Supper is hardly tenable in
   the form in which he seeks to develop it. A purely symbolic conception
   of the Supper never existed, for it was always harmoniously united with
   a ritual which was based on a very realistic way of conceiving of it.
   What we now call "symbol" is something wholly different from what was
   so-called by the ancient Church. On the other hand, after the
   sacramental magic in its coarsest form had found its way into the
   Church, "symbolic" statements were always tolerated because the symbol
   was really never a mere type or sign, but always embodied a mystery;
   see Vol. II. p. 143. On the doctrine of the Supper cf. further the
   monographs by Rückert, Kahnis, Ebrard.

   spiritualism was in no sense opposed to the most superstitious
   treatment of the Supper. Quite correctly Ullmann, Gregor, p. 487: "It
   is difficult to determine what Gregory understood by eating and
   drinking the blood of Christ, and in any case no dogma which may be
   regarded as peculiarly belonging to Gregory can be deduced from it." In
   him we find the expression for the consecrated elements "antitupa tou
   timiou somatos kai haimatos", an expression which Eusebius in his day
   might have used and which Eustathius did use (Steitz X., p. 402).

   [551] On the doctrine of the Lord's Supper as held by Theodore,
   Theodoret, Nestorius, and Pseudo-Chrysostom, see Steitz XII, pp.
   217-435. Theodoret can be described with most reason as a believer in
   the symbolical character of the rite. Yet on the other hand it was
   maintained in the school of Theodore, in order to separate deity and
   humanity in Christ, that in the Lord's Supper the humanity of the
   Redeemer is received. This was very stoutly and acutely opposed by
   Leontius (in Mai, Vet. Script. nova coll. VI., p. 312) and that as a
   deification of man.

   [558] On the mystics before him and after Dionysius, and their in part

   of Aristotle, see Steitz. XI., pp. 229-253. How closely the Trinity,
   Incarnation, and Eucharist were conceived to be connected, in the 7th
   century, may be seen from the Confession of Macarius of Antioch at the
   sixth Council, Mansi XI., p. 350 sq.

   [562] See Steitz XIII., pp. 3-66. The two controversies about the
   Lord's Supper of 1155 and 1199 are relatively the most important.

   [563] The magical view of the Lord's Supper is also seen in the
   practice of children's communion, which first attested by Cyprian (by
   Leucius?), became the rule in the East, after infant Baptism had been
   established. Participation in the Lord's Supper was even held to be
   absolutely necessary; so already Cyprian, Testim. III. 25. See the Art.

   ed.

   [564] See Mansi XIII., p. 398 sq. and Hefele III., p. 473. On the
   present doctrine and practice of the Greek Churches as regards the
   Eucharist, see Gass, Symbolik, pp. 252-277.; Kattenbusch l.c. I., p.
   410 ff. There as also in the Index of Hefele's Conciliengesch. (esp.
   Vol III. under "Abendmahl", "Messe") we obtain information also as to
   the numerous detailed decisions bearing on the rite (leavened bread,
   etc.); compare Heineccius, Abbildung der alten and neuen griechischen
   Kirche, 1711.

   [565] Yet some of the apocryphal Gospels, Acts of the Apostles,
   Apocalypses, etc., come under this head.

   [566] The works of Usener and Dieterich (Nekuia, Leipzig, 1893) are
   valuable.

   [567] To the monks there fell as a rule in the East the role of
   mediators between Christianity of the first and second rank. They
   perhaps contributed most strongly to the transference of catchwords of
   the former into the latter, and of the spirit of the latter into the
   former.

   [568] The Manichæans held a similar doctrine.

   [569] On the extension of angel-worship we have an interesting bit of
   evidence as early as the fourth century in Didymus, De trinit. II. 7,
   p. 250 (ed. Mingarelli): Dio meta tas ekklesias kai oikoi eukterioi to
   Theo tes proegorias humon (scil. of the angels) eponumoi, ho euarestos

   [570] Jerome c. Vigilant. and ep. ad Riparium.

   [571] Worship was more and more paid to the saints as ascetics and
   workers of miracles. Men wished to receive front the miracle-workers
   what they praised in the ascetics; for the worship was not platonic,
   but was always covetous. The great patterns for biographies of ascetics
   were the Life of Anthony by Athanasius, and the Lives of the Egyptian
   monks by Jerome. These were followed in the West by the saintly novels
   on Martin of Tours by Sulpicius Severus, and the Egyptian Tales of
   Johannes Cassianus. Comprehensive works soon appeared in the East, of
   which the philotheos historia of Theodoret, the Historia Lausiaca of
   Palladius, and the corresponding sections of Sozomen's Church History,
   deserve special mention. The apophthegmata of Macarius are uniqne. The
   biographies of saints and martyrs of the Jacobites, Copts and
   Abyssinians are, thanks to a gloomy and desolate fancy, particularly
   repulsive. We need only here mention the collection (Simeon
   Metaphrastes) and the ritual use of the biographies (Menaen,
   Synaxarien, etc.).

   relics, see Sdralek, Art. Reliquien in Kraus, Realencyklop. der

   tractate of Faustus of Reji de symbolo (Caspari, Quellen IV., p. 273);
   "Ut transeamus ad sanctorum communionem. Illos hic sententia ista
   confundit, qui sanctorum et amicorum dei cineres non in honore debere
   esse blasphemant, qui beatorum martyrum gloriosam memoriam sacrorum
   reverentia monumentorum colendam esse non credunt. In symbolum
   prævaricati sunt, et Christo in fonte mentiti sunt, et per hanc
   infidelitatem in medio sinu vitæ locum morti aperuerunt."

   [575] A good review is given by Benrath, "Zur Gesch. der
   Marienverehrung", re-printed from the Theol. Studien and Kritik., 1886.
   A list is given in it of Catholic literature, in which the works of
   Marraci, Passaglia, Kurz (1881), Scheeben (1882), and von Lehner (1881,
   also a 2nd ed.) are especially noteworthy. Art. "Maria" by Steitz in
   the R.-Encykl., Rösch, Astarte Maria (Stud. u. Krit., 1888, pp.

   [576] Jovinian, so passionately handled by Jerome, had, in keeping with
   his depreciatory view of virginity in general, denied among other
   things the perpetua virginitas of Mary. But other Western writers, like
   Bonosus and Helvidius, held the same view, and found supporters in
   their own time in Illyria. Bonosus held heterodox views, besides, of
   the person of Christ (compare the Art. on him in Herzog's R.-Encykl.).

   [577] On the controversy about images, see Mansi XII.-XIV., and the
   works of John of Damascus, Theodore Studita, Theophanes, Gregory
   Hamartolus, Cedrenus, Zonaras, Constantine Manasses, Michael Glycas,

   ff.; IV. 2, p. 1 ff.), Schenk, Kaiser Leo III. (Halle, 1880). On the
   relation of Armenia to the image-controversy, see Karapet Ter
   Mkrttschian, Die Paulikianer (Leipzig, 1893), p. 52 ff., and there also
   the part on the controversies and the history of the sects, p. 112 ff.,
   etc.; see especially the K.-Gesch. of Hergenröther. Gass, Symbolik, p.
   315 ff. Kattenbusch l.c. I., p. 467 ff., and the monograph by
   Schwarzlose, Der Bilderstreit, ein Kampf der griechischen Kirche um
   ihre Eigenart and ihre Freiheit, 1890.

   [578] But at the same time, some ranked the pictures much higher than
   exegesis, as is shown by the interesting letter of Bishop David of
   Mez-Kolmank on images and drawings to John Mairogomier (translated by
   Karapet, l.c., p. 52): . . . "This sect arose after the time of the
   Apostles, and first appeared among the Romans, wherefore a great Synod
   was held at Cæsarea, and the command was given to paint pictures in the
   House of God. These painters became arrogant, and sought to have their
   art placed above all other ecclesiastical arts. They said: "Our art is
   light, for, while few read the Holy Scriptures, it enlightens equally
   old and young." This and other passages by Armenius show, besides, that
   there were "iconoclastic heretics" long before the Emperor Leo. The
   Marcionites (Paulicians) also rejected pictures and crosses.

   [579] Schwarzlose (l.c., p. 36 ff.) has anew examined the origin of the
   controversy, in order to determine the external causes. But the matter
   has not yet been made clear. The following points fall to be
   considered. (1) Lesser reactions against the worship of images, which
   proceeded from the bosom of the Church even before the outbreak of the
   controversy, but which were only locally important. (2) Accusations by
   the Jews that the Christians ran counter to the prohibition of images
   in the Old Testament; the intervention of an Arabian Khalif, A.D. 723
   (Jezid II.), against the Christian worship of images and of Mary
   (influenced by Judaism?); influence of the Jews on Leo the Isaurian
   (?). (3) A theological iconoclastic party in Phrygia, gathered round
   the Bishop of Nacolia [on this Schwarzlose, as it seems to me rightly,
   lays particular stress]; this party perhaps took its stand on ancient
   Montanistic and Novatian reminiscences--the Paulicians are also said to
   have been inconoclasts; Leo's contact with the above party in his time
   of military service. (4) The resolve of the Emperors no longer to
   depend for support on the spiritual power of the Church, but on the
   army, yet on the other hand to perfect the imperial papacy--after the
   pattern of the Khalif: basileus kai hiereus eimi. Karapet, l.c., lays
   stress on the part played by Islam, but will have nothing to do with
   Jewish influences. The Emperor wished to play the same part as the
   Khalif.

   [581] On the external course of the controversy in detail, see
   Schwarzlose, l.c., p. 51 ff.

   [582] A passage from the works of Basil was especially important (di'
   eikonos he gnosis tou archetupou ginetai); but Funk (Quartalschr.,
   1888) has shown that while Basil certainly uttered this saying, his
   meaning was different from that of the later image-worshippers; by
   eikon he meant Christ himself to whom the worship passed.

   thoroughly the theology of the supporters of images. On the third of
   the Damascene's apologies, see l.c., p. 103 ff., on the spurious letter
   to the Emperor Theophilus, p. 109 ff.

   [586] Apparently this opinion is not yet sufficient. Following doubts
   already expressed by Semler, Rössler, Malfatti, and Duchesner,
   Schwarzlose (l. c., p. 113 ff.) has brought forward reasons worth
   considering for holding that Gregory's two letters in their present
   form cannot have come from the hand of Gregory II. Interpolations have
   been inserted by a Greek.

   [587] Schwarzlose (l.c., pp. 76-101) has well described the
   iconoclastic party and its whole system. "The iconoclasts rejected the
   religious use and adoration of pictures, because not only according to
   their view were they contrary to Scripture, tradition, and dogma, but
   also seduced the Church into heresy and heathenism."

   majority of the bishops were still adverse, and were supported by the
   army.

CHAPTER V.

  Appendix.--Sketch of the History of the Genesis of the Orthodox System.

   Origen had drawn up a system of Christian theology based on the four
   principles, God, the world, freedom, and Holy Scripture, and depending
   on the old Catholic Church doctrine. It is the only original scientific
   system ever produced by the Greek Church. The conception of a
   scientific system of truth is in itself philosophical; it has not come
   from religion which consists rather in faith in revelation. But the
   science of the time had conceded a lofty place within itself to this
   very belief in revelation, and, on the other hand, it was an innate
   instinct of the Christian faith to give an account of itself.

   Origen's undertaking and the manner in which he carried it out
   contained as many repellent as attractive features for his Christian
   contemporaries and the future. As a whole it held its ground only in
   the narrow circle of friends and followers; [601] but its effects were
   nevertheless incalculable. If Origen had recast the whole faith
   (Pistis) into a science (Gnosis) the immediate consequence, by no means
   intended by him, was that some of his gnostic (theological)
   propositions were introduced into the faith, and that conversely others
   were amended in accordance with the language of the antignostic
   Catholic Kerygma. The system was thus dislocated, and with good reason;
   for it was a system, simply because in spite of its scrupulous regard
   for the Bible, history, and freedom, it had transformed history into a
   natural process. In opposing the notoriously heterodox points of the
   system--the pre-existence of souls, pre-temporal fall of souls, eternal
   creation of the world, the doctrine of the transfigured body, and
   Apokatastasis--an attack was made, if not always consciously, on its
   principles which became conspicuous in these points. For the above
   doctrines were not appendages which could be deleted; they rather
   expressed most clearly the fundamental thought of the system, that God
   is all in all, and that the doctrine of the Church was dealing with
   wholly inadequate symbols in concerning itself with the conceptions of
   the creation of the world in time, the historical fall and redemption,
   the judgment, and a twofold final destiny. Men desired science, and
   there was, as in all ages, only one science; then it was simply that
   which Origen had represented. But at the same time none would abandon
   the traditional tenets as absolutely valid truths, partly in the
   interest of conservatism, partly because it was vaguely felt that
   scientific theology did not do justice to the distinctive character of
   Christian faith. That was the dilemma; but in one point all thinkers
   were agreed with Origen, viz., that the final aim of faith and of the
   theology accompanied by asceticism, was participation in the knowledge
   and consequently the life of the Deity. They were all intellectualists,
   even, so far as we are acquainted with them, the earliest opponents of
   Origen, including Methodius. [602] And theology brought about in the
   case of nearly all of them a loss to faith incalculable in its
   consequences--the fading of moral responsibility and of the conception
   of the judgment. No doubt the "Judgment" was maintained as before, and
   that against Origen; but the thought had lost and continued more and
   more to lose its all-commanding position in doctrine.

   At the beginning of the fourth century, [603] Christianity was, again
   in consequence of the theology, on the point of disruption. Eusebius
   has himself admitted the danger in the outward organisation, and it was
   a result of the cleavage in thought. Bishops spoke authoritatively in
   the East who had learned from Origen all sorts of ideas that put the
   doctrine of the Church in danger of running to seed. A compact school
   was in the field that, while it considered itself very scientific and
   genuinely biblical, yet without knowing or intending it, secularised
   Christianity. Constantine on the one hand, and Athanasius on the other,
   saved Christendom. Athanasius was no follower of Origen; he was more
   akin to Irenæus. In giving the central place to the thought of Christ's
   essential unity with God, and in carrying it out, he also set the
   theology of the future, as it seems, on a new, or rather on the old
   Irenæan basis. But he was no theologian, or, better, he ceased to be
   one from the moment when he perceived the central significance of the
   above conception of faith. He hardly touched, let alone solved, the
   problem of correlating it with all the other results of contemporary
   knowledge, with the whole of natural theology. He had enough to do in
   showing that a conception still alien, at any rate to the majority, and
   clothed in an unfamiliar word, was scriptural, traditional, and
   fundamental, and in obviating objections. A kind of system was rather
   constructed by the strict Arians--Aëtius and Eunomius--by means of
   Aristotelian philosophy. Every professed system up till past the middle
   of the fourth century was heterodox, with the sole exception of that of
   Marcellus; but while he made a bold front against the whole doctrine of
   Origen, he seemed to fall into long refuted errors. His fate itself
   proves that one thing, in whose assertion orthodox and Arians were
   agreed, was already inseparably bound up with the Christianity of the
   cultured, viz., the Neo-platonic doctrine of God and his revelation.
   The one party--the Arians--might supplement it with Aristotelianism,
   the other might give the widest scope to the conception of salvation
   embodied in Jesus Christ, but in the above fundamental thought both
   were agreed, and the common veneration of Origen is proof of this.
   [604] Cyril's catechisms show the procedure followed in the catechetic
   instruction of the cultured. They are based on the Symbol, and its
   separate points are proved from Scripture. Agreement with Scripture is
   sufficient; it also guarantees, so to speak, the unity, or, better, it
   suppresses the craving for strict unity. Revelation, as contained in
   the oracles of Scripture, was to satisfy all wants. The catechist did
   not indeed renounce rational argument in support of separate points of
   doctrine, but he did not offer anything like a system. On the other
   hand, traditionalism and the mysticism of the cultus were already
   strongly marked. Nor was the latter unconnected with Origen; on the
   contrary, no theologian of early times did so much to further it as he.

   The transference of Athanasius' thought into the scientific theology,
   i.e., into Origenism, was the work of the Cappadocians. Among them
   Gregory of Nyssa was the most thorough adherent of Origen. Though not
   without some reservations, yet it can be said that he represented the
   fundamental conception of Origen. [605] His "Great Catechism" is the
   only writing of the fourth century which can be compared to the work
   "De principiis"; but it contains a much narrower range of ideas, and is
   by no means, even in Gregory's own view, a complete work on dogma.
   [606] Next to the Cappadocians, Didymus of Alexandria is to be named as
   a disciple of Origen. It was of immense importance that, just before
   complete traditionalism settled on the Church, these men took up the
   cause of theological science in Origen's sense, further, that at this
   very time men were found in the West to communicate the views of the
   Cappadocians and Didymus to their native land, and, finally, that the
   Byzantine Church never ventured to condemn the works of the
   Cappadocians--of Gregory of Nyssa. The last is especially a fact which
   cannot fail to excite astonishment; but what would have been left to
   the Greek Church from the sixth century down, if to the condemned
   doctors of the Church and their writings we had further to add the main
   works of Gregory of Nyssa. Since, however, the Church has steadily
   acknowledged the orthodoxy of the Cappadocians, [607] Origen himself
   has after all been always looked at as only half a heretic. Up to the
   present day the members of the two Catholic Churches do not know
   exactly how they ought really to regard him. He has remained a thorn in
   the flesh of the Church.

   At the close of the fourth century it was settled that the dogmas of
   the Trinity and the Incarnation constituted the faith; for they were
   most intimately connected, and the former was fixed in terms of the
   Incarnation. The great Apollinaris, a systematic theologian and besides
   an opponent of Origen's method, and the Cappadocians established this
   conviction. By this means an immense gain was made on the one hand, but
   on the other not much; for what good did it do to confess these
   doctrines, as long as it was possible by means of philosophy to furnish
   very different versions of them, or while the infinite number of other
   tenets, which fell within the range of theology and required absolutely
   to be discussed in terms of the Symbol or of Holy Scripture, were
   destitute of any fixed form? We must again, or, rather still conceive
   the state of matters during the whole of the fourth century on to its
   close as being mutatis mutandis the same as when Gnosticism flourished,
   though a consensus of opinion was not wanting in the Church. There was
   no recognised conception of the nature of the Incarnation, after the
   bold and sanguine attempt of Apollinaris had been rejected as
   heretical, and the hundred and one "doctrines" which floated round the
   Trinitarian and Christological dogma were as fickle and uncertain as
   the waves of the sea. It was not known what belonged to the "faith",
   whether to include psychology, or natural science. Everything offered
   itself, and nothing could be declared indifferent without danger; it
   was uncertain, too, in what form it did belong to faith. No one knew
   how the Bible was to be interpreted, whether literally, or typically,
   or spiritually; no form of interpretation could be wholly accepted or
   wholly rejected. It was not known what was to be expected in a future
   state; and as much doubt prevailed about the beginning as about the end
   of things. Conceptions still existed of God, the earth, heaven, Christ,
   the glories of Paradise and the horrors of the judgment, like those
   prevalent among the old "Saints" of the second century, and they were
   firmly held with less sanctity, but the same fanaticism, by the new
   saints, the monks.

   On the other hand, both among monks and others, conceptions existed
   such as Origen cherished from which the many-coloured pictures and
   dramatic scenes had disappeared: men believed in eternal worlds, the
   original affinity of the human spirit with God, in the one unfolding
   itself into the many, and the many necessarily returning into the one.
   And in the fourth century Christians, and even clerics, went beyond
   Origen. To them the coverings and masks into which he had transformed
   the realistic doctrines of the Church were still more transparent. A
   man was now a Christian because every one was or was becoming one; but
   he would not cease being a philosopher. It was hardly necessary to come
   to terms with the doctrine of the Trinity, for, one or two points being
   set aside, it was held to be correct, rational, and Platonic. The
   Incarnation caused greater difficulty, but the Cappadocians themselves
   had shown how it could be under-stood rationally. A still further step
   was taken; the humanity assumed by God was dealt with in a free and
   easy manner. Speculation found plenty of expedients by which to pare
   down the paradox and to reduce it to the level of the intelligible. But
   once one had formulated, somehow or other, his assent to the Trinity
   and Incarnation he was really free and could apply Greek learning
   (Hellenike paideia) as much as he pleased to Christian truth,
   interpreting its myths. [608] Moreover, there were Christianised
   philosophers who succeeded by an artifice in uniting the sublimest
   spiritualism with superstition; they inculcated a ritualistic immanence
   of the pneumatic in material, if consecrated, things, and transformed
   the whole world and history into a descending series of types and
   symbols, which appeared at the same time as effective vehicles of the
   divine. Creation was the evolution of the one into a world of ideas,
   symbols and types--every potency being the copy of a higher, and the
   pattern for a lower one; and redemption was completed in the mysteries
   of thought and the cultus, which led from type to type, from potency to
   potency, up to the all-embracing One. Thus Iamblichus had taught;
   Neoplatonic philosophers of the fourth and fifth centuries followed
   him, and as they were in a position to conserve heathen mythologies and
   cults by this view, Christians transferred the conception and method to
   Christianity. To them the Incarnation no longer appeared as an isolated
   paradox; it was a special instance, or the verification, or necessary
   result, of the cosmical process. The great Unknown, who probably
   belonged to Alexandria, and who is called Pseudo-Dionysius, "in an
   elaborate conception of the world, smuggled into the Greek Church and
   its theology the Neoplatonism into which the other doctors of the
   Church had only dipped timidly, (?) and on this foundation he
   constructed his theory of the heavenly hierarchy, and its copy, the
   hierarchy of the Church." [609] Dionysius seems to be a realist in the
   sense of the Church; he lets everything realistic stand; but it is all
   in fact simply a wrapping; nothing is and nothing happens which is not
   self-evolved in the process of the Cosmos. At the same time it is
   unmistakable that, though the form by which it is expressed is not
   satisfactory, the nature of the good is perceived--it consists in inner
   union with God. [610] It was of inexpressible importance that from and
   after the sixth century the writings of the Unknown, which also
   betrayed the influence of Aristotle, were held to be the works of an
   Apostolic personage. Neoplatonism and the mysticism of the Cultus were
   thus declared to be part of classic Christianity.

   The representatives of the "common sense" of the Church at the end of
   the fourth century were quite aware of the heterodoxies which existed
   in spite of, and side by side with, the confession of the Trinity and
   Incarnation; some of them indeed were themselves not content with the
   generally received doctrine. They desired a God with eyes, ears and
   limbs, a resurrection of the identical body, and a visible glorious
   kingdom of Christ at the end of the world. Even an exceedingly cultured
   exegete like Apollinaris made common cause with them in the last point.
   A founder was sought for heterodoxies; it was impossible to blame
   Manichæism for everything. Hellenike paideia was held to be the
   culprit, and therefore also Origen, the man who was said, not without
   reason, to have introduced it into Christian theology. A passionate
   opposition was raised in Egypt among the Scetian monks, and in
   Palestine where Origen had many admirers. It was, above all, the narrow
   but honest Epiphanius who saw in Origen the father of Arianism and many
   other heresies. The comprehensive chapter against him in the former's
   Panarion (H. 64) is the first polemical writing we possess of
   ecclesiastical traditionalism against Origen; it is by no means
   unskilful; it does not confine itself to details, but disputes e
   fundamento the title to a place in the Church of a theology such as
   Origen offered. [611] The "Expositio fidei catholicæ ecclesiæ" appended
   to the Panarion shows, indeed, the complete inability of Epiphanius to
   give an account of the faith; it loses itself as usual in irrelevant
   discussions, and the positive contents are extraordinarily scanty. But
   the attack on Origen (compare also the somewhat earlier "Ancorates")
   opened the first great controversy over the question whether scientific
   theology as understood by Origen was legitimate or not. Walch has
   described the history of this controversy with his usual thoroughness.
   It is acknowledged how disagreeably the action of Epiphanius disturbed
   the circle of Origen's monkish admirers, who were congregated in
   Palestine under the protection of the like-minded John, Bishop of
   Jerusalem. The dream that one might be both a pillar of the Church and
   a theologian like Origen was dissipated. Jerome preferred to remain a
   pillar and to abandon Origen. After his desertion and his betrayal of
   his friend Rufinus, he became the father of the "science of the
   Church." To some extent he is a type of this "science" up to the
   present day. It lives on fragments of the men whom it declares to be
   heretics. It accepts just as much from them as circumstances permit,
   and retains of the old what it can maintain with decency. It cultivates
   a little literalness, a little allegory, and a little typology. It
   attacks all questions with a parade of freedom from prejudice; but
   anything inconvenient it surrounds with a thousand invented
   difficulties. It is proud of its free-thought in matters of no
   importance, and hides itself finally, when hot pressed, behind a brazen
   stare. It characterises its friends as "well-disposed", homines boni,
   and slanders its opponents. Where evasion is no longer possible, it
   states the inexorable historical fact as a major premise; to this it
   adds a minor taken from its prejudices, and then it solves the
   syllogistic problem by the aid of piquant conceits. [612] It can be
   incredibly frivolous and again pedantically learned, just as it suits.
   Only one question does not occur in its catechism, and it is always
   hard to drive it home, viz., what is historical truth? That is the
   science of--Jerome.

   Epiphanius' breach with John led to the intervention of the Alexandrian
   Bishop Theophilus, who, at the time, still refused to yield to the
   "anthropomorphists", and adhered to Origen's party. Rome also took part
   in the dispute which, settled as between the bishops, broke out anew
   between the two scholars. Rufinus was only able to defend Origen's
   orthodoxy by the doubtful assumption that "heretics" had corrupted his
   works But that helped neither him nor Origen. Origen was condemned and
   Rufinus censured in Rome in A.D. 399 by the ignorant Anastasius. The
   errors charged against Origen (see Hieron. ad Pammach.) were, a
   subordinationist doctrine of the Trinity, the doctrine of the
   preexistence of souls and their condemnation to enter into bodies, the
   view of the future conversion of the devil and the demons, the
   interpretation of the skins in Gen. III. to mean the body, the
   spiritualising of the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, the
   explanation of Paradise as spiritual, and the too extensive use of the
   allegorical method, etc. Not only, however, did Rome renounce Origen,
   but Alexandria also. Theophilus saw that his power in Egypt would be
   shaken if he did not rely upon the masses of stupid and fanatical
   Coptic monks, the anthropomorphists, in whose circles a material God
   was defended in doggerel rhymes, and the ancient apocalyptic literature
   was greedily read. Theophilus wheeled round, abandoned, and that with
   strong personal feeling, the admirers of Origen among the monks, and,
   with the approval of Rome, hurled his anathemas against him. Jerome,
   ever on the alert to blot out the stain that attached to him from
   having once venerated the great theologian, translated into Latin
   Theophilus' slanderous Easter epistle against Origenism, although he
   must have seen through its calumnies. In Constantinople, however, the
   fight waged by Theophilus against his former friends, the Nitrian
   monks, was followed by that agitation of which Chrysostom was a victim.
   It was the first violent attempt of the Alexandrian Patriarch, who by
   his alliance with the masses had won a secure position in his own
   diocese, to get possession of the Constantinopolitan patriarchate, the
   capital, and whole Church of the East.

   Meanwhile it was only in the West that the influence of Origen was
   really deeply shaken by these endeavours. Jerome persuaded the Western
   Church that Origen was the father of Pelagianism; Vincentius of Lerinum
   held him up as an example along with Apollinaris and other heretics;
   Leo I. considered him a heretic, and Gelasius insisted that Jerome's
   criticism should be maintained in dealing with his works. [613]
   Orthodoxy held its ground unshaken as regards all the points of
   doctrine touching on the dogmas of the Trinity and Incarnation, which
   in the West were hardly ever subjects of controversy. Jerome now became
   the standard theologian and exegete. Everything ancient and
   distinctive, even where it did not lie in the direction of Origenism,
   disappeared more and more in the West. The Western Church became the
   Church of Jerome; but it became also--to its lasting benefit--the
   Church of Augustine (see Vol. V.).

   It was different in the East. The transformation of the controversy
   about Origen into a conflict between two great Patriarchs, in which
   Origen was soon lost sight of, and the rehabilitation, belated indeed,
   of Chrysostom, favoured the impugned reputation of the great
   theologian. But even apart from this, his influence was too deeply
   rooted to be upset by a single bishop, no matter how powerful. His
   individuality represented the Hellenike paideia, with which men would
   not dispense. They were willing to recognise the dogma of the Church,
   i.e., the doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation; but they sought
   besides freedom to interest themselves in (theological) science. The
   Church History of Socrates shows the undiminished influence of
   Origen--see above Vol. III., p. 146 and elsewhere; even before
   Socrates, the celebrated Evagrius of Pontus had sturdily defended him,
   and Sozomen himself, monkish and narrow as he was, was no opponent of
   Origen. The outbreak of the Nestorian and Monophysite controversies as
   to the nature of the Incarnation soon thrust everything else into the
   background, and procured for Origen's cause a temporary peace.

   It is fitting that we should here take a glance at the Patriarchate of
   Antioch and its neighbouring territories. The circumstances there were
   wholly peculiar. The East swarmed with old and new sects. All sorts
   betook themselves thither, and,. beside the official Christianity only
   to be met with in Greek cities, there existed an assortment of the most
   varied Christian communions. Even in the fifth century the Bishops had
   to face conflicts there which had almost died out in Rome, Byzantium,
   and Alexandria, as early as the third century. Therefore the Bishops
   living in or sprung from that quarter still possessed the lofty
   conviction that they were constantly fighting the battles of the Lord,
   and hastening from victory to victory. Nestorius, Theodoret, and others
   plume themselves in their correspondence with their Western brethren on
   their merits as antagonists of heretics; [614] even Chrysostom was
   their inexorable enemy. As a matter of fact, the continuance of these
   conflicts was of vast consequence to the whole Church. Gnosticism and
   Manicheism dogged the steps of the Eastern Bishops, and compelled them
   to adhere strictly to the ancient regula fidei with its antignostic
   impress. They could not, as in Alexandria and Constantinople, confine
   their interest to the Incarnation. They had to defend the doctrine,
   point by point, in its whole extent,. and were thus prevented from
   casting themselves into the arms of one transcendent idea. They were
   pious after the monkish fashion, like the Egyptians; nay, their Bishops
   outdid those of Egypt in asceticism; they were not less realistic in
   what belonged to the Cultus than the rest; they were as much to the
   front when it was necessary to defend an old doctrine. But their
   scientific theologians--Palestine stands by itself--were not followers
   of Origen, and in their fights with heretics they could not use his
   teaching. They used a more liberal and, again, a more rational, a less
   flighty, exegesis, and a sober philosophy. Both these were given them
   by Lucian, and it was, lastly, one and the same school which extended
   from Lucian to Theodoret, and stretched far beyond the latter into the
   Christian schools of the Persian kingdom.

   The character and significance of this school have been discussed above
   in various chapters--see especially Vol. III., ch. 3. It sharply
   contested Origen's hermeneutics, but did not vilify the great man. Its
   own exegetical and biblical-theological method, with some admirable
   features, indeed, omitted, and a little of the literal and allegorical
   added, gradually became, in consequence of its appropriateness and
   thanks to the influence of Chrysostom, the ruling one. And the use of
   Aristotelian philosophy in the Antiochene school was an indication for
   the future. But the ablest of the Antiochenes finally came under
   censure on account of his Christology, and, over and above his
   Christology, he was charged with various heresies, especially
   Pelagianism. In fact, his whole system, and he possessed a system to a
   greater extent than any other after Origen, was a rational one; it was
   natural theology without any transcendentalism. He is therefore a
   source of great difficulty to the Church up to the present time; it
   declines to go further in condemning him than the fifth Council, indeed
   it only recognises conditionally the censure of the "chapters".
   Theodoret's work is without the boldness of Theodore, his anthropology
   and his doctrine of grace as well as his Christology approximating to
   the traditional teaching. Among other things, he appended to his
   compendium of heretical fables a fifth book, "theion dogmaton epitme"
   (an epitome of divine dogmas), which must be described as the first
   attempt at a system after Origen, and which apparently exercised great
   influence on John of Damascus. This "epitome" has a lofty significance.
   It combines the Trinitarian and Christological dogma with the whole
   circle of the doctrines connected with the symbol. It reveals an
   attitude as markedly biblical as it is ecclesiastical and rational. It
   throughout observes the "just mean". It is almost complete, the Last
   Supper being omitted, and it especially takes realistic Eschatology
   once more into account. [615] It has adopted none of the obnoxious
   doctrines of Origen, and yet he himself is not treated as a heretic.
   [616] An actual system this epitome is not; but the consistent sobriety
   and lucidity in the discussion of details, and the careful biblical
   proof lend to the whole a stamp of unity. It could not yet indeed give
   satisfaction, firstly, because of the personality of its author, and,
   secondly, because there was an entire absence of mysticism and
   Neoplatonism from his doctrinal conception.

   In the second half of the fifth century everyone was occupied with the
   decree of Chalcedon. Cyril of Alexandria, the Christologian whom
   bishops and monks had understood best, had to reconquer his whole
   influence side by side with the creed of Chalcedon. The only two great
   theologians whom the Eastern Church has possessed--Origen and Theodore,
   the former a follower of Plato, the latter of Aristotle, both
   biblicists though in very different ways,--were discredited, but not
   condemned. It was on the soil of Palestine, and among the monks there,
   that admiration for Origen came into collision with that for Theodore.
   We are well informed as to the living spiritual movements in the
   cloisters of Palestine at the beginning of the sixth century. Origenism
   experienced a regular renaissance, although it had never died out.
   [617] Its "peculiar doctrines", which had sprung from rational
   mysticism, were in particular taken up again, or at least declared to
   be arguable. The Cappadocians were appealed to in support of their
   validity. Origenism was defended under very different shades. There was
   an extreme right, and even pillars of orthodoxy were found on this
   side, [618] and there was a left, which surpassed even Origen in
   daring. He led some of his admirers over to the Areopagite and the
   Neo-Platonists. The works of the Unknown were brought out, studied,
   and, as it appears, edited. Some went the length of undisguised
   Pantheism, like Stephen bar Sudaili, or the author of the book of
   Hierotheus, "On the hidden mysteries of the Deity." [619] No Gnostic of
   the second century had erected a nihilistic philosophy on the ground of
   Christianity so boldly as this writer. [620]

   But the admirers of Origen met with opponents in Palestine, not only
   among the dull herd of monks and the traditionalists, but also among
   the adherents of the sober science and Christology of Theodore of
   Mopsuestia. And, in addition, there was rising up a new power,
   Aristotelian scholasticism, which took possession of the monophysite as
   well as the orthodox dogma, but only concluded a firm alliance with the
   latter, through Leontius, the great opponent of Nestorianism and of
   Theodore--see above, p. 232 f. The Antiochene school was smitten with
   its own weapons. The great dogmas of the Church, hallowed by age,
   seemed to receive their sanction from the re-invigorated rated
   Aristotelianism, because they were peculiarly adapted for dialectical
   treatment. Thus the age of Justinian shows the Church of the East in a
   state of the liveliest spiritual agitation. All the great powers of the
   past, Neoplatonist and Aristotelianism, Origen and Theodore, were again
   living forces; a new combination was drawing near, and all efforts to
   stifle by conciliar decrees the living spirit in the Church seemed to
   have been vain. But the movements were but limited in extent and
   energy; the "new combination" was in truth the death of real science--a
   thinking which started in the middle of its subject, and for which that
   which was alone worth reflection was held to be beyond the range of
   discussion. Trifling monks, who excommunicated and denounced each
   other, talked big; and there sat at Constantinople an emperor who,
   himself a theologian, thirsted for the fame of creating a uniform
   science as well as a uniform belief. The dispute of the Palestinian
   monks and the scholasticism of a theologian like Leontius gave him his
   chance. The Emperor did not need to publish an edict requiring the
   followers of Origen and Theodore to annihilate one another; they took
   care of that for themselves. The spectacle of the two "sciences", of
   Origen and the Antiochenes, tearing each other to pieces, in the age of
   Justinian, has something tragi-comical about it, recalling the tale of
   the two lions. The fifth Council confirmed this, after the Emperor had
   himself, in his epistle to Mennas, declared, and Vigilius--with other
   Patriarchs--had repeated, the condemnation of Origen. The fifteen
   anathemas against Origen, [621] on which his condemnation at the
   Council was based, contained the following points. (1) The preexistence
   of souls and Apokatastasis; (2) the doctrine of the upper world of
   spirits, their original equality, and their fall; (3) the view that
   sun, moon, and stars belonged to this world of spirits, and had also
   fallen; (4) the doctrine that the differences in the bodies of the
   spirits was a consequence of this fall; (5) the opinion that the higher
   spirits become lower ones, or men, and vice versâ; (6) Origen's
   doctrine of creation, and that it was not accomplished by the Trinity;
   (7) the Christology which taught that Christ became for all grades of
   spirits--each in its own form--that which he had become for men through
   the Incarnation, so that he assumed different bodies and received
   different names; (8) the contention that the Logos was only to be
   called Christ by a misuse of language (katachristikos), that
   accordingly a distinction was to be drawn between them; (9) the opinion
   that not the Logos, but a creaturely mind (nous) which he had assumed
   became man; (10) the assertion of the spherical and ethereal form of
   the resurrection-body, and of the annihilation of the material body;
   (11) the interpreting of the judgment to mean this annihilation, and
   the view that at the end of the world there would only exist
   non-material nature (spirit); (12) the view that the Logos united with
   every man and spirit as he had done with the vouc he had assumed:
   heresy of the Isochristians who appealed to Origen, see, besides,
   Methodius; (13) the assertion of the similarity of the nous, called
   Christ, to all other rational beings; (14) the view of the ultimate
   cessation of all plurality of persons and of multiplicity of knowledge
   (gnosis), the doctrine of reversion to unity and of apokatastasis; (15)
   the view of the identity of the pretemporal with the final life of
   spirits.

   Since the "Three Chapters" were condemned at the same time, Origen and
   Theodore were both got rid of. [622] The latter found more energetic
   defenders than the former; but the majority of his admirers held aloof.
   The fact that the Augustinian West took up his cause best shows that we
   must not over-value this championship. The condemnation of the
   "peculiar doctrines" of Origenism meant much more. Henceforth buoys
   were laid down, which marked off the Neo-platonic channel in which men
   moved under the guidance of the "apostolic" Dionysius. Origen's
   doctrines of the consummation, and of spirits and matter might no
   longer be maintained. The judgment was restored to its place, and got
   back even its literal meaning. The mysticism of the Cultus was carried
   continually further; it received a new impetus; but it adhered much
   more closely to tradition. The anti-gnostic regula fidei was finally
   restored, and the great cultus-mystic of the seventh century not only
   respected it, but worked within its lines. Maximus Confessor held the
   same relation to the Areopagite, as did the Cappadocians to Origen, and
   Theodoret to Theodore. [623] But he was not only a mystic; he was also
   a scholastic and dialectician. There were no longer any theologians who
   reflected independently "de principiis." God, the world, freedom,
   Christ, and Scripture were no longer the first principles, but,
   instead, the fixed doctrines regarding them drawn from tradition.
   Science took for granted the foundations guarded by the Church, and
   passing to the upper story went on building there. A latent free
   thought, indeed, still remained. If everything was symbolical and
   figurative, then, no matter how closely the spiritual might be combined
   with the material, the idea could not perish that the theologian who
   was in a position to grasp the subject matter did not require figures.
   While mysticism and scholasticism might not shrink from a figurative
   philosophy in the most daring sense of the term, they could not stifle
   the view that took every sort of figure and all history as a covering,
   nor could they blame the self-criticism of the Christian who was
   ashamed of being confined in this body. [624]

   For learning (mathesis) the Cappadocians (the two Gregorys, next to
   them Athanasius and Cyril) were regarded as the principal authorities;
   for mystagogy (mustagogia), the Areopagite and Maximus; for philosophy,
   Aristotle; and for homiletics (homilia), Chrysostom. The man, however,
   who embraced all that, who had transferred the scholastic dialectic
   method, which had been brought by Leontius to bear on the dogma of the
   Incarnation, to the whole sphere of the "divine dogma" as that had been
   fixed by Theodoret, was John of Damascus. Through him the Greek Church
   gained the orthodox system, but not the Greek Church alone. John's work
   was no less important to the West. [625] "He was the cope-stone of
   antiquity and the transition to a new age, because his writings,
   translated into Latin, became confessedly a foundation of the mediæval
   theology of the West." He was above all a scholastic. To him each
   difficulty was but an incitement to split up notions artificially, and
   to find a new one to which nothing in the world corresponds except that
   very difficulty which the new notion was meant to remove. John even put
   the fundamental question of mediæval science, that as to nominalism and
   realism; and he solved it by a modified Aristotelianism. All doctrines
   were in his view given already; he took them from findings of the
   Councils and the works of recognised Fathers. He held it to be the task
   of science to edit them. In this way the two chief dogmas were
   introduced into the circle of the doctrines of the old antignostically
   interpreted Symbol. A very modest use was made of the allegorical
   explanation of Holy Scripture. The letter ruled wholesale, at any rate
   much more thoroughly than in the case of the Cappadocians. In
   consequence of this, natural theology was shut out from sight; it was
   hedged round by extremely realistic Bible narratives confidingly
   accepted. [626] But the most serious fact was that the close connection
   which in Athanasius, Apollinaris, and Cyril of Alexandria had united
   the Trinity and Incarnation, or dogma in general, with the thought of
   salvation, was completely loosened. This process had begun with the
   Council of Chalcedon, and John had a mass of dogmas which it was
   necessary to believe; but they had ceased to be clearly subordinate to
   a uniform conception of their purpose. The object which dogma once
   served as the means remained; but the means had changed. Instead of
   dogma, we have the Cultus, the mysteries, into which Book IV. enters
   (IV. 17-25 are to be regarded as appendices). In consequence of this
   the system is destitute of inner vital unity. [627] It is really not an
   account of faith, but of its presuppositions, and its unity depends on
   the form of treatment, the high antiquity of its doctrine, and Holy
   Scripture. The dogmas had become the sacred inheritance from the
   classic antiquity of the Church, but they had, as it were, fallen to
   the ground. The worship of images, mysticism, and scholasticism ruled
   the Church. The two latter bore much fair fruit in after times; for the
   spirit which strives towards God cannot be stifled by anything, and is
   capable even of constructing a restricted science. But the history of
   dogma came to an end in the Greek Church a thousand years ago, and its
   reanimation cannot easily be conceived. A reformation could only set in
   in the cultus. The adoption of a few Catholic or Protestant
   theologumena in later catechisms and books of doctrine has hitherto
   been without effect, and will in the future hardly obtain any.

   Independent theology had been extinguished in the churches of the East;
   but alongside these churches there arose all the more energetically,
   from the seventh century, the sects, old enemies in new forms,
   Marcionites (as Paulicians) and Manichæans, and in addition many other
   curious bodies, the necessary products of religious movements among
   tribes falling into barbarism, and but little trained by the Church. On
   the shaping of the dogmas of the Church these sects exerted not the
   slightest influence; and for that very reason they do not belong to the
   history of dogma. [628]

   Again, this history has nothing to say about the scientific life of the
   Byzantine Church, or the many theories and disputes which arose out of
   it, and, on the other hand, from mystical speculations; for all that
   had little or no effect on dogma. No doubt an isolated theological
   question was decided at this or that Synod; or individual theologians
   elaborated in a praise-worthy fashion theological conceptions, as e.g.,
   in reference to the crucifixion of Christ, atonement, and substitution;
   no doubt another rather important dispute--the Hesychastic
   controversy--agitated the Church in the fourteenth century; but dogma,
   and to some extent the Church itself, remained ultimately unaffected.
   For centuries the intellectual work of the Church consisted in the
   development of Church legislation, and its theologians either wrote on
   exegesis, history, and biography, following traditional patterns, or
   composed ascetic books.

   Finally, to the history of dogma belongs neither the development of the
   schism with the West, nor the silent process, in which the Eastern
   Church has taken over, since the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, a
   great deal from the ecclesiastically more vigorous West. Apart from the
   "filioque" discussed above, the development of the schism was not
   determined by dogmatic factors, and the silent process [629] which
   lasted up to the end of the seventeenth century, and to which the
   Church owes, e.g., the settling of its Canon of the Bible, the doctrine
   of the seven sacraments, a kind of doctrine of transubstantiation, a
   more certain doctrine of purgatory, development of the doctrines of sin
   and grace, a more sharply defined theory and practice of the sacrament
   of penance etc., has come to an end at a time when we have accurate
   knowledge, and will perhaps never be fully explained. The only definite
   dogmatic interests shown in it are anti-protestant.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [601] Theognostus, Origen's disciple, made a new attempt at
   constructing a system, see Vol. III., p. 96.

   [602] Besides him the earliest opponents--after Demetrius--were Peter
   of Alexandria and Eustathius of Antioch. Pamphilus and Eusebius wrote
   against Origen's enemies.

   [603] See the details in Vol. III., pp. 121-162.

   [604] On Arians and orthodox, see Chap. I.

   [605] The reservations are, certainly, not unimportant. If Gregory also
   shared Origen's starting-point, viz., the antithesis of the spiritually
   divine and the sensuous, yet he had a more distinct grasp of the notion
   of creation, and attempted to understand the sensuous as a necessary
   side of human nature. Finally, however, he also regards the whole
   development explored by Christian theology as a cosmical process; only
   the process does not appear so manifest as in Origen, who besides had
   also, judging from Clement of Alex., introduced ideas alien to it.

   [606] Everything in the "Great Catechism" is rational. The author
   begins by expounding the doctrine of the Trinity as the just mean
   between Jewish monotheism and heathen polytheism. He also shows that it
   occurs in the Old Testament (c. 1-4). Then follows the account of the
   doctrine of the Incarnation (c. 5-32), which forms the subject proper
   of the Catechism. It is treated from the most varied sides; the reason,
   nature, and result of the incarnation are discussed. It is proved from
   the essential attributes of God as well as the state of men; and it is
   shown that on the one hand it corresponds to the goodness, justice,
   wisdom, and power of God, and on the other presupposes the condition of
   evil, death, and freedom in man. Christ became man for all, but he is
   the physician only for the virtuous. The old question why he appeared
   so late is also (c. 29) discussed. The conclusion is taken up with
   expositions of Baptism, the Last Supper, and faith, which constitute
   the new birth, i.e., virtuous life (c. 33-40). Origen's conceptions,
   though grouped round a new centre in that of Athanasius, run through
   the whole; this is still more conspicuous in some of the other writings
   by the same author.

   [607] The Cappadocians were always held to be the foremost among
   theologians. Thus Theodore of Studion says (Antirrhet II. adv. Iconom.,
   p. 123, edit. Sirmond.): kai de akousometha ton koruphaiotaton pateron,
   Gregoriou men tou theologou . . . Basileiou de tou megalou, and of the
   former (Iamb. 67, p. 766): Bronthon ta theia te boe ton dogmaton,
   Echesas ontos ten hupouranion, makar; Kai pasas aprix moranas tas
   haireseis, Ton kosmon esterixas en tois sois logois. From the sixth
   century Gregory of Nyssa put his admirers in a precarious position by
   his manifestly heterodox doctrines. They were hushed up; yet their
   author is not placed by the Greeks of to-day on quite the same high
   level as Basilius and Gregory of Nazianzus.

   [608] Nothing is more instructive here than the study of the noble
   Synesius. Thousands must have held the same views as he at the
   transition from the fourth to the fifth century; but few possessed the
   honesty of this Bishop or the clearness of his mind; see above all his
   letter to his brother Euoptius, when confronted by the question whether
   he should or should not accept the bishopric offered him. He was then
   still a Neoplatonist, and, though he afterwards modified his views to
   some extent, he never ceased to be one. But he openly declared that
   while he would not give up science, he would accept outwardly the
   mythical wrapping (ta d' exo philomuthon), since the people did not
   endure the clear light.--Even at the end of the fourth century, Church
   Fathers found it necessary to oppose the idea first broached by Celsus,
   that Christ had borrowed from Plato.

   [609] Steitz, Jahrhb. XI., p. 195.

   [610] On the system of Dionysius, see Steitz l.c., pp. 197-229. The
   fundamental thought of Dionysius is the absolute transcendence of God;
   but God is to him, at the same time, absolute causality; as causality
   he still stands outside of the world (the many), but yet the forces
   emanating from him can on the other hand be regarded as a
   self-reduplication (pollaplasiazesthai). Thus the attempt was made to
   combine the thought of the transcendence of the One with Pantheism.
   This One is force and movement in virtue of the eros (agape) dwelling
   in it, and thus it issues from itself in order to return to itself.
   This emanation, however, is identical with the fixing of proorismoi and
   paradeigmata; i.e., the finite conceived as pure forms exists from
   eternity in God himself, nay, treated and conceived as one, it is
   himself. In him and belonging to him the forces are always immaterial,
   undivided, identical. From the standpoint of God, accordingly, the
   whole process of the world is simply pure self-movement; but viewed
   from beneath it is one of unfolding, division, and descent, and again
   of ascent, unification, and return to the One. We must always maintain
   both, rest and movement, transcendence and immanence, unity and
   multiplicity. To this correspond the kataphatic and the apophatic
   theologies. The former descends from God to things in order from the
   effects to draw conclusions as to the absolute, inexhaustible, nature
   of the One. The latter rises from things to God, in order to deny
   regarding him all that may be conceived, and to find him exalted above
   the antithesis of error and truth, of not-being and being. The latter
   is to Dionysius the more appropriate, but the two methods ought not to
   contradict each other; for the Deity is placed even above the
   antithesis formed by the statements of the apophatic and kataphatic
   theology. In his fifth Epistle, Dionysius says (I., p. 594, ed.
   Corder): ho theios gnophos esti to aprositon phos--how often since that
   has been repeated by mystics!--en ho katoikein ho Theos legetai; kai
   aorato ge onti dia ten huperechousan phanoteta kai aprosito to auto dia
   ten uperbolen tes huperousiou photochusias, en touto gignetai pas ho
   Theon gnonai kai idein axioumenos auto to me horan mede ginoskein,
   alethos en to huper horasin kai gnosin gignomenos. The thought of God's
   transcendence was the decisive point. To the unmoved mover every
   spirit, nay, everything in its own way strives to rise. "A nameless
   longing passes through all the veins of nature;" God himself comes not
   nearer but men can force themselves up to him. Evil consists in being
   separated from hum; it is a pure negation; it does not exist in
   relation to God for it is a negative in the sphere of the many, which
   yet in view of God constitute a non-material unity: it is the
   unnatural, that which does not correspond to the nature of the various
   beings and things, each taken in its distinctive character. In so far
   as these are, they are good; but in so far as they are not what they
   ought to be, they contain evil in themselves. It remains obscure,
   however, how they cannot he what they ought. Is it due to the
   multiplication in itself, or to an unknown hindrance? In any case the
   good is union with God. At this point begins the most characteristic
   work of Dionysius, its mystical and scholastic feature. This union,
   like everything else, has its stages; it is consummated by
   purification, illumination, and perfecting. As the sun dispels
   darkness, then fills everything with light, and brings it to
   perfection, so also does the Deity. And everything in the Cosmos
   contributes to this process; it is the object and agent of redemption;
   it is a universe of symbols which lead to God, but which cannot be
   entirely transcended in this world; for we only see through a mirror in
   a dark saying. The process itself is no pure process of thought;
   thinking is only its accompaniment; it is a process of the action of
   being upon being; therefore the symbol and the rite which offer
   themselves to the feeling of the soul that is passive and yields itself
   up to them. Accordingly we have, at the close, the passive intuition,
   in which man no longer participates in anything external, is no longer
   conscious of anything positive, but negativing all things, loses
   himself in the inscrutable. Yet there is no negation from which it
   would not be necessary to separate the Deity by a huper; the
   imagination must cast anchor before the portals of the inscrutable and
   incomprehensible. The purifying, illuminating, and perfecting rites are
   imparted to men by the heavenly and ecclesiastical hierarchies. But
   between these and the Deity Dionysius has placed the Church doctrines
   of the Trinity and the Incarnation. The former has been outwardly
   treated orthodoxly on the whole, yet in such a way that it after all
   merely assumes the form of a Trinity in revelation i i.e., the persons
   are regarded as the first stages in the multiplication of the Deity
   which is continued in the heavenly hierarchy; however, this way of
   looking at the matter is disguised from view. As regards the
   Incarnation, the system has naturally no room for it; for regard for
   the transcendence of the Deity prevents it from recognising any
   incarnation, and in consequence of his immanence the whole process of
   the Cosmos itself is the materialising and manifestation of the Deity
   in the world. Yet the Incarnation is maintained; but, since this was
   impossible, it is not made the central point, but serves as the
   foundation of various speculations, and the illustration of valuable
   thoughts. The result of the Incarnation in Jesus is conceived as a
   raising of human nature to its highest power, and not properly as a
   fusion of two natures (yet we have the expression: kaine theandrike
   energeia); for even in the manifestation of Jesus the Deity remains
   concealed and incomprehensible. Like all symbols and phenomena the
   Incarnation is in a certain sense a disguising of the Deity. With Jesus
   Dionysius also connects a few realistic Church doctrines as to
   redemption, victory over the demons, and theogenesia; but the
   Incarnation really is the representation of God's unfolding of himself
   in general. As regards the actual redemption of individuals the main
   stress is placed in this system on the two hierarchies and the
   mysteries. These hierarchies are genuinely Neo-platonic. The heavenly
   was formed by the graded choirs of angels (Triads, see Vol. III., Chap.
   4) which themselves consecrated severally by the higher, consecrate
   severally the lower; the historical Christ even had his place among
   them. The ecclesiastical hierarchy consisted of the bishops, priests,
   and deacons; and the means which acted from beneath upwards were the
   six mysteries (see Chap. IV.). In the work on the ecclesiastical
   hierarchy these mysteries are minutely explained. Every openly
   heterodox opinion is, as generally, once more avoided. "The Areopagite
   has given the Church an exposition of all the mystic rites, such as it
   had not possessed till then, in which every act of the cultus has its
   peculiar, deeper reference and secret meaning. His exposition attaches
   itself in form to Christian dogma, and could therefore serve as a
   pattern to the Church theologians of the following centuries. As
   regards the matter, indeed, the case is different; for the Christian
   dogmas themselves merely appear as the dress of Neo-platonic ideas, to
   which the inflexible form offers a stubborn resistance."

   [611] H. 64 c. 73; Su, Origene, apo tes Hellenikes paideias tuphlotheis
   ton noun exemesas ton ion tois peitheisi soi, kai gegonas autois eis
   broma deleteriou, di' hon autos hedikesai adikesas tous pleious.

   [612] For a parallel to this characterisation compare Luther, Vom
   Papstthum zu Rom wider den hochberühmten Romanisten zu Leipzig
   (Weimarer Ausgabe, Vol. VI. 304): Lieber Romanist, wer hat daran
   gezweiffelt, dass das alt Gesetz and seine Figuren mussen ym Neuen
   erfullet werden? man durfft deiner Meisterschaft hirynnen nichts Aber
   hie soltestu dich lassen sehen and beweysen deine hohe Kunst, das die
   selb Erfulling durch Petrum odder denn Bapst gescheh: Da schweygestu
   wie eiu Stock, da zu reden ist, and schwetzist da nit not zu redenn
   ist. Hastu dein logica nit bass gelernet? Du probirst die minores, die
   niemant anficht, and nympst fur gewiss die minores, die ydermann
   anficht, and schleussist was Du wilt.

   [613] The so-called decree of Gelasius, which obtained a far-reaching
   importance in the West is also otherwise important from the
   condemnation it passed on the whole of earlier Christian literature.
   The orthodox Church was determined to vilify and then to bury its own
   past in order to maintain undisputed the fiction that it had always
   remained the same.

   [614] The later antignostic writings and compendiums, those of Ephraem,
   Epiphanies, Theodoret, Esnik, etc., are all, in so far as they are not
   mere extracts from. older works, from the East. Mohammedans, besides
   the later Nestorian and Jacobite scholars, confessedly turned their
   attention to the Christian sects still existing in the East, to one of
   which Islam owes the best of its teaching. Theodoret is full of
   self-praise over his actions, and sports them over and over again to
   prop up his imperilled orthodoxy. In Ep. 81 (IV., p. 1141, ed. Schulze)
   he writes: komas okto tes Markionos kai tas perix keimenas, asmenas
   pros ten aletheian ephodegesa; allen komen Eunomianon--we see that the
   sects are tabulated according to their origin--pepleromenen kai allen
   Areianon to photi tes theognosias prosegagon. kai dia ten theian charin
   oude hen par' hemin hairetikon hupeleiphthe zizanion. Ep. 145 (IV., p.
   1246) he tells how he fought steadily against Greeks, Jews, Arians,
   Eunomians, Apollinarians, and Marcionites ibid, p. 1252: pleious e
   murious ton tou Markionos peisas prosegagon to panagio baptismati. In
   Hæret. fab. I. 20 he records that he had confiscated more than 200
   copies of the Diatessaron.

   [615] Theodoret discusses (1) the First Principle and the Father, (2)
   the Son, (3) the Holy Spirit and the divine names, (4-9) creation,
   matter, ions, angels, demons, and man, (10) providence, (11-15) the
   Incarnation, and that in general as well as in reference to separate
   points of doctrine, e.g., the assumption of a real body of a soul, and
   generally of the complete human nature, and the resuscitation of this
   nature, (16) the identity of the just and beneficent God, (17) God is
   the author of both Testaments, (18) Baptism, (19) the resurrection,
   (20) the judgment, (21) the promises, (22) the second advent of Christ,
   (23) Antichrist, (24) virginity, (25) marriage, (26) second marriage,
   (27-29) fornication, penitence and continence.

   [616] Theodoret has not introduced him into his catalogue of heretics.

   [617] Walch l.c., p. 618 ff.; Möller in the R.-Encykl. XI., p. 512 f.;
   Loofs, Leontius, p. 274 ff.; Bigg, l.c.

   [618] Leontius, as Loofs has shown.

   [619] See the analysis of this extraordinarily interesting work, not
   yet printed, in Frothingham's Stephen bar Sudaili, 1886, p. 92 f.; the
   writer ably calls attention also to the connection with the renaissance
   of Origenism.

   [620] Frothingham rightly says, p. 49 f.: "His system was openly
   pantheistic, or, to speak more philosophically, Pan-nihilistic; for,
   according to him, all nature even to the lowest forms of animal
   creation, being simply an emanation from the Divinity-Chaos, finally
   returns to it; and, when the consummation has taken place, God himself
   passes away and everything is swallowed up in the indefinite chaos,
   which he conceives to be the first principle and the end of being and
   which admits of no distinction." The contents of the five books are
   according to Fr. as follows: I.--On God, the Universal Essence and
   distinct existences. II.--The various species of motion, the ascent of
   the mind towards God, during which it must endure the sufferings of
   Christ. III.--The resurrection of the mind, the vicissitudes of its
   conflict with the powers of evil, and its final identification with
   Christ. IV.--The mind becomes one, first with Christ, then with the
   Spirit and the Father, and finally becomes absorbed. V.--All nature
   becomes confounded with the Father; all distinct existence and God
   himself passes away; Essence alone remains.

   [621] Compare with this the ten anathemas in the epistle to Mennas and
   the Vitæ Sabæ, Euthymii and Cyriaci, Loofs l.c., p, 290 f.

   [622] The religious policy of Justinian and the fifth Council had
   accordingly the same significance for the (orthodox) East as the
   so-called Gelasian decree for the West. In the former as in the latter
   history was extinguished and theology fettered.

   [623] See on him the Art. of Wagenmann in the R.-Encykl. and Steitz
   XI., p. 209; on the Cultus-mystics Sophronius of Jerusalem and Germanus
   of Constantinople, see Steitz XI., pp. 238 f. and 246 f.

   [624] The saying is due to Porphyry who has used it of Plotinus (Vita
   I.): Plotinos ho philosophos eokei men aischunomeno hoti en somati eie.

   [625] See Bach, Dogmengesch. des Mittelalters I., p. 49 ff. Bach begins
   with good reason, pp. 6-49, with Dionysius and Maximus.

   [626] Yet the rational method was by no means given up; on the
   contrary, it was retained; see, e.g., the rational arguments for the
   Trinity, I. 6, 7.

   [627] The plan of the work is as follows: Book I. discusses the Deity,
   the Trinity and the attributes of God; Book II. the creation, angels,
   paradise, and man, giving an elaborate psychology; Book III. the
   Incarnation, the two natures, and Christology--see above, Chap. 3,
   conclusion; Book IV. continues the Christology up to Chap. 8 and then
   discusses--very characteristically--baptism, including the muron,
   faith, the sign of the cross and faith, adoration towards the East, the
   mysteries (the Eucharists), Mary the mother of God and the genealogy of
   Christ, the veneration of the saints and their relics, pictures and,
   only then, Scripture. To the chapter on Scripture a series of chapters
   are appended containing hermeneutical rules for the exposition of
   Scripture, dealing with the statements regarding Christ--where we have
   a precise distinction made between the tropoi of the hypostatic
   union--those concerning God in his relation to evil, the apparent
   existence of two principles, the law of God, and the law of sin and the
   Sabbath. The conclusion consists of chapters on virginity,
   circumcision--the position of these headings is reversed--on
   Anti-Christ and the resurrection.

   [628] Besides the old researches of Engelhardt (1827), Gieseler (1829,
   1846, 1849), see now Döllinger, Beitr. z. Sectengesch. des Mittelalters
   (1890) and Karapet Ter Mkrttschian, Die Paulikianer (1893).

   [629] Compare as to this Kattenbusch, Vergleichende Confessionskunde I.
   passim. The general intellectual life in Eastern Rome is best discussed
   in the excellent work of Krumbacher, Gesch. d. Byzant. Litteratur,
   München, 1891.
