                            The Following of Christ

   "If this little volume does not proceed from Tauler himself, it
   proceeds from one of that remarkable group of German mystics--Friends
   of God,' as they called themselves, amongst whom the great Dominican
   preacher of Strasburg lived and worked. The contents of the little
   book, notwithstanding its forms and repetitions, are full of value.
   Therefore we may well say in this case with the Imitation,--which
   itself, also, issued from the deep religious movement felt in the
   Germanic lands along the Rhine in the fourteenth century--Ask not who
   wrote it, but attend to what it says.' Mr. Morell's translation is on
   the whole a sound and good one, with the signal merit of reproducing
   the plain and earnest tone characteristic of the original.

   "The reader will recognise the strain of homage which from age to age
   successive generations of mystics have ever loved to uplift to the
   eternal word'! I will not say that it is entirely satisfying, but at
   least it is always refreshing, consoling, and ennobling. Whoever turns
   to the little volume which Mr. Morell has translated, will find plenty
   in this strain to give him refreshment. But he will find more than
   this. He will find sentences fitted to abide in the memory, to be a
   possession for the mind and soul, to form the character."

PREFACE.

   TAULER is by no means unknown to English readers, not only of the
   Catholic Church. Translations of many of his sermons have appeared as
   early as 1857, together with a Life of Tauler and a Preface by the Rev.
   Charles Kingsley.

   For many interesting particulars relating to the great German Dominican
   of the fourteenth century we refer the reader to the work in
   question--"The History and Life of the Reverend Doctor John Tauler of
   Strasburg, with twenty-five of his Sermons, translated by Susanna
   Winkworth, and a Preface by the Rev. Charles Kingsley." This book is
   very readable, though recent researches, and especially those of Dr.
   Denifle, have corrected certain erroneous views associated with it.

   Anything the translator of the present work can say in praise of the
   high spirituality and acute intellectual power of Tauler would be out
   of place with Catholics. Others will derive a high idea of his
   excellence from the work to which we have just alluded.

   The "Following of Christ" appears to contain many of the special
   features and excellences of the great Dominican; and being almost
   entirely apart from any doctrinal, controversial, and formal questions,
   will commend itself as a book of great edification to a large number of
   Christians.

   Many indeed will take exception to the spirit and tone of his teaching,
   which is diametrically contrary to, and condemnatory of, the spirit of
   the world at all times, and especially in our time.

   But it is interesting to note that his exaltation of eternal views, and
   a life centred in them, to the depreciation of time and temporals, is a
   feature that Tauler shares not only with the most eminent Churchmen,
   [1] but even with the great thinkers of heathen antiquity, as the
   Stoics, [2] and many of modern times.

   Passing to his method and language, I have to remark that the editions
   I have used are one in the original Middle High German, republished at
   Frankfort in 1833; another in early New High German, also published at
   Frankfort in 1670, and a modern version, published at Ratisbon in 1855.
   I have compared these earlier printed editions with that of Dr.
   Denifle, published at Munich in 1877, to which reference is made
   further on.

   The form of the original Middle High German is peculiarly quaint and
   muscular, and has suffered considerable softening in the modern German
   edition. That of 1670 has retained much of the original strength.

   In the preface to the latter we read thus: "The Following of Christ'
   was first printed at Tübingen in 1621, by Herrn Christophorum Besoldum,
   J. V. D., and Professor. In the title-page it is stated that this
   edition of 1621 was printed from a copy one hundred and seventy years
   old, and thus it has been faithfully, without falsifying, and word for
   word reprinted." Comparing this edition with the older Middle High
   German, reprinted at Frankfort in 1833, I am of opinion that the
   statement is correct, as the two editions agree in almost every
   respect. Dr. Denifle's edition has, however, afforded a different
   reading of certain passages, resulting from a careful comparison of all
   the known existing MSS. of the work.

   It is further stated in the Frankfort edition (1670) that this edition
   has exactly followed the very old copy of 1448, without changing a
   single letter, and only adding a new division into chapters [3] for the
   sake of convenience.

   While treating of editions it may be added that the "Following of
   Christ" was translated into Latin by Laurentio Surio, a well-known
   Carthusian monk.

   With regard to Tauler's method, it is interesting to note how the
   scholastic influence, and especially that of St. Thomas Aquinas, had
   imprinted itself on the mind of the writer, who moreover shows a
   considerable acquaintance with the philosophers of classical antiquity,
   [4] and a readiness to introduce passages of Scripture at a time when
   it was more generally known and circulated than has been sometimes
   alleged. [5]

   Tauler divides his argument invariably under heads, closely and
   logically connected. He presents the objections of adversaries to
   combat them, and uses frequent repetitions in matters which, savouring
   of mysticism, have to be frequently impressed that they may not escape
   the mind.

   With regard to the language of the translation, it has appeared right
   and necessary to adopt much of the terseness and strength of the
   English of our early version in order to convey a proper idea of
   Tauler's expressions. To fritter him down to the dulcet style of
   Gibbon, or even the polished propriety of Macaulay, would have been
   incongruous and unseemly.

   It has been necessary to employ terms which, to modern readers and
   thinkers, may present some difficulty, but a little consideration is
   sufficient to explain the writer's line of thought.

   In speaking of the natural reason of man he often styles it
   "Bescheidenheit," or the power of discretion, which corresponds to the
   Greek egemeoniko'n of the Stoics. In one place he uses the term
   synteresis for the highest power of the mind, the term meaning the
   power of preservation. [6] We have mostly translated these terms by
   reason and understanding, the sound Biblical expressions for those
   faculties. In speaking of the processes of the natural reason, he often
   dwells on that of distinction, which in modern times we describe as
   analysis and synthesis.

   The objects presented to these faculties are styled images and forms,
   by which he evidently describes what in modern philosophy are termed
   representations, ideas, and conceptions (Anschauungen, Vorstellungen,
   Ideen, und Begriffe). With this explanation his meaning will become
   sufficiently clear.

   It may be added that Tauler belonged to a great school of spiritual
   writers nourishing in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Germany
   and Holland, and including Thomas à Kempis, Süss, Ruysbrock, Seuse, and
   others. His writings have been commended by many Lutherans, though some
   of his sentiments were combated by Beza, who naturally, as a Calvinist,
   had objections to the great stress he lays on charity. Even John Eckius
   describes him as circa fidem suspectum. But this view was entirely
   confuted by Ludovicus Blosius.

   From the middle of the thirteenth century two Orders in the Church, the
   Franciscans and the Dominicans, were chiefly instrumental in giving a
   rapid development to German prose, raising it to a position equal to
   that of the admirable early poetry of the Nibelungen Lied and the
   Minnesingers. After the middle of the thirteenth century, the
   Dominicans in particular occupy the first place, and in their sermons
   and learned treatises show that the German tongue of that time can do
   justice to the deepest and most difficult themes.

   Most of the great Mystics issued from that Order in Germany, and had
   for nearly a century so great an influence that they almost effaced the
   poetry of the time. It is with reason that these thinkers have been
   called the sires of German speculation; for in them we trace the origin
   of an independent German philosophy, nay, the germs of many celebrated
   systems developed five centuries later on, in some cases fully
   outspoken in these early thinkers. Of these men, Eckhart, Seuse, and
   Tauler are the most striking individualities, and their writings, as
   well as those of Hermann von Fritzlar, Nicolaus von Strassburg, and
   David von Augsburg, are well entitled to careful study, and are now
   accessible to the student of Middle High German by the assiduous
   labours of modern critics. [7] But as many are not conversant with that
   archaic tongue, the translator has thought it might be useful and
   interesting to not a few of his countrymen to give an English version
   of one of the most remarkable of their works, rendering it as far as
   desirable in an older form of English necessary to convey the terse and
   quaint language of the original.

   "The Following of the Poor Life of Christ, or the Book of Spiritual
   Poverty," as Denifle would have it called, was presented to the German
   world in a perfect form by that able critic after a careful study and
   comparison of the best MSS. in the Leipzig, Munich, St. Gallen, and
   other collections. [8] My translation is mainly in accordance with his
   published German edition (1877, Munich), though I have retained the
   earlier division into short chapters (of the editions of 1833 and 1670)
   as more convenient.

   But I have added the division and headings of Denifle's edition for
   comparison, and I have largely used his valuable notes in the Preface
   and Appendix.

   Though differing from him in his view of the author and of the work, I
   readily admit our large debt of gratitude to him for his patient
   studies and admirable edition which, with its beautiful text and
   learned annotations, has been of the greatest service to me in the
   arduous labour of translation.

   Though Denifle is inclined to dispute the authorship of the "Following"
   by Tauler, he gives the work a high antiquity (the fourteenth century),
   and admits that it was largely quoted by the Provincial of the
   Franciscans, Marcus of Lindau, about that time. [9]

   He further admits that the work has much merit and many passages equal
   to anything to be found in the mystical writers.

   At page liii. of his Introduction he says:--"Let it not be inferred
   from our representations that all teachings in this work are
   exaggerated and erroneous. Such a conclusion would not be just.
   Especially the sections on the Passion of Christ belong to the finest
   things that the Mystics have written on the subject. And when the
   author advances the sound normal doctrines of the other Mystics, he
   develops them always in an original manner, and his description is
   always supported by a high moral earnestness."

   It is very natural to find a member of the Mendicant Orders, when they
   were still in the early energy of the movement, stand forth as a
   powerful expositor of the great principle involved in it. But I propose
   to show how strongly the best Catholic commentators on the New
   Testament endorse the conditions of perfection held forth in this book.

   Thus basing my argument on far higher and more conclusive authority, I
   hope to establish that this work is worthy of the great name of Tauler.

   The passage of Scripture most frequently recurring in the "Following,"
   and forming the master theme of the work, occurs in Matt. xix. 16-30.

   I shall now compare the view of this passage in the two great Catholic
   commentators with that taken by the author of the "Following."

   J. Maldonatus (Comment, in Matt., c. xix., p. 409, v. 24, Moguntiae,
   1602), says: . . . "Apostoli mirabantur quasi nimis dura esset ac
   severa sententia; respondit Christus, eam, etiam atque etiam
   exaggerens, et severiorem reddens; atque hoc est quod ait: iterum dico
   vobis,' quasi dicat," non solum quod modo dixi verum est, sed amplius
   etiam dico vobis, facilius esse camelum per foramen acus transire, quam
   divitem intrare in regnum coelorum . . . v. 26. "Apud homines hoc
   impossible est . . . Christumque voluisse sententiam suam magis et
   magis exaggerando confirmare. Primo enim simpliciter dixit, difficile
   esse divitem in regno coelorum introire; secundo dixit, facilius esse
   camelum, etc.; tertio, impossible omnino esse sed apud homines, non
   apud Deum."

   Cornelius a Lapide (Comment, in Matt., c. xix., pp. 265-267; Venetiis,
   1761, v. 21-23), has: . . . "Tum quia cupido divitiarum facit eus
   coacervari per fas et nefas; tum quia eadem ita mentem auro alligat ut
   nequeat cogitare de coelo; tum quia divitiae sunt materia et stimulus
   ad superbiam, gulam, luxuriam, omniaque scelera." "Et iterum Christus
   enim adaugendo quasi corrigit id quod dixit." Dixi difficile esse
   divitem salvari; nunc addo quod amplius est, facilius esse camelum
   . . . Quemlibet divitem accipias.

   "Rursum impossibile hie proprie capias; nam divitem salvari impossibile
   est apud homines (p. 267).--Humanae naturae viribus impossibile est
   diviti opibus suis intricato salutem consequi . . . imo ut non pauci
   iis relictis ambiant et sequautur evangelicam Christi paupertatem; hoc
   enim fecere primo omnes Christiani, qui omnia habebant communia ut
   patet" (Act. Apost. iv. 32).

   After this survey by those who accept Christian and Catholic teaching,
   it must be admitted that the argument of the "Following," with
   reference to the condition of perfection, is founded on the words of
   Christ, as they are explained by the most competent and approved
   commentators of the Church.

   It has appeared to us useful to show that the teachings in the
   "Following" are, in many cases, conformable with those of the Mystics
   of the fourteenth century, and with previous saints and doctors of the
   Church. But it would be as absurd to deny the author's originality on
   this account, as to represent that Schelling and Hegel copied all their
   views from Fichte and Kant, or that Brown was a plagiarist of Dugald
   Stewart and Reid.

   On the Doctrine of Poverty, in No. 9, p. 7, Part I., &c., and
   throughout the "Following," compare Nicolaus von Strassburg in
   Pfeiffer's edition, Die Deutsche Mystiker, Predigten (p. 301):

   "We are on the way to the kingdom of heaven, and are always waiting for
   the end of the journey. But whosoever for a short way loadeth himself
   with much corn, becometh sooner weary, before he cometh to the end, and
   must suffer much trouble by the way. Thus Thou wishest, O Lord, that
   thy people be ready for the journey, and not overladen with earthly
   things. If they have something to carry, let them share this with their
   shipmates, who have not; thus their burthen is less, and they go
   quicker, and come thus earlier in the evening to the heavenly shelter.
   This hast Thou taught us with thy complete poverty, for whoso carrieth
   not much on the way, is the less frightened by robbers, for many a man
   hath lost his life on account of the burden he carried."

   Again, at p. 314, "The seven Rules of Virtue:" "The third rule is that
   the spiritual man do sparingly use the things that are of the world, as
   far as his necessity alloweth in food, and clothing, and house, and all
   things. Our Lord Jesus Christ teacheth us this rule, who would not have
   so much from the world, as even where to lay His head. . . . The more
   sparingly a man useth the world's goods and its lusts, the more readily
   he flieth to the height of the heavenly kingdom. . . . We have high to
   climb into the heavenly kingdom. . . . But whoso overloadeth himself
   with a heavy burden of earthly possession, he is stricken with much
   sorrow on the evening of his death, like the rich man in the Gospel,
   who enlarged his dwelling that he might lay in more store. When he
   comforted himself for many years, with an easy life in store for him,
   the Lord said, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of
   thee.' Such are they who treasure up here, and are not rich towards
   God. Thy treasure is what thou lovest more than the right.

   "Seneca saith: If two words were not in the world, men would live in
   concord without any war: these words are "mine and thine."' These words
   were not in Christendom at first, where all earthly things were in
   common to them, but to each as his necessity required, not according to
   caprice and lust. Therefore they lived together in concord as if they
   had only one heart and one soul. This was to us a pattern of peace and
   Christian perfection."

   On the doctrine of essential virtue (Following, Part I. No. 7, p. 5;
   Part II. No. 72, p. 241), &c., see Eckhart (Pfeiffer's edition), 524,
   12; 571, 3, &c.

   On suffering in God, see Eckhart (op. cit.) 4, 8; 6, 34; 8, 1; 16, 1;
   15, 24; 23, 28, &c.

   Respecting the drawing in of the powers (the lower powers into the
   higher), op. cit., 3, 27; 13, 16, 39; 24, 33 (Part II. No. 112, p. 289,
   No. 98, p. 274).

   If God speaks creatures must hush, op. cit.; 36, 30.

   God worketh in the highest union the works of the soul, which is, as it
   were, an instrument, op. cit., 127, 34; 402, 32; 515, 36; 526, 2 (Part
   II. No. 95, p. 272).

   The spirit becomes divinised, or has a godlike form; op. cit., 156, 5;
   161, 26; 240, 14; 643, 19, 38 (Part II. No. 37, p. 193).

   Man loses his name in this state (Part II. No. 37, p. 193), (op. cit.)
   387, 12; 503, 4; 513, 20.

   The comparison of the sun and moon occurs (op. cit.), 505, 5; 509, 18
   (Following, Part I. No. 148, p. 128).

   The soul becomes, from knowing, knowingless; from loving, loveless; op.
   cit., 491, 8; 504, 36; 509, 14 (Following, Part II. No. 20, p. 171).

   The spirit loses itself in God, so that it knows nothing but God; see
   op. cit., 519, 25. Even Dionys. in his De Mystica Theolog., c. 1, § 3,
   says of the nous . . pas o'n tou pa'nton epe'keina kai` oudeno`s ou'te
   e'autou ou'te ete'rou to pantelos de` ageo'sto . . enooumeno's.

   St. Bernard teaches: "Mens . . . quodammodo se sibi furatur, immo
   rapitur atque elabitnr a seipsa, ut verbo fruatur." (In Cant. Sermo,
   85, p. 1244, ed. Mediol. 1851.) Confer Epist. 11, No. 8: De dilig. Deo.
   c. 12, No. 28.--And Richard of St. Victor (De contemplatione, v. 12, p.
   321 says: "Cur non recte dicatur spiritus semetipsum non habere, quando
   incipit a semetipso deficere et a suo esse in supermundanum quemdam et
   vere plus quam humanum statum transire . . . ita ut ipse jam non sit
   ipse, eo duntaxat tempore quo Domino incipit altius inhaerere."

   Cod. Einsidl., No. 278, translates this passage thus: Book 7--compare
   c. 9, p. 318: "A semetipsa penitus deficit."

   David of Augsburg (De septem processibus religiosi, c. 1 5) explains:
   "Haec est hominis in vita sublimior perfectio ita uniri Deo ut tota
   anima cum omnibus potentiis suis et viribus in Deum collecta unus
   spiritus fiat cum eo, nihil meminerit nisi Deum, nihil sentiat et
   intelligat nisi Deum."

   Albert, M. (De adhaerendo Deo, c. 6): "Et sic transformatur quodammodo
   in Deum, quod nec cogitare nec intelligere nec amare nec memorari
   potest nisi Deum pariter et de Deo." Therefore, says Seuse in his
   little book, of Truth (c. 6, p. 277, 3 edit, of Diepenbr.), the spirit
   loses itself in God.

   The teaching that a man can scarcely fall after this elevation, is
   found in Eckhart, op. cit., 10. 14 (Part II. No. 103, p. 280).

   The doctrine that accidental reward attaches to external works, but
   essential reward attaches to merit, as it has its excellence from love
   or charity, is the ordinary Catholic teaching, and a quotation from St.
   Thomas suffices to show this:

   "Labor exterior operatur ad augmentum proemii accidentalis; sed
   augmentum meriti respectu proemii essentialis consistit principaliter
   in charitate." (2, 2, qu. 182, a. 2, ad 1. Comp. 4 dist. 49, qu. 5, a.
   1, ad. 3; in Ep. ad Rom. 8, lect. 5.)

   The doctrine of the communion of good works (Part I. No. 44, p. 34), in
   which Schmidt (op. cit. p. 131) sees a suppression of all differences,
   of all diversity in the spirit that has gone out of itself in union
   with God, is also the Catholic doctrine. Like the Mystics, St. Thomas
   also traces back this communion to love working in the Mystical Body of
   Christ: "Illud quod unus videtur specialiter haberi inter homines,
   quodammodo omnes communiter habent, in quantum se per charitatem
   perfectam unusquisque bonum alterius suum reputat." (1 c. e Libro in
   Sent. ad 4.)

   Peter Blesensis says of the communio sanctorum in heaven: "Bonum; quod
   in Deo vel in proximo diligam, diligendo faciam meum. (Maxima
   Bibliotheca, P. P. tom. xxiv. Lugd. 1677, p. 1242.) Comp. Eckhart, 29,
   23; 56, 5; 209, 2; and especially 552.

   Denifle affirms that the great matter of the perfection of the will
   (Part II. No. 51, p. 214) is an older teaching than the Mystics.
   Compare St. Thomas, 2, 2, qu. 81, a. 6 ad 1.): "Laus virtutis in
   voluntate consistit, non autem in potestate, et ideo deficere ab
   aequalitate, quae est medium justitiae propter defectum potestatis non
   diminuit laudem virtutis, si non fuerit defectus ex parte voluntatis."

   Hugo of St. Victor (De sacram. lib. 2, p. 14, c. 6, p. 498, ed. Mog.
   1618): "Totum meritum voluntate est. Quantum vis, tantum
   mereris"--provided, as he explains, the will, without any fault on its
   part, is unable to come to work. (St. Thomas, 1, 2, qu. 20, a. 4 in
   fine.) This doctrine is, moreover, found in Mark xii. 43, and in 2 Cor.
   viii. 12.

CONTENTS.

   THIS Book teacheth how a man should follow the poor life of our Lord
   Jesu Christ, and how a man should live inwardly, and how he should come
   to right true perfection, and teacheth sundry lovely differences of
   godly truth.

   No.

   In the first place, this book teacheth how poverty is a (state of)
   being withdrawn (detached) from all creatures

   [1]1

   What is a poor man's holding, since he holdeth to nothing, and yet all
   things hold to something

   [2]2

   How some folk say this is the highest poverty and detachment, that a
   man be as when he was nothing

   [3]3

   How man ought to know and love God

   [4]3

   What man's knowledge is

   [5]4

   What use there is in a man's having in him a rational distinction in
   images and forms, since with them he cannot be saved (or blessed). To
   this it is answered that distinction is useful for right poverty in
   four ways

   [6]5

   If man should be also poor in graces and virtues

   [7]6, [8]7

   If a man can have virtue essentially who has his bodily necessity, and
   yet inwardly doth not possess it as property

   [9]8

   What chance or accident is

   [10]8

   If the favour of creatures hindereth poverty

   [11]11, [12]12

   Rich folk cannot have a thorough love and truth to a right poor man;
   this be proved by eight matters

   [13]14, [14]15

   In the next place, how true poverty is a free capacity or power
   (vermögen).

   A question, What is freedom?

   [15]16

   If freedom is hindered when a man giveth himself up into obedience to
   another man, and how in three ways a man letteth himself to another

   [16]17

   It is not necessary that a right perfect man, who hath become empty of
   himself and of all things, should let himself to another for the sake
   of four things

   [17]18

   How a poor man should hold himself in lawful matters

   [18]19, [19]20, [20]23

   A poor man may let himself in three wise

   [21]23

   If a poor man should at all times take heed of his heart, and never
   cumber himself with outward things

   [22]24-[23]26

   How shall we understand if the impulse to outward works of love be from
   the evil spirit, or from nature, or from God

   [24]27

   Through four matters shall a man know if the impulse to outward works
   of love is from the evil spirit

   [25]28

   Through three matters a man should know if the impulse to outward works
   be of nature

   [26]30

   Through three matters shall a man know if the impulse to outward works
   of love be from God

   [27]31-[28]34

   Distinction between godly freedom and subordinate freedom

   [29]35, [30]36

   Of two kinds of subordinate freedom

   [31]37-[32]42

   In the third place, how true poverty is a pure working.

   How what is called pure is when a thing is one and separate from the
   manifold or mixed

   [33]43

   How working is to make something out of nothing, or of one thing
   another or better than it was before, and out of something nothing

   [34]43-[35]47

   Of how working can be in poverty, since it is a pure being

   [36]48

   In man is a natural work, a work of grace and a godly work. In the
   first place--

   How three kinds of work are in man, bodily, sensual, and spiritual

   [37]49-[38]54

   How natural knowledge is to be attributed and not attributed

   [39]55

   What difference there is between knowledge natural, of grace and godly

   [40]56, [41]57

   A natural man is to be known by three things

   [42]58

   This natural understanding is useful to a man to come to a complete
   detachment from himself and all things

   [43]59

   Secondly, of the work and knowledge of grace.

   How Holy Scripture is understood fundamentally through divine grace

   [44]60

   Through the knowledge of grace is also understood the distinction of
   virtue and what is unvirtuous (vice)

   [45]61

   Through grace also man knows his sins

   [46]62

   Through grace a man knoweth the injury that lieth in sin

   [47]63

   How not nature but the badness in nature ought to be blamed

   [48]64-[49]66

   Through grace each sin is known in its degree and how it is called

   [50]67-[51]73

   Through grace the distinction of spirits is known, for there are four
   kinds of spirit that speak in man

   [52]75-[53]81

   Secondly, how the natural spirit speaketh in man

   [54]82, [55]83

   What distinction there is between natural and divine truth

   [56]84

   If divine truth can be known without images

   [57]83-[58]86

   In the third place, how the angelic spirit speaketh in man

   [59]87

   If a true repentance hath all virtue

   [60]88

   How many men guard against sins, and yet have not all virtues

   [61]89

   How man should not drive out the images and forms of the angel if he
   hath need of them

   [62]91

   Distinction between natural, angelic, and devilish images

   [63]92-[64]96

   Since a right poor man is raised above all creatures in God, how can he
   then tarry at the images of the angel or of another creature

   [65]97

   In the fourth place, how the Divine Spirit speaketh in man

   [66]98

   Three things make a friend

   [67]99-[68]101

   How some men say, If they knew the dearest will of God they would
   fulfil it, and how they say untruth in this

   [69]102, [70]103

   Since no accident or defective quality can attach to God, how then can
   He hate sin?

   [71]104

   How it is the noblest gift that a man can give, that he give himself

   [72]106

   Threefold use lieth in this, that man getteth his temporal good through
   God

   [73]107

   If a man can be perfect, who keepeth his necessity from without, and
   yet holdeth all things to be nothing for the love of God

   [74]108-[75]111

   How the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the
   flesh

   [76]112

   Why Christ said, Blessed are the poor in spirit, as you cannot be
   perfect without poverty of temporal things?

   [77]113, [78]114

   In the third place. Of the godly work and of three kinds of men.

   Some keep their necessity from without, but are empty (of all earthly
   desire), and leave themselves to God inwardly; others leave temporal
   good outwardly for God's sake, and yet remain coarse and unenlightened
   inwardly, and these two classes war (contend) with one another, and
   each of these think it is right; the third leave all things outwardly
   and inwardly through God, and look inwardly what God will have of them;
   with this they are satisfied, and they dispute with no one

   [79]115

   What the work of God is in souls

   [80]116, [81]117

   Whoso followeth Christ as He went before us becometh one spirit with
   God

   [82]118

   How Christ hath two kinds of work in Him, and which work we ought to
   follow

   [83]118

   That we follow Christ as close as we can on earth, maketh us near to
   God in the kingdom of heaven

   [84]119

   By two kinds of work a man draweth nigh the aim, that is Christ--one is
   internal, the other external; and in the internal work man should have
   three aims

   [85]121

   The first aim that man ought to have internally is to see his own
   defects, and how he may he free of them

   [86]123

   The second object that a man ought to have internally is the Passion of
   our Lord Jesus Christ

   [87]124, [88]125

   Whoso will know and seek godly truth, he findeth them nowhere else than
   in the Passion of Jesu Christ

   [89]126, [90]127

   Of a bodily heaven that is over us, and of a spiritual heaven that is
   in us, and that is the essential being of the soul in which God
   dwelleth

   [91]128-[92]130

   The third object that man ought to have in his internal work that he
   may come to the right aim, that is God in His simple divinity

   [93]131

   Of the external work that man may draw nigh the right aim, that is
   Christ

   [94]132

   The Spirit of God speaketh in man without image and form, life, light,
   and truth.

   In the first place, the Spirit of God speaketh life in man

   [95]133-[96]135

   Why sermons should be heard, since the highest happiness of man lies in
   this, that he hear the eternal Word in himself

   [97]136

   When man has heard the word of the Teacher, or hath exercised himself
   in other virtues, he should turn inwardly and perceive the eternal Word
   in himself, and he ought to drive out violently what hindereth him in
   this

   [98]137-[99]139

   How God the Father speaketh His Word in the being or essence of the
   soul, and is the Teacher in the powers of the soul

   [100]140, [101]141

   The other way that the Spirit of God speaketh in the soul is light

   [102]142

   What light can the soul receive since she is herself light, as she hath
   sundered herself from all grossness

   [103]144

   If the soul is to receive the divine light she must turn to it

   [104]145

   Man must exceed the righteousness of the hypocrites and scribes if he
   is to be enlightened with the divine light

   [105]146, [106]147

   Whereby a man can know the distinction between natural and divine light

   [107]148

   How several men have not much divine influence (or influx), and yet
   their soul is not on that account dead

   [108]149, [109]150

   The divine sun begetteth the fish in the water, the beast on the earth,
   the bird in the air, the phoenix in the fire, and many hidden secret
   things that God only knoweth

   [110]151, [111]152

   The third thing that God speaketh in the understanding of man, without
   image or form, is truth, and how the understanding of man is likened
   unto lust

   [112]153

   What a perfect will is, whereof the works and virtue are essential.

   How the will is movable if it turneth to the creature, and immovable if
   it turneth to God

   [113]156

   What an essential work is

   [114]157

   How the will given up to God is immovable and yet always advanceth
   (runneth) in God

   [115]158

   How the will of man ought to be immovable, but yet he turneth to this
   and to that as long as man is in time

   [116]159

   What a man's own self-will is, and what a resigned will is

   [117]160

   How there are several men, who have their necessity, and yet inwardly
   hold nothing as property, and thereby they think that they are empty of
   their own will

   [118]161

   How man possesseth himself in spiritual things in a twofold manner

   [119]162-[120]164

   If it be better that a man should take heed of his heart inwardly, or
   that he should cumber himself with external matters

   [121]165-168

   If it be good or not that a man should give himself up to the authority
   of another, since the lights shining into him are various

   [122]169

   If you should always follow the teaching of an exemplary man

   [123]170

   In two things man should understand if he is touched by God

   [124]171
     __________________________________________________________________

   The other part of this little Book teacheth how a man can come by four
   means to a perfectly poor life.

   In the first place, the teaching and the life of our Lord Jesus Christ
   impel a man to a poor life.

   A man must deny himself in four things if he wisheth to follow Christ

   [125]2

   In the first place, man should kill sins in himself by virtues

   [126]3, [127]4

   How a man is to know if he have all virtues

   [128]5

   If a man can have all virtue so that he need no more

   [129]6

   In the second place, man must overcome and kill in himself the love of
   creatures with a poor life

   [130]7

   In the third place, man must overcome bodily lust and kill it with
   continual internal contemplation of the Passion of our Lord Jesu Christ

   [131]8, [132]9

   Of the fruit of the Passion of our Lord Jesu Christ

   [133]10

   How the men, who contemplate the Passion of Christ internally, from the
   hot hunger which they have for God, run to the Holy Sacrament of the
   Body of our Lord that they may be satisfied

   [134]11, [135]12

   They who contemplate internally the Passion of Christ with a steady
   earnestness, they are so overflowed by divine love that they would have
   nothing of self, either internally or externally, and will also love
   God with their whole heart, with their whole soul, with all their
   might, and all their mind

   [136]13

   Since divine love binds the mind so that it becomes powerless over
   itself, it might be said that in this way the freedom of the will is
   taken away from man

   [137]14

   In the fourth place, if man wisheth to follow Christ, he must leave
   himself and kill in himself all spiritual and natural lust which
   subsists in images and forms that are created. He must do this through
   the inspeaking of the eternal Word, that God the Father speaketh in the
   ground of the soul

   [138]15

   Of an indwelling work and of an outflowing work of God

   [139]16

   What use it is that man should work, since with his works he cannot
   come to God

   [140]17

   Whereby a man shall know if his work is of himself or of God

   [141]18

   God worketh two kinds of work in the soul, a work of grace and an
   essential work

   [142]19-[143]23

   In the second place, perfection of virtue driveth a man to a poor life.

   If a man is weak by nature and keepeth the thing he needeth for his
   necessity, if that something hindereth perfection

   [144]24

   In the third place, this ought to drive man to a poor life, that he may
   die to himself and to all creatures, and God alone may live in him.

   How a poor man must always die, since he sometimes appeareth quite
   cheerful with other men

   [145]25, [146]26

   Whoso wisheth to be blessed (saved) must always die, on account of two
   things

   [147]27, [148]28

   Five uses are found in this that a man must always die

   [149]29

   If no one can come to this, that he fundamentally dieth, without
   external poverty

   [150]30-[151]32

   In the fourth place, the perfection of a contemplative life should
   impel a man to a poor life.

   If rich folk can also be bound with the bond of divine love, and if
   they can also have a contemplative life

   [152]33-[153]34

   How many men say, If our Lord were still on earth, He would not bid me
   leave all things externally, for it may be it doth not belong to me to
   do

   [154]35

   Rich folk, who have not divine love, work from two kinds of love, from
   natural love, and from the love of grace

   [155]36

   Eight uses lie in a contemplative life

   [156]37

   If all those are contemplative men who give themselves to a poor life

   [157]38

   Since a poor life and a contemplative life both stand in emptiness of
   all works, and in a pure suffering God to act, how can they then have
   works?

   [158]39

   Four ways lead a man to a poor, perfect, contemplative life, seeing God
   inwardly. The first way is, that a man have a perfect will to give up
   all that is against God, that is not a matter of God and that is not
   solely God, and thereby you obtain all virtue.

   To the man who hath obtained all virtue it is easy to turn inwards, and
   he can well wait in fasting, and hath also the greatest joy from
   within; and whoso hath not all virtue, he also hath not this

   [159]41

   How can good people rejoice in this time since our Lord saith, Happy
   are they that weep and are troubled

   [160]41

   The other way which leadeth a man into a poor, perfect, contemplative
   life, is, that man steppeth in the footsteps of our Lord Jesus Christ
   and followeth Him.

   In two ways you should go through the humanity of Christ into His
   divinity. In the first place, man should clothe his outer man with the
   outer image of our Lord

   [161]43

   Secondly, you should go through the humanity into His divinity, by man
   clothing himself inwardly with continual contemplation of the work and
   of the Passion of our Lord

   [162]44

   How the natural light of the heathen was as night to day compared with
   the light that cometh to a Christian man, who turneth his understanding
   entirely to Christ

   [163]46

   How the will of man is perfected and united with God in the
   contemplation of the Passion of Christ

   [164]47

   What is the treasure hidden in the field, and how it shall be found,
   and wherewith it may be bought

   [165]47

   Whoso were to know what noble fruit grows on the field of the Passion
   of our Lord, he would make a trench round the field, and would build a
   tower and sit in it, and would make a winepress in it; and what this
   trench and this tower and this winepress are; and on the field stand
   wine and corn, summer and winter; nor can the hail destroy it, nor the
   frost freeze it up

   [166]47

   How God compelleth the will of man by the Passion of Christ, and maketh
   it at once subject to Him, and maketh a man free of himself

   [167]49

   By six signs shall a man know if his will is overcome by God

   [168]50

   If a man satisfieth in all that God willeth to have from him, then God
   must satisfy him in what he willeth

   [169]50

   How a perfect will doeth as much with one good work, as an imperfect
   will with many good works

   [170]51

   How the highest power of the soul, which is called synteresis, is also
   brought to its highest nobility in the Passion of Christ

   [171]52

   Whoso cumbereth himself and considereth the most about the Passion of
   Christ, he is the most blessed and the likest Christ

   [172]54

   Whoso adhereth to Christ and considereth His Passion, can be as little
   abandoned by God as the Son can be abandoned by the Father

   [173]55

   What is the cause why God letteth sinners live, and slew them more
   swiftly under the Old Law

   [174]55

   How the friends of God remain unknown by other men, who are not like
   unto them, on account of seven things

   [175]56

   How it is the highest wisdom that a man can have, that he should know
   good men, and whoso winneth the grace that is in Christ, to him all
   that is intermediate vanisheth, so that all things become known to him
   without medium

   [176]56, [177]57

   The third way of a poor, perfect life, when you contemplate God
   internally, is, that a man do not fly from what may kill him in
   spiritual things.

   The man who shall be ready for a poor perfect life, wherein you see God
   internally, must endure all judgments that fall upon him, and should
   omit no true virtue for the sake of any judgment

   [178]58, [179]59

   If man can give no cause of falling to his fellow-man by any kind of
   virtue

   [180]60-[181]64

   A work of love hath four rules by which it should be worked

   [182]65

   Whoso wisheth to receive the Lord worthily in the Blessed Sacrament,
   must be like unto Him as far as can be

   [183]66

   The man who shall be ready for a poor, perfect life, wherein you see
   God internally, must suffer all contradictions through God, and how
   sufferings are very profitable to man

   [184]68, [185]69

   If the suffering that a man inflicteth on himself is better, or that
   which others inflict upon him, or that God layeth upon him

   [186]70

   If it be better that a man do not seek for suffering, and leave it to
   events, since suffering at the hand of others is better than that
   self-sought

   [187]71

   How suffering is like unto a press with which wine is pressed

   [188]72

   How good people may always be cheerful, since our Lord saith, My soul
   is sorrowful, even unto death

   [189]73

   How good people may alway have joy, since our Lord curseth them who
   rejoiced in their time

   [190]74

   Since good folk alway rejoice, what suffering can they then have, since
   joy and sorrow do not consist very well together?

   [191]75

   How a true friend of God alway suffereth in a fourfold way

   [192]76

   First, he suffereth in the works

   [193]76

   Secondly, man suffereth in the will

   [194]77-[195]80

   How the will may love God, according to His eternal existence, since he
   cannot know Him according to His eternal entity. But what a man doth
   not know he also cannot love?

   [196]81

   In the third place, man suffereth in the spirit

   [197]82

   In fivefold ways the spirit of a righteous man is not troubled

   [198]83, [199]84

   Many men have rest and great pleasure in a rational distinction of
   truth through images, such as the heathen had; and we ought to part
   with this rest and pleasure and seek pleasure in God only

   [200]84

   If a man loved a natural man above a good holy man, if God would on
   that account give him reward, as if this natural man were also (good
   and holy)

   [201]85

   Since you do not love man without you know him, or without faith in
   him, shall not therefore God give more reward to the man who loveth his
   neighbour, especially through faith and a good trust, than to another
   who hath not so much faith in him, and also doth not love him so
   thoroughly?

   [202]86

   If God must reward the irrational man, as much for his faith as the
   rational who have much distinction in them, since the light of faith is
   above all knowledge

   [203]87

   What is the most useful way in which unenlightened men come to the true
   faith, in which their love may be right and good?

   [204]88

   The men who live in the senses cannot guard themselves against sins for
   two reasons

   [205]89

   In the fourth place, a man must have suffering in God

   [206]90

   Two kinds of work are in the soul; one is the rational and the work of
   grace, the other is divine and essential

   [207]91

   Two kinds of birth take place in the soul; one is called an inbirth,
   the other an outbirth

   [208]94

   How man can be guarded from venial and mortal sins in six different
   ways

   [209]96-[210]102

   How God can be seized hold on in two ways

   [211]100

   Voluntary poverty, outward and inward, guards men from venial sins in
   four ways

   [212]101

   If the men, who have received the Holy Ghost, live always without sin,
   since the love of the Holy Ghost makes all sin to disappear

   [213]103

   To a God-living man all things are bitter that sever him from God, for
   two reasons

   [214]104-[215]106

   The fourth way that leadeth a man into a poor, perfect, contemplative
   life, is a zealous avoidance of all that which can please men, whether
   it be spiritual or bodily, so that whatever it be, it be so received as
   not to mix up the soul with it.

   What is the cause that we have unrest, and do not find God when we seek
   Him; and of the external senses?

   [216]107

   In what wise a man can best master and kill his senses

   [217]110

   How the sensual men, who altogether live in the senses, have not a
   right faith that could uphold them and save them, for they are in their
   works like unto the heathen

   [218]111

   Why the senses must turn inwardly into the internal man, since they are
   not capable of receiving the most intimate truth

   [219]112

   For three reasons man should draw in all his senses.

   In the first place, man ought to draw in all his senses and quiet his
   powers, and only hear what God speaketh in the soul, if he wisheth to
   have right godly love

   [220]113, [221]114

   Whoso worketh virtue on God-loving men worketh it most intimately on
   God, and it may well be that God will never let such a man be lost

   [222]115

   How God-loving men ought properly to be hated, dishonoured, and scorned
   by the world

   [223]116, [224]117

   Why voluntary poor men are ordained for God, so that they should wait
   on Him only and no one else

   [225]118

   Whereby man can be right free

   [226]119, [227]120

   In the second place, as the best part of man is within, therefore he
   should draw in his senses and take heed of the internal man

   [228]120

   How God damneth no man, but man damneth himself

   [229]120

   In the third place, man should draw in his senses on this account,
   because they commonly receive something impure, when he turneth them
   outwardly

   [230]121

   How right inwardness is a quite perfect giving up of oneself, and all
   things, externally and internally

   [231]122, [232]123

   A question--"What is a poor, internal, mortified life?"

   [233]124

   Whoso occupieth himself with visions and giveth much attention to
   images, this is a sign that the ground of the man is not simple and
   pure, and he hath more communion with Antichrist than with Christ

   [234]126

   How God-loving men have the greatest labour, and also inwardly the
   greatest divine pleasure, and of two kinds of love of working love and
   of suffering love

   [235]127, [236]128

   POVERTY is a likeness with God. What is God? God is a Being, withdrawn
   from all creatures, a free power, a pure working. So also poverty is an
   existence withdrawn from all creatures. What is the meaning of
   withdrawn? What doth not adhere to anything. Poverty adheres to
   nothing, and nothing adheres to it.

2.

   It might be said in answer: All things adhere to something, for all
   things are contained by something;--to what then doth a poor man adhere
   or hold on? A poor man adhereth to nothing that is under him, and only
   to Him who is raised above all things. St. Augustine saith: "The best
   of all things, that is, God." [10] And this is what poverty seeketh, to
   which it adhereth, and to nothing else. And this is also the supreme
   nobleness of poverty, that it adheres only to the very highest, and
   entirely leaves the lowest as far as it is possible.

3.

   Several say that the highest poverty and the most entire withdrawal
   consist in this, that a man becometh as he was when he did not yet
   exist. Then he understood nothing and willed nothing, then was he God
   with God. [11] This might be true, if it were possible. But inasmuch as
   man hath a natural being, he must also have a working; for in this lies
   his beatitude, that he know and love God, as St. John saith: "This is
   life eternal, to know Thee the Father, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast
   sent." [12]

4.

   But how is man to know and love God, and yet remain poor or empty of
   all knowing and loving? He must know God by means of God, and love God
   by means of God, and otherwise he can neither know nor love Him, so as
   to attain to beatitude; and he of himself must thus be poor or wanting
   in all knowledge. What is the knowing of man? It is in images and forms
   which man draws in through the senses, and otherwise he is not able to
   know through nature. And if he wisheth to be blessed and saved he must
   be lacking in this knowledge and stand on the ground of genuine
   poverty.

5.

   Here it may be objected: What use is there then in a man having in
   himself a rational power of distinguishing in images and forms, if this
   will not save him or bless him, and if, furthermore, he must become
   empty of this distinguishing faculty and thoroughly lacking in it. To
   this I reply: That a distinguishing power is useful, because man is not
   yet in thorough poverty, and because he is still burdened with manifold
   things. Hence he must put up with this aptitude to distinguish. In this
   imperfect condition the power of distinguishing must not be set aside,
   and has its use. But when man hath come to the point where his being is
   simplified and weaned from all that is manifold, and when he thus
   cometh into true poverty, then he must leave all distinction through
   images, and must transfer himself with One into One, without any
   distinction. For if he remained on the ground of distinctions, he would
   commit faults, and would not be thoroughly poor. Furthermore, to
   distinguish is useful, for man cannot be taught in any other way than
   through distinctions. Thirdly, because while man is in time, he hath a
   working in time, according to the outer man; and a clear rational
   distinction is necessary in order that man may not remain in time, and
   that the outer man may be in due subordination to the inner. Fourthly,
   distinction is useful, because man cannot remain long without manifold
   sinful impressions, and these man must resist by distinctions, so that
   he may remain pure and poor. And thus, therefore, is poverty a likeness
   with God; for it is a pure, simple Being, separate and apart from all
   creatures.

6.

   The question now occurs: Shall then man be poor and lacking even graces
   and virtues, for grace is a creature, and virtues are creaturely? To
   this I answer: Grace is nothing else than a light which God draweth
   from Himself, and He poureth it into the soul, and the soul thereby
   passes from the bodily to the spiritual, from time to eternity, and
   from the manifold to the simple. Thus when the soul is raised above all
   the bodily over time and all that is manifold, so as to become a naked
   spirit, dwelling in eternity and uniting itself to the Only One--when
   come to this, grace is changed into God, [13] so that God no longer
   draweth the soul after the manner of a creature, but He leadeth it with
   Himself in a godlike manner. He leadeth it from Himself to Himself; as
   St. Augustine saith: "O Lord, give me another Thyself, that I may go
   from Thee to Thee." And arrived at this point, the soul is poor in
   grace and emptied of it.

7.

   Next has a man to be poor in virtues? Virtues are creaturely in
   operation but Divine in intention, and God doth not accept virtue
   according to the working but according to the intention, and man has to
   work from a pure intention, that is, God: Behold now, virtue is no
   longer a creature but Divine, for all things work through the end in
   view. Thus therefore God shall be thy end, and nothing else; and hence
   virtue consists well with poverty. Again, man has to be poor in virtue
   in this sense, that he has so completely worked out all virtues that he
   hath lost the mere image of virtue, and he hath no longer virtue as an
   accident but in his essence, and not in a manifold direction but in
   unity; and he works virtue in unity. Arrived at this point again,
   virtue is no longer a creature but Divine. And as God comprehendeth all
   things in Himself, so also a purely poor man comprehendeth all the
   virtues in a simple love, and in love he worketh all virtues, and these
   virtues are essential, and they consist well with poverty. For a man
   can never become genuinely poor unless all the virtues make up his
   being.

8.

   Another objection. Are we to understand by the term poverty of spirit,
   as some say, that it means when a man has what he requires bodily, he
   yet holds this possession, unwillingly, inwardly? And the question is
   if such a man hath virtue essentially in the same way as a poor man,
   lacking all things both outwardly and in the spirit. My answer is this:
   A man begins to enter into what is essential when he is empty of all
   that is accidental. For if he is empty of all accidents, this is a sign
   that Divine Love hath withdrawn from him all temporal things, and that
   he stands empty and naked, lacking all things, outwardly and inwardly.
   In this condition he hath not the faculty or property of working some
   virtues with materials, and can only let himself be in all virtue,
   given up with a simple will to God. Now another man cannot be thus, who
   is not yet emptied of all outward accidents, and from whom Divine Love
   hath not drawn away all external things, and who is not entirely
   stripped of all natural possession. Hence he cannot have virtue in
   essence but in accidence. But what is accidence? It is a thing which
   now is and then is not; and accordingly it now works virtue, but only
   as it occurs or presents itself to him. But a genuinely poor man
   worketh alway virtue, and as his being is indestructible so also his
   virtue cannot be destroyed. For this reason it is called essential, for
   it is like or equal to being.

9.

   It has been said: Whosoever hath one virtue hath all virtues. [14] That
   is true. For all the good that a man can do outwardly or inwardly
   belongs to a virtue, which ought to be perfect. And if he turns all
   things to this virtue he thereby wins the essence of virtue, and with
   its essence he draws to himself all other virtues and makes them
   essential. If, then, a man hath not placed all things in virtue, the
   essence of virtue has escaped him; hence he cannot have all virtue
   essentially as he himself is not like unto its essence and being.

10.

   From this it follows also that the perfection of man is not only to be
   taken as implying emptiness of the internal, but likewise of the
   external man; for a man is not only man through the soul, but also
   through the body. Hence man is not perfect only by lacking everything
   in the inner spiritual man, but he must also be entirely lacking in the
   outer man, as far as it is possible. When then a poor man hath turned
   all things into virtue outwardly and inwardly, then and then only is he
   perfect: for perfection stands founded on virtue.

11.

   Some one may say: Supposing a man has withdrawn himself from all
   creatures and yet creatures turn to him with favour, would not this
   hinder poverty? My answer is: If man is in himself emptied of all
   things, whatsoever befalls him without his co-operation, is a gift of
   God, and is the best thing for man, whatever it be, be it grateful or
   painful, sour or sweet. For when a man turneth himself away from all
   things and holds on to God, God must needs go to meet him with all
   good, be it bodily or spiritual. He must take it all from God and not
   from creatures.

12.

   But what shall a man do if too much or too little accrues to him? If
   too much accrues to him, he must not stand upon the ground of
   accidents, but take steps that he may always remain a poor man. If any
   one give him a hundred marks, let him take heed that he doth not become
   richer thereby; for his riches are God and not temporal things. Shall
   he then take all that is given to him? If he taketh it, he maketh
   himself laden with it and no longer empty. But if he refuses it, he has
   less reward than if he took it. But, supposing he who wishes to give it
   is himself poor,--or, again, if he is so rich in charity that he keeps
   nothing and gives all away, or, further, if he wishes to give it thee
   from natural love,--then take it not, let him be cumbered with it,
   while you are empty and free. But if the giver be rich in goods but
   poor in love, and he giveth thee through God and you are in need of
   help, take; and if something over thy necessity give it to others. And
   if this puts on thee a burthen, it is not really such, but a work of
   God.

13.

   If, again, too little falls to thy share, then seek to free thyself
   from thy necessity. If any one giveth thee, take it. If they do not
   give thee, suffer in patience. For want is sometimes as profitable as
   possession. For in want a man knoweth himself better than in having;
   for in the lack of temporal things man is prepared for the reception of
   everlasting things, and in the sickness of bodily power man gains much
   in spiritual strength, which surpasses all bodily powers; as St. Paul
   says: "Righteousness is made perfect in weakness." [15]

14.

   It may be inquired: Supposing a poor man addresses himself to rich
   people, can he find complete love and truth in them? I answer: No; and
   I will establish this with a little discourse. First, "Like cleaves to
   like," a lesson of Aristotle, 17 Eth. Nic. 1165, b. 17. [16] Hence
   where there is disparity there is no love. Secondly, they have not the
   true ground from which spring forth love and truth. Thirdly, what they
   do of charity to poor men is done from fear of hell and love of heaven;
   and this is not genuine charity or truth, for they love themselves in
   it. And if they could get to heaven without poor people they would not
   have much friendship for them. Fourthly, if they ever testify truth and
   love to a poor man, it is not thorough, but a part and a fraction, and
   is not perfect, for they do not learn to love all that belongs to it,
   but only a little, and that with difficulty and under much pressure.
   Fifthly, a poor man is removed from all creatures, and they are still
   laden with creatures, and therefore they cannot show with love that
   they cherish the poor man out of love, and thus he remaineth unloved by
   them. Sixthly, genuine love is a thorough going forth out of yourself
   and apart from all things; and hence if these people have not gone
   forth from themselves and all things they cannot have love. Seventhly,
   genuine love is spiritual, for it springs from the Holy Ghost,--and
   they are bodily, and hence they cannot show spiritual love. Therefore a
   really poor man doth not reckon much on rich people when he suffers
   want. Eighthly, a poor man is unknown by all rich people, therefore he
   is also unrequited, for the being ignored also begets lack of love, as
   St. Augustine [17] saith: "The things that we see we love them well,
   but other things that we don't know or recognise, we also love them
   not."

15.

   God is a free capacity, so also is poverty a free capacity, unchained
   by any one; for its nobility is freedom. The soul, as long as it is
   laden with temporal and sinful things, is not free, but is a burthen.
   What makes a burden? Coarseness, blindness, the lack of virtue. Thus
   temporal things are coarse and blind, and make the soul unvirtuous.
   Therefore, if she wishes to be noble and free, she must empty herself
   of temporal things. Poverty is empty of all things, and therefore
   poverty is noble and free.

  In the next place, how true poverty is a free capacity or power (vermögen)

16.

   The question here occurs: What is freedom? Freedom is a complete purity
   and detachment, which seeketh the Eternal; freedom is an isolated, a
   withdrawn being, [18] identical with God, or entirely attached to God.
   Poverty is an isolated condition, an existence, withdrawn from all
   creatures, and therefore poverty is free. A free soul dismisses all
   defect and all created things, and penetrates into the increate good,
   that is, God, [19] and acquires it with violence, as Christ saith: "The
   kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the mighty take it." [20] God
   is the kingdom of heaven to souls; if therefore she leaveth all things
   and clingeth to God alone, she acquireth God by constraint. For God
   cannot withhold Himself; He must give Himself to her, for it is His
   nature that He communicates Himself to the soul that is receptive of
   Him. To a free soul all things are equal--pleasure or pain, chiding or
   praise, riches or poverty, weal or woe, friend or foe. A free soul
   cloth not let itself be drawn away by anything that might separate it
   or mediate between it and God, as St. Paul saith: "Who shall separate
   us from God?" [21] All things rather further it to God, and she
   presseth forward through, all that intervenes to her first original. A
   free soul seizes and wins all virtue, and not only virtue, but also the
   essence of virtue; and nothing binds it except virtue, and the most
   intimate and purest virtue; but this is no bond, rather is it the way
   of freedom. And then is the soul thoroughly free, when she can only
   endure what is best and entirely abandons evil. For freedom does not
   consist in sins, but slavery; as St Paul saith: Whosoever committeth
   sin, he is the slave of sin, and not a free agent. [22] Genuine freedom
   is so noble that no one giveth it save God the Father; for it is a
   power flowing immediately from God the Father into the soul, and giving
   all capacity to the soul; as St. Paul saith: "I am able to do all
   things in Him that strengtheneth me." [23]

17.

   The soul when she dives into herself perceives what she was, what she
   is, and what she is not; what she was after a sinful fashion, and this
   she comprehends with bitterness; and bitterness, remorse, distress, and
   displeasure, make her pure. Then in this purity springeth up a clear
   light, which showeth her all truth; and the Holy Ghost causeth the
   light to burn, intensely and hotly, and driveth the soul through it
   into all truth, which hath been shown to her, and by no means suffers
   her to return to her old sins, but leads her freely into all truth,
   without any necessity of further insight. And when she cometh thus into
   the truth, and is taken up with the truth, and freedom hath tasted the
   truth, this truth becomes to her so sweet and comforting that she
   leaveth all things and cleaveth to the truth, and then giveth up the
   freedom of her will and maketh herself poor. And on her going forth out
   of her own will, God receiveth her will, and clothes her with His will
   and makes it free, and gives it all capacity with Him; as St. Paul
   says: "Whoso cleaveth to God, he is one spirit with God." [24] And in
   the poverty of her will, this her will is ennobled and elevated, and
   not abased, but much rather set free as though she had not become
   emptied of her will. The Master of Nature [25] says: "Everything that
   is most intimate with the first cause is the most noble." Hence, when
   the soul hath united her will with the Divine Will, it becomes truly
   noble and free; and if the will is otherwise it is not free. And in the
   union of her spirit with the Divine Spirit, the soul is capable of all
   things freely; for "where the Spirit is, there is freedom," as St. Paul
   saith. [26] Hence poverty is a likeness with God; for with God it can
   do all things.

18.

   I hear a voice say: If a man goes out of his own will, and gives
   himself into obedience to another man, does he not lose his freedom? To
   this I answer: That man gives himself up to another in four ways.
   First, inasmuch as he is ignorant, and is taught, he gives himself up
   to another. Secondly, inasmuch as he is not dead to all sins, and that
   he may the more readily die to all inequality in truth, he also giveth
   himself up to another. Thirdly, he gives himself up from genuine
   humility; he does not look to see if he understands the truth and is
   dead to sins, but holds himself to be nothing else than a sinner, and
   therefore he gives himself up to another and doth not trust himself. In
   the fourth place, he gives himself up to the commandments of the Holy
   Church; what he is told to do that he does willingly.

19.

   But the case is different, as I will show, with a thoroughly perfect
   poor man, who has become empty of himself and of all things. First, he
   need not give himself over through ignorance, for a poor man is a pure
   man; now, where purity is, there is light; where there is light, it
   shineth and showeth what is hidden. A thoroughly poor man is a pure
   light in himself, in which he sees and recognises all truth, and need
   not go out of himself nor seek it elsewhere. For in this going forth he
   is easily led into intermediate and manifold distractions. Rather doth
   he go into himself, where he findeth all that he requires. For in this
   movement in which he really drops himself and all creatures, God must
   give Himself to him in all truth; then if he hath God, he needeth
   nothing more. [27]

20.

   Furthermore, it is not needful for him to go out of himself for the
   sake of dying. For he is dead to all sins: he who is dead to them, has
   no need of further dying. But here it may be asked if a man can come to
   this in time, that he hath no more to die? Man certainly comes to this
   in time, that creatures find in him nothing more to kill, for he has
   gone out of himself and out of all creatures. In this state was St.
   Paul when he said: "I have reckoned all things as dung." [28] Hence the
   deaths of a poor man are so subtle and hidden that few creatures can
   detect them. But man never comes to this in time; God always finds
   something to kill in him. Therefore, it is not necessary for a man who
   hath abandoned self, to give himself up to creatures; but he should at
   all times give himself up to God.

21.

   In the third place: A poor and pure man need not give himself to any
   man through humility, for he hath in himself the roots of all humility.
   Nor is it, needful for him to show his humility to creatures, for God
   understandeth his heart well; as Christ saith "Learn of me, for I am
   meek and humble of heart." [29] Have humility of heart, that is enough.
   An objection may be made that "it is not enough for man to have virtue
   in him, but he should manifest it, that people may be bettered." I
   answer to this: If thou art gone out from thyself and quite withdrawn,
   people will be much more improved on thy account, if they wish it,
   through this thy withdrawal than through thy co-operation. It may,
   however, be urged: Granting that a man in himself understandeth all
   truth and hath overcome all sin, yet is it good that he should not
   assume this to himself, and it is better for him to trust another than
   himself. To this I say: He should not assume it, but give it to God,
   and to no creature; for no creature can give such truth and singleness,
   for God only giveth them.

22.

   In the fourth place: A purely poor man is also not bound to take
   externally, like another man, all that is legally prescribed in holy
   Christianity; for those who do this are not wholly emptied of
   themselves. And that which holy Christianity worketh in an external
   manner the poor man worketh inwardly and essentially. For in manner and
   form enters the manifold, but essence is without manner or form. And
   the poor man is thus simplified in essence, and therefore he cannot mix
   himself with the manifold, as St. Paul saith: "All laws are not binding
   to the righteous." [30] For the law is only there to make people leave
   sin and win virtue. The really poor man hath left all sins and won all
   virtue. But how shall a thoroughly poor man hold himself under the law?
   He should in simplicity do all that he can and that appertaineth to
   him, and the rest he should leave; yet he should not despise it nor
   hold it to be evil but good; for all is good that holy Christianity
   hath set forth. And thus to the poor man abideth always his freedom,
   and yet he is very submissive and obedient.

23.

   Now the question might occur: How is it then with the poor men, who are
   in a community, when one gives himself up to another and is obedient to
   him? Is not this against freedom? This is explained, because a poor man
   can give himself up in a threefold way.

24.

   First, from the necessity of the body, as to seek bread, through God,
   for his own wants or the necessity of his brother. And if he gains what
   is necessary for himself, he should give himself over to God and watch
   his heart and give God scope to work in him inwardly; and he should let
   God use the strength he has got from the food, and not let himself be
   led astray. For if he let himself fail at all in God's work he would
   not be thoroughly free. For it belongs to the nature of alms that they
   should be consumed in God. And whosoever consumes them otherwise, be it
   with external works or in idleness, he doth not make a proper use of
   his alms nor act according to the true principles of a poor life. If I
   am asked: Should then a poor man always watch his heart and not trouble
   himself about external things, such as spinning and other such work?
   and if he trouble himself with outer works, is this against poverty and
   freedom? I say: A thoroughly poor man owes no one anything, only God,
   and he should always hold himself so, if he wish to do the work of God,
   that God may find him ready. And if this relates to external works, he
   should leave them, nor consider the obedience to man, but he should
   satisfy God and not man. But if he consumes internally so that the body
   can no longer endure it, let him then certainly go forth to an external
   work of charity that may be nearest at hand.

25.

   Secondly, a poor man may give himself up for the sake of virtue in
   himself and in his brethren. In himself this may happen in three ways:
   First, if his nature is burthened or sick, so that it cannot well take
   heed of the heart and turn inwardly to God, in this case he can very
   properly give himself to some work of charity. Then, again, if he hath
   not yet obtained the external virtues, he must exercise himself till he
   has adopted, the essence of virtue. Thirdly, to better his brother,
   that he may give him a good example and image, he should practise works
   of charity; and what he does he should do from pure love, and this does
   not take from freedom but increaseth it. Again, and further, a poor man
   should give himself up and practise acts of charity to his brother in
   three ways: First, when he is deficient in virtue and has no one who
   could help him, he should go out of himself and go to the help of his
   brother,--even if he were in the highest vision and contemplation that
   can exist in time, and did not come to help his brother, he would
   commit a sin. Then, again, he is the follower of our Lord, who
   exercised outward works of charity towards His disciples, and he ought
   to follow His image. Lastly, if he is to possess eternal life, as
   Christ saith, "Come to me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I
   will give you rest." [31] And this means the acts of mercy that God
   will require from every man. And in this way a man can go out of
   himself and give himself up to works of charity. But this doth not
   hinder a man, nor take from him his freedom, but it helpeth in the
   closest manner and gains for him freedom. And the man is not pure and
   free simply if he is pure in virtue, but he ought to exercise himself
   in all virtues that belong to his state, and then he is pure and free,
   and then he can without any sin dive into himself and take heed of his
   heart.

26.

   In the third place, a poor man ought to give himself up to an external
   work of charity when he is warned by God to do so, and he ought not to
   resist God; he should satisfy his Creator in this, and give himself up
   in all that God requireth of him.

27.

   Here it might be objected: How is a man to understand if the motive to
   an external work be from the Evil Spirit, or from Nature, or from God?
   For internal works that God worketh in the soul are far better than
   external works of charity, and yet both must exist. I shall consider
   this distinction quite briefly, for much might be said on the subject,
   which I pass over at present. First, let us see how the Evil Spirit is
   to be recognised in the way in which he stimulates to acts of charity.
   First, if a man is stirred out of his internal recollection and moved
   to address himself to wealthy persons, and to give himself up to them
   and to satisfy them without any necessity of virtue, and if he wastes
   his time unprofitably with them and lives comfortably with them in much
   ease, in eating and in drinking, and if he fancies that his nature
   needeth his ease, that he may be stronger, and may serve God better,
   and if he grasps at more than his necessity, and becometh heavy laden
   and disturbed and given to manifold cares, so that he cannot so well
   enter again into his heart as if he had remained at home, this motive
   and tendency are from the Evil Spirit and from his bodily nature. For
   bodily nature also findeth its pleasure in these things. St. Paul
   saith: "The kingdom of heaven is not eating and drinking, but peace,
   joy, and righteousness."' [32]

28.

   Further: Another motive proceedeth from the Evil Spirit if a man
   favours rich people and gives them what is due to poor people, as, for
   example, to invite them, and to live on a good footing with them, for
   in doing this such a man seeketh praise and honour, and that people
   should invite him again, and thereby he neglects virtue, and he gets no
   reward for this conduct, but much tribulation. Christ saith: "If thou
   makest a feast, thou shalt not invite thy friends nor the rich, but
   thou shalt invite the poor, and thou shalt not have thy reward here,
   but in the kingdom of heaven." [33]

29.

   In the third place: If a man is by himself and God worketh works in
   him, and if he thinks he is too weak and he cannot suffer it, and turns
   himself outwardly into time, to unnecessary works of charity, and in
   the distraction of the senses, and of a bodily nature, if it be
   difficult to the body to be much recollected internally, this again is
   a temptation of the Evil One and of nature. In the fourth place, the
   motive is also inspired by the Evil Spirit if a man turns himself to
   external works of charity beyond all measure or necessity; for example,
   in excessive fasting and watching, and other severe practices, by which
   a man is unbalanced and his senses are in some degree perverted so that
   he becomes half foolish, and by which he departs so much from himself
   that he can never again revert to his own heart, and he becomes so
   seriously ill that for this reason he is obliged to give up many good
   works which God would have worked in him. Therefore St. Paul spoke in
   this connection, "Let your service be in moderation." [34]

30.

   Further, to discern if the external work of charity is dictated by
   Nature observe this: Whatsoever is turned to self or considers self in
   a work of charity, that is a work of Nature; for Nature always loveth
   and proposeth self. Again, if a man exerciseth himself in bodily joys,
   and testifieth love to them, that is also readily seen to be from
   Nature, for sinners also practise those things amongst one another.
   Thirdly, if rich people show trust and faith one to another that is
   also from Nature, for like adheres to like naturally: therefore if a
   poor man cumbers himself about rich folk, this is a sign that he hath a
   certain likeness with them, and hath not yet contemned all things; for
   if he had despised all things he would not hold much intercourse with
   rich people, for virtue would consist in only doing this as far as
   necessity directeth.

31.

   In the third place, how is a man to discern if an external act of
   charity is prompted by God? To determine this observe: Man has to keep
   three things in view in his work. First, the necessity of the person
   whom he serves, if that person needs his services,--in which case he
   ought to come to the help of every man, friends or foes, bad or good.
   For in a case of necessity no one is excluded, as Christ saith: "Pray
   also for those who despitefully use you and do good to them that hate
   you, that ye may be children of your heavenly Father, who causeth His
   sun to shine on the evil and the good." [35] And that is a divine work
   of charity if it is a case of necessity and is performed with modesty.

32.

   Again, a man ought to keep in view the distinction of persons in his
   works of charity. He should be more prone to a good man, who consumeth
   all things in God, than to a man in whom he doth not recognise much
   good. For in a good man all things are fruitful and to the praise of
   God, and all things are in him referred to their first source. And
   although it be true that God at all times worketh in a good man, that
   he be strengthened so that he may be able to support the work of God,
   yet you should come to his help rather than to that of another man, in
   whom God does not work so purely or unimpeded. And also all things are
   more the property of a good man than of him who hath them; and
   therefore if a man wisheth to atone for his sins, he ought to impart to
   a good man that which he hath; and further, a good man can obtain much
   more for him for whom he prayeth, and God giveth ear to him sooner than
   to another man.

33.

   In the third place: A man ought to keep in view, in his external act of
   charity, the proper ordering of time and of himself. In regard to time,
   in the morning a man ought to take special heed of his heart, and not
   cumber himself much about external works, unless a great necessity
   intervene. For things are easier to a man in the morning, and at that
   season he can more effectually turn to God than at any other time. And
   afterwards, in the afternoon, a man may very properly exercise himself
   in external acts of charity; but again, at vesper time, he should take
   heed of the state of his heart. Thus we see that he should keep order
   in the regulation of his time. He must also observe order in the
   management of himself. For if he feeleth himself well moved towards
   God, and if God driveth him from external things to Himself, he should
   give place to God, and suffer Him to work internally in him. And at
   such moments he may be quite empty of all external works, unless there
   be a case of great necessity. Afterwards, when God no longer worketh in
   him, and this internal working is withdrawn from him, he ought to give
   himself to external work in necessary works of charity, and for him
   thus to work is a divine act of charity.

34.

   A man can also detect a divine work of charity, when he is always
   inspired by complete devotedness to the work, and when he proposeth
   nothing in it save the honour of God and the necessity of his fellow
   man, when he doth not seek any natural pleasure in it, nor any motive
   save the honour and glory of God. And such works of charity should be
   wrought by a poor man, and he should readily leave all other kinds of
   work, whether prompted by the evil spirit or by nature, and therefore
   poverty is a free property and power.

35.

   I hear a voice saying: How then about an ill-regulated freedom, and how
   is a man to know if his freedom is regulated by God or not? Notice
   here: Godlike freedom springeth from true humility, and endeth in
   humility, and in patience, and in all virtues, and in God Himself. For
   if a divine poor man, who is free, be attacked either by man or by the
   evil spirit, he becometh more humble and patient, and draweth nigher to
   God, and committeth all things to Him, and he keepeth silence and
   suffereth and thanketh God. But freedom of a lower class springeth from
   pride and endeth in pride, and in anger, and in insolence, and in other
   vices. For if an imperfectly free man is attacked, he becometh
   wrathful, and seeketh revenge at once, and falls into arrogance, into
   hatred, judgment, and slander, against him who disputes with him, and
   he cannot contain himself, but must break out into revenge by means of
   vices. It may quite well happen that they wish to do this from a sense
   of justice, and they are so far free that they are not willing to
   depart from justice, and think they are giving honour to God in their
   opposition. But this justice is false, for it doth not spring from
   genuine humility, but from pride, as a teacher saith: "False justice
   hath hardness, but true justice hath pity and compassion." [36] In this
   manner, ill-regulated free men are to be recognised by their unvirtuous
   sallies, but just and free men by their humble silence, by their
   long-suffering and resignation to God. And their silence is not from
   fear, but because they perceive that their speech doth not bring fruit,
   therefore are they silent. If, however, God willeth that they do so,
   they speak without all fear. And they are able to endure much for the
   truth; but unjust free men are much troubled with the necessity and
   help themselves, as far as they are able, to get rid of the suffering,
   if possible.

36.

   It also happens often that a just and free man is viewed as
   ill-regulated. Thus, when a thing is proposed to him that is good, and
   he recognises that it is not the best for him, and he turns to this
   best and is satisfied with it;--this, his conduct, is often held to be
   bad, and yet it is good. And an imperfectly free man is also often
   considered as well regulated; for example, when he ought to practise a
   virtue, which is a case of necessity, and he omits to do so, and wishes
   to be singly occupied with himself. This is often reckoned as good, and
   yet it is evil. For we ought to work virtues, if a necessity occur, and
   remain singly with ourselves, if that is also convenient and fitting.

37.

   There are two kinds of ill-regulated freedom. One is bodily, the other
   spiritual.

38.

   Bodily freedom cometh from temporal good, from honours and friends and
   power. For whosoever hath much property, honours, and friends, and is
   powerful, wishes to be the best, and wishes to be noble and free. And
   this freedom is not regulated, for it doth not spring from God. And it
   is seldom that a man is taken up and implicated in property and
   honours, or with friends or power, who is at the same time
   unembarrassed with imperfect freedom. But whosoever wishes to be thus
   perfectly free, must have departed from property, and honours, and
   friends, and power, and must have come to the true ground of humility.
   For in this ground springeth up true freedom, and from no other ground;
   for true freedom is a capacity for all virtue and an abandonment of all
   vice. An objection may be urged that no one is capable of all virtue,
   though he hath left the cause of all vice. Now temporal goods, worldly
   honour, friends, and power are a cause of vice and sins, therefore it
   must follow of necessity that he who wisheth to have genuine freedom in
   order that he may obtain all virtue, must leave and be empty of all
   temporal things, honours, power, and friends. Seneca alludes to this
   when he saith: "Whoso wisheth to be quite free in his mind must be poor
   and like a poor man." [37] Poor men are accused of being irregularly
   free; but it is the rich who are so, who retain property in temporal
   goods, and try to vindicate themselves with subtle pretences, and wish
   to come to the same degree of perfection as a thoroughly poor man, and
   think they can obtain the best internally, without external poverty. It
   is good if this come to pass. But the Gospel saith not so. It saith
   indeed, "you should leave it and not keep it," [38] and those who keep
   it, and yet wish to be perfect, belong to a lower class of freedom.
   Ill-regulated freedom has also this peculiarity, that it sins without
   punishment or fear, and assumes to itself virtue without acquiring it
   or accomplishing it, and places itself in seeming perfection, without
   having abandoned itself and all things.

39.

   The other kind of ill-regulated freedom ia spiritual. For it proceedeth
   from the spirit and is possessed by spiritual people and clerics, and
   it is brought forth in three fashions.

40.

   First, when a man turns away from a sinful life and attacks his body
   with severity, and exercises himself in a penitential life, and works
   virtues externally, and doth not examine himself internally, and doth
   not perceive God in himself, and thus remains all along an external
   man,--this man remains unknown to himself. For true knowledge springeth
   from within and not from without. Since, therefore, they are external
   and not internal, the truth remains unknown to them, and they fall from
   blindness into an ignorance of themselves. If they carry on a great
   many exercises, they fancy themselves the best, and thus a kind of
   spurious freedom arises in them, leading them not to give way to any
   one, for they think themselves the best through the manifold nature of
   their works. These are, indeed, good men, but they cannot subsist
   without defects, for internal light is wanting to them. And thus they
   fall into an ill-regulated freedom, and into a despising and judging of
   others. And it is very distressing to live and move with such people,
   for these men, while they stand alone in their external works, never
   come to genuine humility. They may all show externally an humble
   carriage, but they are not so fundamentally. But the ground of genuine
   humility is born from within, and not only from without. Some one might
   say: What is the use of external observance, penance, &c., as they
   don't place a man in perfection, and even cause ill-regulated freedom
   to spring up in a man? To this I reply that external practices are good
   and useful if they are used in an orderly manner and in moderation; and
   if, over and above them, a man examines and watches himself internally,
   and giveth himself up to God. The outer life is imperfect without the
   inner, and, in like manner, the inner without the outer. They both
   belong together to the structure of perfection, and neither is
   sufficient without the other.

41.

   Furthermore, an ill-regulated freedom is brought forth if a man hath
   exercised himself in external good works, and he then leaveth the
   manifold and turneth into himself, and remaineth within. For in this
   withdrawal into himself there springeth up a natural light in him, and
   this shows him the distinction of natural truth. And this distinction
   begets a great pleasure, and this pleasure drives him on to know still
   more truth, so that he becomes intellectually developed; but the reason
   and intellect are from nature. Therefore he stands still in his natural
   light, and he comprehends what he will through distinction, and he
   fancies he has all truth and distinctions in him. Then he falls back
   with pleasure on himself, and he fancies that no one is equal to him,
   and that he is so free that he should give way to no one, for he weens
   that no one knoweth the truth which he understands, and therefore he
   forms judgments of other people, as that no one comprehends the truth
   as perfectly as he does, and a pride riseth up in him, and he takes
   pleasure in forming distinctions, which is so agreeable to him that he
   pays no attention to virtue and good works. And from this ariseth an
   ill-regulated freedom, so that he despiseth all the laws of holy
   Christianity. And inasmuch as he goeth into his natural light to
   recognise all things, it comes to pass that he willeth to know faith
   according to a figurative manner, and he cannot thus know it. And
   inasmuch as he thus stands in ignorance of faith, and yet would gladly
   know it, the evil spirit comes in, and presents a false light to him as
   a true one, and he gives himself up to it, and grasps it as a truth,
   and yet it is false, and he cometh thereby to fall. And his fall is in
   some degree like Lucifer's fall, for he is spiritual, and he can
   scarcely ever rise again, and all that he doeth he holds to be no sin
   at all. And for this reason the sin remains unpunished and unrepented.
   And no man can come to the help of this man, but God only. And these
   men are called free spirits. But it is an evil freedom, and it is never
   the freedom which hath been spoken of before, and which appertaineth to
   a pure, poor man. For it proceedeth from the evil spirit; but the other
   freedom is from God. And it is necessary to be very careful in
   intercourse with these men; and no man can recognise in time these
   persons except a perfect man, who is enlightened both with natural and
   with divine light.

42.

   In the third place, an ill-regulated freedom is generated by visions,
   as when a man is ravished in ecstasy, and seeth something that was
   hidden from him before, and this does not happen without means, as St.
   Paul saith, and thereby a man cometh to think that he is in a very
   edifying state; [39] and thus a freedom that is often irregular
   springeth up in him; for it doth not originate in genuine humility.
   And, moreover, the evil spirit can deceive the man, for he may present
   to him a false image, which leads him to think he is very favoured, as
   St. Paul saith, that the evil angel may take on himself the likeness of
   a good angel; [40] and therefore we ought not to believe in all
   spirits, for man is easily deceived. And these men will hardly endure
   that you chide them.

  In the third place, how true poverty is a pure working.

43.

   God is a pure working, therefore also is poverty a pure working; and
   each thing worketh according to its form. Poverty is a pure, simple
   working. Perhaps some one might say, What does pure signify? That is
   pure which is one, a unity, and severed from all else. Poverty is one,
   and severed from all difference, and therefore poverty is pure. That
   therefore which is pure worketh purely. What then is working? Working
   is nothing else than making something out of nothing, or making of one
   thing another, or making a thing better than it was before, or making
   into nothing something that is. And this mode hath poverty to itself.

44.

   First, Poverty maketh something out of nothing. Thus when a man hath
   left all that is not God or godlike and cleaveth only to God, God must
   needs give himself and all things back again to such a man. Hence, what
   was not his before, becometh now his own, as, for example, the good
   works that other men work, and also those that Christ worked ever, and
   all the saints, and all good men have worked, or still work, and will
   work, these are the property of a pure man, as though he had worked
   them himself. For in the fact that he goeth out of himself and out of
   all things that are not God, and turneth to God with all love, he
   obtains thus a community with God and all things that are godlike; and
   what he is then incapable of doing by works he accomplisheth through
   love. What another doeth through works that he maketh his own through
   love, for "love appropriates other's virtues," as St. Gregory saith.
   [41] And thus a poor man maketh out of nothing something. Further, a
   poor man's works are so widely spread, so broad, that in a moment he
   worketh all works. And internally and hi isolation he worketh all
   external and internal works that are good, and he worketh them not by
   accident but essentially; and as the essence of a thing is much nobler
   than accidents, thus the virtues of a poor man are much nobler than
   those of another man who worketh virtue in accidents.

45.

   Secondly, poverty maketh out of one work another. For instance, when a
   man is overladen with time and creatures he hath also his working in
   time and with the creature, and he cannot be empty of them. When now he
   turneth himself from time and from creatures, and turneth to God and to
   eternity, he hath henceforth his working with God and in eternity, and
   no longer in time and with the creature; hence out of time he maketh
   eternity, and out of the creature, God. And this is what poverty
   seeketh, and therefore is its working pure.

46.

   Thirdly, poverty changeth a good work into something better and more
   perfect; as, for example, when a poor man goeth on the way of God, and
   his going is always to something better and more intimate; as St.
   Gregory saith, "The going in the way of God is always a forward march."
   [42] And thus a poor man goeth always in the truth, and increaseth,
   while he is in time; and therefore poverty is a pure working, as he
   maketh things continually better and still better.

47.

   In the fourth place, poverty hath this, that it destroyeth one thing
   and maketh another in its stead. Thus a man has inherited from the fall
   of Adam that his nature is full of sinful inclinations; and to destroy
   these man must do it by virtues,--and in the stead of each sin must
   this man place a virtue; [43] and thus we must overcome vice with
   virtue. He who wisheth to cast out all vice must have all virtue, and
   in no other way can you overcome vice save by virtues. Hence poverty is
   a pure working, for it continually killeth vices and seizes hold of
   virtues and obtains them. Wherefore we must at all times exercise
   ourselves in virtues if we would be empty of vices; for whensoever a
   man is empty or idle with respect to virtues vice gains power over him.
   If, then, a poor man at all times worketh virtue vice hath no power
   over him. All things are a virtue to him if he proposeth God's honour
   in all things. Of this St. Paul speaks when he saith, "To the pure all
   things are pure." [44]

48.

   But some one might say: How can there be working in poverty, for
   poverty is a mere state of being, and what is mere or simple is
   immovable, whereas working is movable and takes place in movement? How
   then can poverty and working agree together? To this I answer and say,
   that poverty is a likeness to God. Now God is in Himself immovable, and
   yet He moveth all things; so likewise is poverty in itself a stationary
   being, immovable and yet with God it moveth all things. For poverty is
   dissolved in God and united to Him; that then which is one hath one
   working. Now God and poverty are one, and therefore poverty worketh
   with God all things, and yet it remaineth pure and simple and immovable
   with God. Again, man is compounded of time and eternity. When, then,
   man is raised with the highest forces out of time into eternity, he
   becometh immovable, according to the highest forces; for eternity is
   immovable that, therefore, which is in eternity is immovable also. If
   man with his highest part is in eternity, he is immovable, and yet he
   moveth the lowest forces according to time. For poverty is to be taken
   according to the highest faculties, and the highest faculties are
   immovable. So, therefore, poverty is also immovable, and yet worketh
   with the highest forces in the lowest and not the lowest in the
   highest. A simile. The angel moveth heaven and the things that are in
   heaven, and yet he remaineth unmoved. So also is it here. Thus, then,
   is poverty a pure working and yet immovable.

     __________________________________________________________________

  In man is a natural work, a work of grace and a godly work. In the first
  place--

49.

   There are three kinds of work in man, a natural work, and a work of
   grace, and a godlike work. The first man ought to make pure, the second
   worketh purely, the third is pure.

50.

   First, man hath a natural work in him in three fashions; the first is
   bodily, the second is sensuous, the third is spiritual.

51.

   The first natural work is the bodily, such as eating, and drinking, and
   sleeping; man should make all this pure, that he may not stray from God
   in it. And this is effected by three means. The first is that he should
   observe moderation and measure. And moderation consists in this, that
   is, neither too much nor too little. And man should thus take the
   necessity of the body, that he always remains in the middle or mean
   between excess and too little. And in this measure the work remaineth
   pure, and well regulated in God; but without this measure it is neither
   pure nor regulated. And if a poor man regulates all his works according
   to God, his works are pure. The other property that belongeth to a
   bodily work for it to remain pure, is that a man should take his
   necessity from truth and from the Holy Ghost; he should not help
   himself out with untruthfulness. What is this mendacious help? It is
   when a man asks for alms that be doth not need, and addresses himself
   to people and exaggerates his necessity; this is mendaciously seeking
   help and is unworthy; and a man must drop this if he wisheth his work
   to be pure. He must take his necessity from the Holy Ghost; that is, he
   must not be prompted by his own will, because people do not give him
   anything from natural charity, or for his service, or for his speeches,
   but the Holy Ghost alone must be the mover of the gifts that are
   bestowed on him, and in this fashion the work remaineth pure. Thirdly,
   it also belongeth to a pure bodily work, that what a man eateth or
   drinketh, he should consume in the Holy Ghost. For the heart of man
   ought to burn in the love of the Holy Ghost, and the strength which man
   hath taken from his meal, the Holy Ghost draweth to Himself and burneth
   it in the fire of charity, and maketh it altogether spiritual; and thus
   instead of the bodily force, man becometh a spiritual force, which
   surpasseth all bodily force. And these are genuinely spiritual men, and
   their eating is dearer to God than the fasting of other people, and
   those who eat so, eat God Himself. And that which they eat and drink,
   that consumeth God in them. A comparison. As with the sun, which
   shining hotly draweth the damp on the earth's surface to itself, and
   maketh the earth dry, so is it also here; when the Divine Sun shineth
   in a pure heart, it draweth to itself all that is in the heart, and
   maketh the heart at the same time light and dry, which, thus escaping
   from man, exceedeth all force, yea, far more than if he had worked in a
   mine. And whoso strengtheneth this man, strengtheneth the work of God,
   in which God is well pleased, and in which God cleareth up all things
   in time. And if God did no longer work this work on earth, all that is
   in time would pass away. And this is a specially pure work, which,
   however, belongs quite essentially to a poor man.

52.

   The second natural work is sensuous, such as seeing, hearing, and the
   other five senses, which man ought also to hold in such wise that he
   remains always pure. He should hold them always under the restraint of
   modesty, and only grant them the essentially necessary. For if the
   senses stretch forth beyond necessity, man becomes distracted, and can
   scarcely remain as pure as when his senses were gathered into one; for
   true purity is in unity and not in the manifold. When man is thus
   distracted, he wishes to see and hear all things, which cannot consist
   with purity. Man ought also to curb his senses, because the forces hang
   on one another. And when one works, the others are hindered and
   hampered. Thus, if while he is seeing and hearing outwardly, his
   internal sight and hearing should be led astray, that is an injury.
   Wherefore a man should only take his mere necessity from his senses and
   nothing beyond it, in which case he abideth pure, and he can always use
   them to the honour of God, and not for the pleasure and lust of the
   body. For God will demand an account of our five senses, and therefore
   we ought to direct them usefully.

53.

   The third natural work is spiritual; such as to know, to love, and to
   think. And this ought a man also to use merely according to necessity;
   but how is this to be? Man has. doubtless, from nature the power of
   knowing, and this forms a distinction between him and other animals.
   But he ought to turn this natural knowing to God and to godlike things,
   and draw off from things which are not necessary. For if he turneth it
   to another thing that is not God or godlike, God remains unknown to
   him, and man goes astray. For if Lucifer had turned his natural
   understanding to God when he turned it on himself he would not have
   fallen; but, as he turned it to himself he must needs have fallen, for
   by mere force of nature he could not subsist. The case is still similar
   if a man turneth his reason and his understanding on himself and on
   other things that are not God; for in this case he must fall, even were
   he of as noble a nature as Lucifer. He must fall and he could not
   subsist; for by mere nature no one can subsist. But if he turneth his
   natural understanding in the light of faith to God, and to divine
   things, and if he liveth thus, then God changeth his natural
   understanding into a divine understanding, and confirms him in it so
   that he may not fall. This is brought to pass in the angels, who dwell
   with Him, whom God strengtheneth in such wise that they can no more
   fall. For, at the same instant that they turn their understanding from
   themselves to God, God begets in them His divine nature, [45] and this
   draweth them at once out of themselves into God and confirms them. The
   same thing occurs with man. At the same instant that a man turneth his
   knowledge from himself into God he also becomes strengthened in Him.
   And this happened to the Apostles on the day of Pentecost; for whoso
   rightly knoweth God, he can never take pleasure in mortal sins. If
   Lucifer had rightly known God he might never have fallen. And in this
   way a man is no more possessed of a natural but of a godlike
   understanding. And what he then knoweth, that is from a divine light,
   and never from natural light.

54.

   A comparison from the sun. As soon as be ariseth, he changeth all other
   lights into his light, so that there is no other light. For his light
   being above all other lights, and for that reason, as soon as he
   ariseth, all lesser lights must go down and the sun shineth alone with
   his light. So is it also in a pure soul; when the Divine Sun ariseth in
   it all other lights change into the Divine Light, so that no other
   light remaineth but the godlike light; for God is a Light above all
   lights. When He therefore shineth with His light, it is right and
   necessary that all other lights should set, whether they be natural or
   of grace; but not on that account does it follow that the natural light
   is destroyed. Nevertheless, though it burneth still and is not as a
   thing that doth not exist, it is, however, changed into a divine light
   and transfigured and glorified, just as when the sun ariseth, the
   moon's light is changed into the sun's light and is glorified and
   magnified. So is it also here. St. Augustine saith, "God is never a
   destroyer of nature, but He ordereth it and maketh it perfect." [46]

55.

   Several deny natural knowledge and several attribute it. And it must be
   both denied and attributed. It is to be denied, for though man's
   knowledge can run through all knowledge and distinction, and that man
   has a true distinction of all truth in himself, yet he must leave all
   distinction and carry himself inward with one and into one, and in this
   one he ought to abide. And he ought to contemplate this one with a
   simple and single sight. And then all natural knowledge should depart;
   for natural knowledge consists in images and forms, and man can never
   know God through images, but he must know Him without them, so that the
   spirit must be unclothed of all images; for a teacher saith, "Whoso
   wisheth to know God, he must be unclothed of all creaturely art." [47]
   And knowledge seeketh that which is unclothed, namely, the naked truth;
   and it is never satisfied in no natural fashion till it cometh in
   complete nakedness to see God and know Him without any medium. And when
   it cometh into nudity then all natural marks and signs fall away, and
   the soul becometh unoccupied, and sitteth and resteth in pure
   tranquillity; and then hath the spirit come to its true origin whence
   it flowed. And in this manner is natural knowledge to be denied, and
   this is necessary, that a man become empty of his natural knowledge if
   he wish to have genuine poverty. And in nakedness and poverty his
   knowledge is glorified with divine clarity, so that nothing remaineth
   to him of the knowledge that belongeth to him only naturally. And thus
   man knows all truth when he knoweth what is good or hurtful to him, and
   this man can no longer be deceived by any false light for he is removed
   from all falsity, and therefore falsity can no more have place in him.
   Wherefore Christ saith, To you shall be given the spirit of truth,
   which shall lead you into all truth. [48]

56.

   But natural knowledge must also be attributed to man, that is, when a
   man stands in doubt, and he is yet exposed to error in distinguishing
   the truth, he must then seek distinctions in himself and out of
   himself. For man can never live to the truth unless he has known it
   first. Hence if knowledge is wanting to a man life is also wanting. For
   a true life springeth from a pure knowledge. And as a man needeth
   distinctions and seeketh them not, this is to live like the beasts and
   not like a human being. For man desireth by nature to learn much, and
   therefore is he a man because he comprehendeth the truth, and what
   fails in him that ought he to seek. And in this sense natural knowledge
   is not to be denied but attributed to him. For natural knowledge, if he
   be willing, leadeth a man into the knowledge of grace, and knowledge of
   grace leadeth him to divine knowledge. And in this way a man cometh to
   perfection.

57.

   Perhaps some one will ask. What difference is there between natural
   knowledge and the knowledge of grace? Mark this. Natural knowledge
   seeketh distinction in created things, whether spiritual or bodily, and
   man by nature desireth to know all created things, and the distinction
   that he perceives in them is given to him by his natural knowledge. And
   to know begets in him great pleasure; and he abides in the pleasure,
   and the pleasure driveth him on to know more and more. And if a man
   remains on the ground of natural knowledge so that he cometh not to the
   knowledge of grace or to divine knowledge, he turns his knowledge on
   himself, and holds it as his property, and cometh not to a true and
   genuine self-denial. For mere nature bends itself back on itself, and
   seeketh her pleasure and delight.

58.

   The question might occur, How can a natural man be recognised, whose
   knowledge is merely natural? Among other things he is to be recognised
   by three features. First, by his wishing to be always the most
   distinguished in speech and honours; he wishes also to have most of the
   talk, for he thinketh that no one can do it so well as himself.
   Secondly, he wishes always to have the right of a question, and holds
   that his words are the truest; and if people attempt o dispute his
   words, he becometh wroth, and grasps at any support of his own opinion,
   and will not listen to the opinion of any one else. Thirdly, he thinks
   right and proper all that people credit him with, for he thinks himself
   worthy of all things, and he considers a man to be devoid of reason and
   sense who finds anything more entitled to praise in another person than
   in himself.

59.

   And in this way natural knowledge is hurtful if it abideth in self, and
   doth not come to true denial of self and all things. But man, who is by
   nature discreet, if he cometh to a true denial of self and of all
   things, to him his natural understanding is no injury but useful, for
   he cometh more easily to Divine truth than a man who is coarse and
   stupid by nature. For that which the stupid man seizes with much
   labour, and must seek from far, the intelligent man obtains in himself
   without much labour. For a well-regulated nature, if it have a good
   will, is a great help toward God; but if it have a perverse will and
   keeps to itself it falleth much sooner than a stupid nature. And this
   happened with Lucifer, who was of the noblest by nature, but because he
   kept to himself he was the first to fall. And this happeneth yet; and
   therefore is poverty very noble and useful, for the man standeth alone
   in poverty and in denial of himself and of all things.

  Secondly, of the work and knowledge of grace.

60.

   Next have we to speak of the knowledge which is by grace. This
   signifies that to man in that state is given the power of
   distinguishing the Holy Scriptures, so that he comprehend them in full
   truth, and that in bearing and reading he should understand them in the
   best and most profitable way. And this knowledge is by grace and not
   from nature; for by mere nature you cannot come to a true knowledge of
   the Holy Scriptures. For the Holy Scriptures are from the Holy Ghost,
   and therefore whoso wisheth to understand them properly he must be
   enlightened with the grace of the Holy Ghost. An objection might be
   made, that many understand the Holy Scriptures who have not much grace,
   nor walk in a holy life. That is true; but they only understand them
   according to the sense, and not rightly according to the foundation and
   groundwork thereof. For whoso wisheth to understand them on their right
   ground, that must issue from the life and from the divine grace. Hence
   it is that Holy Writ is understood in the light of grace, and not in
   the light of nature. For genuine poverty is full of grace, and
   therefore is Holy Writ understood by a genuinely poor man. Wherefore
   Christ said, "To the poor the Gospel," [49] for they alone understand
   it rightly. And this is found in the Apostles, who preached the Gospel
   and converted the people, and did not do this by cleverness of natural
   knowledge. Rather did they it in the power of poverty, for therewith
   they overcame all things, and in it they understood all things.
   Doubtless grace is a flowing out from God, and it floweth into the
   soul, but into one that is empty and poor in all things that are not
   God. Then if Holy Writ is only to be understood by grace, and if a poor
   man is alone receptive of the grace of God, then a poor man only
   understandeth Holy Writ properly. Not that a poor man understandeth
   Holy Writ in all the ways in which it can be understood, but he
   understands it in its essence, and he understands the naked truth for
   which all Holy Writ hath been written. For a poor man hath understood
   the essence of all truth. Wherefore it is not needful for him to take
   the truth according to accidents, and that he should understand all
   figures of speech which are in Holy Writ. As Christ said to His
   disciples, "To you it is given to know the mystery of God, but to
   others it must be given in parables." [50] He who understandeth the
   naked truth needeth not a parable. Therefore because a poor man is
   empty of all things that are not like the truth he thence understandeth
   the naked truth, and therewith he has enough.

61.

   The knowledge of grace is also in him the distinction of virtue and
   vice. For it is scarcely possible to leave vice and bring in virtue
   unless you understand them. And, therefore, it is of grace that man
   should understand virtue and vice thoroughly. Natural masters have
   written about virtues, but they never come to the true foundation of
   virtue. They write of virtues, how much pleasanter and sweeter they are
   in their nature, for virtues are undoubtedly and naturally a greater
   source of delight than vice. And in this way they sought their pleasure
   in virtue and nothing else; but they never get into virtue properly;
   for virtue consists in the denial of all natural lust, and they never
   possessed virtue thoroughly, because they sought themselves in it. Now,
   whosoever wisheth to have virtue in a hearty denial of himself, this
   must be of grace and not of nature; and virtue is quite at home there.
   For, whensoever a man has himself in view in virtue, that is not right
   virtue, it is natural virtue, but not of grace, for sinners have it
   also; but virtue in genuine self-denial they cannot have. When,
   therefore, a poor man stands in thorough denial of all natural lust,
   then he understandeth virtue quite in its groundwork. But the masters
   of nature could not come with vices to natural truth, and therefore
   they left vices through the power of natural knowledge. For no man can
   come to natural truth who is too heavily laden with the coarseness of
   sins. Hence these philosophers left vice through nature, and not by
   grace. For the virtue by grace is only for the sake of God, and not
   from natural knowledge, and therefore they did not come to the right
   knowledge of virtue; and this knowledge is of grace.

62.

   This is also of grace, that a man should acknowledge his faults; as St.
   Gregory saith, "It is a great perfection that a man should know his
   imperfection, for sin blindeth a man, so that he may not understand his
   faults." When then a man feeleth displeasure of sins, a light springeth
   up in him, showing him his defects, so that he knoweth what a sin is,
   and thus he leaveth his sins and turneth to virtue. And this
   understanding is of grace. When then a poor man feels a thorough
   disgust at all sins, he thereby has a divine light, showing him all
   sins,--and not only sins, but also the causes of sins,--and not only
   gross sins, but also spiritual and intellectual sins,--which occur in
   the reason and in the will. And a man must have very much light who
   understandeth all sins; and this knowledge can no one have save a
   singly and purely poor man, who stands there in denial of himself and
   of all things. He alone understandeth perfectly all sins, whether
   spiritual or bodily. For this reason is perfection placed in poverty,
   for in poverty alone is all truth understood, all good, all evil,
   without any doubt. In thorough poverty no one can be deceived, for
   deception is in a manner a cleaving to and taking possession, whether
   it be of a spiritual or temporal good, or what seemeth a good. And it
   is in this point that we are liable to be deceived; but in true
   detachment and in genuine self-denial, and in essential truth, no one
   can be really deceived. When then a poor man hath given himself up to
   God, and has thoroughly denied himself, and he doth not take truth
   according to appearance, or show, or splendour, but in its essence,
   which is undisguisedly God or godlike, without all this or that
   (appendages), in this state he cannot be deceived, either in himself or
   in other men. A teacher saith, "That all men can be deceived, except he
   alone cannot be deceived in whom the heavenly Father begetteth His
   eternal Word." And this is only in the man who has given himself up
   entirely to God, and is thoroughly self-denying, and has gone out
   entirely from himself, and who has taken the being of things according
   to their essence and not according to appearance. And no deception can
   be hid in this, all is manifest, so that the man knows what is evil;
   and in this state he leaveth the evil and chooseth the good.

63.

   This also is of grace, that man recognises what injury lies in sin.
   Such injury lies in it that no one can speak of it; for it robs man of
   all good, not only of natural good, but also of spiritual good. For sin
   degrades nature from its nobility and debases it to the ignoble, which
   all creatures hate; nay, even the devil hates it, and yet he can never
   be clear of it, and that is his hell. People say it is human to sin but
   it is not human, but devilish; for sin maketh of man a devil. For those
   who live conscious of it, in mortal sin, these are not men but devils,
   and are even more wicked than devils. For if the devil could come back
   he would not remain in sins; but these men, though they came back, they
   would do the same evil, therefore are they worse than devils. An
   inclination to sin is indeed human, [51] for man has this from Adam's
   fall. But his actual sinning he does from an evil will, and is not from
   nature, for it is rather against nature. For nature is destroyed
   thereby, and degraded from its nobility. Whosoever wishes to come to a
   proper nature, must do it through virtues, and not through vices. For
   nature desires good and not evil, and whenever evil happens, it is a
   suffering to nature. In fact, nature is created for good and not for
   evil, and therefore it hateth all evil. As now sin is evil, sin is
   hated by nature. That men should love sin is not of nature, but it is
   of devilish wickedness, and it is worse than the devil. For the devil
   hateth sin naturally, and yet the fact of his loving it unnaturally,
   this maketh him a devil. Sin does alike; it maketh all who love it into
   devils.

64.

   Several persons blame nature sorely, and these do not know what nature
   is; for nature is noble, and does what is right. Men should blame evil
   and not nature; for God loveth human nature so dearly, that He hath
   created all things for its service, and hath suffered even death in
   human nature, as in His death human nature is raised above the angels.
   Mention is made of natural men as if they were hurtful men, but I say
   that a thoroughly natural man is a pure man; for everything is to be
   taken according to its best. Now nature is good; but what is good is
   also pure, and is without any sinful accident. Thus, then, when a man
   stands in his genuine natural nobility, he is without any sinful
   accident, and that which is without any sinful accident is pure. Hence
   finally a thoroughly natural man is a pure man. That which maketh
   nature impure is a faulty accident of nature, and is not the essence of
   nature. Now just as accidental virtue regulates nature and leads to its
   true source and to its genuine essence, so in like manner vice
   destroyeth nature, and displaces it from its source, so that it never
   cometh to its true essence. And it is much more according to nature to
   work virtue than vice; for virtue places nature firmly and supports it,
   while vice displaces it.

65.

   And this is found in the heathen, who, prompted by genuine nature, left
   vice and worked virtue. For they knew from nature that vice keeps man
   from happiness; as Seneca said: "Even if it were true that the gods did
   not know my sins, and did not avenge them on me, I would still leave
   sin and the soiling of sin." [52] But where natural men are to be
   blamed, is where they keep to themselves selfishly, and possess
   themselves in their own property and ease. And these are very hurtful
   men, for they change their human nature into a devilish nature.
   Lucifer, when he stood in his natural nobility when God had created
   him, was a pure, noble creature. But when he kept to self, and
   possessed himself as a property with his natural nobility, he fell, and
   became instead of an angel a devil. So also is it with man. If he
   cometh to the summit of his nature and stands empty of all accidents,
   his nature is very noble. But if he remaineth in himself and possesseth
   himself of his natural nobility as a property, he falleth, and becomes
   instead of a man a devil. And therefore is sin wicked, as it maketh out
   of an angel a devil, and maketh a man devilish.

66.

   If those who lived in sin only knew in what good they are wanting, yea,
   even natural good, they would suffer the greatest pain to be inflicted
   on them before they would commit a mortal sin. For sin is so bad that
   it robbeth man of all good. They who live in riches and in sin fancy it
   is right well with them, but they know not what woe it is to them. The
   devil prompts to the sins, and especially those of unchastity; but when
   you are unchaste, he flieth and will not have seen it, through the
   thorough wickedness and soiling there is in it. For though he is the
   root of all wickedness, yet for its very uncleanness he hateth this sin
   naturally. Therefore it is a great gain to know the injury of sin. Now
   no one can properly know this injury, save those who have been in sins,
   and have left sins and have come to grace; for it would be a torment of
   hell for them to fall in sins again. For they have more delight and joy
   in one day than all sinners have ever gained. Their labour is
   pleasanter than the rest of a sinner, who can really have none; they
   labour always and rest never, and yet their labour is unfruitful. But
   good men rest alway; not that they sit idly, but their labour is rest.
   For "they have in all things rest," as Solomon saith. [53] But the
   sinner hath disquiet, unrest, in all things. Let him eat, or drink, or
   sleep, or wake, all is painful; let him do what he will, his heart will
   never be joyful. He showeth indeed a certain joy outwardly, so that
   people might fancy he were cheerful. But no joy is there; for the
   ground of joy, out of which joy springeth, is broken up, and he can
   have no joy. He indulges himself sometime, but that doeth also a dog.

67.

   This is also of grace, that a man know each sin, according to its
   degree. One is called a fault, and another a debt, and another a sin,
   and one kind is called a venial sin and another a mortal sin, and one a
   capital sin, and another a sin against God the Father, and God the Son,
   and God the Holy Ghost.

68.

   In the first place, it is a fault for a man to know the good and for
   him to adhere negligently to what is less good; as when a man has a
   useless thought, or speaketh a useless word, or doeth a useless work,
   though he knows well there is a better one, and he doth not attend to
   it; now this is a fault.

69.

   Again, it is a debt, a measure of guilt, if you dwell with pleasure on
   a thing that is bad; as when an evil thought occurs to a man and he
   lingers on it rather too long and with pleasure. This pleasure is
   guilty, and he must suffer pain for it. Further, if he speaketh
   voluptuously improper words, and doeth works of this kind, this is
   guilt.

70.

   In the third place, it is a sin if we do consciously a thing that is
   bad; as uttering a lie, which yet doth not injure any one; this is
   venial sin; or uttering abandoned words and indulging in abandoned
   gestures, so that people are rendered angry by it.

71.

   Fourthly, it is a mortal sin, if man with evil and obstinate will doeth
   that which is forbidden; as he, for example, who breaketh the ten
   commandments, in which the seven deadly sins are forbidden. Thus, in
   the first commandment, "Thou shalt believe in the Lord thy God," which
   condemns unbelief, for unbelief is a mortal sin. Then, "Thou shalt love
   the Lord thy God, and thy neighbour; "in this envy and hatred are
   condemned. "Thou shalt observe high days and holidays; "in this
   indolence is condemned. "Thou shalt not covet any man's wife," in which
   unchastity is condemned. "Thou shalt not covet any man's property," in
   which greed and avarice are condemned. "Thou shalt not worship idols,"
   where gluttony is chastised. "Thou shalt not kill any man," where anger
   is proscribed. [54] Furthermore, to break maliciously the commands
   which Holy Christianity hath set up, is also a mortal sin.

72.

   Fifthly, it is a capital sin if you do what is unnatural and
   inhuman--as to kill, rob, and burn father and mother, and other sins
   that are against nature.

73.

   Sixthly, you sin in God; and first, in God the Father. This occurs if a
   man is tempted, and in the resistance he is so rigid that he sinneth
   through sickness. This sin is in the Father. Again, a man sinneth in
   the Son, when a man sinneth unwittingly. Thirdly, you sin in the Holy
   Ghost, in five ways. First, if a man sinneth against God's mercy;
   again, if a man having sinned, despairs in God's compassion; thirdly,
   if a man entirely resists the counsel of the Holy Ghost, and destroyeth
   it in himself; fourthly, if a man attributes to himself the good that
   he hath from God, whether spiritual or bodily, and thinketh he hath it
   from his own worthiness, and doth not thank God for His goodness as he
   ought; fifthly, when the Holy Ghost wishes to do His work and man
   turneth away from Him, and will not make place for Him, and cumbers his
   heart about other things that are against God, and driveth out the Holy
   Ghost. And this is meant by sinning in the Holy Ghost, and is scarcely
   forgiven.

74.

   It is therefore a great grace that man may know each sin, in its
   degree; for when he knows it, he can more easily guard against it and
   keep himself pure. Since, then, a poor man is full of grace, he has the
   light of grace, which shows him all faults, so that he can well guard
   himself against all defects, and thus he remains pure; and therefore is
   poverty a pure working, for no impurity can hide itself in it.

75.

   It is also of grace that a man knoweth the distinction of spirits.
   There are four kinds of spirits that speak in man, and he must have
   very much light who wisheth to know them.

76.

   First, the evil spirit speaketh in man, and his speaking is in one
   direction to sin, and in another direction to virtue; the third way is
   to perfection.

77.

   First, he adviseth sins. That is, if a man finds himself inclined to
   bodily pleasure, he presenteth to his mind the sin with great sweetness
   and voluptuousness, so that the man thinketh that great delight and joy
   lie in the sin. And the body is inclined to luxury, and if the spirit
   inclineth to the body and the body to luxury, the man cometh to his
   fall and falleth into mortal sin; but if the spirit turneth from the
   body and the body remaineth in its inclination, and yet the spirit will
   not concede it to do any deadly sin, then the evil spirit counselleth
   the man to great venial sins, and thus he falleth into daily venial
   sins. But if it come to pass that the spirit of a man turneth from the
   body and the body wisheth to follow the spirit and do no sin, either
   mortal or venial, then the evil spirit attacketh the man in his belief;
   and thus it must happen that a man should have fighting and spiritual
   combat.

78.

   If, in this condition, a man resist sturdily and invoketh God that He
   may help him to overcome the evil spirit, if he should then overcome
   the evil, this spirit of iniquity maketh himself like unto a good angel
   and counselleth to the man virtue. But this virtue ib above the power
   of nature, and the evil one overdoeth this in order to destroy nature,
   and that man should come into a state of sickness, so as to lose his
   senses. For the virtue which the evil one counselleth is irregular and
   without measure; and the end of the virtue is evil, for it teacheth not
   the mean and stretcheth over it to grasp the end. [55] For example,
   fasting and watching without measure, and other such severe exercises,
   which result in a man getting ill, all this is neither useful to God
   nor to himself, nor any one, and has for its result that he must
   intermit in the performance of many good works. And this is what the
   evil one proposeth by his counsel, that a man should utterly perish.

79.

   But in case a man entereth into himself and vieweth each virtue in its
   proper measure and worketh virtue according to it, he beginneth to go
   into perfection. And when man thus goeth from virtues to virtues he is
   purified from all faults; for the virtues purify a man. And in purity
   springeth up a light, and the light enlightened man in. distinguishing
   manifold truths; and in this distinction the evil one plunges to
   deceive him. For when man understandeth much truth, he cometh at last
   to a truth that he cannot well understand, and he would gladly
   understand it, and yet he is not able to understand it. Then cometh the
   evil spirit and presenteth a false image to him, and this image is
   against faith. Now if it happen that the man takes this image for a
   truth, as often occurreth, he is deceived by the evil spirit, and he
   maketh in that case a spiritual fall, which is very hurtful, for he
   knoweth it not; and if man is to be warned against this, it must come
   to pass through God without any other mediation.

80.

   If now man hath been warned by God, so that it is given to him to know
   that the image is false, he then turneth away and perceiveth what is
   best and cleaveth to it. And thus when the man stands in perfection, so
   that he taketh all to be good that God willeth to have from him, then
   the evil one cometh again and works up pride in him, and makes the man
   think that all other men err and go astray, and that he alone liveth to
   the truth and understands it. If now man should resist this and
   overcome the evil one, and perceive what he is in himself, and that he
   is capable of nothing good without God, then he giveth to God the
   honour, and maketh himself poor, or empty of all truth.

81.

   And with poverty he cometh to the ground and foundation of humility,
   and then the evil spirit can do him no harm, for he cannot come to him
   on the ground of humility, and therefore he cannot injure him. For true
   humility is a firm fastness which no one can capture; men attack it
   indeed and seek to storm it, but it is not to be taken. So also is it
   with true humility; in it man cannot be overcome. The evil spirit
   attacks him indeed in many ways, but he cannot injure the man of true
   humility. But if man stands on any other ground than true humility and
   detachment and poverty then the evil spirit can injure him, and can
   cast down his house, for the foundations are not laid deep enough. But
   true humility hath deep foundations, on which stands firm all that is
   built upon them; and without humility every building must fall. Then
   whoso wisheth to conquer the evil spirit let him place himself on the
   ground of humility, where no one can do him any harm. But now true
   poverty is true humility, and therefore you can do no harm to a poor
   man. He may be helped indeed, but he cannot be injured. For all things
   further him to God, yea, the evil spirit himself is even of use and no
   injury to him, as St. Paul saith, that he wrestled with him and tempted
   him grievously, [56] and the temptation placed him in true humility, as
   he himself said, "Strength is made perfect in weakness." [57]

82.

   The other spirit that speaketh in man is natural, and its speech is in
   images and forms, and thereby he seeketh the distinction of created
   things. And if man's spirit understands all created things, and he is
   empty of all accidental faults, he is in the highest nobility of mere
   nature. But if he keeps to himself, and considereth his nobility with
   satisfaction in himself, he cannot remain in the highest nobility of
   his nature, and falls into an ignoble state, and clothes himself with
   mortality and with manifold defects, for no nature can subsist long
   without accidents, whether these be from sin or grace. But if it come
   to pass that when the natural spirit hath attained the highest summit
   of its nature, it should then turn of itself to God, and contemplate
   the nobleness of God, then the natural nobility of this man is clothed
   upon with the divine nobility, and his nature is united to the divine
   nature, his nature becometh immortal and light and life and truth flow
   into him, and these God begetteth in him alway.

83.

   When the spirit of Adam stood on the highest summit of his nature he
   understood all created things, and that was his delight. And so is it
   still: when the spirit of man is stripped of faulty accidents, he
   understandeth much natural truth, and the truth begetteth much delight
   in him. And delight is of nature, whereas man fancies often it is of
   grace. Thus nature is often taken for grace. Now just as to the spirit,
   which is raised above itself and above all things in God, divine light
   and life and truth flow into it, so also flow into the natural spirit,
   that standeth on its mere nature, natural and supernatural truth.

84.

   It may be asked, What distinction is there between natural truth and
   divine truth? Natural truth consists in this, that a man knoweth the
   distinction of manifold things in such wise that the understanding
   creates images of each and every thing, which images approach most
   nearly to the truth, and that it understands each thing from its image
   or representation. Now, if the images are evil they are. from the evil
   spirit; if they are neither good nor evil they are from nature; if they
   are good, then are they from the angels. Again, these images are evil
   if they be turned to sins or to the source of sin. They are neither
   good nor bad, if they do not procure man eternal happiness, and if they
   are turned to the mere work of knowing everything generally; by this
   knowledge a man is not blessed or saved, but by knowing God, which is
   eternal life. Hence this knowledge is not to be called good, as it doth
   not obtain eternal life for man; nor is it evil, as sin is not
   committed with it. But these images of the understanding are good when
   they direct man to virtue, for by them life everlasting is obtained.
   Thus we see. that natural knowledge consisteth in the distinction of
   manifold things, that are neither good nor evil. But divine truth is a
   pure distinction of things everlasting, which man recognises in himself
   without all images, that is, by an internal consciousness and feeling
   showing him what God and creatures are, time and eternity, sin and
   virtue, manifold and simple, useful and hurtful, evil and good. It may
   be asked, "Can this be known without images?" I answer, Yes, in the
   truth; those men who are internally touched by God, these know all
   without natural images, for the truth reveals itself to them, without
   all images, in a pure consciousness. For the man who hath left
   creatures and turned himself to God, he findeth in himself, without all
   intervening images, the sweetness of God and the bitterness of
   creatures. It is not necessary to say anything to him in images or in
   manifold forms, for the divine image and the divine, simple form inform
   him, and open up to him all things. And this knowledge is in unity and
   not in the manifold, therefore it is called divine, for it is like unto
   God. And as God understandeth all things in Himself without all created
   images, in a simple survey or insight in Himself, so also a divine man
   understandeth all things in God by a pure indwelling in God. For whoso
   understandeth God understandeth all things. And to understand is
   nothing else than that man understands the work of God and its fruit.
   And by this work and fruit which man finds in Him he values and
   examines all other works and fruits that are not from God. For God's
   work is delightful, and its fruit is sweet, but the work of creatures
   is without delight, unpleasant, and its fruit is bitter. Just as with a
   man who eateth a sweet and a sour apple; after doing so he knoweth the
   sweet from the sour. So also is it when man tasteth God, after which he
   recognises that all other things are bitter, and he values them
   accordingly. As Christ saith, "By their fruit ye shall know them"
   (Matt. vii. 44). And this is the distinction between natural and divine
   truth.

85.

   And as the natural spirit taketh its object in images and forms that
   are created, when a poor man is empty of all fallible accident he has
   no impediment in his natural perception. For all that hindereth a man
   in understanding, whether natural or divine, is a fallible accident,
   and when a man is empty of this he hath a pure understanding of all
   truths, whether natural or divine, and from this position he can take
   out the best in each.

86.

   An objection might be made that there are many pure poor men who yet do
   not understand or find such truth. I say that where there is a pure
   poor man all truth is opened up in the interior of his soul. And if he
   doth not understand the truth in images and forms yet he understandeth
   it in its essence. And if he doth not find the truth in the powers or
   forces (of nature) he yet findeth it in essence.

87.

   The third spirit that speaketh to a man is the angel, and his speaking
   is for virtue, which leadeth the man to God. The highest angel draws
   his image from God; this image is multiplied in him, and he giveth it
   over to a second angel; this one again giveth it to the lowest angel,
   and this lowest angel at length giveth it to the soul, which obtains
   thereby the power of distinguishing how she has to seize and hold the
   truth, and how she shall practise each virtue in proper order and
   measure, and according to necessity. And this clear distinction which
   man obtains is given him by the angel, who also lets him see crime,
   that he may guard against it. When man knoweth crime he also knoweth
   virtue, just as through the colour black you can recognise white. And
   if man denies crime he draweth nigh unto virtue, but if he departs from
   virtue crime returneth to him; and the man who turneth away from virtue
   must of necessity arrive at all crimes.

88.

   Some one might now say, If a man feeleth remorse at his sins God
   forgiveth him, so that he hath no more sins upon him, and yet he doth
   not possess all virtues. To this I answer, that a true repentance
   includes in itself the forgiveness of sins and the gaining of all
   virtues. And if virtue be lacking to the man in fact, yet must he have
   it at least in the will, and if sin is not to find any place in him he
   must carry out his will in works, as far as this is possible. And
   through the firm will that man hath, no more to sin and to obtain all
   virtue, God forgiveth him his sins. But he must overcome every crime by
   a special virtue, for the root of sins must be extirpated by virtues.
   But if the man be empty of virtues and of good works, then within him
   there still abide the roots and the impulse to sin, and if he be
   attacked he falleth easily. Just as the tree that hath not deep roots
   falleth easily if the wind sweeps violently against it; so man, if he
   wish to stand firm and not to fall, must let the virtues strike deep
   roots in his heart. He must therefore have all virtues if he will not
   fall. Virtue guardeth a man from sin; if he is empty of virtues he hath
   also no support, and crime taketh up a place in him.

89.

   It may be objected; if a man hath a right repentance of his sins God
   forgiveth them him, so that he immediately hath no more sins upon him?
   To this I say, this is done by a true repentance; but there are many
   men who guard themselves against sin, but yet have not all virtue. I
   say also that a true, downright avoiding of all sins is a true
   possession of all virtue. If also some men guard themselves against
   sin, yet by no means possess virtue, they only guard against it
   outwardly in their works, and they often do this on account of
   disgrace, as they are afraid of dishonour before the world; but they do
   it not for the sake of God, and do not inwardly avoid sin. If also they
   avoid mortal sins in their works and will, they do so from fear of
   hell; but they do not avoid venial sins, for they commit these very
   often; thus sin is not avoided in the right way. If these men, while
   guarding against sins, be they mortal or venial, do not at the same
   time possess all virtue, being aware of this, it must needs be that,
   though unconsciously, they commit many sins. Anil in this case this
   unconsciousness itself is a sin. And in sooth a man who wisheth to
   guard himself against sins must have all virtue; therefore the angel
   counselleth also to man virtue, that he may be free from vice. The more
   a man recognises virtue in himself the freer he seeth himself from
   vice, and he who cannot find any virtue in himself, let him know that
   he is full of vices.

90.

   But it might be urged: a child is pure and without any sins, and yet he
   doth not possess all virtue. I reply against this, that a child
   possesseth purity in the lowest degree, which is a mere necessity or
   necessary first condition for heaven. Therefore the child hath virtue
   also only in the lowest degree. As it possesseth purity only in an
   unmerited way, so also hath it virtue without merit, and all its
   virtues are imperfect, for both qualities may come to naught. It is
   therefore certain, that true purity is a vessel full of all virtues,
   and just as much as a man faileth in virtue, he faileth also in purity;
   therefore the absence of all sins is the possession of all virtues.

91.

   Thus the angel persuadeth the soul to virtue, and determines her to fly
   from vice. His speech is also in images and forms, but his images are
   useful and good; they lead man along the path of truth, and without
   these images no one can practise genuine virtue. If a man needeth these
   images he should not avoid them, for if he were to reject them he would
   lack the order of virtuous exercises, and he could scarcely carry into
   effect a good work in proper order and with discretion. These images
   come from grace, and do not hinder a man from what is best but further
   him to it. Just as a man, who seeth clearly, leadeth a blind man, so
   that he fall not into a ditch, in like manner images lead man, so that
   he lapse in no sin; and he who hath most ideas or images in himself,
   can best keep himself in proper order, both outwardly and inwardly.
   Some avoid images but know not what they avoid, and God often imparteth
   to them the grace to deny them to themselves. But these that help a man
   to divine truth, we ought gladly to receive.

92.

   There is a great difference between natural, angelic, and devilish
   images. The natural images direct man to the preservation of nature,
   they refer all things to man's nature, and all men have these images.
   Every man is by nature more directed to himself than to others; and
   what man loves in nature, he loves on account of himself, from the
   pleasure it giveth his nature, and were it not agreeable to it, he
   would never love it. The angelic images lead man from himself and all
   things to God, refer all to God, and few have such images, save a
   perfect, poor man. For the most of men are more considerate of
   themselves than of others, whether in spiritual or bodily things; for
   every man seeketh his own.

93.

   People inquire further, if perhaps a poor man have too many natural
   images in himself. I maintain that a truly poor man is free from all
   natural images, for he is stationed in a perfect denial of himself and
   of all things, and therefore the images that are in a poor man proceed
   from the angel and not from nature, for he refers nothing to himself
   but all things to God. A poor man hath indeed also more knowledge than
   another; but he directeth his knowledge to virtue, and thus it is not
   hurtful but useful. They who have principally natural images in
   themselves are also mostly thoughtful of themselves and cleave too much
   to temporal things, for temporal things are to them a maintenance of
   their nature; now those who are most thoughtful about maintaining
   temporal things and their nature, are the most natural or immersed in
   nature, and have mostly natural images in themselves. They are too
   natural, because they cleave too much to bodily things, and wish
   thereby to attain to the best. They wish to have temporal and eternal
   things at the same time, which however is impossible, for two things,
   that are unequal, cannot subsist in the same being. They wish indeed to
   be poor in spirit, but yet to be rich in the body; they wish to eat the
   pure grain, before they have removed the husk; they wish to have God
   and the creature at the same time. And such men are natural and have
   the greatest number of natural images in themselves. Now these are not
   natural, spiritual images, but bodily, but for that reason they are
   more defective than if they were spiritual. But a truly poor man
   surrenders temporal and eternal things, outwardly and inwardly;
   therefore his images are not natural but angelic; and as the man with
   his image is only directed to the holiest will of God, his image is
   also like unto that of the angel, that is, it is angelic and not
   natural.

94.

   But how doth it come to pass that natural images are often like unto
   angelic images; for a man thus frequently taketh a natural to be an
   angelic image? The likeness is in the forms; they have both a like form
   in a spiritual way; they are, however, very unlike in their aim.
   Natural images are directed to nature, and such images hath nature
   since the fall of Adam; but the image of the angel is directed away
   from nature to God, and we have this image from Christ. Before Christ
   every one was thoughtful about his own selfhood (Ego), and every one
   wished only to possess, no one wished to be poor, all strained after
   riches. But when Christ came, He brought the angelic image with
   Himself, which we had lost since the fall of Adam. This is the true
   poverty, both outwardly and inwardly, in which the angelic image lieth,
   which Christ hath brought with Him. No one, therefore, is free from
   this natural image which we have from Adam, except a truly poor man,
   who is free both outwardly and inwardly from all temporal things, and
   who followeth the image of Christ by a genuine poor life. He hath the
   image of the angel, for he standeth in true denial of himself and of
   all things, therefore is he like unto the angels and not to Adam.
   Whosoever abideth with external accidents, he is like unto Adam, but
   whoso entereth with self-complacency only into himself, he is like unto
   Lucifer. For Lucifer sinned spiritually but Adam only bodily, therefore
   also his fall was greater than that of Adam. In like manner the fall of
   him, who refers all only to himself (his Ego), is greater than his, who
   cleaveth outwardly to accidents. But the men who are empty, outwardly
   and inwardly, are like unto Christ according to the angelic image,
   which Christ hath brought to us from heaven. When nature is blamed,
   this is because of its likeness with Adam and Lucifer, but when it is
   praised, this is because of its likeness with the angelic. Therefore
   nature itself is quite noble, and such a nature is quite adapted to a
   truly poor man. Thus is the distinction between natural and angelic
   images to be understood. Natural images are directed to the delight of
   nature, but the angelic lead from the delight of nature to God and
   virtue.

95.

   But the devilish images have a likeness with the natural and the
   angelic. If man directs the images to his own nature, and seeketh
   delight thereby, then cometh the devil, and presenteth a sensual object
   to man, that promiseth great delight. If now the man should follow
   this, and seek delight, the natural is then turned into a devilish
   image. But if man turneth away from them, and remaineth in an
   abandonment of all delight of nature, then this his image becometh
   angelic. But the evil spirit forms himself like unto this image and
   counselleth to man abandonment of all natural lust; but his counsel
   surpasseth the forces of nature, and he doeth it to this end, that
   these may come to nought and destroy themselves. It is in this wise
   that an image of the devil hath a likeness with the natural and angelic
   images.

96.

   But when a poor man hath denied all bodily lust and delight, and
   holdeth all things in proper order, neither natural nor devilish images
   have place with him. They may doubtless occur to him, but he doth not
   tarry with them, but holdeth on only to those of the angel, which lead
   him through the virtues to God.

97.

   Some one might here say, "A man truly poor in spirit is raised above
   all creatures in God, whether they be angels, or whatever creatures
   they may be. If now a man be raised above them, he is then also raised
   above their images; how can he then abide by the images of the angel or
   of another creature?" To this I make answer, that the elevation of a
   poor man is to be taken according to the highest forces of the soul,
   according to the likeness of God, which is stamped upon the soul.
   Thereby is the poor man raised above all creatures and their images,
   whatever the creatures may be. But according to his lowest powers, man
   must have images, to the end that he may order things according to
   measure. These images must be angelic, in order that he be able to
   accomplish all things orderly. When it is said that man must be emptied
   of all images, this is to be understood according to the highest power
   of his spirit; but this cannot be in the lowest powers of the soul;
   these must have either good or bad images. And if a man wisheth to
   practise his work in images, after the likeness of the angelic, that
   is, in entire abandonment, the work is then perfect and ordered as the
   best. But if man accomplishes the work so that he is truly emptied of
   all personality in all works, he must also be free from this image,
   whether it be angelic or natural, and must leave God alone to work
   without any images. God worketh not in images, but in essence,
   therefore He also must be free from nil images.

98.

   Lastly, the fourth spirit that speaketh in man is .the Divine Spirit,
   and its speech is nothing else than a real revelation of divine truth.
   By it man is raised out of sensuality above all images and forces, and
   attaineth unto the divine essence. Now, the spirit knoweth its
   nobility, and its nobility is now compassed around with the godlike. By
   this entrance the spirit is united with the Divine Spirit, as St. Paul
   saith, "Whoso cleaveth to God becometh one spirit with Him" (1 Cor. vi.
   17). But this cleaving is nothing else than that the spirit goeth out
   of itself, out of time, and entereth into a pure nothingness. And that
   which is and forms his being is the divine, likeness, which abideth in
   man and can never be destroyed. This likeness God taketh and uniteth it
   with Himself, and thus the spirit of man becometh one spirit with God
   according to the divine likeness. Man's spirit is also one spirit with
   God, when he worketh and bringeth forth all in essence that God
   worketh. But what doth God work and beget? God hath begotten all things
   out of love, and because God begat them were they also good. Thus also
   the spirit ought to work all things from pure love, and what it thus
   produceth is also good and is the work of God. In the divine love all
   things are good, as St. Augustine saith, "Have divine charity, and do
   all things." [58]

99.

   The Spirit of God speaketh in man that man may speak again all things
   through the Divine Spirit in God. But the spirit speaketh again all in
   God, when it purposes in all its works the honour of God, and when,
   whatever happens or clashes with him, he remains always pure, and never
   holdeth on to any accident, if thus he always finds himself in a pure
   state to receive God, and listeneth to Him whenever God willeth to
   speak to him. In thus hearing he giveth back all to God again, and this
   hearing is so joyful and delightful for him, that he setteth aside all
   things, and listeneth only to His words. This hearing is also called
   giving back all things to God, and thus the spirit speaketh back again
   all things in God. Thus man becometh one thing with God when he giveth
   back all things to God as God had given them to him, and by this return
   he maketh himself the friend of God. But where there is friendship
   there is union; for "a friend is another myself," as Aristotle saith,
   [59] and the spirit is united with God when it hath obtained God as its
   friend. Jesus said also to His disciples: "Now call I you no longer
   servants, but friends" (John xv. 15). He used this term "Now "when they
   had left all things to follow Him; now were they no longer servants,
   but friends. Therefore whosoever wisheth to be a true friend of God
   must leave all things and follow God; but he who is attached to things
   and doth not follow God, he is not a friend, but a servant. And he who
   is not a friend is also not one spirit with God, for friendship worketh
   union, and not servitude.

100.

   What doth a friend furnish? Three things. First, likeness, for "like
   cherisheth like." God is empty of all temporal things; now, he who
   wisheth to be like unto Him must dispense with all that is temporal,
   and thus can he become like unto Him. Where likeness prevails there is
   also friendship; where friendship prevails there also doth union. God
   is the giver of all gifts, therefore man must give back all gifts to
   God. God loveth all virtue, therefore man must love and practise all
   virtue.

101.

   Secondly, the same willing and not willing maketh a friend. As
   Aristotle saith, "True friends have the same willing and not willing."
   [60] Therefore whoso wisheth to be the friend of God must will what He
   willeth, and hate what God hateth. But what doth God will? God willeth
   that man should be holy. As St. Paul saith, "God's will is our
   sanctification" (1 Thess. iv. 3). Man must also will this. What, then,
   is holiness? To be holy is to be free of the earthly; therefore he who
   wisheth to be holy must be emptied of all earthly things. This is the
   will of God, and man must also will this, if he will be a true friend
   (of God).

102.

   Some men indeed often say, If I only knew what is the dearest will of
   God I would gladly do it. But they speak very much untruth, for they
   know it full well, but do it not. Christ hath often announced to us the
   will of God, and whoso followeth His teaching fulfilleth the dearest
   will of God. He hath also taught us that we should leave all things and
   follow Him. In so far as we do this we follow His will, and as oft as
   we omit it we say an untruth when we give out that we live according to
   His will. [61] Whoso wisheth to fulfil the will of God, he must live
   according to His teaching. But His teaching is no other than that we
   should give all to the poor if we anyhow wish to come to a perfect
   life, as in this consists the will of God.

103.

   But some one might now say, But do I know that God willeth exactly that
   of me? Yes, God willeth it, but do thou see and observe if thou art
   willing to have it! God will give thee all gifts, but what wiliest thou
   to accept from Him? If any of His gifts is despised, the fault lieth
   only in thee. But thou wilt perhaps say, God hath certainly ordained
   all things; therefore perhaps He hath put me in a condition that I
   should contract marriage, and have children, for whom I must procure
   temporal goods, that they may not suffer necessity. God hath ordained
   all things for the best, and if it be otherwise, it is no longer the
   order of God; man often ordereth it for himself, and then considers it
   still to be God's decree. Perhaps you continue: Well, but granted that
   I hold it to be God's will and order that I should come to perfection,
   perhaps I am not meet for it, to find myself well in it, as a purely
   poor life, and this perfection, are not intended for me, and I am not
   equal to act in what doth not belong to me, as a sick man is not fitted
   to cope in fight with a strong man. But I say the best belongeth to
   every man, and God will give it us if thou wilt take it, and it we are
   not worthy, we ought to strive to become worthy. Thus if we stand in
   the high place of life, we should make ourselves humble, and thus seize
   on lowliness in highness. But if we do not find it easy to attain to
   this, we should strive after all the ways that lead to it. If we are
   too weak and sick, we should call on God to help us, unite our weakness
   with His strength, and then what we cannot do. He fulfilleth in us.
   That is therefore the will of God, that we should thus hold His
   teaching; this also must be thy will, it thou wishest to be a friend of
   God and one spirit with God. If now a poor man hold the teaching of our
   Lord, and live after it, he then fulfilleth the dearest will of God;
   this maketh of him a true friend of God and one spirit with God.

104.

   The man who wisheth to be a friend of God, he must also hate what his
   Friend hateth. But what doth God hate in us? Sin, and this must we hate
   if we wish to be the friends of God. But it might be now insinuated:
   God is Love; this is not accidental but essential, therefore no
   accident can enter into God. But to hate is an accident; how then can a
   man say that God hatelh sin? This is to be understood in the following
   way. God is a pure being, unified in Himself with essential love, and
   no accident is possible with Him. God hath also made man alter His
   image, as St. Austin saith, "Lord, Thou hast made us after Thy
   likeness, and my heart is in unrest till it resteth in Thee." If now
   man is laden with faulty accidents, he cannot come to God. That man in
   this way turneth away from God is what rouseth His wrath, but not in
   God as in man, but only anger or displeasure that the image which He
   hath stamped upon the soul and created after His likeness, is now moved
   away from Him, and not formed out as He wished. It is the disorder that
   man stirs up against God's order that causeth His wrath, but not a
   wrath from accident or hatred, but it is His divine justice which is
   not shut out by His love. For real hatred is only in man and not in
   God, and God willeth it not Therefore the man who wisheth to be God's
   friend must also not will what God willeth not. This is faulty accident
   from which man ought to be free, if he wisheth to be a friend of God
   and one spirit with God. If, then, a poor man is free from all faulty
   accidents, he is this in fact.

105.

   Thirdly, gifts procure a friend, as a teacher saith, "Giving maketh a
   man well-pleasing to God," and Christ saith, "Give alms, and behold all
   things are pure to you" (Luke xi. 41). Purity is likeness to God, and
   where God findeth His like, there must He also love, therefore giving
   maketh man a friend of God.

106.

   But what gifts will God have from men that can make him a friend? The
   noblest gift which man can give is this, that he give himself; and with
   himself he giveth God all things, for man is himself all things,
   therefore lie need give nothing more than himself, as David also saith
   (Ps. xliv. 8), "I blame thee not because of thy offerings, for I eat no
   flesh; if I am hungry I say it not to thee. Give God the praise and the
   desire, this offering God willeth to have from thee." [62] (Ps. 1. 8,
   12-14). The same thing is described by God of thee in the words of
   Solomon, who saith, "My son, give me thy heart" (Prov. xxiii. 26).

107.

   If then the greatest offering consisteth in this, that man offer
   himself, of what use is it, people may say, that man should give other
   things for the sake of God? The use is threefold.

108.

   First, man is created for time and for eternity. But time and eternity
   cannot be united or made one. Whoso, therefore, wisheth to possess
   eternity must put aside time and all temporals. Therefore it is needful
   that the man who holdeth many temporal things, so part with them to
   others for the sake of God, in order that he may not immerse himself in
   them, for were this the case, he would go away from the eternal; it is
   only by going out and away from temporal things there is an entrance
   into the eternal. You ought to be free also from temporal things,
   because very many accidents adhere to them. Therefore he who wisheth to
   be free from all faulty adherence must be freed from the love of
   temporal things. The man who is too much laden with the temporal can
   never arrive at true peace of heart. Time itself is fluctuating,
   therefore he cannot obtain peace who has an influence from time and
   temporal things. Further, man must be free from temporals, as the
   temporal hindereth man in the knowledge of the truth, and the fire of
   divine love is extinguished, as St. Austin saith, "These things we
   ought to value freely as a poison, which killeth not only the reason of
   man, but his soul, if he practises them and gives himself up to them."
   Another teacher saith, "Just as impossible as to kindle fire in water
   is it for the heart of man to be enkindled with divine love in bodily
   delights."

109.

   Secondly, the giving away of temporal things is useful, as Christ
   Himself hath taught it with the words, "Give alms, and behold all
   things are pure to you" (Luke xi. 41). A man may have made himself
   impure in manifold ways by the use of temporal things. If, now, he wish
   to purify himself from them, this must take place by his denying
   himself temporal things. Through the lack of temporal things the wounds
   are healed which man hath inflicted on himself by the possession of
   them; as a teacher saith, "I know nothing more useful to heal the
   wounds of the sinner than that the man should give alms out of love."
   It is also a commandment that a man should help another in his
   necessity, wherefore Jesus also said, "All that ye wish that others
   should do to you, that do ye to another, that the old and new covenant
   may be fulfilled" (Matt. vii. 12).

110.

   From temporal things we should also depart, if divine love demands it;
   as St. John saith, "Whoso hath temporal things and seeth his brother
   suffering necessity, and closeth his heart against him, how can divine
   love be in such a one?" (1 John iii. 17). Where divine love is, it
   expresseth itself outwardly; as St. Gregory saith, "Where great love
   is, it worketh great works, and if it doth not work these, it is no
   divine love at all." [63] A heart full of love and a bag full of gold
   cannot subsist with one another; for love is a fire by which all that
   is temporal is consumed; but where true love ruleth, there can only be
   a free heart, or it maketh it free. Whoso is burthened with temporal
   things, he showeth that the fire of divine love doth not burn properly
   in his heart. It is the nature of fire that it destroyeth all that it
   seizeth with its flame. Even so the divine fire destroyeth all things.
   This fire burnt in St. Paul when he said, "I have reckoned all things
   as dung."1

111.

   The question might now be put, If it were not possible that the fire of
   divine love should burn in man and destroy all temporals only inwardly,
   while the outward man might preserve what is necessary? I answer, If a
   man keep himself pure, always watcheth his interior, exercise himself
   with holy contemplations, especially with the contemplation of the
   Passion of our Lord--for this maketh a man pure--then in his purity
   cometh up a light which burneth, and this internal burning showeth
   itself outwardly. If it be great, it consumeth in man all things,
   outwardly and inwardly; but if it be weak, man doth indeed despise
   internally these thing [64] , but outwardly he retaineth his necessary
   possessions. But it is of necessity, in order to reach heaven, that a
   man be empty of all things internally. Now, these people who do this
   are indeed good men, but not perfect like those in whom the fire of
   divine love hath consumed all things inwardly and outwardly; these
   alone stand on the degree of all perfection, of whom the Gospel also
   speaketh "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
   heaven" (Matt. v. 3). Some one might here object at my speaking of the
   fire of love, and giving it strength and weakness, and say it is
   neither great nor small, for it cannot be divided; and what hath no
   parts hath also not these qualities, but is a simple being in. itself.
   The divine fire of love is neither great nor little, hot nor cold, in
   itself, but it is so in its working, for it worketh in every man
   according to his power of receiving, according to his earnestness and
   desire for God. If this earnestness and desire be great, this flame ia
   also greater; but if his earnestness and desire are small, then the
   flame also is small. If, now, a man hath a will free from all temporal
   things, the divine fire cometh and consumeth in him all things,
   outwardly and inwardly. Speaking of this, St. Paul said, "God is a Fire
   that consumeth all things" (Heb. xii. 29); [65] this fire springeth up
   in him who willeth to and resign and deny all things. So with him who
   will not do this, in him nothing is consumed. In fact, if a soul be
   empty and poor through love, its body must also outwardly be empty and
   poor, as far as he can strip away from it all save the barest
   necessity. And even this he must only retain in the mode most despised
   by the world, namely, in a truly poor life, according to the teaching
   of Jesus Christ. For the soul commandeth the body, and not the body the
   soul. To whom orders are given, it behoveth him to be obedient and do
   the will of his bidder. As a. lord commandeth his servants, and his
   servants do what he commandeth, and if they do not this he dismisseth
   them, so also is the body the servant of the soul, and what the soul
   commandeth, that the body ought to do. It now the soul be completely
   sundered from all temporal things, this same condition she giveth to
   the body. When a lord getteth into a dispute, his servant must stand by
   him and help him in the strife. Thus also is it with the soul; while
   she is in the body she must contend and fight against her foes, and the
   body must help her, for without the body she could not conquer; and
   hence she giveth to the body the same weapons that she hath. If she be
   detached from temporal things, the same thing happens with the body.
   For if the body wisheth to have reward, it must also work with her, to
   help her to overcome all things that are not God. Soul and body are
   only one person, and what the soul receiveth from God she giveth
   directly to the body; and the same sweetness that the soul feeleth from
   God the body feeleth from the soul. If, now, the body wisheth to enjoy
   this blessedness, it must also work with her. If this be the case, and
   the spirit is emptied in the most perfect manner, the body must also
   strip itself as far as it is possible.

112.

   But St. Paul saith, "The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the
   spirit against the flesh" (Gal. v. 17). People will say, Where there
   are unlike desires, there are unlike results. How can man come to this,
   that the flesh be subject to the spirit? Man is created for time and
   for eternity for time in his body, for eternity according to his
   spirit. Everything strives towards its origin; as now the body is made
   of earth and for time, it inclineth to earthly and temporal things, and
   seeketh its delight in them; but the spirit has sprung from God and is
   created for eternity, therefore it inclineth to God and eternity. This
   contradicting inclination of both formeth this opposite lusting or
   desire. Soul and body are one; those which are united have mutual
   faithfulness; thus the soul is devoted to the body and the body to the
   soul. If now the soul, from blindness of its knowledge, chooseth a sham
   good for a real good, she turneth to sensuality and the senses turn to
   this good, which can be seized by them, and choose it, and the soul
   followeth them. But this arises from ignorance. Yet she findeth no rest
   in it; she desireth something else but cannot grasp it, as the body
   hindereth and her knowledge is blinded. Thus the soul followeth and
   taketh the likeness of the body--that is, mortality--for the body is
   mortal; she therefore becometh also spiritually dead; she ought to
   live, but she dieth, as already St. John said, "Thou hast the name that
   thou livest, but art dead" (Rev. iii. 1). But if the soul cometh to the
   knowledge of the truth, seeth the true distinction of everything,
   recognises that all bodily things are passing and faulty, but also
   recognises in the light of faith that she herself is eternal, she is
   then frightened at all mortality, she turneth from the body to God,
   from the temporal to the eternal. In this longing for God, the soul
   draweth the sensual desires up into herself and unites them with
   herself, so that the senses can desire nothing save what the soul
   willeth. Now, the body must follow the soul and be subject to it.
   Whither the soul turneth itself, the body followeth her. What God hath
   lent her that she imparts to the body, and this is a greater comfort to
   the body than all that is bodily; this comfort maketh it then so strong
   that it suffereth all things for the sake of God. When the soul has
   resigned all bodily things, she desires this also of the body, which,
   no doubt, according to its nature giveth it woe, and this woe is the
   striving against the spirit; yet now the body followeth the spirit.
   Just as the soul followeth the body when she inclineth to it, so also
   the body followeth the spirit when the spirit inclineth to God. And
   just as it was contrary to the spirit to incline to the body, and yet
   she did so in her blindness, so it is also burdensome to the body which
   yieldeth to the spirit, but yet it doeth it. Lastly, when man's mind is
   united with his spirit and the spirit with God, no more combat taketh
   place, but a pure peace, a single will, as two spouses mutually follow
   one another, and what one wills the other willeth. This is the holiest
   will of God, and this they wish both to fulfil, and each doeth what it
   can that the will of God may be fulfilled. This union bringeth to
   complete resignation, so that each standeth in denial and abandonment,
   so that the body abandons itself to the spirit and the spirit cleaveth
   to God. If the body do not abandon all temporals as far as is possible,
   a real union of body and spirit can never take place, nor of the spirit
   with God; a real peace could never be, but a perpetual contest and
   fight. Whoso now wisheth to be a friend that he may be one spirit with
   God, he must leave all things out of love, and unite his love with God
   alone; in this manner giving maketh friendship and union.

113.

   But it may be said: What doth Christ mean when He said, "Blessed are
   the poor in spirit," if you cannot be perfect except you are also poor
   in body? For He saith Himself, "If thou wilt be perfect, sell all that
   thou hast, and give to the poor!" (Matt. xix. 21). To this I answer, If
   two things are united in one you should always look to the best. As now
   soul and body are one, but the soul is the noblest, happiness should be
   chosen with the view to the soul, and not on account of the body; for
   the soul is receptive of happiness and not the body, therefore Jesus
   said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit." If He had said, Blessed are the
   poor in body, a sinner might also be blessed and all rich people would
   be condemned. Therefore blessedness lies situated in poverty of spirit,
   for no sinner possesseth poverty of spirit; he may have, indeed,
   poverty of body, but through this poverty he cannot be saved. The man
   who holdeth his bodily necessity in a right way, can guard himself so
   well that he may be saved. But this happiness is not in the most
   perfect degree, such as the beatitude of those who leave all things,
   outwardly and inwardly, and only follow God. Therefore Jesus also said,
   "If thou wiliest to be perfect, sell all that thou hast and give it to
   the poor, and come follow me." But what doth Christ mean when He saith,
   "Give it to the poor?" and what doth Peter mean by "We have left all
   things?" (Matt. xix. 27). Could not then a man leave his things unsold
   and yet be perfect? This must be understood thus. If a man be rich so
   that he hath much possession, and selleth it, he ought to distribute it
   to the poor and not to the rich, for the poor have need of it; and it
   is a great virtue that he should come to the help of his fellow-men,
   for the poor cannot give him anything in return and repay him, but God
   must repay the giver in their stead; but what God giveth him is a
   perfect gift, and also maketh him perfect. Moreover, rich people do not
   need this gift, therefore it is no virtue if he giveth to them; for
   they can give him in return and repay him, and this giving doth not
   make perfect. What he giveth to rich people, God will not give back to
   him; therefore Jesus said, "Sell all that thou hast, and give it to the
   poor." And what thou hast not, this thou must abandon even if thou
   wouldst have gained it. As St. Peter was poor and had nothing, save
   what he gained by handiwork, he said, "We have left all" (Matt. xix.
   27); and this he was obliged to leave, and could not sell it. Therefore
   a man who possesseth temporal things ought not to go away arid leave
   them thus; he ought to sell them and give them away and then follow
   God, and what he hath not and might perhaps gain he should leave for
   the sake of God. This consists quite well with perfection.

114.

   Secondly, the words, "Blessed are the poor in spirit," should be also
   thus understood. Where there is perfect poverty of spirit there is also
   poverty of body. The highest contains in itself the lower, and what the
   highest doeth the lower must also do. Now, if the spirit, which is the
   highest, is poor, then the body, which is the lower, must also be poor.
   Just as the servant must do what his lord biddeth, so also the body
   must do what the soul willeth, and not the soul what the body wishes.
   Therefore it was not necessary for Christ to say, "Blessed are the poor
   in spirit and in body," as poverty of spirit includes poverty of body,
   for where there is true poverty in the mind, there must also be poverty
   of body. Thus poverty of spirit consisteth with perfection, which
   belongeth to a poor life. And whoso accepteth poverty of spirit in
   another sense than that spoken of here, hath it only as far as is
   necessary for salvation; but for the perfection of which Christ
   speaketh you must have poverty both of spirit and of body, and
   otherwise it cannot be.

  In the third place. Of the godly work and of three kinds of men.

115.

   But here there is a dispute between two classes of these men. One class
   retain the needs for the body, and give themselves up internally to
   God. but do not trouble themselves about external works. They watch
   their heart and attend to what God wisheth to work in the interior, and
   give also place for this. This occupies them inwardly, so that they do
   not care much for external reputation. It also cometh to pass that such
   men attain to great internal contemplation, and perceive divine graces.
   This is effected by their zealous entering into themselves, and by the
   devout contemplation of the Passion of our Lord. These and other pious
   contemplations guard them also from sinful defects and purity them.
   Into this purity now God poureth his graces, so that they are conscious
   of these within their. selves. If, moreover, these men give themselves
   up to God, and carry out what He hath warned them to do, it happeneth
   easily that they leave all things outward and inward, and follow Him
   through a poor life. And thus they become perfect, and soar indeed to
   the highest degree of perfection. But if they still keep something for
   their necessity, and give what remaineth to them for the sake of God,
   and if they watch over their heart, they are also pious men, but not in
   the highest degree of perfection. The other class give away all outward
   things for the sake of God, but they do it more from hearsay, as they,
   for instance, have heard that perfection consists in this, in giving
   away all that a man hath, and following Christ in a poor life. This
   they do also. But they keep and hold on to mere external poverty, do
   not pay much care to their heart, do not give much attention to
   internal contemplation of the Passion of our Lord and other good
   practices that keep man pure from sins, and make him fit to take in
   divine graces; yet they do many external good works. These also are
   good pious men, but they are faulty and lack light, and know nothing of
   the familiarity with God, nor of His working. God worketh only in the
   ground of the soul, but these men are always turned outwardly, while
   God worketh inwardly; therefore they cannot properly understand the.
   truth, which is God Himself, in a pure heart. And these men do not come
   to the proper degree of perfection which appertaineth to a heartily
   poor man. Now these two kinds of men strive with one another, and each
   of them judgeth the other, and each thinketh how wrong the other kind
   is; and this must be so, as both lack the most essential and perfect
   thing. But those men who go out from all things outwardly and inwardly,
   and have a diligent ingoing into themselves, and look to what God
   willeth of them, to satisfy Him in all things, who occupy themselves
   zealously with contemplation of the Passion of our Lord, and avoid all
   that hinders them in this, who accept the real truth, which is God, and
   let it work in them, such men are on the road of perfection. What they
   cannot do in works they fulfil with their will, and God taketh their
   will for the work if they do all that they can, and what they cannot do
   that God doth not require of them. These men, I say, are on the road of
   perfection, and they dispute with no one, nor do they judge any one,
   but they commit all things to God, for they have completely resigned
   themselves and all things, and hence they take nothing to themselves.
   And on their thus going out of themselves and all things, the Spirit of
   God entereth into them, and draweth them to Himself, and uniteth them
   to Him, so that they become one spirit with Him. And now the Divine
   Spirit speaketh in man that he should be free and empty of all things.

116.

   In this purity and emptiness God can then work without all hindering;
   and such a work in a pure soul is much nobler than all works that God
   ever worked in time and in eternity. And for this reason. When God
   created all things He had no hindering of His work; but the work that
   God worketh in the soul may be hindered through the freedom of man's
   will, and when men unite their will to God's, this is therefore the
   noblest work.

117.

   But what kind of work is this? It is nothing else than a revelation of
   God in the soul when God showeth Himself to the soul. God worketh, and
   is Himself the work that He bringeth about. Therefore God draweth away
   the soul from all things, that it may be able to receive His work; and
   this receptiveness and the work of God make the soul one spirit with
   God, and this is the dearest and most desired thing that God will have
   from man, that man should always be so disposed that God can work in
   him at all times without hindering, so that he may become one spirit
   with Him; therefore He also saith, "My delight is with the children of
   men" (Prov. viii. 31).

118.

   Man's spirit becometh also one with God, if he followeth Christ just as
   He hath gone before us. For Christ is one with God; therefore it is
   necessary that he who wisheth to be one spirit with God, should be
   united first with Christ. And this union of man with Christ consisteth
   in this, that he do all things as far as it is possible and he is able,
   as Jesus worked them, when He was man. Christ hath taught us in His
   works what we should do, and for no other end than that we may become
   one with Him. Therefore He saith also, "Father, I pray Thee, that these
   may be one with us, even as I and Thou are one" (John xvii. 21). Thus
   then, man is one with Christ when he hath one working with Him. But it
   might be urged: Christ is God and man, how can a mere man have a
   working in common with Him? There are two kinds of works in Christ. The
   one kind is divine, as, to walk on the sea, to do wonders and signs, to
   fast forty days. Such-like works do not belong to us, and we should not
   try to work them, for they are godlike. The other kind is human; as, to
   be poor, despised, and insulted, to suffer hunger and thirst, to endure
   pain; then again the virtues that Christ had: humility, patience, and
   gentleness. These works belong to us, we should adopt them and work
   them, by which we become one with Him. What we lack in these works,
   marks how much we stand on ourselves and how distant we are from
   Christ. Whoso therefore wisheth to be one with Christ and empty of
   himself, must work all that Jesus worked as man, and as far as it
   relates to him. Paul also said, "Christ's working is our teaching."
   [66] Therefore also did He work it, that He might teach us how to work
   and what He taught is His will, which we ought to fulfil; and this His
   will bringeth to pass in us, effecting that, our will becomes His will,
   and His will our will. Thus we become one with Him, and this is only
   compassed by good works, which we have like unto His. St. Peter saith,
   "Christ hath suffered, that we might follow His footsteps" (1 Pet. ii.
   21). And as He walked, so also ought we to walk.

119.

   What do people believe by the expression that we come quite near unto
   God in heaven? It consists in this, that we follow Him closely on
   earth. St. Bernard saith, "Many would walk with Christ in heaven, but
   they are unwilling to suffer with Him on earth." [67] These cannot be
   one with Him, for a true union only begetteth one working; whoso doth
   not work in it, is separated from Him, for He saith Himself, "Where I
   am, there shall My servant be" (John xii. 26). But His servant is he
   who worketh His works, that He hath brought to pass. Now he who doth
   not this is also not His servant and shall not be with Him.

120.

   Thus no one cometh to God, save he only who setteth aside all things
   and followeth Christ in the way in which He hath gone before us. Christ
   is the everlasting aim of all men, and whosoever cometh nearest to this
   aim, he is also nearest to God. It happeneth, indeed, that some men
   come nigh to this aim by good works, and yet do not deny things, and
   the nearer they come to this aim, the nearer they come also to God, and
   the more diligently they exercise themselves in good works and avoid
   sins the nearer they come to Christ. If they have many good works, then
   they are so much the nearer; if they have few, then they are further;
   but if they have no good works whatever, then they stick in sins and
   are entirely away from Christ. On the other hand, if they have all good
   works and all virtue, they are, in that case, one with Christ, and
   where Christ is, there are they with Him. Whoso therefore willeth to be
   one with Christ, must have quite gone forth from himself, and thus he
   cometh to the aim; but he who giveth not up everything and yet
   exercises himself in good works, approaches indeed the aim, but doth
   not reach Christ; for he only who weareth His garment and followeth Him
   entirely, attaineth unto Him. Let this serve as a simile: A lord, who
   hath many servants, suffereth those whom he liketh most to stand
   nearest to him, to wear his uniform, and to bear his arms. So also is
   it exactly with men; those who wear the garment of Jesus, practise all
   virtues and bear His arms, are the men who endure His poor, despised
   life that He had upon earth, and suffer patiently all that smiteth and
   befalleth them. This is the surest sign that they are dearest to God,
   and these reach Christ the first; but they who do not this, and
   therefore have not all virtue, but yet practise good works, come indeed
   to the aim, but do not find Jesus.

121.

   There are two kinds of works by which we come to the aim--an inner and
   an outer work,

122.

   In an inner work, man must have in view three objects--his defects, the
   Passion of our Lord, God and His Godhead.

123.

   First, man must consider his defects, learn to know himself internally,
   and if he knoweth this, free himself. If a man doth not turn into
   himself, if he doth not inwardly consider his defects, he never cometh
   to a right knowledge of them, and cannot free himself, so that he
   become quite pure. Therefore the men who only look to outer works and
   cleave to them, never come to a right knowledge of themselves, and
   often fail in their good works. They think that they are practising a
   virtue, and they put in practice a vice, and this proceedeth from a
   blinding of themselves, whilst the evil spirit can moreover often
   deceive them. He who wisheth not to be deceived, that he may come
   without hindering to the aim, which is Christ, with the light that God
   hath kindled in him, he must consider well everything, if it be good or
   bad; then he must choose the good and reject the bad, and thus he
   attaineth to the aim.

124.

   Secondly, he must consider the Passion of our Lord; this must he stamp
   upon his heart, and thereby he learneth how he shall avoid all that is
   not God, and how he shall exercise himself in virtue that he may attain
   to God. In the contemplation of the Passion of our Lord, God poureth a
   power into him whereby He draweth man unto Himself. This is the great
   fruit produced by the Passion of our Lord. If, now, man turneth himself
   to this with earnest desire and tarries in it, then God revealeth to
   him the fruit of His Passion, which is so great that it entirely
   streams round him, and by the stream of His grace man is led with power
   and energy to God. Just as a mighty stream embraceth all and sweeps it
   along with itself with overpowering force, so likewise doth it come to
   pass with the man who diligently considereth the Passion of our Lord.
   Into him cometh the stream of divine graces, and leadeth him forcibly
   away from himself to his first origin from which he hath sprung. But
   those men who do not institute such an inner contemplation of the
   Passion of our Lord, and only exercise themselves with other good
   works, go indeed to God, but often stand still or even go backward. But
   it is not a human but a divine force that is lent to them in the
   contemplation of the Passion of our Lord, and it is so great that they
   cannot resist it. Therefore run they alway forward, and even if they
   lived till the day of judgment they must needs always hasten on, and
   would not cease to do so, for they do not urge themselves but God
   spurreth them on.

125.

   And as God the Father begetteth His Son in Himself and in all things,
   so in the same birth He leadeth man to Himself through the Passion of
   His Son and all virtues. And as God is everlasting in His begettings,
   so also the initiation of man in the sufferings of His Son is an
   everlasting process, and nothing can hinder man in this work. Just as
   little as God can be hindered in the birth of His Word, will He let the
   man be disturbed who giveth himself up with entire love to the Passion
   of His Son. The men who with intensest love contemplate the Passion of
   our Lord, are a second Christ; for love uniteth, therefore they cannot
   go astray as long as they cleave to Christ. As God the Father did not
   let His Son fail, so also doth He not let such men go astray, but He
   willeth that they should always come forward in order that they may
   reach the aim. Therefore, whoso wisheth to come to the aim, which is
   Jesus Himself, must entirely immerse himself in the Passion and
   consider it steadfastly. Out of this contemplation he obtaineth so
   great force, that in one hour it leadeth him nearer than he could have
   attained to for a long time by natural force. But whosoever neglecteth
   this is idle, and even if he succeed in reaching God, it is only by all
   possible effort and grievous difficulty.

126.

   Jesus saith, "I am the Gate, through which a man must go to God. Whoso
   entereth elsewhere is a thief and a murderer. The thief cometh to
   steal, and the murderer to kill" [68] (John x. 1-10). And as the thief
   taketh that which is not his, so also do those who wish to obtain
   heaven without the Passion of our Lord. They wish to take what is
   another's, for the kingdom of heaven is ours through the Passion of our
   Lord, and whoever taketh it in any other way save this, he taketh it by
   unjust means and is a thief. He is also a murderer who wisheth to enter
   otherwise than through the Passion of our Lord. Christ hath been killed
   and murdered by us, and through His death we have been saved from
   everlasting death and given again to life. Whoso killeth himself--that
   is, inflicteth penance on his body--except in considering the Passion
   of Christ, he killeth himself unrightly, for thereby he cannot come
   into the kingdom of heaven. Therefore is he called a murderer. Only in
   the death of our Lord canst thou get there. Whoso wisheth rightly to
   mortify his body and strip it of lusts, let him sink into the Passion
   of Jesus, in which all bad lusts disappear, for otherwise no man can
   die to himself. If a man be thus dead to bodily lusts, a godlike
   ecstasy ariseth in him exceeding all bodily lusts, and this rapture
   driveth on man to his aim, which is Christ.

127.

   Some men take much exertion for the knowledge of truth. But he who
   wisheth to obtain genuine truth, let him consider with all possible
   diligence the Passion of Jesus, in which welleth forth the fountain of
   all truth. Christ is the truth, and whosoever wisheth to have the truth
   let him seek it in Christ and in His Passion; here he findeth it for
   sure, but nowhere else. The truth of the world he may indeed find in
   his natural knowledge, but even if he have this it helpeth him not to
   true happiness. But if he wisheth to have the truth which is alone
   saving, he must seek this in the Passion of our Lord. Here is the real
   fountain of divine truth, and whoso drinketh of it drinketh living
   water. To this water Jesus calleth with a loud voice, saying, "If any
   man thirst, let him come to Me and drink. Whosoever drinketh of it, out
   of his body shall flow streams of living water flowing into everlasting
   life, and whoso drinketh of this water shall never thirst" (John iv.
   14). Therefore, whosoever wisheth to drink the full truth let him hold
   his mouth to the sacred wounds of our Lord, from which the truth
   floweth. St. John rested on the breast of our Lord, and sucked all
   wisdom and the truth of God, which was hidden from all men; this do
   also those men who diligently immerse themselves in the Passion of our
   Lord. They sleep on His breast, and suck from it all wisdom and all
   truth, the friendship of God, that was hid from all other men; a truth,
   an unspeakable truth, as St. Paul saith, "I have heard things which it
   is not proper to reveal to men" (2 Cor. xii. 4). Such a truth also
   receive men of which they ought not to speak at all, for the fountain
   of all grace and truth floweth through them, and the stream is so great
   that they overflow with it. This no man can know but God alone, for
   what God works in them goeth above all human conceptions. No man is
   required to lead or guide these men; they are at all times led to God
   and guided to perfection. They come to the right aim, that is, God;
   they go the right road and they are there at home where their right
   dwelling is--namely, the kingdom of heaven, of which St. Paul saith,
   "Our conversation is in heaven" (Phil. iii. 20).

128.

   But what heaven does St. Paul mean here? Heaven is of two kinds the
   heaven that is over us, and the other heaven, which is spiritual, that
   is. the soul, in which God dwelleth: and where God is. there is heaven.
   Therefore St. Paul saith, "The kingdom of heaven is within you." [69]
   If, now, the being and essence of our soul is heaven, and God is in it,
   what is to blame that we have not this heaven here, and do not know
   God? There are two things that hinder us. First, defective accidents.
   When man is too much burthened with these, they prevent him from
   attaining to the essence of his soul; therefore he hath not heaven and
   cannot know God. The essence of the soul is simple; but if the soul is
   dissipated in what is manifold, she cannot make use of her essence.
   Now, St. Paul was freed from all defective accident; thereby, had he
   come into the essence of the soul, he beheld its nobility and knew God
   immediately, and therefore could he well say, "Our conversation is in
   heaven" (Phil. iii. 20). But how comes it to pass that he had not then
   the kingdom of heaven that he now hath? This relates to the second
   thing that hindered him; that was, the coarseness of his body, and
   therefore he said, "I desire to be dissolved from the body, and to be
   with Christ" (Phil. i. 23); and again, "Oh I, unhappy man, who
   delivereth me from this body of sin?" (Rom. vii. 24). And on this
   account he could not have the kingdom of heaven that he now hath. And
   yet his dwelling was in heaven, which was in the essence of his soul,
   and in it he knew God, and therefore he said, "I know Christ Jesus and
   Him crucified" (1 Cor. ii. 2).

129.

   Thus a man must be free from all the defects of accident if his
   dwelling is to be in heaven. And it cannot be that he should be free
   from his defects save in the Passion of our Lord. To it should he turn
   with all earnestness, all accidental defects pass away from him, and
   thus he cometh into heaven, that is. into the essence of his soul, when
   he seeth God inwardly; and no defect can fasten hold on him, for it
   melteth away in the wounds of our Lord. Just as the snow, if held
   before the fire, melteth and becometh water, so it happens with all
   sins which are held in the burning wounds of our Lord. They all melt
   away and become nothing; and thus the man cometh to the right essence
   of his soul, when he seeth all truth internally without any taint of
   untruth.

130.

   The heathen also sought the naked and simple essence of the soul, but
   they could never come to it without Christ. Hence they could not know
   God, nor be happy, and yet they wished to be happy. And the same
   happens still to all men who seek the naked essence of the soul without
   the Passion of our Lord; for they never come to a right understanding
   of the truth, which is God, and by which they can be saved and happy.
   For all our salvation and happiness are placed in Christ and in His
   Passion; therefore he who wisheth to be saved must enter into the
   Passion of our Lord. And therefore our Lord said, "It was necessary for
   Christ to suffer to come into the kingdom of heaven." [70] We also must
   suffer with the Passion of Christ in the kingdom of our soul, where we
   see God immediately, and thus we come to our right aim with the Passion
   of our Lord.

131.

   The third object that a man ought to have in his internal work, in
   order that he come to his aim, is to contemplate God in His pure
   Godhead and Divinity. If man hath seen in his interior what he really
   is, hath he put aside all defective accident, if the contemplation of
   the Passion of our Lord hath led him to all virtue, then he seeth God
   in His essence and simplicity and in His true nature. Through this
   vision he goeth into God, uniteth himself to Him, and God leadeth man
   with Himself into Himself, and thus he hath an everlasting entrance
   into God. He is indeed quite encompassed by God, so that he loseth
   himself, and knoweth nothing more save God only. And thus sinketh he,
   and is drowned in the fathomless ocean of the Godhead; he liveth in God
   as the fish in the sea, and thus as the sea encompasseth the fish, so
   the soul is encompassed by God and hasteneth to its aim, where she
   shall eternally abide. She aimeth at it and hits it, as is written in
   the Canticles, when the Lord, speaking of His bride, saith. "My friend,
   thou hast wounded Me with thine eyes." [71] The eye is the love of man
   penetrating into God; and with this love the soul compelleth God, so
   that He must do what she wisheth, and this is called wounding, because
   she hath sway over God and hath mastered Him. She spanneth her bow and
   shooteth God in the heart; the bow that she spans is her own heart;
   this she spans and shooteth with a burning desire at God, and hitteth
   the right mark, and thus she attaineth to the highest degree of
   perfection.

132.

   The other work by which man draweth nigh to his aim, which is Christ,
   is outward; it consists of all the virtues which appertain unto a
   perfect life. These a man must have of necessity, if he wisheth to
   arrive at the right aim. Mention has already been made of these virtues
   further back, therefore we pass them over here, and only note,
   moreover, that a man who wisheth to be one spirit with God must be led
   to this by the life, Passion, and works of our Lord Jesus Christ. As
   now a thoroughly poor man is led through all this, he cleaveth to God
   and is one spirit with God.

     __________________________________________________________________

  The Spirit of God speaketh in man without image and form, life, light, and
  truth.

133.

   The Spirit of God speaketh also in man without images and forms, or
   rather, raised above all images and forms. This speech is Life, Light,
   and Truth.

134.

   To speak of life, this life is nothing else than a divine force,
   whereby man can do all things. As St. Paul saith, "I can do all things
   in Him that strengthened me" (Phil. iv. 13). But this power was nothing
   else than the giving up of all things that were against God, and a
   seizing of all virtues that lead to God. And if man cometh to the
   capacity of dropping all that is not godlike, and if he can grasp all
   virtues that lead to God, this is the living force that God poureth
   into man, and with this force he overcometh all things that are
   transitory and cometh to life. In tins life liveth God, and God is
   life; the soul liveth in the life that is God; her life is no longer
   earthly, but divine. God planteth the soul in His life, and whatever is
   planted in another fashion must be cast away. What the creature
   planteth is destructive, what is destructive must be removed, and
   therefore must it be cast away. Death and life cannot subsist together.
   What God planteth is life; to this life the soul turneth, and in this
   life she liveth.

135.

   Of what life is in itself we cannot speak; man, indeed, experiences
   something in himself, but he cannot describe it, and it is above all
   words, and he cannot give it in images and forms. Therefore he cannot
   speak of it, but he is silent and passive. This also is the most useful
   thing a man can do, namely, to be silent and suffer. Silence and
   suffering are the most perfect work that a man hath. This silence and
   patience make him living, but if he wisheth to speak or if he wisheth
   to let man speak in him, this maketh him mortal. If he wisheth always
   to live, he must always keep silent, and suffer God alone to speak, for
   what God speaketh, that is life. Christ saith also, "My sheep hear My
   voice, and I give them everlasting life" (John x. 3). The sheep of our
   Lord are men in whom all creaturely things keep silence, and who are in
   a pure passive state of receiving God. These hear the voice of God,
   that is, the everlasting word which God the Father speaketh in the
   soul, and this hearing giveth everlasting life. The Lord saith also,
   "They follow alter Me" (John x. 4). This following is nothing else than
   that they live in the life in which God liveth.

136.

   If now the highest happiness of man consist in this, that he keep
   silence, and listen only to the everlasting word, and avoid all other
   words, many will say, Why then should we listen to a sermon, to
   preaching? Preaching is nothing else than a leading to God, and the
   power of perceiving the everlasting word. But if man is far removed
   from God, he cannot hear the everlasting word, for when one is distant
   from another, he cannot perceive what the other saith to him in secret.
   Therefore this has to be said to mail in images and forms, that he may
   come to a sense of it, and understand the hidden word of God. Through
   the outer word that men hear, they attain to the inner word, which God
   speaketh in the essence of the soul. Christ also saith, "I have other
   sheep, these also must I lead up, that there may be one Shepherd and
   one fold" (John x. 16). Therefore preaching is needful to tell these
   people what to do who have not yet come into the proper fold, that they
   may hear the voice of the Shepherd. But the fold is nothing else than
   the essence of the soul, in which the Eternal Father speaketh His word,
   and if man cometh to this, that he perceives the eternal word in
   himself, he need not attend to all other things, but place himself in a
   complete silence. This is his best condition, therefore St. Austin
   saith, "The man who hath learnt of our Lord Jesus Christ to be meek and
   humble of heart, for him it is better that he pray and think of God
   than that he read or listen to preaching." [72] But they who have not
   come to this should hear preaching, and learn and follow what they hear
   or read; thus they come to the real truth, and to life, which is God.
   Even if a man is so advanced that he hear the word in himself, he is
   yet not at all times prepared for it, for bodily nature cannot bear it,
   and a man must sometimes turn to his senses and be active; but he ought
   to direct this work of the senses to the best end. If preaching is
   useful to him, he can hear it; if an outward virtue is useful to him,
   he can work it, and he ought to exercise himself in what he recognises
   as the best. But this by no means hindereth him from hearing the
   everlasting word, but it furthers him to what is best. If lie hath
   exercised himself in it, if the outer man hath been strengthened and
   directs itself according to the internal man, he must again enter into
   himself, perceive and listen to the eternal word, and this hearing
   bringeth him to everlasting life.

137.

   And he should drop and drive out with violence all that hindereth him
   in this. Then he hath the capacity of depriving himself of all that is
   not God, and of always hearing the eternal word in himself, which
   spriugeth from a living ground, in which God is. What he driveth away
   is as Jesus did in the Temple, when He drove out buyers and sellers,
   and said, "My house is a house of prayer, but ye have made it into a
   den of thieves" (Matt. xxi. 13). A pure heart is a temple of God, in
   which God the Father is worshipped; the tradesmen whom Jesus drove out
   are the worldly furniture and goods that rust in the heart and are
   hurtful to it. If now the heart keepeth the useless thoughts and
   tarries over them, it is no longer a house of prayer but a den of
   thieves, for the evil thoughts drive out God from its dwelling and
   murder Him. This cometh to pass when the heart is so entirely remote
   from Him that He can no more come in, and it is a real cavern, where
   all wickedness holds sway. This hinders God, so that He can no more
   come into His house, and therefore He nameth it a den of thieves.

138.

   But the man who resisteth all thoughts that keep him apart from God,
   and who giveth place to God only to dwell in him, receiveth this
   living, divine power from God the Father, who pours it into him. This
   inpouring is His inspeaking, and that is the life full of ecstasy and
   joy. Whoso hath not this life, that is, God Himself in a pure heart, he
   is also lacking all ecstasy and joy, he is more dead than alive, and
   that is ever against the nature of man. Sin killeth nature, but nature
   is abhorrent of death, therefore sin is against nature, therefore
   sinners can never have a joy. Just as little as the dead can rejoice
   can the sinners rejoice, for the ground from which genuine joy
   springeth is dead, and thus they cannot possibly rejoice. But in those
   men who live in genuine purity there is the fountain of all ecstasy and
   joy, and it admitteth of no sadness, for the eternal word, through
   which all angels and saints enjoy delight and ecstasy, speaketh in them
   as in the saints in heaven. "But that their joy is not so perfect as
   that of those in heaven cometh from this, that they still have their
   body with them. If they were free from their body they would have the
   same joy as those in heaven; but their joy is still now unspeakably,
   great, and the more they are freed from earthly things, the greater is
   their joy. If now earthly things hinder even pious men from their joys,
   how can those feel joy who are quite sunk in the earthly? They fancy
   they are in a goon condition, but this well-being is quite contrary to
   the true one, for just as it is never quite well with a soul as long as
   it is in the body, so also there is woe to those who are much burthened
   with earthly things. But those who dispense the most with earthly
   things have the true joy which springeth out of a living, pure ground,
   and the Holy Ghost is the source from which this joy streameth.
   Therefore St. Paul also said, "The fruit of the Holy Ghost is peace,
   joy, and righteousness" (Rom. xiv. 17; Gal. v. 22). The inspeaking of
   the Holy Ghost is life, from which all joy springeth. Whoso listeneth
   most to this voice, he hath life in the highest fulness, and where this
   is, is also the highest measure of joy. If now poverty of spirit is a
   pure instrument of God, with which God can work without any hindering,
   and where He can lay down His eternal word, which can give life to all
   creatures, then a poor man is full of this life, for he hath the
   fulness of the eternal word in himself, from which all joy springeth.

139.

   It might, however, now be said, If man is saved by this, that he
   heareth the word of God, he is also saved if he heareth the preacher
   who holds it forth to him; for Christ also saith, "Blessed are they
   that hear the word of God and do it" (Luke xi. 28). But I say that the
   speaking and hearing of the word of God is twofold; in the first place,
   it is internally saving; and secondly, it bringeth and fitteth a man
   for salvation.

140.

   The first is a speaking of God in the essence of the soul, where no
   creature can enter nor can it speak there, for here God alone dwelleth
   and also alone speaketh. [73] But God speaketh therein when the soul
   setteth aside all that is created, bringeth her power to silence, and
   hath a vision into the groundwork of her pure essence. In this pure and
   silent soul now God the Father speaketh, and she heareth His voice. But
   this hearing is nothing else than an internal feeling of God in the
   essence of the soul, which passeth over also to the forces, and in so
   great an ecstasy that she would gladly give up her working and let God
   alone work, only attending to His lead; and the more that she
   withholdeth from all working, the more God worketh in the soul. And
   whoso hath experienced this working in himself is saved and blessed;
   for God will not carry out His work in any creature, save in the soul
   which He hath chosen, to remain eternally in it. No creature which will
   sever itself from God is worthy of it, therefore God also doth not work
   in it. If Lucifer had felt this in himself he would never have fallen;
   for this working is so powerful that it moveth the soul out of itself
   to God. Then God embraceth the soul and unites her with Himself, so
   that she will and must eternally abide with Him; but this was lacking
   in Lucifer, therefore he also fell. The working is God's speaking; His
   work is His word, the Son of the Godhead; this happeneth in the essence
   of the soul.

141.

   The second is the working of God in the forces. The word is spoken by
   the preacher, and man heareth it with his bodily ears; but this will
   not save him unless he follows it in his life. This speaking taketh
   place through men in images and forms; but that which cometh to pass
   through means or media doth not save the soul, but it can bring them to
   salvation, and teaches them how they can lay aside the media or means
   so as to arrive at the pure essence, where the soul seeth God without
   anything intermediate. But if the soul can distinguish all things by
   reason, so that it is free from all defective accident, then she must
   let go all external words that are spoken through men; she must turn
   herself to the innermost of her being and here only perceive the
   eternal word which God the Father speaketh. And all other speech she
   ought not to hear, even if it came from the angels. It is true the word
   of the preacher is not his own but the word of God; but yet it is
   mediated, and doth not penetrate like the immediate word of God. If the
   soul hath freed herself from all intermediate things, if she is
   stripped of all images, she ought not to tarry with the mediate, but
   her object must be God in His pure being, and in this essentiality she
   ought to enter. But as long as man hath the external material about her
   and hath not attained to his inner essence, so long must she hearken to
   the external word; this then teacheth him how he should deprive himself
   in order to attain to the truth. In this way is the external word of
   God useful.

142.

   The second thing that the Spirit of God speaketh in the soul is light.
   Light is nothing but an adornment of the soul with which God adorneth
   her, clotheth her, and maketh her well-pleasing to Him. He saith also
   in the Book of Canticles to His bride, "Very fair art thou, My friend,
   and no stain is in thee; come from Lebanon; come, thou shalt be
   crowned." [74] This crown is the clear light with which God
   encompasseth and glorifieth the soul. Christ also said, "Father,
   glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son may also glorify Thee" (John xvii. 1);
   and there came a voice from heaven, "I have glorified Him, and will
   glorify Him again" (xii. 28). If the soul hath come so far that she
   bringeth forth the eternal word in her, and she bringeth herself forth
   with the same word in God, then is she a child of God; not a natural
   son, like the Word in the Godhead, but a son of grace, and thus can
   she, speak, "Father, glorify Thy son with Thy clearness, and with the
   same brightness will I also glorify Thee; this is the unspeakable
   praise that poureth forth from me to Thee." And a voice, the eternal
   word, will then also speak in her, "I have glorified thee, and will
   still more glorify thee" (John xvii. 1-4). This glorifying is the being
   encompassed by God, encompassing the soul with the same clarity that He
   hath and is Himself, and which glorifies the soul with itself.

143.

   The soul groweth perfect in this clarity. So long as she abideth in
   this body she will always increase more and more in this divine
   clarity, and according to the measure of her purity she groweth also in
   divine clarity. "We can take a likeness from the sun. The purer the air
   the brighter doth the sun shine and beam forth. So is it also with the
   soul; the purer it is the more doth the divine sun shine in her and
   purify her. If she be quite pure of defects of accident, then the
   divine sun penetrates immediately into her. But if she be
   over-burthened with venial sins the sun shineth in her mediately but
   not so brilliantly, only like a flame. If, however, the soul be laden
   with mortal sins, the light of the divine sun cannot penetrate into it.
   St. John also saith, "The darkness comprehendeth not the light" (John
   i. v). The light of the sun is nothing else than an encompassing of
   light, and wherever the light penetrates there it enlightens, and
   whatsoever is a recipient of light receiveth it. Air is refined, glass
   is pure, a flame is light, and therefore they are recipients of light
   and they receive it too. But whatever is coarse, impure, and thick can
   receive no light, such as earth, the stone, and wood. They are
   altogether coarse, thick, and impure, therefore the light of the sun
   cannot penetrate them. Exactly so is it with the soul. She is rough and
   coarse when she is overladen with earthly things; impure when she
   cleaveth to sensual pleasures; dense and darkened when she is occupied
   with outer of inner manifoldness; and thus the divine sun cannot
   penetrate or enlighten her, for she is not meet to receive light. That
   which is to receive light must be shaped accordingly. [75] But light is
   spiritual, freed from everything earthly; and if the soul wisheth to be
   enlightened by this Divine light she must become a pure spirit, emptied
   of all earthliness, and in this likeness she then receiveth this light

144.

   If therefore the soul is a pure spirit, emptied of all that is earthly,
   she is now a light herself for what is pure is also a light--it may be
   asked what further light is she to receive? If the soul is a pure
   spirit, free from the earthly, it is a light, but a light of her true
   nature. God hath placed a pure light in the soul, but this light is the
   soul herself, if she standeth in the highest dignity of her pure
   nature, and thus understandeth the distinction of all created things.
   The light which she still receiveth is a supernatural light, which God
   draweth in Himself and poureth into the soul that is capable of
   receiving it; and in proportion that the natural light is pure, the
   soul receiveth also the supernatural, which is a light of glory. [76]
   Just as with a glass, the purer it is, the more is it enlightened by
   the sun, so is it also with the soul. The purer it is, the more is it
   enlightened by the divine light; but if it is darkened, and far from
   God, she cannot receive the light. In a prison, that is quite walled
   in, the sun cannot penetrate; just so is also the soul laden with sins
   a dark prison, in which the divine sun cannot shine.

145.

   The soul must also be near the light, if she is to receive it. Though a
   glass were always quite pure, but it were not brought to the sun, it
   would not be enlightened. Thus also the soul must raise herself to the
   divine splendour if she is to receive the clarity of the light. But
   this being nigh is nothing else than an intense desire for God with
   perfect love in the light of faith; this maketh the soul receptive of
   the divine light. If she were even lacking in purity, so that she could
   not receive the divine light, but yet hath perfect faith and perfect
   love for God, then she becometh pure and receiveth the light. But if a
   man be even quite pure and without all sins, but without faith and love
   to God, then he cannot receive the divine light. Some are also found
   among the heathen, who kept themselves pure and virtuous, yet they
   lacked the divine light; the defect was, that they had not the faith,
   though they certainly had more natural light than other men. So there
   are many, who indeed keep themselves pure and free of mortal sins, but
   cannot well guard themselves against venial sins, and the divine light
   faileth them. The only cause thereof is that they do not approach it in
   the light of faith. The faith is Christ; but they only follow Him
   outwardly; for to follow Him innerly is lacking to them, and therefore
   they have not the divine light. God's light lighteth in the heart, and
   whoso wisheth to have this light must turn into himself, and thereby he
   will perceive the light in himself. But whoever followeth Christ only
   in an outwardly way, doth not receive the right light, for Christ
   saith, "If your righteousness do not exceed that of the Pharisees and
   Scribes, you will by no means enter the kingdom of God" (Matt. v. 20).

146.

   The Pharisees are those men who appear outwardly quite holy in many
   good works, but who despise the truth and do not follow it in thorough
   righteousness. These cannot enter into the kingdom of God, which is in
   the depths and foundation of the soul. But he that desireth to reach
   it, must exercise himself in all good works, outwardly and inwardly;
   thus such a man surpasseth the Pharisees in righteousness, and
   attaineth to the kingdom of God, in the essence of the soul, where is
   the kingdom of God. The Pharisees of the old covenant held indeed the
   laws outwardly, but inwardly they were quite false. But this did not
   make them righteous; they seemed indeed righteous, but were not so. We
   must exceed this apparent righteousness if we would come into heaven.
   What of righteousness we show outwardly must hold sway in full measure
   internally. This maketh us then capable of receiving the divine light;
   therefore St. Paul saith, "Appear what ye are, and be what ye appear!"
   "Abstain from all appearance of evil" (1 Thess. v. 22). [77] Whoso
   wisheth to have the divine light in himself must follow Christ
   outwardly and inwardly. Outwardly by a poor life and all good works
   that appertain unto it; inwardly by a perfect faith, by the
   consideration of His good works and of His bitter Passion. In him is
   then inflamed a perfect love, that maketh him meet to receive the
   divine light, whereby he surpasseth all Pharisees in righteousness.

147.

   Man must likewise surpass the Scribes in righteousness. The Scribes in
   the old covenant were those who taught the people, but what they taught
   other people they did not practise themselves. It also cometh to pass,
   that such men show themselves as inwardly righteous, so that men
   believe that they are really so; but this inwardness is not divine but
   natural. The natural light of their reason cometh to their help; they
   can distinguish all things, which maketh them so eloquent, and they
   hold themselves to be quite internal men. They are also difficult to
   detect, and only the perfect man, who is enlightened with the divine
   light, can recognise them; these people are quite like the Scribes of
   the old covenant. Whoso wisheth to attain to the divine light must
   surpass them in righteousness, for their righteousness consisteth only
   in words, but hath no life. If they enter into their interior, this
   only taketh natural images, and as there is too much natural truth in
   them, they do not obtain the supernatural light. Their outer emptiness
   and their internally dwelling in themselves make them reasonable in a
   natural way. But whoso wisheth to have the divine light must speak
   little, but what he speaketh must, have life. He must consider his
   faults and lay them aside, and exercise himself diligently in
   contemplating the Passion of our Lord. If he now wisheth to distinguish
   how he is to part with his defects and increase in virtues, he must not
   long linger over such distinction; he must rise above the distinction
   of created images, and must penetrate through to the uncreated best,
   which is God; thus he attaineth to the true divine light.

148.

   But how can you know the distinction of the natural and the divine
   light? A likeness thereto is given by the moon and the sun. The moon
   receiveth its light from the sun, for she is in herself cold and damp,
   and even when the sun throweth his light upon her, he warmeth nothing
   thereby. From this we recognise the moon, that her light giveth no
   warmth, and her light maketh, as you see, many objects doubtful in
   moonlight; it also deceiveth often. Such is also the natural light in
   the reason of man. As the moon receiveth her light from the sun, so
   also the natural light is cold and not warming; and just as the light
   of the moon is unproductive of fruit, so also the natural light in
   itself is unfruitful, for it produceth few fruits that are useful for
   everlasting life. If the natural light could produce fruits whereby man
   could attain to heaven, in that case many heathen would be in heaven,
   who are, perhaps, condemned; for by his mere nature man cannot come
   into heaven, but grace must work together with it. What is also viewed
   by natural light remaineth doubtful; it is only a weening or
   conjecture, but not a perfect knowledge. The natural light remaineth
   dim because it only consists in images and forms, and you cannot see
   pure truth thereby; though these natural men believe that a thing is so
   and not otherwise. In this way the natural light is quite like
   moonlight. But the light of the sun is like unto the divine light. The
   light of the sun enlighteneth the air immediately, thus also the divine
   light enlighteneth the soul immediately. The light of the sun giveth
   warmth, and the divine light warmeth, and the soul gloweth thereby in
   divine love, and through this that she receiveth the light, she also
   receiveth the warmth of the light, and all inequality, unlikeness, and
   each doubt of truth passeth away and vanisheth in the warmth of the
   divine light. The sun is fructifying, the parent of all earthly life,
   for all creatures experience the influence of the sun. If the sun were
   to pass away and his light were withdrawn from the earth, all would
   perish. Thus the sun is the begetter and upholder of creatures; their
   generation is wonderful, and no one can perfectly see through it; no
   sage was great enough to know all that the sun bringeth forth. He
   begetteth the fish in the water, the beast on the earth, the bird in
   the air, the phoenix in the fire, and many other unknown beings that
   God only knoweth. So is it often with the divine sun; it is
   fruit-bringing, and the parent of all spiritual creatures. God hath
   created the soul and the angels immediately, but He hath created the
   bodily creature through the sun. The soul and the angels have been
   created immediately by God, and also receive immediately the influence
   of the divine sun. If the divine sun were to withdraw its light from
   the soul she would perish, not like earthly things, for the soul is
   dead when she lacketh the divine inworking, for of herself she hath not
   the life that saveth, but she must receive it from God.

149.

   Some will say, however, there are many good men who have not a special
   inworking from God, and yet their soul is not dead thereby. There are
   three kinds of men. Some live in mortal sins; these lack the influx of
   God entirely, and are also quite spiritually dead. But that they are
   yet called back to life is a much greater wonder than the resurrection
   of the bodily dead, for as much nobler as the soul is than the body, so
   is it much greater when she cometh again to life. A teacher saith on
   this point, "It is a greater work to convert a sinner from his sins
   than to create heaven and earth." [78] Others abstain indeed from heavy
   mortal sins, but yet not from all venial sins; these are neither dead
   nor living; they do not indeed entirely lack the divine co-operation,
   but it is slight, so that the outer forces feel nothing. They conceive
   also that they have a lack of divine influence, and yet are they good
   men, for they exercise themselves in many good works. Lastly, the third
   kind of men consists of those who guard themselves against all sins,
   but this cannot come to pass without divine grace. They live in truth;
   they are not lacking in divine influence, and this is so strong that it
   streameth over from the soul to the outer forces of man, and they
   recognise the splendour of the divine clarity. With the same efflux out
   of God they come back again to God with the same clarity, which is God
   Himself; they are also clarified and preserved from all fall. As,
   therefore, the sun is fructifying, for it generates all things among
   creatures, so is it also with the divine sun, for it bringeth forth all
   truth in the soul; but its generation is wonderful, and no one knoweth
   it perfectly save God alone.

150.

   No man hath been yet so wise by nature that he could recognise the most
   unimportant work that God worketh in a pure soul. Therefore also no man
   should judge good men. A really holy man is hidden from all natural
   men; but such a man ought not to proclaim his secret, especially not to
   those who are ready with words by nature and make fine speeches, but
   have little life. According to their natural conceptions they cannot
   understand what grace worketh in a pure heart; therefore they often
   hold that which is good to be not good, and what is evil to be not
   evil.

151.

   The begetting of the divine sun is wonderful. We will carry over the
   simile of the natural sun's begetting to the divine sun. The natural
   sun produceth the fish in the water, the divine sun maketh all the
   works of the senses fruitful, for by the water is to be understood the
   senses. As the water is unsteady and fluctuating, so also are the
   senses. If the senses in their movements turn to virtue, and go on to
   work, they have become fruitful. This is effected by the divine sun,
   which hath enlightened them and rendered them fruitful.

152.

   The natural sun produceth the beasts of the earth and fructifieth the
   earth. When the body exerciseth itself in all good works, its activity
   bringeth forth fruit for everlasting life, as Christ also saith,
   "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I give him, his body shall be a
   source of living water flowing into everlasting life." [79] The living
   water is the divine light which penetrates into the soul and maketh her
   overflowing in all virtues, in order that she may come to everlasting
   life.

153.

   The natural sun also begetteth the bird. By the bird is understood the
   thought of man. As the bird flieth hither and thither, so also are the
   thoughts of man restless and roving, but these too are made
   fruit-bringing by the divine sun. If at length they turn from the
   earthly and fly to the contemplation of the Passion of our Lord, and
   thereby into the true Godhead, they bring forth here incalculable
   fruits. This is worked by the divine light, which irradiates and beams
   round the thoughts, and leadeth them to God. By the air is also
   understood the reason of man. Just as the natural sun produceth in the
   air various things, grass and plants, so also doth the divine sun bring
   forth in the reason various wonderful things and truths. With this
   truth it adorneth the reason and prepareth for it Unspeakable rapture,
   so that no heart can conceive and no mouth express it. St. Paul found
   himself in this rapture when he said, "I have seen things that it is
   not lawful to mention." He recognised in himself the truth which he
   could not express in words, therefore he said, "which it is not lawful
   to mention." Whoso speaketh out what he perceiveth in himself proveth
   that he hath never yet found in himself right divine truth, and it
   cometh easily to pass that they who babble the most have the least pure
   truth. For divine truth consisteth not in speeches but in silence, and
   keeping within, recollected. St. Paul saith, "On these things we should
   be silent." [80] What can be said on the subject consists only in
   images, but divine truth is raised above images and separated from all
   images. Human reason beholdeth indeed the truth, but cannot embrace or
   obtain it, for this truth outrunneth the reason. By this going forward
   it draweth reason after it. If now then reason directeth its course to
   the summit of perfection, then it seizeth the truth, and this seizing
   is everlasting life. Then only when it hath reached this has it found
   rest and satisfaction. But man will not find perfect satisfaction or
   rest on earth, because as man liveth in time he must grow and advance,
   therefore he cannot find perfect rest. But if the soul parteth from the
   body and cometh to everlasting life, then the pure truth is her object,
   and therein she findeth satisfaction and rest. Thus is the reason
   adorned with the divine light.

154.

   The natural sun also produceth the phoenix in the fire, [81] and
   bringeth it to life without other creatures. For it is not born like
   other creatures through the influence of creatures, therefore it is the
   noblest creature that is born under the sun. Exactly in like manner
   doth the divine light produce the will, and maketh it fruitful in many
   virtues. By the phoenix is understood the will, for as the phoenix is
   the noblest creature, so is the will the first power of the soul; and
   as the phoenix reneweth itself ill the fire, so also doth the will in
   the divine fire. As the phoenix holdeth the first place among creatures
   having life, so hath the will the first place in God among the
   remaining creatures and forces. If it hath the first and the highest
   place, so hath it also the best fruit; and just as the phoenix is born
   immediately from the sun, without the help of other creatures, so also
   the true fruit of the will is produced immediately by God, therefore
   the will is raised above all things, and thus beareth its fruits. If it
   is free from all things that are not God, the divine light shines
   gloriously and maketh it fruitful. If the will is entirely separated
   from all things and united with God, it also produceth with God that
   which God produceth. This fruit that the divine light bringeth forth in
   the will is essential, for God's being is bestowed on all creatures,
   only each receives it according to its receptivity. Thus also the fruit
   of a perfect will is common to all creatures according to their
   receptive faculty. A perfect will desires a perfect good, for the good
   is the object of the will; the same perfect good it desireth also for
   all creatures that are receptive of good, such as the soul and the
   angels. The soul and the angels are alone receptive of an essential
   good, but all other creatures only of an accidental good. Essential
   good, which is God only, is carried over by a perfect will to all
   rational creatures. Therefore a perfect will worketh essentially in all
   creatures; ita fruit and its work are essential. This essential fruit
   is worked by the divine sun in the perfect will; but in the will that
   is not quite perfect, though good, it only bringeth forth accidental
   fruit. Nothing can work above its powers; if, therefore, the will be
   not perfect, it cannot carry out any perfect work; therefore its fruit
   is not perfect nor essential, but accidental.

155.

   But what is a perfect will, whereby works and virtues are essential? A
   perfect will is an abandonment of all that is not God. If a man hath
   not done this in works, he must do it in will if he will be perfect.
   What lacketh him still in works he must lay aside, and free himself in
   proper order. If he doeth this, and hath exercised himself in
   accidental virtues, he obtaineth the essence; the will penetrates into
   the essence, and thereby worketh also essential works, for where two
   things are one, then they have one working. If now the will hath
   entirely passed over into the essence, it hath also one working with
   tie essence. Each thing worketh according to its quality, and thus the
   essence worketh essentially, and the will with it. It is not, however,
   a work that is brought about by the movement of the forces, but it is a
   standing still without all motion, and it is Divine. In this manner
   worketh God, accordingly an essential work is only thus brought forth.

  What a perfect will is, whereof the works and virtue are essential.

156.

   Now some person might say, How can this be, that the will can work an
   essential work, when it is nevertheless a force which is movable; and
   what is movable cannot work anything essential? To this I say, that the
   will hath two drifts or direction's, one to the creature and time, and
   the other to God. And in case the will is turned to the creature, and
   to time, and to the body, it is movable, and cannot generate or work
   out any essential work. Nothing can work above its power; if, then, the
   creature and time are unsteady, and the will is united with time, from
   this cause its working is unsteady and movable, and therefore it is not
   essential. For an essential work is immovable, and therefore he who
   wisheth to work an essential work, his will must have parted from all
   creatures and from time. The other drift which the will hath is in God,
   and in case the will is directed to God, it is immovable with God, for
   movement is only in time and in those who are overladen with accidents;
   and if the will be raised above time into eternity, and is emptied of
   all accidents, and penetrates into the essential good, which is God,
   behold all then that God worketh, the will also worketh with God. And
   since God's works are essential, so also the works of the will are
   essential and immovable. For just as when an imperfect thing is united
   with one that is perfect, it will not work according to its
   imperfection, but it works according to that with which it is
   united--such also is the right order which is held in the works of the
   will For the will of man is in itself imperfect, and therefore of
   itself it hath an imperfect work; but if the will raiseth itself above
   itself and above all things in God, then hath it also a perfect work
   with God; for what is one hath also one working. Now if the will is
   united with God, it hath then one working with God, and the divine
   light bringeth forth in the will essential fruit.

157.

   Here the question might be put, What is an essential work? An essential
   work is when the essence of the soul is one and simple, and is placed
   in complete silence. And through simplicity it hath communion with all
   things; for what is most simple is most universal, and imparts itself
   to all things, and yet remains undivided and unmoved in itself. And to
   communicate and divide with all things is called an essential working;
   and in this working one work is all works, and all works are one work.
   For just as God seeth all things with one glance, and it worketh
   without any movement of Himself, so doeth also an essential will. It
   seeth all things in one glance, and in this one glance it worketh all
   works, and all works are only one glance. And this worketh the divine
   light in the will, for a perfect will is so dear to God that He will
   reward it with all gifts, and will make it fruitful in all things. For
   if God did not give all things to a perfect will, so that something of
   his own might remain to him, God would not have rewarded him, and the
   will would have no satisfaction; therefore God must give all things,
   that is, Himself, to a perfect will. Of this St. Austin speaketh, "If
   God gave me all things without Himself, it would not satisfy me; but if
   I have God I have all things, and with that I am satisfied." [82]
   Therefore let him who wisheth to work in pure tranquillity, be careful
   that he have a perfect will, in which God begetteth all virtue and all
   truth; and thus he taketh hold of the essence of perfection. Therefore
   Solomon saith, "I have sought rest in all things." [83] Now, man hath
   in all things rest if he hath exercised himself in all virtues, so that
   he taketh hold of the essence of all virtues, for then he resteth and
   husheth, leaving God only to work; and without any effort all truth
   poureth into him. For into a pure being flow all virtue and truth, and
   he lacketh nothing; for where a pure being is, there is no defect.
   Therefore a man hath nothing further to do than to lay himself aside,
   and when he hath once laid himself aside, that he keep himself purely
   passive, and in this purity he hath all virtue and all truth. And he
   need not seek virtue or truth here or there, for he hath them within
   him. And all men are lacking in virtue and truth, save alone a perfect,
   pure, and poor man. He hath them, and the divine will hath worked this
   in a perfect will, and the essential working endureth always without
   end. And because man is in time he hath a growth in essential truth,
   and he penetrates continually into the essential good, which is God;
   whether he sleep or wake, or eat or drink, he is always advancing. Just
   as little can the perfect will stand still: it always hasteneth to God.
   This is the supernatural power whereby the will is led; and as God, who
   leadeth the will, is eternal, so also is the course of the will
   eternal.

158.

   Objection might be made to this by some one saying, Just before it was
   said that the will was immovable, and now, again, I speak of a course
   of the will; but this is a movement? We said above that if the will
   turneth away from all things and uniteth with God, that it is
   immovable. And that is true; and this immobility is to be thus
   understood, that it no longer moveth to the creature and to time, for
   it is raised above creatures and time, and therefore it is not moved by
   the creature nor by time. And it turneth no more to this or to that,
   but it willeth always One, and that is God; to Him it cleaveth alway,
   without any going back; and therefore is it called immovable, for it
   suffereth not itself to be moved from God. Bui when I spoke of the will
   always running forward, this merely means an everlasting advance into
   God and His eternal immobility; and this stability of the will is meant
   by its immobility. For creaturely movement is to this and to that, and
   this will is not such, but it inclineth alway toward God, and
   penetrates into God, and this penetration is its course or running. And
   the running is not after the manner of creatures, and therefore it is
   not to be valued as a movement, but it is after a divine fashion, and
   therefore is it immovable, for the will never moveth outside God, but
   abideth alway in God. This indwelling (in God) is its running, and its
   running is its indwelling, and the more it runneth the more sure and
   steadfast is its indwelling, and the more rapid its course in God, the
   more firm and complete is its silence and immobility.

159.

   Some one might now say, How can this be, that man cometh to this in
   time, that his will becometh immovable, for man is scarcely so perfect
   that he doth not mark how his will inclineth now to one side and now to
   another, and as man is born in time, he hath a movement with time? To
   this I answer, That man is made up of time and of eternity, and hence
   he must have an influence from them both. The body is receptive of the
   temporal influence, which he must endure, because he liveth in time.
   Then from the necessity of the body, the will inclineth to the body,
   that the body should strive to satisfy its necessity. In this way the
   will is certainly movable, and inclineth now to one thing and now to
   another, in order that the body may have its necessity. If, now, a man
   ordereth bodily things with discretion, and giveth the body the
   necessity that belongeth to it, and which it consumeth in the service
   of God and according to the doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ, this man
   is not against the truth nor against perfection, nor is this really a
   movement. For it is a movement for the will to turn from good to bad,
   and that is not here the case; for the will only grants to the body
   what is quite necessary, and in real sincerity and truth; but what a
   man doth not want that the will doth not grant. If, then, a perfect
   will dwelleth always in truth and in perfection, and doth not let
   itself be led out of them, it is called properly immovable. And any
   movement that may take place in a perfect man is more a movement of the
   senses than of the will; for a perfect will willeth God only, and what
   is otherwise, as a necessity of the body, it suffereth the senses to
   seek; and he doth not this for the pleasure or comfort of the body, but
   for the honour of God. When, then, the liody taketh its necessity, the
   will taketh the power which the body hath received from the food, and
   transfers it to God, so that it is absorbed in God, and thus is the
   will immovable. Any movement that takes place in it is for the sake of
   virtue, for it is not to be moved by any evil propensity or vice; and
   thus it remaineth always in the truth, and therefore it suffereth not
   itself to be moved. This immobility is also worked again by the divine
   light, which streams round the will, and consisteth in no untruth.

160.

   It is sometimes said, that poor men stand too much on their own will
   and like much to follow it, and that this is a fault in them. To this I
   answer, that a right poor man is entirely resigned and hath given up
   his will, and never carrieth out his own will; but he fulfilleth alway
   His will to whom he hath resigned himself, that is, God's will. Again
   it might be said, What is your own will? and what is a resigned will?
   Your own will is nothing else than a holding yourself possession of
   bodily and spiritual things.

161.

   The man who hath not yet parted with all temporal things, internally
   and externally, has still possession of his will for it is the property
   of the will, that it inclineth to creatures and to time, and hence he
   who is overladen with creatures, hath still property in his will.
   Therefore whoso wisheth to be free of all property, must leave
   creatures inwardly and outwardly, as far as may consist with,
   discretion. It might now be said, There are many good people, who have
   their outward necessity and yet internally hold no property, for they
   purpose the honour of God in it, and if they knew that it was the will
   of God, they would leave all things. To this I answer: When a man is
   internally free from all property and selfhood he is so outwardly; for
   what a man hath in his heart, he worketh outwardly, whether it be good
   or evil; and therefore, it they are quite free internally, this would
   appear also outwardly. They might be quite free internally, but if they
   knew that outward things sever them from God, they would leave them and
   give themselves up to a poor life; but that they are perfectly free
   from all selfhood is not so. They say, no doubt, that they would leave
   all, if they knew that it is the will of God, and they would "assume
   poverty." But it is the holiest will of God that maketh us quite
   perfect, thus when St. Paul saith: "This is the will of God, our
   salvation and our sanctification." [84] But the highest perfection
   lieth in poverty, therefore it is also the will of God that we should
   be poor, for Christ Himself saith, "If thou wilt be perfect, sell all
   and give to the poor, and come, follow Me." If it were not the will of
   God, He would not have said it. Therefore he who wisheth to be empty of
   his own will, must set himself free from all outward possession.

162.

   Further, keeping possession of ourselves in spiritual things is from
   self-will, and indeed in a twofold way. First, a man taketh on himself
   an external work that hindereth him entirely in his perfection, but he
   will not give it up, but carry it out according to his own head,
   believing it to be good, though another seeth that it is not good. He
   would gladly bring the other from it and direct him to something
   better, but the other will not follow it. This also is from self-will
   of man, which hindereth him in his perfection. Secondly, if a man hath
   a false view and holdeth it as true, but will not suffer himself to be
   brought from it, that is again self-will. And even if his opinion is
   partly right, but another understandeth the thing better, only the
   former will not hear the latter, when he insists on having the
   advantage given to his own more ignorant view. Nay, if a man's opinion
   be really the true one, so that a different view of the case cannot be
   entertained, the man of the stamp we are considering will boast of it
   too much, despise other people, hold them to be devoid of
   understanding, and think himself the wisest of all. This cometh all
   from an overbearing will, which is very destructive.

163.

   But if a man is more modest in this his opinion, if he doth not despise
   other people, and yet is too rejoiced in his having so much
   penetration, this hinders him from his perfection, which surpasseth all
   that is human, for the highest perfection cannot be grasped by the
   senses, but you must be raised above the senses into a state of
   silence; the reason must drop its imagery and be tranquil and at rest,
   and in this way you seize hold on that which is per feet. And whoso
   doth not suffer this in proper order, hath still his own will, which is
   destructive. St. Dionysius saith, "Quiet yourselves, that ye be at rest
   from all contest." A single view of pure divine truth is better than
   all the works that holy Christendom worketh one with another. [85]
   Christ also saith, "Ye need not take heed as to what ye shall say when
   ye have to answer, for it shall be given unto you in that hour what ye
   shall say." [86] Christ means by this, that man should not trouble his
   mind with thoughts and place them as intermediate things between God
   and his soul, but he should at all times keep silence and let God alone
   speak. The Divine Word instructeth him more in all wisdom, what he
   should speak, if it be necessary, than if he were to learn and study
   more what he ought to say. [87] David said also, "Happy is the man whom
   Thou, Lord, teachest." [88] He is taught by God when he keepeth
   silence, and God only speaketh in him. This speaking maketh him blessed
   and teacheth him all truth.

164.

   Supposing, now, that all which a man understandeth is perfectly true,
   but he valueth it little, and findeth no joy in it, but findeth more
   pleasure in that which is raised above all imagery, in pure, divine
   truth; if in this condition he has to work out virtue outwardly, that
   belongeth to him of necessity, and he cannot give himself up properly
   to this work, for he is continually too much occupied with God for him
   to trouble himself about external things, and he wisheth to be free
   from them; then I say, he still hath self-will.

165.

   It might certainly be asked, Is it not better that a man should only
   mark the state of his heart and suffer God to work in him, than that he
   should trouble himself about outer works? I answer, Yes; but a
   distinction is needful here. It needeth a man, who hath so exercised
   himself in virtues, that though an external virtue were to rejoice him,
   he would no more be able to work it; and this happeneth in two ways.

166.

   First, if he have expended all that he had already on virtue, so that
   he hath no longer any matter on which to exercise virtue, if thus he
   would gladly work it, but cannot, as he hath nothing, and is poor, and
   is furthermore devoted to God, so that he cannot sever himself from God
   for a single moment; if he is further weak in body, so that he hath no
   more strength to work external virtue this excuseth him from the
   exercise of outward virtue, and if he turned to outward things he would
   commit a fault. Virtue must now work in the will, and the will is more
   pleasing to God than the outward work. That he doth not work this, doth
   not hinder his self-sacrifice, for it is the right self-sacrifice that
   he hath freed himself from all outward works, and that God can work
   unhindered within him. These are the genuine supplicants who pray in
   spirit and in truth; in spirit, because their spirit is one with God,
   and in truth, because, without any defects, they suffer God alone to
   work in them, and practise every virtue inwardly in the will. The
   virtue which they then work is essential virtue. For all accident
   droppeth away, and a pure essence alone remaineth, and in this pure
   essence is virtue worked, and for that reason it is called essential,
   for it cometh to pass in the essence and not in accidents. And these
   men can work all virtue in one moment. For their nature is so simple
   and so refined that it can penetrate into each virtue and work it. And
   this virtue is almost equal to the divine virtue, for as God exciteth
   and worketh all virtue, remaining Himself immovable in perfect rest,
   thus such men excite every virtue. Before a virtue is begun to be
   practised, it is previously excited in a pure heart; for a pure heart
   awakeneth more virtues in love than all men can carry out in works.
   This heart also a wakeneth virtue and yet remaineth immovable,
   therefore is this virtue like God's virtue. Such men who have virtue in
   essence can let drop accidental virtue without a sin, and in giving up
   their own will.

167.

   But the man who holdeth temporal things and hath not yet devoted all to
   virtue, must work out, at all events, the virtues necessary to his
   state. And even if God were to work inwardly in him, yet must he often
   break off from the internal work and practise external virtue; he must
   do this if he hath an object for it, and necessity demands it. He must
   do it if he wisheth to be humble, and if he doeth it not he committeth
   a fault; he omitteth to do it from self-will, and not through the will
   of God. He cannot yet possess virtue in essence, as he is still
   burthened with the temporal; it is therefore needful for him to
   exercise accidental virtues so long till he is emptied of all
   accidents. If he is then emptied of the accidental, he is then free
   from the necessity of exercising this kind of virtue (the accidental)
   and worketh it henceforth essentially. If an object faileth for this
   exercise, he must omit it, but if one is found he must do it. Thus man
   is humble if he exerciseth all virtue, till virtue becometh his
   property and his very essence, and if this hath come to pass, he can
   omit accidental virtue. But whoso hath not obtained all virtue, till it
   hath become his very being, he still possesseth a property in his
   self-will. He may indeed say to others that he is willing to give way
   and do all that he is commanded to do, and he may thus believe that he
   possesseth humility and hath given up his own will. This may be all
   well and good. But true humility lieth in the virtues; the more a man
   hath of these, the humbler he becometh, and the more hath given up his
   own will. If a man possesseth all virtue he is always humble; if he
   hath it not, he doth not give way, and is not free from his own will,
   though he give out what he pleaseth.

168.

   Now that man entirely give himself up to virtue, is worked out by the
   divine light, which lighteth the will, and enkindleth in it the fire of
   divine love, which driveth him on henceforth to virtue, and suffereth
   him not to rest till he hath hold on the essence of all virtue. Whoso
   followeth this light is humble, and no one else. A man may indeed show
   a denial of self, but this rather hindereth a man from true humility
   than helpeth him to it. It often cometh to pass that rich folk assume
   humility, and say to others they will give way; but these people only
   give way as far as they free themselves from temporal things and
   practise virtue, but no further; he, however, who entereth into himself
   and perceiveth the divine light in him, followeth all that is said to
   him by God; and this man is humble, and hath departed from his
   self-will.

169.

   It might be said, This light is doubtful, for men are often deceived,
   holding a natural or a devilish light to be divine. Therefore is it
   good that a man should trust to another who hath more light. I say it
   is good for a man who standeth in doubt to let himself be led, so that
   he may be shown what is best, which he can and ought to follow. He
   should not only stop at external doctrine, but carry it into the light
   of his heart, see what he finds good, and follow it. Above all things
   should he turn to the Passion of our Lord, consider it with great
   earnestness, and what he learneth there he should follow, but he should
   compare what he hath learnt with the testimony of Holy Scripture and
   the general teaching of the Church; thus he cannot err. Nor is it
   necessary that he should always regard what his Leader saith and
   commandeth him; but he should mark this especially, what God commandeth
   him inwardly, that should he chiefly follow, and thus cometh he to true
   humility. By the counsel of men only he cometh not thereto; man only
   counselleth what is human, and this doth not make perfect. But God's
   counsel is divine, and this maketh perfect. Whoso followeth His
   teaching cometh to the highest perfection. "Blessed is the man," saith
   David, "whom Thou, O Lord, teachest." [89]

170.

   It might here be said that the teaching of an exemplary man is from
   God, therefore you should always follow it. I answer, that the teaching
   of an exemplary man is from Cod. But it is still in the intermediate,
   and so long as a man thus standeth he is not immediately touched by
   God, for to be so he should not follow any creature, but God. If,
   however, he hath come so far that God toucheth him without any
   mediation, he should give way to no creature. For God hath revealed to
   him a li^ht in which he cannot err, and God giveth him enough to do
   with himself, so that he forgetteth all creatures, and therefore, saith
   the Master of Nature (Aristotle), "Whoso is touched by the first cause
   must follow no human counsel, but Him who is above all human counsel."
   [90]

171.

   It might be here said, How is man to understand if he is touched by
   God? By two things. First, when God cometh into the soul He revealeth
   Himself with a new light, which man hath never known in himself before,
   and this light breaketh out with heat in the body, so that man by
   bodily feeling is aware of the divine light, and the heat of the light
   giveth him to wit that it is from God. For the light of nature, that is
   cold; but the divine light is hot. In the second place, when God
   revealeth Himself to the soul, this is without all doubt, and man
   cannot doubt it. And though all men were to say it is not from God,
   that would not affect him; for he hath found such truth in him as no
   one can give, save God only. But natural light is doubtful, and a
   weening or conjecturing. But this light and this feeling are without
   all doubt or conjecture, and form a complete knowing. And those who
   have felt it know that it is true what I say; but those who have not
   felt, cannot either know it.

Part Second. How is a man to attain to a perfect, poor life?

   How is a man to attain to a perfect, poor life?

1.

   The second part of this book treats of how a man shall come to a
   perfect, poor life, in which man seizeth hold on the highest and
   closest (perfection), and what things a man must consider in order that
   he become poor. First, man must consider the teaching and the life of
   Jesus Christ, for He hath taught poverty and lived it. And a man should
   follow the teaching and the life, if he wisheth to be perfect, for He
   saith, "Whoso loveth Me keepeth My commandments and My counsels, and
   heareth My word." [91] The love to our Lord, in the lowest degree, is
   that we keep the Ten Commandments, which are necessary for everlasting
   life. The second degree of love to Jesus is, that we keep His counsels,
   that is, His teaching of the Holy Gospels, in which He hath counselled
   us to follow Him in .a poor life, as when He said. "Whoso cometh after
   Me, let him deny himself."
     __________________________________________________________________

  In the first place, the teaching and the life of our Lord Jesus Christ impel a
  man to a poor life.

2.

   It might now be said, What is man in his selfhood, that he must deny,
   if he wisheth to follow after Christ? Man's selfhood consisteth in four
   things. First, his frailty, and that he falleth into sins; and this he
   must needs set aside; he must die to his defects and sins, and mortify
   himself. Secondly, he is inclined to creatures. For man is inclined by
   nature to his like, and he must kill nature, and must withdraw from
   creatures, for God and creatures are opposites. And therefore he who
   wisheth to have God must leave creatures. For the soul is so narrow
   that God and the creature cannot dwell together in her; and therefore
   if God is to dwell in thy soul, the creature must remain without. The
   third point is, that man to part from selfhood should drop all sensual
   delight, for he must die to this and kill it in himself, it he wisheth
   to have God's comfort. As St. Bernard saith, "The comfort of God is so
   noble that no one receiveth it who seeketh comfort elsewhere." [92] The
   fourth thing a man must let go, if he wisheth to follow Christ, is
   spiritual natural comforts, which are generated in man, by detecting
   the distinction between spiritual and natural knowledge. Through his
   reason man turneth from natural things to spiritual images and forms,
   and shapes them so as to form a rational distinction, which giveth him
   great delight; this pleasure is natural, but it surpasseth all fleshly
   lust. But whoever tarries by this natural rational delight, hinders
   himself from the supernatural delight which God in His grace imparteth
   to the soul. Man often hoMs this natural joy to be the working of
   grace, but is grievously deceived in taking that to be of grace which
   only cometh from nature. Now. although this pleasure of the soul doth
   not blind so much as bodily pleasure, it must nevertheless be
   abandoned, for it hindereth perfecting. This pleasure pushed the
   heathen to the knowledge of natural truth. Whosoever stoppeth in this
   is therefore like the heathen, and not like unto Christ, and is not by
   any means a poor man, who followeth Christ.

3.

   But it will here be asked, How shall man deny himself that these four
   things may be killed in him?

4.

   First, man should kill sin in himself through virtue; for just as man
   is removed from God by sin must he be brought nigh again unto God by
   virtue. St. Paul saith, "As ye gave up your members to serve sin in
   unrighteousness, so give ye up now also your members to serve virtue in
   righteousness." [93] Man hath from his nature a leaning to sin,
   therefore he must exercise himself in all virtues if he wisheth to
   conquer his defects; but let no one believe that he is free from sins,
   unless he hath taken unto himself all the virtues.

5.

   But who knoweth, wilt thou ask, if he have all virtues? I answer to
   this like John, who saith, "Whosoever is born of God cannot sin." [94]
   For in the same moment in which God the Father begetteth His Son in the
   soul, all sins and all unlikeness disappear, and all virtues are born
   in her in a likeness to God. In the same moment man standeth there
   without sins, in all virtues. Man also hath all virtues if he employs
   all the faculties he can use to virtue, so that he bringeth about
   virtue essentially in a perfect will, working no longer accidentally
   but essentially. But no one can do this save a pure, poor man, who hath
   stripped himself of all things for the sake of virtue, who cleaveth to
   God alone and worketh virtue in God.

6.

   Hath a man virtue in such fulness that he needeth no more? This must be
   understood differently and in two ways. First, if the outer man hath
   virtue, he can never have too much, so that he needeth no more in
   number, magnitude, and purity. He must practise continually more and
   more virtues, and as long as he liveth on earth always grow and
   advance. He must strive that his virtues may become always greater and
   greater, and also that they may become purer, which must be his
   endeavour even to the end. Secondly, if the inner man have all the
   virtues, he needeth then no more in number; for whoever possesseth one
   virtue perfectly, he hath them all; he embraceth in the unity of his
   will all the virtues, so that none are any more wanting to him. But his
   love for virtue must grow, it must be always greater and greater for
   each virtue, it must also increase in purity, that the virtue may be
   always purer and purer. Thus he groweth in virtues until death, and
   overcometh sin with them.

7.

   The second thing that man must shun is the love for creatures. Poverty
   of spirit is a going out of yourself and out of everything earthly.
   Thereby he despiseth creatures, is despised by them, and is thus set
   free. A truly poor man taketh nothing from creatures, but all from God,
   be it bodily or spiritual. God alone will be the Giver. And truly whoso
   receiveth something elsewhere than from God is no truly poor man, for a
   man can give nothing to a perfectly poor man, except it come as a gift
   from God, therefore is it also good, as God alone is the Giver, and a
   poor man can gladly leave all things in order that he may receive from
   God alone. His bodily friends withdraw their love from him, and the
   love that they still show him cometh from grace. Therefore the gift to
   a poor man hath such a great reward, for everything is given to him of
   grace; his life is, moreover, fruitful, as all who show him love reap a
   reward, and not only doth he come into heaven, but he leadeth also
   others with him. But whoso possesseth temporal things, to him all is
   given only out of natural love, and he is only loved from nature; if
   any one giveth to him it bringeth no reward, nor to him who taketh it,
   and the gift is lost for everlasting life, as no work of man is
   rewarding except only from grace. St. Augustine saith also, "Whoso
   giveth his gift, but not rightly, he sinneth." But you give not rightly
   if your gift be given where it is not needed; therefore Jesus also
   said, "Sell all and give to the poor." He doth not mean the rich.

8.

   The third selfhood that man must resign is fleshly lust. This is
   overcome by steady internal contemplation of the Passion of our Lord.
   If a man immerse himself in the Passion of our Lord, he is purified,
   and in this purity a light is kindled that burneth and killeth all
   luxury of the body. A spiritual divine rapture is begotten which
   surpasseth all bodily lust. Whoso wisheth to have this divine rapture,
   lei him lay his mouth at the wounds of our Lord and suck them in.
   Truly, if he always doeth this, he overfloweth with divine delight, so
   that he wondereth whence this great grace cometh. The wounds of our
   Lord are full of sweetness, and all men, if they knew it, would turn to
   the Passion of our Lord, and if a man did not this for the sake of God,
   he would do it on his own account, for all men desire comfort. But seek
   it where you list, nowhere shall you find it save in the Passion of our
   Lord. The men who do this have heaven here and there, on earth and
   above, and if God were not to give them heaven in any other way, He
   would have given them enough to reward them for all they have endured
   for God's sake.

9.

   Many a man saith, I have no grace. Nothing is to be accused for this
   save that thou dost not seek it rightly. If thou seekest it rightly in
   the Passion of our Lord, thou wouldst always find grace and all
   comfort. Even though it be bitter to thee at first and giveth no
   delight, this is a sign that thou art still burthened with bodily
   luxury, which must be rooted out by bitterness. If this bodily pleasure
   is punished it passeth away, and a spiritual, divine pleasure is born,
   so that thou hast never felt so great rapture. But if thou fliest the
   first bitterness, thou wilt never be emptied of luxury. Man can
   therefore gladly suffer a short bitterness in order to be free from
   that bitterness which lasteth for ever.

10.

   A man who earnestly considereth the Passion of our Lord, from him its
   fruit also will not be hid. For if he ascendeth the tree of the cross,
   the fruit thereof beckoneth him on, if he be willing to have it. All on
   the cross is full of fruit, and more than all tongues could in truth
   proclaim. Nay, angels' tongues could not describe the overflowing grace
   that is there hidden in the Passion of our Lord. Blessed are those who
   have found this treasure, but unhappy they to whom this treasure is
   hidden, and who do not turn to it that the treasure may be revealed to
   them. And it is the living fruit of living Paradise. Whoso eat of this
   fruit shall never die. Had Adam eaten the lawful fruit and not that
   which was forbidden, he would have remained deathless. The same thing
   cometh to pass with us. If we eat the fruit of the cross, which is
   permitted us, and leave that which is forbidden, that is, all natural
   lust, then we shall become deathless. But if we neglect the fruit of
   life and take the fruit of death, we become in truth mortal, and shall
   be driven out of Paradise. Now they who have tasted this fruit desire
   always to eat more and more, and they are always hungering after it,
   and are never satisfied so long as they live in time, and in order to
   satisfy this their hunger they run with great desire to the Sacrament,
   and their hunger is so great that God could not satisfy them with all
   that He hath created, but only with Himself. Nor can they ever be
   satisfied so long as they live in time, for they desire always more.

11.

   Priests should have care for such a hungry soul, and should give her
   God's Body, that she may not die of hunger. It is often said, He who
   suffereth a man to die of bodily hunger when he might well have helped
   the sufferer, would be guilty of the death of that man. Much more is a
   man guilty towards souls when he letteth them die of hunger. For just
   as the soul is much nobler than the body, so much more are you guilty
   if you allow the soul to suffer hunger. These men that thus hunger are
   often severely blamed, because they go often to receive the Body of our
   Lord, but in truth he who really saw their hunger would not blame them.
   The man who blameth them is not willing to see his own blindness, and
   his small degree of love. He doeth like a man who seeth another sitting
   on his own tree, from which hangeth a fulness of fruit, and who
   upbraideth him because he eateth his own fruit. For thus do also these
   divine men; they sit upon their own tree of the cross, which hath a
   fulness of the noblest fruit of the body of our Lord. For the Sacrament
   of the Body of our Lord is the fruit of the holy cross, and whoso would
   eat its fruit with profit must break it off from the cross by steadfast
   internal contemplation of the Passion of our Lord. And other men cannot
   endure, and they must needs judge it But their sins are guilty of this.
   But he who willeth to consider the Passion of our Lord in all
   earnestness, let him go joyfully to the Table of our Lord, for it is
   useful to him, and he will become rich in graces. Nay, if he could
   bring all men to it, they would all be saved and perfect. Thus man
   overcometh all bodily lusts in the Passion of our Lord, and not only
   bodily lusts, but all things that are not God. For there is nothing,
   however great it be, if it is brought into the Passion of our Lord it
   passeth away into nothingness. For it is a glowing fire in which all
   inequality vanisheth and is consumed. As Christ saith, "I am come to
   send fire upon earth." [95] Now the fire that our Lord sendeth, that is
   the heat of divine love, which He draweth from the wounds of His heart.
   And whosoever thirsteth let him hold his mouth to it, and he will take
   draughts such that he will never more thirst for temporal things.

12.

   This man doth not need much preaching, save to come here and stay here;
   for if he entereth thoroughly into the Passion of our Lord, he is so
   laid hold of that he can no more turn away from God. They who have come
   to this thank God greatly, for God hath chosen them from among men,
   like our Lord chose St. Peter, St. John, and St. James, and led them
   apart from the other disciples to a particular place, and revealed to
   them the secret of His Passion, and said, "My soul is troubled, even
   unto death." [96] And that was a sign that He loved them above the
   other disciples. And so also the men who busy themselves with the
   Passion of our Lord are loved by God above other men. For they hold
   their mouth to the source whence divine love always floweth without
   interruption, and they will overflow in such wise that they can no
   longer please themselves; they give up all outward and inward things in
   order that they may be able to give in return a corresponding love to
   God.

13.

   And these are the right lovers of God, who love God with their whole
   heart. And they who love God with their whole heart give up all bodily
   things for the sake of God; and the heart is bodily; thus, when they
   turn away their heart from all bodily things to God, this is called
   loving with the whole heart. They also love with their whole soul; that
   is, when they give up their life for the sake of God; for the soul
   giveth life to the body, and this same life they give entirely to God.
   They further love God with all their strength; that is, they ordain all
   their powers according to the highest discretion, and they direct all
   of them to one end, and with this effort they penetrate into God.
   Arrived here all the powers keep silence and rest; this also is the
   highest work that the powers can perform, when they are inactive and
   let God only work. They also love God with all their mind; that is,
   when their mind soareth above all created things, and penetrates into
   the uncreated good, which is God, and then loseth itself in the secret
   darkness of the unknown God. [97] Therein it loseth itself and
   escapeth, so that it can no more come out. As a likeness, let us take
   that of a man who casteth a stone into the sea, where no bottom can be
   found: as the stone must continually sink, but would reach no ground,
   and it could not be fetched out again, unless it were lying still
   somewhere, which, however, is not the case, as it has no soundings, so
   also it happeneth with the mind which hath cast itself into the
   unfathomable Godhead, he sinketh alway, but findeth no ground. No one
   can draw him out again, and he hath no final ground where he can stand
   and remain. He hath broken away from the created, therefore also no
   creature can reach him, and thus he hovereth everlastingly in God; he
   can no more come out of the Godhead than the stone by its own force can
   come up again to the surface. Sensuous men cannot understand this, and
   say, So long as a man liveth in time he can always fall. This is quite
   true; but the men we spoke of do not live in time, for their "dwelling
   is in heaven," [98] as St. Paul saith. Whosoever cometh to this
   dwelling must stay there. Take the following simile: If a man be bound
   by such strong bonds which he cannot rend, he could not, people will
   say, become free, and get loose unless he were helped. Thus is the mind
   bound by God; and if all creatures united their strength, they could
   not rend this bond. The mind hath become so powerless over itself that
   of itself it is not able to rend the bond.

14.

   To this it might be said, If this is so, the freedom of the will is
   taken away. I answer, the freedom of the will is not taken away but
   given to it, for then is the will quite free when it cannot bear
   anything save what God willeth. We say that a king is free who
   overcometh all his enemies and ruleth uncontrolled in his kingdom, and
   he is not called a free king who is conquered by his enemies and driven
   out of his kingdom. Thus also the will is a free king when it
   overcometh all its enemies and ruleth uncontrolled, that is, "in God,
   in whom he then can do all things," [99] as St. Paul saith. And thus
   man overcometh all things in the Passion of our Lord, in which of
   necessity all besides must pass away into nothingness.

15.

   When now man is thus prepared with all virtues and with a poor life,
   and with the Passion of our Lord, he cometh to the third degree of
   perfection, in which he heareth, in a silent, secret speaking, the
   everlasting Word which God the Father speaketh in the ground of souls;
   and this speaking driveth out all created images, so that a man
   discardeth his selfhood in all spiritual, natural pleasures, which
   consist in attractive created images and forms, and he will only hear
   His eternal Word, in which he will know and love God in the most
   perfect manner. Therefore Christ said, "Whoso loveth Me heareth My
   word," [100] that is, when God speaketh in him, and he suffereth it.
   And this is the highest work of man, that he suffereth God and
   hindereth Him not in His work.

16.

   It might be asked, What is God's working? There are two kinds of work
   in God--a working within and a working outwardly. [101] The working
   inward is God's being and nature; the outward working is the creature.
   And after the fashion that the creature hath flowed out of God, so also
   must it flow into Him again; and therefore God worketh in souls that He
   may bring them to the first origin from which they have flowed, for by
   their works they cannot go in again. It is therefore absolutely
   necessary that man should come to this, that he can receive the work of
   God, in order that by this working he may return to God. Therefore
   Christ said, "One thing is needful, without which no man can come to
   God."

17.

   Here some one might say, Since now man with his work cannot come to
   God, what use is there then in his working? To this I say, that man
   with his work much more hindereth than furthereth himself in coming to
   God. For all that man doeth of himself is defective, and with that he
   cannot come to God. For as the creature is faulty, it worketh faulty
   works; and therefore if man is to come to God, he must be empty of all
   work and let God work alone. Of this Christ spake, "What the Father
   doth not plant is cast out and perisheth." [102] Therefore it is quite
   the best thing for man that he should be empty of all work. For if he
   were empty of all work, he would be a mere instrument of God, so that
   God might work with him without all hindering. Now, all that God
   willeth to have from us is that we be inactive, and let Him be the
   working Master. If we were altogether inactive we should be perfect
   men. For all that is good is the work of God, and if God doth not work
   it, it is not good. Therefore said St. James, "The best and perfect
   gifts are from the Father of Lights." [103]

18.

   Now, it will be asked, How is a man to know if his work is of himself
   or from God? Shortly be it said: there are three supernatural divine
   virtues, Faith, Hope, and Love or Charity; whatever increaseth these
   virtues is from God, but what diminisheth them is a sign that it is the
   work of man; whoso observeth these things internally knoweth that it is
   so. For what man worketh of himself, he applieth to himself and to
   time, and thus doth not increase the supernatural virtue; but what God
   worketh, draweth a man away from himself to eternity, and this
   increaseth Faith, Hope, ami Charity.

19.

   What is the divine work? It is twofold, what God worketh in the soul,
   one the work of grace, the other essential and divine. By the work of
   grace man is prepared for the essential. God worketh through His grace
   in man, when He draweth him away from sin and leadeth him on to virtue;
   if man leaveth sin and exerciseth virtue, this is a grace of God; by
   grace God maketh man well-pleasing, it driveth him away from all
   defective things on to virtue, so that with it he obtaineth all
   virtues; thus man attaineth to a perfect life, in which he knoweth the
   holiest will of God, and liveth entirely after it. The second work that
   God worketh in the soul is essential; when man cometh to this, that he
   hath obtained all accidental virtue, and so now arriveth at the essence
   of virtue, then God worketh all virtue in him in an essential way,
   namely: the Heavenly Father begetteth His Son in the soul, and this
   birth raiseth the spirit above all created things into God. Now is the
   spirit without grace, for grace is a creature, but the spirit is raised
   above all creatures. Nevertheless grace leaveth not the man, but it
   directeth and ordereth the forces of man and cherisheth the divine
   birth in the essence of the soul. Now what God so worketh is an
   essential work, a work raised above all grace and reason, a work in the
   light of glory; [104] the spirit of man hath now passed over to the
   Godhead. Then the essence seeth essentially, and essence giveth essence
   and the spirit worketh all things with God in an essential manner; his
   work is the work of God, and God's work is his work. For when two are
   one they have also one working. This work the reason cannot grasp
   through imagery, therefore is it a work above human reason.

20.

   The reason recognises full well that this working is a work raised
   above all created things, the noblest work, whereby alone the spirit
   can be blessed and saved; it is always striving after this essential
   working, if possible to know and grasp it. But the reason will never
   seize hold on it in time, for if she would do so, this would give
   heaven, in time. And although she cannot comprehend it in time, she yet
   striveth continually after it, and standeth not still until death. By
   this act of hastening after the divine work, she empties herself of all
   created images, and with a supernatural light she presseth into the
   mystery of the hidden Godhead, and through this knowledge she can no
   longer know, and through this love she can no longer love, which means
   that she no longer knoweth after the fashion of a creature, but after a
   divine fashion, and that she loveth not with her own love, but
   according to the love of God, of which St. Paul spake when he said, "I
   live, yet not I, but Christ in me." [105] The spirit is dead to earth,
   and henceforth liveth only godly. Whosoever therefore despiseth the
   reason doeth great wrong to her. For all things desire life, and when
   the reason recognises that all temporal things are deathly, and that
   God alone is life, she must needs turn herself to God, for she
   naturally desireth life. And it is much more natural for the reason to
   turn to God than to creatures. For all creatures cannot fill her but
   God only, and therefore is it more natural that she should turn to Him
   who giveth to her rather than to that which taketh away from her.

21.

   The reason is not guilty of this, that man chooseth the earthy and
   leaveth God, for if reason were present this would not happen. For what
   the creature chooseth instead of God, is done by sensuality and not by
   the reason, and therefore David saith, "Ye shall not be as the horses
   and mules, which have no reason;" [106] and whoso chooseth the creature
   instead of God, is not a rational man, but is as an irrational beast.
   If yet the reason sticketh to created things, images and forms, this
   happeneth because she recognises the eternal God in created things, as
   St. Paul saith, "In the visible things are the invisible* seen." [107]
   What preventeth the reason to reach God through created things, is the
   pleasure attaching to created images, which they generated in her; this
   is natural pleasure, which blindeth her so that she cannot recognise
   the divine truth; and this must be avoided. It is fancied, however,
   that this joy is of grace, and therefore many men tarry in it. These
   people are also yclept natural, rational men, and yet they have not
   true reason. For the right reason seeketh God, and removes from
   creatures whether they be bodily or spiritual, and whoso cometh to this
   reason is a right, rational man, whose reason is shone through with
   divine light, in which you know the Godhead and forget the earthy. And
   whosoever giveth himself into this, hath a foretaste and a delight of
   everlasting life. This rapture driveth the reason away from all natural
   pleasure to God. And there she receiveth her rapture, as Christ saith,
   "Whosoever eateth me hungereth not any more" [108] after creaturely
   pleasures. And this must be thus understood, how the spirit in this
   state is raised above grace and above reason, and above all pleasure in
   God, and standeth thus in naked poverty of all created things, and hath
   vision only of the divine essence, which is raised above all grace, and
   above all reason, and knoweth nothing of itself, nor of created things,
   but only of God. And man obtaineth this perfection, if he followeth the
   teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ.

22.

   The other thing that driveth a man to a poor life, is the perfection of
   virtue. For virtue is never filled up in full measure, nor followed in
   the highest, except a man strip himself of the love of all temporal
   possession, till he exerciseth himself in all virtue, and lose the
   image of all virtue, and cometh to the faculty of no longer being able
   to work any virtue outwardly, but only essentially and not
   accidentally. For thus is virtue brought to the highest. This causeth,
   that all things are small to such a man, and virtue alone great; he
   turneth easily all things to virtue; he exerciseth himself in all
   virtues till he can do no more, and becometh so poor and despised that
   no one desireth any more a virtue from him. Thus without any guilt he
   is emptied of all outward virtue; and then without any hindering he can
   turn to God, which was not the case before.

23.

   So long as a man hath he must give, and when he hath nothing more he is
   free. Freedom is much nobler than giving was before, for he giveth no
   more in accident but in essence, and giveth no more one gift but all
   gifts, and giveth no more to one man but to all men. And his gift is
   like unto the gift of God, therefore also a teacher saith, "It is good
   when a man imparts his property and cometh to the help of his
   fellow-men; but it is far better to give all and to follow Christ in a
   poor life." And never will you have virtue in the most perfect degree
   save if you have given all things for the sake of virtue. I take the
   case of mercy. He who is entirely merciful keepeth nothing at all. And
   whoso keepeth something is not perfectly but only partially merciful,
   and in a fragmentary way. And whoso wisheth to be perfectly humble must
   exercise himself in all humble works that are required. Whoso doeth not
   this is not thoroughly humble. Thus let men take all virtues; whoso
   wisheth to have them in perfection must give himself up to them so long
   till he is poor of all creatures and possessions, so that no one asketh
   anything more of him. Therefore the perfection of virtue consisteth in
   poverty and in nothing else.

  In the second place, perfection of virture driveth a man to a poor life.

24.

   It might now be said, If a man is weak by nature, and keepeth the
   things that are required as necessary, if this doth not hinder him from
   the perfection of virtue? I say in answer, If the man is weak, so that
   he require this, and keepeth something that he needeth, this is not
   against virtue. For virtue hath a proper order, and if he gave away
   this necessity he would act against order, and that he cometh to his
   own help is as right as if he gave it to a poor man. But it would be
   much more perfect, if he were sound, that he should thus strip himself
   of all temporal things, so that he had nothing left when he became
   sick. Thus the perfection of virtue consisteth in resigning all things;
   therefore we should give up these gladly, in order to be able to
   possess all virtue.
     __________________________________________________________________

  In the third place, this ought to drive man to a poor life, that he may die to
  himself and to all creatures, and God alone may live in him.

25.

   The third cause why a man should give himself up to a poor life is in
   order that he die to himself and all creatures, and that God alone may
   live in him. Now such a poor life is living in death, and in this death
   is blessedness, as St. John saith, "Blessed are the dead who die in the
   Lord." [109] Therefore we should make ourselves poor, that we may
   fundamentally die, and in this dying be made alive again. Therefore
   Christ said, "Unless the grain of corn fall into the ground and die it
   cannot bring forth fruit. But if it die it bringeth forth much fruit."
   [110] So also is it in truth. Whoso wisheth to have all the fruit of
   life must suffer all manner of death. And no one can have all manner of
   death save a poor man. Therefore a teacher said, "Whoso liveth after
   the Gospel hath cross and martyrdom." Therefore no one can have the
   fruit of a right perfect life save a poor man, wherefore Christ said,
   "Whosoever cometh after Me, let him sell all that he hath and give to
   the poor, and follow after Me." This selling means the self-denial of
   man; the giving away is virtue, the following of Christ is
   fundamentally to die, so that dying completely to himself, God may live
   perfectly in him. Therefore is a poor life useful in order that we may
   alway die. And whoso doth not entirely die cannot either fully live.

26.

   I hear it said, How can this be, that a poor man entirely dieth, for he
   is still seen to live like other men, and he is even seen cheerful? To
   this I answer and say, that a Christianly poor man dieth alway; whether
   he eat or drink, or wake or sleep, all is a suffering to him. How this
   happens, that he liveth much as the common of men, this is merely an
   ordering of the outer man, according to which necessity he cannot
   attend much to God, and this is his dying. For according to the inner
   man he would wish always to busy himself with God and leave all other
   things. Moreover if he testifieth himself to be cheerful, this joy hath
   nothing common with time, nor with any creatures. For it springeth
   alone from God, and therefore is it without defects, and doth not
   oppose the dying of the creature. Now although a poor man would perhaps
   gladly help himself, so that he might not entirely die, God will not
   allow it. For his future must be his through dying, and what he hath he
   hath by dying. His death are also manifold and without number, for he
   dieth every moment. Thus must a poor man die. Blessed is the man who
   can die all manner of deaths; but this dying is of such a nature that
   no man can rightly understand it, and he is the most rational who
   understandeth this dying the best. For no one understandeth death save
   he to whom God hath revealed it.

27.

   But why must we always die if we would be blessed? There are two
   matters: One is, that our nature since Adam's fall is full of sinful
   propensity, and this propensity must be rooted out and die. And as this
   can never be absolutely rooted out we must continually die. It cometh
   to pass indeed that a man die according to his rational will, and that
   he willeth not otherwise than God willeth. As St. Paul saith, "You are
   dead in Christ, for your life is hidden in Christ." [111] But the
   sensuous will, with its sensuous inclination, can never die absolutely
   in time. Now the rational will must continually kill this sensuous
   will, so that sensuality be always under the direction of the higher
   powers, and these be directed to God. Whoso standeth thus standeth in
   the justice in which God created Adam, and whoso standeth in this
   justice he would stand without any sins, mortal or venial. And this can
   by no means happen unless God draweth man to it. Therefore a man cannot
   be absolutely without defects, and therefore must he continually die.
   Another reason why man must continually die is the perpetual onslaughts
   of the evil spirit and of the world striving to make us fall. For
   whatever the station of a man he is attacked in it. And no one in time
   is free from this. Then must we at all times fight against this, and
   die that we may overcome, for whoso overcometh and dieth shall be
   crowned, as St. Paul saith; [112] and the deaths are without number
   that we die in the combat, for the evil spirit circumvents us with
   manifold snares, and we must alway be on our guard to resist him. It
   often happeneth that an image is presented to man which he beleiveth to
   proceed from grace, though it is from the evil spirit, as St. Paul
   saith, "The evil spirit is clothed as an angel of light." [113] He
   presents this image to us in a pleasant light, and yet it is evil in
   itself. And those who have much to do with images and visions are often
   deceived in this way. For it is often from the evil spirit, and now in
   this time more than it ever was. For the truth is revealed and
   disclosed in the Holy Scriptures, and therefore it is not needful that
   the truth should be revealed to us in another way. And whoso taketh
   truth otherwise than out of the Gospel he is sick in faith, and not
   much is to be thought of his life, for our life is only from the
   Gospel, as Paul saith, "Our Lord hath begotten us again in His Gospel."
   [114] And whoso is begotten elsewhere than in the Gospel is not a
   legitimate child, but a bastard. Thus, therefore, the evil spirits have
   often presented man an image that appeareth good in order that he may
   take false, sham truth to be the real truth. To this we must die. The
   cause why God formerly revealed Himself in visions [115] was this, that
   the truth was hidden, and this was necessary. But it is not now
   necessary, and therefore it happeneth very seldom from God. Therefore
   we must always die to that which is unlike simple divine truth. For
   simple divine truth is a pure intuition of the soul into the being of
   God, and we must die to all that hindereth the spirit in this. And the
   holy Evangel leadeth us to this. And whoso is led into it otherwise
   than by the teaching of Jesus Christ he is a thief and a murderer, and
   is a follower of the Final or Antichrist. Therefore let him who doth
   not wish to be deceived hold to the teaching of Jesus Christ; then let
   others teach what they will, nothing can injure him.

28.

   A man is often judged as one standing on his own opinion, who would,
   however, gladly live after the teaching of Jesus. He should not mind
   this, for it is fair that he should be so judged. Whoso doth not live
   in the most, perfect manner after the teaching of our Lord standeth on
   Ids own selfhood. Let him take unto himself humility as much as he
   will, yet he is not humble, and his humility is more a holding fast to
   himself than a denial of himself, for true self-denial abideth only in
   the Gospel, and whoso doth not live in the most perfect manner
   according to it is never thoroughly humble, nor dieth entirely to
   himself. Therefore let every man look and see how much he liveth in the
   Gospel, for so much is he advanced in humility and dead to himself.

29.

   But what use doth it bring if a man alway dieth? It bringeth a fivefold
   use. First, man draweth nigh thereby to his first innocence. For he was
   created without all sins, but when he fell into these, he became
   overladen with all manner of sins. But these defects must be rooted out
   by dying; the more he dieth to these the more he draweth nigh to his
   first innocence, and if he cometh again into this nobility, he is
   without defects. If man had not fallen his nobility would have remained
   immortal, and he would have suffered no punishment They are best in
   this who have the most died to themselves, for in that death and denial
   of self a new delight springeth up, for the death that man suffereth
   thereby openeth up the hidden joy. Christ also said, "Take My yoke upon
   you--that is, My Passion--and ye will find rest unto your souls." [116]
   The second use is, that in each such dying a new life ariseth to man,
   and with this life every time a new love, so that man is overflooded
   with grace, and his reason is enlightened with divine light, his will
   is glowing with the fire of divine love; he groweth continually, so
   that he becometh rich in graces and his reason so clear that no false
   light can any more deceive him, and he can perfectly distinguish all
   truth, as far as it is necessary. He is quite inflamed with divine
   love, so that no one can any more separate him from God. In this state
   was St. Paul when he said, "Who can separate us from the love of God?"
   [117] He meant to say, No one. Whoso wisheth to be receptive of the
   gifts of God, let him always take heed to this, to be able to die; let
   him suffer all manner of deaths and to him will be all gifts, for
   through every dying he receiveth in return a special gift. They who
   thus die also become so rich that no one can compute their riches.
   Truly if we knew what use lies in dying, we should hasten to it as if
   all the highest worldly dignities were about to be given to us. But
   what is most useful to us we fly from the most, while we always seek
   what is most hurtful. It is said that those who are in heaven, before
   they would do without the smallest part of the reward they have
   obtained and which they have received through their suffering, would
   come down to earth again and suffer till the day of judgment. Thirdly,
   if a man is quite pure he is emptied of all defective accident, and
   receptive of God alone. God is present in all things; if you accomplish
   all things so, then God only remaineth to us; but this purity must be
   sought by dying, and if the soul is freed from everything else, she is
   in a condition to bring forth the Son of God within her. And as God the
   Father begetteth His Son in the Godhead, thus also the Son of God is
   born in a pure soul, and she is again born in God. Therefore Jesus
   said, "Except ye be born again, ye can in no wise enter into the
   kingdom of God." [118] The fourth use ariseth if God is born in the
   soul, [119] when God ravisheth the spirit from the soul and casteth her
   into the darkness of His Godhead, so that she becometh quite like unto
   God. She loseth the shape of what is created, and is formed into the
   formless image of the Son in the Godhead, so that the man becometh a
   son of grace, as he is a son of nature. Fifthly, if the soul be raised
   into God, it reigneth also with God; of which St. Paul saith, "If we
   die with Christ, so shall we also reign with Him." [120] Thus the
   spirit can do all things with God; he commandeth all with God, he
   ordereth and leadeth all with God; what God omits, he omitteth; what
   God doeth, he doeth with God; he worketh all things with God. This
   unspeakable perfection we obtain through dying.

30.

   Some one will ask, Can then no one die without external poverty? I give
   this answer, So long as a man hath temporal things, he often useth them
   without dying to his nature; but if he is poor in temporal things,
   outwardly as well as inwardly, all is turned into grace for him. What
   was natural to him before becometh now of grace, and he dieth alway;
   for whoso groweth alway in grace, he must always die to nature. As,
   however, all things do not become of grace to man, if he hath not yet
   freed himself from all things, and they are still natural, he doth not
   therefore continually die. Hence no one can entirely die save a pure
   and poor man. If a man hath what is his necessity, this doth not kill
   nature; but if he have want and must beg for much, this killeth nature
   and increaseth grace; he also who always suffereth want dieth
   continually. Poor men are so rich in grace, that they do not know it,
   for their dying is without number, therefore also the grace is
   incalculable that God secretly imparteth to them. It often cometh to
   pass that a man believeth that he is abandoned by God and all
   creatures, and hath no grace. But want and self-denial entirely kill
   nature, and he is filled with unspeakable grace; for as is the dying so
   is the grace, and blessed are they who have chosen God in a dying life,
   for their riches are excessive great in graces. If poverty were useful
   to no other end than that man should continually die, and thereby
   receive innumerable graces, it ought to be chosen if only on that
   account. Whoever doth not love it showeth that he hath no divine love.
   For if he had divine love, he would then also love the image of our
   Lord Jesus Christ; His image was poverty and suffering. Whoso doth not
   love poverty doth not love God also. Thereby should a man know if he
   belongeth to heaven or to hell from his love for the poor or the rich,
   and whether he preferreth to be with the poor rather than the rich.
   Whoever occupies himself much with rich folk doth not show that he is a
   purely poor man; for like loveth its like; whom he is closest to he
   loveth, cleaveth to him, and goeth about with him.

31.

   The fourth ground that should prompt man to a poor life is the
   perfection of a contemplative life. So long as a man is chained to
   temporal things, he must have an active life, for he hath much to work.
   As long as the affair lasteth he must work, but whoso would free
   himself from it before he hath completed all outer works, he would have
   an imperfect self-denial, and fail very much. For it is laziness to be
   against God and the truth by such a neglect of virtue. A teacher saith
   on this point, "He raiseth his hands in vain to God who doth not offer
   them to the poor if he could." Neither true freedom nor contemplation
   take place in the possession of temporal things, for just as much as a
   man hath in temporal things, to that same measure he lacketh in
   everlasting things. For temporal and eternal are opposed to one
   another. Whoever hath the one must leave the other. A contemplative
   life is raised above all that is temporal, and only an enjoyment of
   eternal things; whoever therefore wisheth to lead such a life must
   needs leave all that is temporal. Thus if a man hath turned himself
   only to God, the best part, He then alone is his object. He entereth
   into God and withdraweth from all creatures, so that no one can speak
   either evil or good of him, as he is entirely hid in God. These men are
   the friends of God. Verily, no man can hide himself in God, except he
   who is quite free from creatures, for whoso still cleaveth to the
   created is also known to it; but if you are free from the creature
   outwardly and inwardly, then God only knoweth us, and the creature
   forgetteth us. When these men of contemplation sink themselves in God
   and hide in Him, they are strangers to all the created, they see God
   without any hindering. But others cannot do this who still cleave to
   earthly things, for they would be too often impeded in it. Therefore a
   perfectly contemplative life is a purely poor life, emptied of all that
   is temporal.

32.

   People often conceive, too, that if a man lead a contemplative life and
   seeth God without a veil, yet saw that his neighbour suffereth want, he
   should give up his contemplation and come to his help. They who still
   have temporal possessions must do this, for it they do it not their
   contemplation availeth not indeed, they commit sin; but they who are
   free from all temporal things, and therefore have nothing with which to
   help their fellowman, are also set free from this external work. This
   freedom is much nobler than the occupation with creatures; Christ also
   praised the inactivity of Mary, for our Lord only goeth about with such
   persons. This going about is nothing else than the dwelling of the
   lover with the beloved. But God cannot dwell anywhere, save in a soul
   that is free from the earthly. They who possess such freedom walk with
   God, and God with them. Solomon also saith, in the Book of Love (the
   Canticles), "He kissed me with the kiss of His mouth." [121] The soul
   is kissed by God when she is raised above all earthly things, and only
   beholdeth the countenance of God; then God inclineth His countenance
   and kisseth her, and His kissing is nothing else than a union of love
   with love. One beholdeth the other, and neither can do anything without
   the other; they are quite united by love, of which bond of love St.
   Bernard saith, "How sweet is this bond of love; it maketh the poor
   rich, but the rich who hath it not is poor."

  In the fourth place, the perfection of a contemplative life should impel a man
  to a poor life.

33.

   Here it might be asked, If it be possible that rich people be united by
   this bond of divine love, and if they could be partakers of a
   contemplative life? I answer, So long as man cleaves to creatures and
   to time, he hath not divine love, for the tie of divine love breaketh
   every tie with creatures, and whoso is still bound by these creaturely
   ties showeth that he is not yet enveloped with the divine tie, as St.
   Austin saith, "If the heart is seized hold of by divine love, in that
   case the vanity of creatures finds no place in it." Further, genuine
   love is a foil owing of the beloved; what he ordereth and counselleth,
   true love cloeth it all, it omitteth nothing, but it accomplisheth all.
   But the rich do not follow the counsel of our Lord, therefore also they
   have not the right love. They may indeed show works of love, but these
   do not spring up from the ground of divine love; for if they did spring
   from it they could easily work one and all works of love, as St. Austin
   saith, "To the God-loving man nothing is too difficult, for he can do
   all in Him who strengtheneth him,." But as they are not capable of all
   works of love, they have not the divine love. Divine love is such a
   source that whoso holdeth his mouth to this source overfloweth with
   love, must avoid all creatures, and cleave to God only. St. Austin
   saith, "To a soul that loveth God all creatures are too narrow, so that
   they can no longer tarry in any of them." Yea, it is the nature of
   divine love to give up creatures and cleave to God. St. Paul [122]
   wished to prove that he loved God when he said, "Behold, Lord, we have
   left all things and followed after Thee." [123] Otherwise he could not
   testify his love. This also must, we have if we wish to love God,
   namely, we must give up the earthly and cleave to God. Whoso leaveth
   the earthly the most, he loveth God the most. Whoso doeth it not at
   all, he cannot say that he loveth God. All can testify this who love
   God, if they are thoroughly inflamed by the fire of divine love, so
   that this faith destroyeth all that is not God.

34.

   Some say that you can retain temporal things if a man doth not let his
   selfhood (his ego) cleave to them, and cleaveth to the will of God and
   not his own will. This is a statement in which there is not much truth.
   Whoso loveth the will of God right well, he loveth it not according to
   his own head but according to the teaching of Jesus Christ, who
   certainly knew the will best. If we therefore wish to fulfil the will
   of God we must follow the teaching of Jesus. But His teaching was to
   leave all and follow Him; whoever doeth not this hath not struck root
   in the ground of divine love, as Christ saith, "Whoso loveth Me, he
   keepeth the words which I have taught him." [124] A true lover
   accomplisheth the counsel of his beloved rather than his commandment;
   the indifferent lover halteth at the commandment, but suffereth the
   counsel to go over him.

35.

   Some may say indeed, If our Lord Himself were on earth He would not
   require a man to leave all externally. I say, Ii He were on earth He
   would say the same thing that He spake to His disciples, and no one
   would be excepted. He said, "If thou wouldst be perfect, sell all and
   follow Me." No one is excluded or excepted from this commandment, and
   he who doeth it not must not lay claim to any perfection. Divine love
   is a force which raiseth a man above all things to the highest degree
   of perfection, and who standeth on this highest degree he hath the true
   love. But no one can arrive at this if he have not passed through the
   lowest degrees. The very lowest degree of divine love is to despise all
   temporal things, the second to despise himself, the third to deny and
   give up all, whether bodily or spiritual, which disturbs union between
   God and man. Thus only doth man arrive at right perfection. Whoever
   hath not climbed the first degree can arrive at none of the others.

36.

   What work of love then do rich people exercise if they [have] not
   divine love? This love is of two kinds, natural, which hath no reward,
   or the love of grace, which indeed hath a reward, but is not perfect,
   as it can increase and decrease; on the other hand, perfect love always
   groweth and never falleth off. But only they who are emptied of all
   earthly possess this love; temporal things are changeable, whoever
   cleaveth to them is also changeable with them in this changeableness,
   therefore it is no perfection, therefore also they can have no perfect
   love. If they have not this they also cannot live a contemplative life,
   for a perfect love is only begotten in a pure contemplation of the
   Divine Being; whatever fails a man in this contemplation he lacketh
   also in true love, for it hath nowhere else its origin than in the
   Father or the Son. If the eye of the reason is pure, and directed away
   from all that is not God, then it can perfectly contemplate the Divine
   Being; but if this eye is impure, troubled through temporal things, it
   cannot contemplate it, for "the light is unbearable to a sick eye," as
   St. Augustine saith. [125] Whoso is overburdened with temporal things
   can lead no contemplative life, for his eye is impure and sick. But
   whoso wisheth to arrive at the life in which lieth the best must strip
   himself of all external possession and lead a purely poor life; thus he
   attaineth to the highest degree of perfection. Whoso withdraweth
   himself from a poor life also neglects the God-contemplating life, for
   contemplation and poverty stand on the same degree. Among all things
   there are only two, God and the creature; he who is poor in creatures
   is rich in God, but these riches are the immediate contemplation of
   God; our whole blessedness lieth in this, that we know and love God
   immediately.

37.

   If now a man ought to give up all things to arrive at a contemplative
   life, what use doth it then bring? An unspeakable use, as St. Paul
   saith, "I have seen such things as it is not lawful to speak of." [126]
   Among others, I will mention eight kinds of uses. First, you do all
   works without much labour; labour only occasioneth an overlading with
   earthly things; whoso is free from them is also emancipated from
   trouble. As now a truly contemplative man is freed from all that is
   earthly, he is also emancipated from this labour. Secondly, what other
   men work accidentally these men work in essential divine truth; in this
   he worketh all works. But they who are burdened with the creature work
   in natural accidents. Thirdly, what others work partially a thoroughly
   internal man worketh entirely. He accomplished all works in one and one
   work in all, because he is united with God; thus he hath one working
   with Him, and as God accomplisheth all in one work and one work in all
   so doeth likewise such a man. All good works are proper to him as if he
   himself had worked them, for Christ saith, "All that I have received
   from My Father I have given unto you." [127] But His receiving and His
   giving are all equally good. Fourthly, what other men first get from an
   active life these have already a foretaste of in time; but as their
   spirit is raised above time and all earthly things the delight and
   rapture of things eternal is manifested to it; this spreads so in the
   spirit that it passeth over to the body, and thus it hath a foretaste
   of everlasting life, as Christ saith, "From your body will flow living
   water, flowing into everlasting life." Fifthly, whoever attaineth to a
   true contemplative life, him God draweth to Himself, revealing unto him
   His divine being; He confirmeth him so that he shall no more fall off
   from Him. If Lucifer had been thus drawn into his being, so that he had
   rightly known God, he would not have fallen, for the being of God is so
   rapturous that whoever knoweth it rightly in the light of glory would
   not possibly be able to turn away from God. But God also giveth it only
   to him who will dwell eternally with Him. Whoso falleth into sins hath
   never known God in His light, therefore also Jesus said to St. John, "I
   will that he remain so," [128] and to Mary Magdalene, "She hath chosen
   the better part, which shall never be taken from her." [129] To whom
   the best part is given it remaineth eternally, for it is no accidental
   but an essential gift that abideth alway with man. Sixthly, it bringeth
   to man an everlasting entrance into divine truth and an essential
   increase in divine love, for the being of God is unfathomable, and no
   creature can fathom it. Whoso hath been drawn into it sinketh
   eternally, and can come to no ground or soundings; the spirit hovereth
   in God as the fish in the sea and the bird in the air. Seventhly, new
   wonders, rapture, delight, and new truth are continually discovered to
   man, for God alone satisfieth the spirit. The more he contemplates Him
   the more he longeth for Him, and the more he beholdeth God with the eye
   of his reason the purer he becometh, and the more clearly doth he know
   God. Eighthly, if the spirit is raised above all things in essential
   truth all inequality escapeth from it; it is placed in an equality, and
   in this it entereth into God, so that it knoweth nothing more than God,
   and is embraced by God; the spirit loseth its name, so that it is
   called rather God than spirit; not that it is God, but only divine,
   therefore is it more called God than spirit. David also said, "I have
   said, ye are gods and sons of the Highest." [130] Gods, he saith, not
   God, by which he proverb, that we are not God by nature, but divine
   through grace. Through His speaking we are sons of the Most High, for
   as the Father looketh to His nature so He begetteth the Son by nature.
   Thus is it also where God speaketh His word in the soul, for thus He
   begetteth His Son through grace, and thus we are gods and sons of God,
   and whoso prepareth himself for this birth, which God the Father
   begetteth in the soul, he is mostly God's son through grace.

38.

   If poverty of spirit is a preparation for a contemplative life, it
   might be asked, if all men have such a life, who give themselves up to
   poverty? Certainly he who hath perfectly seized true poverty is a true,
   internal, and contemplative man. Yea, poverty is nothing else than a
   lack of all that is not God; if we are freed from this and all means of
   that sort are lacking, then are you in the presence of God; and in this
   presence man contemplateth Him. God is present in all things; if that
   external deception, sensuality, be removed, God only is found; and
   therefore poverty and contemplation stand on one point. But not all
   those who adopt a poor life are poor men and hence they are not
   contemplative men, as Christ saith, "Not every one who saith, Lord,
   Lord, cometh into the kingdom of heaven, but he who doeth the will of
   My Father who is in heaven." [131] So also is it with each man: not
   every one who saith, I am a poor man, or who seemeth a poor man, is a
   poor man, but he who doeth the work of a poor man, he is a poor man,
   and is also a contemplative man.

39.

   It might now be said, Poverty and contemplation have no works, for they
   subsist both in emptiness of all works in a pure suffering of God's
   influence. I answer, That is true. But in the beginning and progress of
   a poor and contemplative life, you must have works, which prepare man
   and set him free, so that he can comprehend true poverty. And whoso
   embraceth the right work also cometh to a poor life. But whoso taketh
   the wrong work, which happeneth often, never cometh to true poverty nor
   to a contemplative life. A simile: If a man on a journey, wishing to
   reach his goal, taketh the wrong way, he goeth astray and cometh not
   where he listeth; so is it here. Many believe that they have a truly
   poor life, but they take the wrong road, and thereby they go astray so
   that they never come to the right goal of a poor, contemplative life,
   in which man attaineth to the highest degree of perfection.

40.

   Which now are the right roads, wilt thou ask, to a poor life? In the
   first place, there are four of them.

  Four ways lead a man to a poor, perfect, contemplative life, seeing God
  inwardly. The first way is, that a man have a perfect will to give up all,
  that is against God, that is not a matter of God and that is not solely God,
  and thereby you obtain all virture.

41.

   The first way is this, that a man have a perfect will to give up all
   that is against God, also all of which God is not the cause and that is
   not God Himself. In the first path you leave all sins; in the second
   you leave the cause of sin, such as temporal property, wives, and so
   on. The third removeth all that entereth as a disturbing influence
   between God and man, such as spiritual images and forms, through which
   you can no longer find God. Man must conquer all virtue with a perfect
   will, must exercise himself willingly in all virtues that appertain to
   him, till he reacheth the summit of all virtues, so that none escape
   him till he hath attained all. Whoso omitteth one, strayeth away from
   the road of a poor and contemplative life. Poverty consisteth in a
   freedom from all burdens and a possession of every virtue; and the
   contemplative life is a life perfected in working. To whom virtue is
   lacking, lacketh also poverty; to whom a working life lacketh, lacketh
   also a contemplative life. For only when a man hath come to the highest
   point of a working life, doth a contemplative life begin, and no one
   contemplates the divine clarity, save he who hath seized hold on virtue
   with all his powers, in order that this force may lift him out of
   himself, out of all darkness of created things, into the divine
   clarity, in which clarity he will behold the purity of the Divine
   Being. Now he who lacketh this force must tarry down here below. For
   nothing can work beyond its force. And as man is sick by nature,
   therefore he cannot of himself raise himself above himself, but this
   must take place through a divine force of grace, and the force
   springeth out of virtue, and it is easy for him, who hath all virtue,
   to enter into himself and make room for God to work inwardly in him,
   and this working is full of delight. But it is difficult for him who
   hath not all virtue to enter into himself and make room for God to work
   in him, and this is because he is not receptive of the work, and he is
   still lacking in the force of grace, which springeth out of perfect
   virtue. Hence they scarcely detect that it is time for their meal,
   before they turn themselves to outward things in which they take more
   pleasure, rather than go into themselves. But to a man who is perfect
   in virtue, his meal seemeth ever too long, he would always wish to do
   without eating, that he might alway attend to his heart, and this would
   be more delightful to him than all eating and drinking and all external
   joy. For his delight is entirely from within, and not from without. And
   this is the case when he is dead to himself and God alone liveth in
   him. For where God is, there is joy and rapture without any distress.
   And people often fancy that a good man hath much woe, hut know not that
   it is so well with him. For every virtue and good work bringeth him a
   special delight. And he who hath the most virtue, hath also most joy. I
   shall perhaps be asked what the Lord meant when He said, "Blessed are
   they that weep and mourn, for they shall be comforted." Here notice,
   that the joy of good people doth not issue from creatures, but from
   God. And thus as they have always a divine joy, in that proportion is
   the delight of creatures bitter to them, and our Lord meaneth that
   happy are they to whom all creatures are bitter and God alone
   delightful, of which St. Bernard said, "If you taste the divine spirit,
   all bodily things become bitter to you," [132] and whoso goeth forth on
   the road of virtue, he cometh certainly to the goal of a perfectly
   contemplative life. For every virtue pusheth him forward, and helpeth
   him to it, as of himself he cannot get there. And when he cometh to
   this, that he obtaineth all virtue, he is led forward with power to the
   highest step of perfection.

42.

   The second road to true poverty, in which a man seeth the wonderful
   riches of God, is this, that he walk in the footsteps of Jesus Christ,
   and follow Him in every possible manner. Thereby we receive all the
   divine light and all the light of grace, which lead man on the right
   road to a perfect contemplative life, as Christ Himself saith, "Whoso
   wisheth to come to the Father must enter through Me," [133] that is,
   through His humanity, into the Godhead. This cometh to pass in two
   ways.

  The other way which leadeth a man into a poor, perfect, contemplative life,
  is, that man steppeth in the footsteps of our Lord Jesus Christ and followeth
  him.

43.

   First, that a man should clothe himself with the external image of our
   Lord. And in this man is guarded against all sins. For His image and
   pattern was a bringing again of man in all the ways from which he had
   fallen and might fall. For our Lord did not take on Himself sin, but
   all that rooteth out and atoneth for sin, and this was by sufferings
   and contradictions, through which He hath brought us back to an
   innocent life, and this doth not help us except we lay the same garment
   on ourselves, that is, except we leave all sins, and give ourselves up
   continually to the sufferings of our Lord. And thus we are brought back
   to an innocent life, but if our Lord had suffered much and I were not
   willing to suffer, this could not help us much. But that I suffer
   through Him, even as He hath suffered through me, in this case His
   suffering maketh my suffering fruitful, and bringeth me everlasting
   life, and for this reason Christ spake unto His disciples, "If they
   drink My cup they will come to life everlasting." [134] And thus the
   suffering of our Lord bringeth us thither, where we cannot bring
   ourselves of ourselves, and this is the case since all in us is
   inclined to fall. But if it is to be raised, this must come to pass
   after the image of our Lord, and whoso turneth away from this image, he
   casteth himself down. For no one can stand by his own strength, but
   from the power that issueth from the works of our Lord; and whoso
   wisheth to have the force must seek it in the likeness of the image and
   of the works of our Lord. St. Peter spake of this, "Christ hath
   suffered through us and left us an ensample, that we follow His
   footsteps." And whoso therefore likeneth himself to the image and to
   the work of our Lord, in him grow up the fruits of His works, and free
   him from all unlikeness, and bring in him a purely poor life, in which
   he knoweth God. And thus is Christ known by the fruitfulness of His
   works--that is, that the fruit which liveth in the works of our Lord
   spring up in him, and show him that Christ is God and man. Paul
   speaketh of this, "I know Christ and Him crucified." [135] That meant
   that he knew the fruit of the cross in himself, and to him from whom
   the fruit of the cross and the works of our Lord are hid, Christ is
   unknown. For every tree is known by its fruit; thus also Christ is
   known by the fruit of His works, when a man likens himself in his works
   to our Lord; and Christ cannot be known otherwise. And these are the
   right Christ men who believe perfectly in Christ, for no one can
   separate them from Christ, for the fountain of all graces hath
   overflowed in them, so that they can flow nowhere save into Christ When
   it is said that man cometh to the knowledge of the faith, this is
   nothing else than that the fruit of the faith springeth up in us
   through grace, and revealeth to us and giveth us to know in a clear
   manner that Christ is both God and man. Of this St. Paul spake, saying,
   "I know Christ only." This was because Christ revealed Himself to him
   in the fruitfulness of his works, and killed all besides that was not
   Christ, and therefore Christ alone remained known to him. Now we obtain
   a knowledge of Christ by following the image and the works of Christ.
   For in the degree to which you follow Christ are you like unto Him, and
   to the extent you are like Him you know Him. For everything is known by
   its like, and he who is likest God knoweth also God mostly. Now God is
   a pure Being, and such must the man be who is to know God, pure and
   stripped of all besides. And the purity and nakedness issue from the
   image of our Lord. Therefore he who likeneth himself most to the image
   of our Lord is the purest, and knoweth God the best. Thus, then, man is
   prepared in the image of our Lord for a poor life, in which he seeth
   God in all clarity.

44.

   The other way by which a man should enter through the humanity of
   Christ into His Godhead is when he hath clothed his outer man with the
   garment of Christ, so also that he now formeth his inner man with a
   continual contemplation of the works and of the Passion of Christ. And
   by external exercising in the image of Christ, and by internal
   consideration of the Passion of Christ, man is inflamed with the fire
   of love, and all unlikeness to the truth is quickly consumed in him,
   and then the truth is presented naked to him and he beholdeth it in its
   pure nakedness. For all that is in man has gone astray through Adam's
   fall; the senses are gone astray, the powers of the soul are gone
   astray, and none of them is obedient to another; and if that is to be
   set right again, so that one may be obedient to another, as they were
   when Adam stood in his first innocence, all this must come to pass in
   Christ. For just as Adam was a cause of falling and death, Christ is
   also the cause of resurrection and life; as Paul saith, "As in Adam all
   die, so in Christ are all things made alive." [136] And whatever is in
   man must be purified; and this must take place through Christ; and each
   one must do what he can, and must turn himself to make himself capable
   of receiving.

45.

   If the senses of man are to be purified, they must be ordered according
   to the external man of Christ, and must be formed and directed after
   Him, and thus they will be purified and ordered in the internal man.
   But without the image of Christ the senses never die to sensuality, so
   that the internal man may remain unhindered by them; ii this is to be,
   so that the man may be called a man free from sensuality, this must
   take place in the image of Christ; the more he turneth his senses and
   formeth them after that image, the more they die within him. In this
   way also the outward senses are brought to Christ, so that they are
   restored to the condition of the primitive order.

46.

   And just as the outer senses are purified and ordered, in their first
   nobility, in the image of Christ, so also must the internal powers of
   the soul be purified and ordered by an internal consideration of the
   works and of the Passion of Christ. And whoso neglecteth this will
   never be properly ordered in the internal man, and abideth in the
   disorder following the fall of Adam, nor will his reason be ever
   enlightened with divine light For Christ is the true Light which
   enlighteneth all the powers of the soul; as He Himself saith, "I am the
   Light of the world." [137] And therefore whoso wisheth to have the
   light of truth must have his reason in Christ; and whoso is enlightened
   elsewhere save in the Passion of Christ, has more a false than a true
   light. Of this Christ spake: "Beware of false prophets, who show
   themselves good, but inwardly are ravening wolves." [138] The false
   prophets are the lights that are not begotten from Christ, and from His
   teaching, and from His works, and from His Passion; they appear very
   good, and yet are inwardly and secretly bad; therefore we should guard
   against them, and should turn to the true Light, which is Christ. And
   let no man be directed by any light save it be somewhat like to Christ,
   and those who wish to come on the right road of an undeceived life,
   turn their reason from all things to the works and the Passion of Jesus
   Christ, and plunge themselves in it; then they are born again, as a
   newly-born child desireth milk to drink, and the eye of the reason is
   anointed with the oil of divine grace, in which, pure and clean, it
   will know the naked truth, and no more false light can deceive it. But
   a reason immersed anywhere save in the Passion of Christ is not
   anointed with the salve of divine graces. Hence it remaineth dark, so
   that it cannot see the divine truth; and from this cause many are
   deceived by manifold false lights, taking falsehood to be truth, and
   truth to be falsehood; and this is because all men err and are blind of
   themselves; therefore if they are to see, they must leave the darkness
   and turn to the Light, which is Christ; then the eye of their reason
   will be enlightened to know divine truth. For the reason of man is by
   nature dark, and like unto the night; and when the sun setteth in it it
   is night, and when it riseth it is day. So also is it with the reason;
   when the Divine Sun riseth in it it is clear as day, but when the Sun
   is withdrawn it becometh dark. Now, the light is withdrawn from it when
   it turneth to creatures and leaveth Christ. It is correctly said that
   the heathen attained to great natural light; but I say all their light
   was night compared to day, when contrasted with the light which the
   true Christian obtaineth who turneth his reason to Christ. In him dieth
   all unlikeness or inequality of light; he is all light; with the
   heathen, however, all inequality was not extinguished, therefore also
   they had not true pure light. Thus are still all men who have been
   indeed taught by nature, but not born from the Passion of Christ; they
   are blind compared with those enlightened by the Passion of Christ, and
   the distinctions which these last understand they derive from the works
   of Christ. Natural men, it is true, tell correctly the truth from
   images and forms, which they draw from their reason; but divine men who
   are united with Christ and His Passion keep the truth in silence, for
   what they hold to be true is raised above all images and forms, in a
   pure feeling of the divine good, of which no one can speak. Therefore
   are they silent, and they are held to be devoid of reason; thus is it
   also right, for they do not give to be understood what they know, and
   cannot at all express it with words. If they were to say what they see
   internally, they would be obliged rather to lie than to speak the
   truth; therefore they keep silent in order not to speak falsehoods. St.
   Dionysius saith, "All that you can speak of God is rather untrue than
   true, for God is unspeakable; and what you say of God is therefore
   always something else." [139] So is it also with the reason which is
   purified by the Passion of Christ and enlightened by the divine light.
   All that they can say of the divine is always something else. Yea, St.
   Paul saith, "It is not lawful to speak of it." Such men also are only
   known by their silence; many a man showeth by his babble that he is
   nothing, but the others show by their silence what they are. Whoso
   talketh much showeth that the simple divine good hath never been found
   perfectly in him. But whoso hath this is disgusted with external words,
   save when it is needful for his fellowmen, and to this he must consent.
   Without it is necessary, he speaketh not; he is familiar with no one,
   but he hath an everlasting contemplation of the good that he hath found
   in himself; he findeth no rest in other things, but it driveth him
   always to this good. He is accused of having no charity, but this
   happeneth because he hath occupied himself only with the single divine
   goodness, which makes all that is manifold give him disgust. He would
   alway be gladly alone, and that no one may hinder him he must omit many
   works of charity. But what faileth him in external works of charity, he
   worketh immediately in God; and such a work is a thousand times more
   noble than any accidental work of charity, for it is an essential work,
   while the other is accidental, and therefore not noble. Whoso worketh
   all works in immediate love, is right rich in good works, for he
   worketh all works in one; all are essential to him, and also bring an
   essential reward. But these men are alway blamed; people say that they
   are inactive, and will not perform any good work; they are accused of
   transgressing the commandments of Holy Church; but if they are free
   from everything external, they keep all commandments of Holy Church in
   God. But external men cannot understand or test this, and thus blame
   the others at all times. It must needs be so, for they are blind; but
   yet it is a folly for a blind man to wish to lead one who seeth. Such
   men need no leader, for they have the right lead, and they cannot give
   themselves up to another; they have the true light, which issueth from
   the Passion of Christ, which suffereth them not to fall into any false
   light; for the Passion of our Lord destroyeth all falsity in the reason
   and enlighteneth it with all truth. Thus doth the reason attain unto
   its first nobility through the contemplation of the work and of the
   Passion of Christ.

47.

   The will of man is also perfected in Christ, in His works and in His
   Passion. Without Christ all men go astray; with a blind will they
   incline to a sham good, and give no heed to the true good. This is also
   meet and proper, for all temporal things are in themselves blind, and
   all are blinded by them who choose them, and thus overlook the true
   good, which is hidden in the Passion of our Lord. If, however, man
   turneth with his will to Christ and His Passion, then Christ cometh to
   meet him with all true good things, and endoweth him richly with
   delightful gifts, which surpass all the gifts of creatures. If the will
   embraceth these it leaveth all that is earthly and its gifts and
   cleaveth to Christ, to receive only from Him. Christ also said, "The
   kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in a field; if man
   findeth the treasure he hideth it, and from joy he runneth away,
   selleth all that he hath and buyeth the field, and also the treasure in
   the field." [140] That is the most holy fruit of the Passion of our
   Lord. If man turneth with his whole will to it and seeketh there he
   findeth an unspeakable treasure, for special gifts issue from every
   wound, and these currents of grace are (according to Bonaventura) six
   thousand six hundred and sixty-six, which flow continually in the
   richest measure. If a man cometh to this field where these living
   fountains spring up he openeth his mouth and drinketh, overdrinks
   himself, and is intoxicated, and overflows with rapture; from
   overwhelming joy he can no longer hold himself, runneth away and
   selleth what he hath, namely, all that is not God; he leaveth all and
   buyeth the field wherein the fountains of this grace spring forth. He
   seeketh continually more and more for these original springs till he
   cometh to his first original source, which is in the heart of God. Here
   he drinketh the hidden wisdom of God, which no one knoweth save he who
   hath received it. This divine fatherly wisdom and goodness alway
   floweth through the Passion of our Lord into panting, thirsting hearts,
   which are burnt through by the divine fire of love. For this fire
   burneth through and inflameth them, so that they too excessively
   thirst, and in this thirst they hurry with burning desire to the
   fountain and to the wounds of our Lord, from which all graces flow; to
   these they hold their mouth with longing and drink. Oh, the lovely
   drink that they here drink! The giver is precious, also the drink, for
   giver and drink are one! He it is who giveth, and He too is what He
   giveth. Oh, if all men knew what a treasure lieth hid in the field!
   every one would dig and seek it; they would find so much that they
   would desire nothing more in time, for the field is full of riches.

48.

   That we are poor in graces is a sign that we have not yet come properly
   to this field, for whoever cometh to it properly and diggeth would not
   go away empty. Oh, how foolish is many a man that he doth not seek this
   incalculable treasure! If he can find a penny he seeketh for it, and
   here he leaveth the riches untouched, and remaineth a poor vile
   creature, who can never be saved, for all our blessedness and salvation
   are contained in Christ and His Passion. For whoso seeketh his
   salvation outside the Passion of Christ loseth much more than he
   seeketh. The wounds of our Lord are alone the fountains from which all
   salvation floweth; whosoever seeketh salvation let him seek it in the
   Passion of our Lord; there he findeth it surely, and nowhere else. I
   can find nothing better for man than that he turn earnestly to the
   Passion of our Lord and consider it; what is there counselled him he
   should do, for thus he obtaineth most surely an entrance into God.
   Whoever knoweth what noble fruit groweth on the field of the Passion of
   Christ would work on it day and night and never go away from it; he
   would fence it round, build himself a tower upon it, and dwell there,
   and set up a winepress. The fence would be his senses, which he would
   guard against all luxury and turn to the Passion of Christ; the tower
   would be his spirit, raised above all created things, where he would
   dwell in the uncreated Godhead; the wine-press would be his heart,
   where the sweet new wine would always flow for him, so that he would be
   quite intoxicated with it. On the field of the Passion of Christ grow
   wine and corn, in order to have meat and drink at the same time. They
   who come to this field and eat and drink here are full of divine
   graces. The prophet saith: "Eat the grist and drink the new wine, and
   be ye drunken, ye most beloved." [141] Oh, what a noble meat they eat,
   and what a good wine they drink! It is a wonder that they are not
   surfeited with the delight and overflow with the sweetness of the noble
   wine. Neither hail nor frost can injure this fruit and wine, though
   they grow winter and summer; you can always reap and gather, it is
   always harvest and vintage. Whoever wisheth to be rich thereby let him
   build a great barn and a roomy cellar and store them well. The more
   they can hold, the larger supply is there of fruit and wine.

49.

   If the desires of all men were directed to this, to gather this fruit
   and wine, how many rich persons there would then be on earth. If man's
   will seizeth hold on these riches it sinketh itself therein, eateth and
   drinketh, and enjoyeth its ease, seeking nothing more among creatures
   but all in God. But God endoweth him richly with all gifts. With these
   gifts He forceth the will and maketh it subject to Him. He maketh man
   free, so that he is freed from all adherence to creatures, and only
   cleaveth to God alone. Thus is inflamed in him the fire of the love of
   God, and it maketh him lovely, so that he entirely floweth away in
   love--a love that is by nature in God, but by grace in him. He arriveth
   then at the state of his original innocence; the will is raised above
   itself and all things; the will is no longer will, it loseth its name,
   and is called now the will of God, and no longer man's will. This is
   now the aim of the will for which it was created, and this is worked by
   the noble fruit of the Passion of Christ; it freeth him from all
   attraction of creatures and floodeth him with divine sweetness; it
   overwhelmeth him and killeth all besides, and maketh him united. Then
   in this state of simplicity he is led on high to comprehend the divine
   wonders; and he is led through all the wonders to the wonder of
   wonders, which is God; here he has got beyond wondering, and all other
   wonders escape him. Thus as he seeth that he can never come to the end
   of this wonder, he keepeth silence and leaveth all things to God, and
   all that God then doeth seemeth to him right. In this manner the will
   is at its highest point, and the measureless purity of divine goodness
   is given him by God, which compelleth him so that he can be nothing
   else than good. This is obtained by the will in the Passion of Christ,
   in which all bitterness is turned into sweetness, but all the sweetness
   of the world is turned into bitterness. Herein alone is revealed true
   goodness, which is God, and it compelleth him to will only all that God
   willeth.

50.

   It may be asked, Whereby shall a man know that his will is overcome by
   God? By six things. First, if a man giveth not himself up to any sinful
   work, but resists it and alway fleeth from it, and draweth his will
   entirely away from it. But the will of man cannot do this, therefore he
   who liveth according to his own will can never live without sin.
   Secondly, if man prepareth himself for all virtues, so that he
   exerciseth each virtue that God requireth of him; this also man cannot
   do of himself, and of this Christ saith, "Without Me ye can do
   nothing." [142] In the third place, if he doth not flee all the deaths
   that may occur to him, but suffereth them gladly through God; and no
   one can do this except through God, of which St. Paul said, "I can do
   all things through Him that strengtheneth me." [143] In the fourth
   place, if a man sets aside all that is intermediate between him and
   God, whether bodily or spiritual; and this God Himself must work in
   man, and must take from him all mediums, and that is the highest work
   that God can work in man through grace. In the fifth place, it may be
   known if man's will is the will of God by this: If the honour of God
   only is his object in all his doing and permitting, if he always taketh
   the best for the greatest honour of God. Then the light of glory hath
   sprung up in man, when he findeth nothing else in himself than that the
   honour of God should alway increase, but his own honour should
   diminish. But many men are found who say, "I wish that the honour of
   God might be fulfilled in me and in all." It is well to say this, but
   it is scarcely to be attained that this can always be: no one can do so
   except a right perfect man who stands in essential truth, unmoved by
   any accident, whether weal or woe, or whatever it be, so that he always
   remain contented in all things. Sixthly, if a man who standeth in
   essential truth always penetrates more in this essence into the hidden,
   secret, unknown will of God, and loseth his will entirely in it, so
   that he becometh entirely without will, neither willing good nor evil,
   but willing nothing; and thus nothing becometh the object of the will.
   This cometh to pass because he knoweth nothing in that moment but the
   pure will of God, and thereby is he freed from all willing, and
   suffereth God only to will, and this is the highest union of the human
   will with God's will. Now all this is worked by the Passion of Jesus,
   in which he lifteth himself and freeth himself from all that is not
   God. He is thus linked to God by the great good which lieth hid in the
   Passion of Christ, and he arriveth at the highest degree of perfection.
   And God granteth him what he asketh, because he hath done all that God
   wished to have from him. Therefore whoever willeth that God should hear
   him at all times must listen and hear what God willeth to have from
   him; if he doeth this God can refuse him nothing. St. Gregory saith,
   "God's hand is never empty of gifts when the ark of the heart is full
   of good will."

51.

   A perfect will doeth as much with one good work as an imperfect will
   with many good works, and it worketh as much in a moment as another in
   a long time, and it doeth as much in rest as another with much labour.
   This is because God doth not take this according to the plenitude of
   number, nor of magnitude, but he taketh everything according to the
   perfection of purity. Therefore the work that is perfect and pure is
   dearer to God than a thousand that are impure and imperfect. Since now
   a perfect will alone can do a perfect work, then one single work by it
   is worth a thousand other works. Also for this reason is its work
   better, because a perfect will comprehendeth all good works in one good
   work; and not only those that it might do, but those that all men, and
   angels, and saints do. And this is because he doeth in one work all
   that he can, and if he could do all works as that one work, he would do
   it gladly. Yea, if he could do the works that God worketh, he would not
   omit to do so; and thus he deserveth essential reward in all good
   works. Again, this is because he loveth them, and where love is it
   deserveth; and the work answereth to perfect love; this is not what an
   imperfect will worketh in its imperfection, but the work answereth as
   if he had done it in perfection. In other cases what is wanting in a
   good work must be made up by him who worketh it, but whoso loveth hath
   no drawback in his work, for it answereth to the perfection with which
   he loveth it. Thus, then, it deserveth reward. The most perfect works
   that Christ ever did, and that all saints in heaven and all perfect men
   on earth do, all answer to a perfect will, and the works are entitled
   to reward according to their perfection. For if anything faileth to
   this perfection (in this man of charity) he is pained thereby; he would
   gladly be perfect according to the dearest will of God, and he would do
   what he could to become so; what is lacking to him now God filleth up
   with His works and with all perfect works. For God loveth much a good
   will; He wisheth that it should lack nothing, but that it may alway
   embrace the best, and He will dower him with all good.

52.

   Also the highest power of the spirit, which is called synteresis [144]
   --the understanding faculty--is brought back to its first nobility by
   the Passion of Christ. This faculty is created immediately for God
   without mediums, but it was brought under a medium by the fall of Adam,
   and this medium must be destroyed in Christ, so that the spirit may be
   entirely stripped of all mediums. This happeneth in this wise, when all
   the faculties of man, whether outer or inner, pass through the works
   and the teaching of Christ, and do what they can. This exercise in
   Christ maketh the powers quite pure, and the purity is inflamed with
   the tire of love, so that each faculty inclineth itself to what it was
   ordained, that is, to the highest power, which attaineth God without a
   medium. Then God revealeth Himself in the essence of the soul, and
   draweth all the faculties to Him, and uniteth them with Himself. Thus
   all that which is in man will run after God and seek Him. And then God
   showeth Himself, and giveth him to try on His garment, and when the
   faculties taste how sweet God is, they find such relish in this
   sweetness, that they follow and hurry after God alway. As a sporting
   dog hurrieth after game as soon as he findeth the scent, so all the
   faculties, when they track God in the essence of the soul, run after
   Him. And thus hath it come to pass when they look into the essence of
   the soul, where God is, that God lifteth and embraceth them, and they
   embrace God. And each sitteth down to table, and wisheth to partake,
   and each one inviteth the other to eat and to drink. They all eat and
   drink, and are all filled in common. One letteth himself be moved by
   another, what one willeth the other willeth, and all agree. Therefore
   Christ said, "When I am lifted up I draw all things to Me." Thus when
   the highest faculty of the spirit unites itself with Christ, it is
   drawn up with Christ, and draweth all things with it; and thus each
   thing cometh to its first origin from which it came. This is because,
   when the highest faculty of the spirit standeth on the most perfect
   degree for which the spirit was created, all the lowest faculties are
   obliged to stand on the highest perfection for which they were
   ordained, for when anything faileth in the highest it must fail in the
   lowest.

53.

   Thus is it known of a man if he stand rightly or wrongly. If the
   internal man be well ordered according to the best, the outer man must
   also be so, for what the spirit receiveth from God it also giveth to
   the lower faculties, and just as God ordereth it so it ordereth them.
   Thus the inner man is known by the outer, for if the spirit is formed
   inwardly after Christ by grace, then the external man is formed from
   this. Christ also said, "Even as the Father hath sent Me, so send I
   also you, that you may go and bring forth fruit." [145] From this
   likeness to Christ the disciples of Christ can also be known.

54.

   Nothing maketh us liker Christ than when we consider His works and His
   Passion. For this also hath Christ worked and suffered, to take away
   all inequality from us; in this same work and Passion we must form
   ourselves, if we wish to lose our inequality and unlikeness. Verily as
   Christ hath redeemed in no other wise than by His life, working, and
   suffering, just as little can any one be saved and perfect, save if we
   hold to the teaching, works, and Passion of Jesus; he who busies
   himself the most with this is happiest and likest Christ. The works and
   the Passion of Jesus are full of blessedness, and therefore our mind
   ought to live upon them. As the bee flieth to the flower and sucketh
   sweetness therefrom in order to get honey, so also ought we to fly to
   the wounds of our Lord, and to suck them, and then we shall stream over
   with divine sweetness. Only thus doth man gather unto himself this
   precious honey; whatever belongeth to the man will so overflow with
   divine good that he will desire nothing more. That bee which flieth out
   the farthest to the flowers of the field bringeth also the most honey
   home, and what cometh from it is all honey; so is it also with the man
   who flieth and sucketh the most at the wounds of Christ, the loveliest
   flowers of the field; he receiveth the most honey. His soul is full of
   the divine honour, and what proceedeth from him is nothing else than
   the honour of God, which is at all times revealed to him. As Jesus
   Christ hath at all times established the glory of His Father, so such
   men establish alway the honour of God, and for this reason, because the
   wounds of our Lord always overflow with grace, and whoso drinketh of
   them drinketh continually internal graces, and these pass over into all
   his actions, and into all that he letteth be, making all to the honour
   of God; God also keepeth him from all that is against His honour. As a
   lord alloweth nothing to his dear servant that would be against his
   honour, even out of love for this faithful servant, so also God
   permitteth nothing in His servant that were unworthy of God and of him;
   this God doeth out of special love for them who cleave to His love, who
   embrace His Passion and consider it zealously.

55.

   Whoso cleaveth to Christ and considereth His Passion is as little
   permitted to leave God as the Son is able to leave the Father. For when
   man turneth to the Passion of our Lord, God openeth the fountain of His
   grace, floodeth therewith the mind of man, and overwhelmeth him, so
   that he can do nothing apart from grace; that which now floweth from
   Him is only love and grace. Oh, lift up thy wings and fly away to the
   field where the flowers bloom as Solomon saith, "I am the flower of the
   field," [146] and suck the sweetness of the flowers and gather honey.
   Thou shalt receive honey in plenty, so that thou canst hand it over to
   men! Why do people think that God suffereth sinners to live, and doth
   not slay them? Chiefly among others for this reason, because good men
   who hold their mouth to the wounds of our Lord, and suck all grace
   therefrom, return to God and pray for sinners. As grace compelleth man
   to pray for them, so they compel God to hear them. Christ also said to
   Zaccheus, "I must tarry to-day in thy house." [147] For as the grace of
   God compelleth men to do what God willeth, so also they compel God to
   do what they list. Because under the old covenant the overflow of
   divine grace was not so perfect, God slew or smote the sinner at the
   time, instantly; but now is the outflow of divine grace perfect and
   floodeth all pure hearts, compelling them in true love to cleave to
   God, and thus also is God compelled by them.

56.

   Oh, wise would be he who knew these men and was intimate with them; if
   they desired he should do anything he would do it quite perfectly, for
   what they ask of God He granteth them. But they are known by no one
   save those who are like unto them, for their treasure, which they carry
   in themselves, is hidden, as gold in the earth; therefore he whose
   heart is burthened with earthly things cannot know them. They are also
   for this reason not to be known, because they carry what they have in
   the innermost depths of their soul, hence the man who minds outward
   things cannot well recognise them. They are unknown because their
   treasure is raised above all images and forms; but whoso perceiveth
   truth according to images cannot recognise them. What they have, have
   they obtained from the Passion of Christ; whoso doth not know this also
   knoweth nothing of these men. They cannot also be known, because they
   obtained all that they have in a pure state of rest, but whoever is
   impure and unquiet knoweth them not. They are also unknown as they have
   nothing striking about them, and whoever still aspires after notorious
   things and striking things, he knoweth nothing of such men, and thus
   these best men are generally the most slighted and least loved, because
   people do not love what they do not understand. Lastly, they are not
   known because their possession is raised above all words; but those who
   love all things according to words are often deceived. Therefore is it
   the highest wisdom to recognise good men. Wisdom is not studied at
   Paris but in the Passion of our Lord, and whoso turneth his reason to
   this learneth all godly wisdom. [148]

57.

   But no one is hidden from these men; they recognise all; for as Christ
   hath communion with all things, such a man learneth, when in communion
   with Christ, all things. Jesus is the rule of all men, and whoso
   knoweth the rule understandeth all men; He is full of grace and truth:
   whoso obtaineth the grace that is in Christ and in His Passion, to him
   all mediation disappeareth, so that all things are known to him
   immediately. That we do not know all in truth comes from this, that we
   still have mediation; if we were free from this we should certainly
   know the pure truth. But its purity we obtain in Christ and in His
   Passion. For His Passion is like a grindstone, and to him who grindeth
   his mind in it, all rust falleth away. His Passion taketh away all
   deformity from the mind, so that thou knowest quite purely, and no more
   unlikeness remaineth in thee. The spirit becometh thus a pure vessel of
   God; in Him God can now work without any hindering; but God worketh in
   the soul without hindering when its highest power looketh well about
   it, and driveth away all that is hurtful. What doth not belong to its
   dwelling is not let in, it shutteth out all, that no storm may bring an
   injury. Thus God now resteth in it and inviteth in His guests, namely,
   all the faculties of the soul; He leadeth them into His house, into the
   essence of the soul. They must all be therein, and He giveth to each
   his special viand; each receiveth its own and taketh what belongeth to
   it, as Jesus saith, "Give to each his reward, beginning from the last
   unto the first." [149] The last to whom God giveth is here the highest
   power and the essence of the soul; they are the last in the divine
   service, but they yet receive first their reward. The lower powers must
   begin in the service of God, and each one must do what he can. Thus the
   lowest powers are gradually led into the highest; but the highest are
   led into the essence of the soul, where God dwelleth as in His own
   house. He endoweth them now and beginneth with the last; for he
   begetteth His Son in the essence of the soul, for this is alone capable
   of supernatural birth. Through this birth all the other faculties also
   receive their distinct gifts; He imparteth to the reason light, to the
   will love, to the memory strength: also the lower faculties receive
   their share; from the sight He withdraweth all that is against God, the
   hearing He draweth to Himself, the feeling He turneth away from the
   luxury of the flesh, from the taste He withholdeth all that is unholy,
   the smell He directeth to Himself; each receiveth its own. But the
   lower faculties murmur because they are not endowed first. This
   murmuring ariseth when man beginneth to turn to God; he would wish at
   once to know all truth and to have perfect love, to be free from all
   that is against God; he would embrace all that appertaineth to God. But
   if he doth not find this directly he waxeth wrath against God, and yet
   he cannot become all this till he cometh to the point where the Father
   begetteth His Son in the soul; then all perfect gifts are given him by
   the Father of Light, in whom there is no shadow of turning, fur which
   reason also His gifts are unchangeable. God alway draweth the weakest
   to Himself, and yet endoweth the best first. For if He were to dower
   the lower faculties first, they would be too weak, and could not keep
   the gift. Whereupon God beginneth with the best, endowing this first,
   that the gift may be retained. His gifts lead the spirit to the highest
   degree of perfection, in which it seeth the pure truth, which is God
   Himself. This is worked by the fruitfulness of the works and of the
   Passion of Christ, wherewith it conquereth and overcometh all things,
   so that it obtaineth true peace and enjoyeth God without a medium. Then
   the spirit standeth in right freedom, and what it willeth cometh to
   pass, and what it ordereth must be obeyed, and what it asketh is
   granted. This is because it and God are one, and what God willeth it
   willeth, and what God commandeth it commandeth, and hence all things
   must come to pass as it wisheth, and all things must be obedient to it.
   And this is the other way by which you should go to a poor life.

   [134] Here, again, two verses are condensed. In Matt. xx. 21 we read,
   the mother of Zebedee's children begged that they might sit in the
   kingdom of Christ on both sides of Him; ver. 22, Christ answers, "Can
   you drink the cup which I shall give you?"

   [135] 1 Cor. ii. 2.

   [136] 1 Cor. xv. 22.

   [137] John. viii. 2.

   [139] De Mystica Theolog. c. 5.

   [140] Matt. xiii. 44.

   [141] Here the author of the "Following" again combines two verses: 2
   Esdras, 8. 10. "Comedite pinguia et bibite mulsum;" and Solomon's Song,
   5. 1. "Drink abundantly, O beloved."

   [142] John xv. 5.

   [143] Phil. iv. 13.

   [144] According to the greatest of the Schoolmen, the synteresis is not
   a power of the soul (potentia), but a habitus (St. Thomas, 1. p. qu.
   79. a. 12) and habitus principiorum operabilium. But according to
   Alexander of Ales and St. Bonaventure it is not a pure Power (Potenz),
   but a potentia habitual is (2 qu. 73. m. 1.--2 dist. 39. a. 2. qu. I.)
   St. Thomas expressed a similar view (2 dist. 39. qu. 3. a. I.) when he
   calls the synteresis a virtus: Quae (sicut aquila) transcendit
   rationabilem. St. Bonaventure calls it (Itiner. c. 1), Apex mentis, seu
   synteresis scintilla. According to William of Paris there were several,
   who described it as Nobilissima et sublimissima pars animae (De vitiis
   et peccatis, c. 6. opp. ed. Par. 1674. tom. ii. p. 273} as superior
   pars rationis, nay, as ipsa anima humana secundum essentiam (p. 274).
   On the whole, all the Schoolmen agree in placing this synteresis in the
   ratio practica, while the Mystics seek it in parte affectiva, though
   they also acknowledge in it something higher than the intelligentia.
   (See Sandaeus, l. c. p. 30 and foll.) Eckhart comes nearest to the
   scholastic doctrine, 113. 36, where he gives the synteresis much the
   same properties as the Schoolmen.

   [145] Here again verses of different chapters are combined: John xx.
   21, "Even as the Father hath sent Me, so send I you;" and xv. 16, "That
   ye may go and bear fruit."

   [146] Solomon's Song ii. 1. Ego flos campi, and lower down, p. 220,
   Luke xix. 5.

   [147] Luke xix. 5.

   [148] Denifle remarks in this connection, that if some Protestant
   inquirers see in this or in other passages an undervaluing of
   scholasticism, let once for all this fact suffice in answer: that the
   greatest of the Schoolmen, St. Thomas, teaches that--"Scientia et
   quidquid aliud ad magnitudinem pertinet occasio est quod homo confidat
   de se ipso, et ideo non totaliter se Deo tradat. Et inde est quod
   hujusmodi quandoque occasionaliter devotionem impediunt, et in
   simplicibus et mulieribus devotio abandat." &c. (St. Thomas, 2. 2. qu.
   82, a. 3. ad 3.)

   [149] This passage, again, is not correctly cited: Matthew xx. 8, "Call
   the labourers and give them their wages, beginning from the last to the
   first . . . They received one penny."
     __________________________________________________________________

  The third way of a poor, perfect life, when you contemplate God internally,
  is, that a man do not fly from what may kill him in spiritual things.

58.

   The third way, which belongeth to a poor life, wherein you see God
   inwardly, is to give yourself up and not flee all that killeth man
   spiritually. This is expressed by being spiritually dead, so that a man
   is despised by all creatures and judged and condemned; now, a man ought
   not to fly from this if he wisheth thoroughly to die to his nature.
   Whoso flieth this steppeth aside from the way of poverty and of a pure
   life.

59.

   Now this is so, because man hath cast himself through sins into the
   hatred of God, and this hatred must be rooted out by the hatred of
   creatures. Whoso is most hated in his repentance of sins, to him will
   his sins be most surely forgiven; and in proportion as man seeketh the
   love of creatures he departeth from the divine love, for creaturely
   love and godly love cannot subsist together. Thus he who is hated by
   the creature in a natural way is loved by God in a spiritual way; for
   no truly poor man is ever loved by any creature in a natural way, nor
   doth he love any one by nature; this is because he dieth continually to
   his nature, in him and in other men, and hence no one findeth anything
   to love in him naturally. For it is meet and lit that natural men who
   live devoted to their bodily nature should always hate him. For like
   loveth its like; therefore he who wisheth that he should never be loved
   unrightly, should take heed that he always die to his nature, in him
   and in other men, for what then is loved in him is God. And whoso is
   loved by natural men, that is a sign that he is not yet dead to his
   nature. For what natural men love is the luxury of nature, and when
   they do not find that, they do not love. It is therefore a good sign
   that a man rejoice when he is hated, for this no sinner can feel. He
   should give up all likeness with natural love, then divine love is
   alway his object, and he is only loved through divine love. For no one
   loveth another save when he findeth some likeness to himself in him,
   both by nature and grace; hence, when the likeness of nature is quite
   gone, there remaineth only the likeness of grace; and hence, whoso
   dieth to all likeness of nature, his flow or efflux is divine love, and
   his influx or ebb is also divine love. It happens thus that men not
   dead to themselves often love by nature, weening it is by grace, and
   when they are blamed for this, they are troubled and wax wrath; by this
   they should know that their love is natural. For right divine love is
   at all times patient, and suffereth all things; it letteth itself quite
   well be hated, but it hateth no one, and construeth all things for the
   best; but men not dead to themselves are always agitated in
   contradiction, and distracted from their peace.

60.

   A man must also endure all judgment? that fall upon him, and this
   prepareth him also for a poor life. If a man is to be freed from all
   the judgments which a man hath deserved, he must be judged; and by the
   judgment, that he patiently endureth, the judgment of God is taken away
   from him. This is necessary for those who belong to God--that they
   should be prepared by manifold judgments. Therefore Christ said, "It is
   needful that scandal should come, but woe to him through whom it
   cometh." [150] Therefore is it necessary that virtue should be guarded
   by contradiction and judgment; and whoso is not judged, that is a sign
   that he never worked proper virtue, for the highest virtue that man can
   work is most attacked by judgment; and whoso fleeth judgment fleeth
   virtue. In fact, the man who wisheth to live most perfectly must be
   judged by all men, for they do not stand in the same nearness to
   perfection. Every man praiseth his own, and what is unlike his own is
   not praised by him; and hence he judgeth all that is not like to him.

61.

   Therefore let no man omit any virtue through any judgment, and say, I
   will spare my fellow-man, that I be not a stumblingblock to him; or
   again, I will leave virtue for God. I answer to this, that a true
   virtue is never a cause of stumbling to any one, but it is a cause of
   setting all men upright, and guarding them from all falls. Whoso
   falleth through virtue is like a man whom a physician physics and who
   dieth of it. A man who doth not better himself by good works can never
   better himself by bad works, and the omission to do a good work is a
   bad work; therefore no one is bettered by the neglect of a pure virtue.
   And whoso leaveth a virtue for the sake of judgment, he feareth more
   bodily injury to himself than the spiritual injury of other people; for
   true virtue bringeth no injury, but it alway bringeth use. And whoso
   neglecteth virtue out of fear, this is a sign that he never obtained
   real virtue, which springeth out of divine love, for "in divine love
   there is no fear," as St. John saith. [151] Therefore the man dead to
   creatures accomplisheth virtue, even if the pains of hell were to fall
   upon him. For he worketh no virtue either from fear of hell or for the
   sake of heaven, but alone from pure love of God; and he will gladly
   suffer what falleth upon him, and it is the greatest joy to Mm thus to
   suffer, like the twelve apostles, who rejoiced that they were worthy to
   suffer through Christ. Therefore whoso hath divine love letteth no
   virtue be omitted, and suffereth every one to judge as much as he will;
   and he looketh to all that is pleasing to God, and not to what pleaseth
   people.

62.

   When a man hath still an eye to other people, and to what pleaseth
   them, his eye is not clear, therefore his work is not pure: for the
   creature blindeth, and God maketh seeing. He, therefore, who wisheth to
   see perfectly must turn his eye away from all creatures, and alone to
   God. After this all his works are pure virtue, and whatever falleth
   then upon him is for his best. No one should be guilty of this, that he
   goeth out of his best and followeth the best of other men; and this is
   because, when a man followeth his best in the most perfect manner, he
   doeth what is best for all in the most perfect manner. As Christ saith,
   "When am raised up, behold I draw all things after me." [152] Now,
   therefore, whoso is raised with Christ above all earthly things,
   draweth all things with him aloft, where is Christ, and that is the
   very best for all men. And who doth not take his best therein, this is
   his fault, as he is not worthy of Him; but no one must omit virtue for
   any unworthy object, and if he were to omit a virtue, he would fall
   into this same unworthiness. And God's honour doth not lie in this that
   I am sparing with virtue on account of my fellowman, but that I fulfil
   all virtue, and I ought to endure whatever judgment may fall upon me,
   and that is the honour of God. For these same judgments make me a
   powerful judge at the last day, over all those who judge me here. Of
   this Christ spake: "Judge not, that ye be not judged." [153] Now, whoso
   judgeth another here in good works, gives him power to judge himself.
   Of this Paul spake: "Whoso judgeth his brother, heapeth judgment on
   himself." [154] Therefore let no man be frightened because he is
   judged; for all his detects are thereby taken away from him, which only
   leave him henceforth the feeling of repentance.

63.

   It may now be asked if man with his virtues cannot in any way give an
   occasion of falling to his fellow-man. I say, where there is a true
   virtue, which is perfectly worked by divine love, this is no cause of
   falling; and whatever judgment falleth upon it is nothing else than a
   revelation of truth and justice. But the good work that taketh place
   out of fear or natural causes and natural likeness and an unprepared
   ground is an impure work; the greater the impurity the greater is the
   cause of falling to fellow-men; and whoso overthroweth his fellow-man
   with such works is guilty of his fall; these good works must often be
   left for the purpose of helping a fellow-man. Because these good works,
   through an improper intention, are changed into bad works, so that they
   are no longer good, but they are bad, and therefore they must be left;
   but good works that take place from right divine love are altogether
   pure, nor are they a cause of stumbling to our fellowmen, and therefore
   they are not to be left.

64.

   It might now be said, Could not an evil work be wrought from love, so
   that though the intention is to God, yet the work is evil? I say that
   all right works of love are good, and not evil. [155] St. Paul saith
   this, that "divine love worketh no evil." But many a man weeneth that
   he worketh from love when it is not love, therefore his works are
   ofttimes evil. For divine love is ordained according to a necessary
   aim, and when a man worketh works of love without order or necessity,
   love loseth its name, and a work lacking love taketh place. But such
   works are not entitled to reward; for Paul saith, "If I lack charity, I
   am nothing." [156] Therefore is it a great necessity that men should
   know how they should work works of love, and should let drop works
   lacking charity. Few men are found who know this art, to work the works
   of love in perfection.

65.

   A right work of love hath four kinds of ordinances. First is the law of
   Holy Church; the second order is that of the natural law; and these two
   ordinances meet in one law, and their law is measure, and the measure
   applieth to outer works, and whoso doth not attain to measure in his
   works of love, spoileth his work. Now, this is the measure, a mean or
   medium between little and much; and whoso always hitteth the mean in
   his works of love, his works are ordered and ordained according to
   divine love. Thus it is not a work of love to give to a man who doth
   not need it, for the giver doth not work according to the mean, which
   is here the necessity; for necessity is the object of gifts and their
   mean or measure, and hence it is not a virtue that a rich man should
   give to another rich man. Just as little is it a virtue that you give
   to eat to a man who is full, or to a drunken man to drink, as it is to
   give temporal goods to a rich man. There is indeed a little of virtue
   in this, Give to me and I will give to you. But God giveth no reward
   for this, for it is no work of love. Nor is it a properly ordered work
   of love, that a man should fast above the power of nature, so that his
   nature is injured by it; it is also not good that a man should eat
   beyond necessity, but a medium and measure should be kept in all
   things, and whoso observeth the mean in all his works, keepeth the
   commandments of Holy Church and of nature. Of this St. Bernard
   speaketh: "The best thing that a man can do is to keep order in nature
   and spirit." [157] For all things have order, and whosoever taketh away
   their order from things, taketh their being; and whoso breaketh proper
   order in his works of love, he infringeth the divine love, and his
   works are rather evil than good. For Christ saith, "There is no one
   good save God," and therefore nothing is good, save it be done in God,
   and nothing is done in God save according to order. The third order
   according to which a proper work of love should be worked is the order
   of the Holy Gospel; the fourth order is divine. And these two orders
   have one aim, which is God; for the order of the Holy Gospel
   admonisheth to external freedom from temporal things, which are not
   God, and the divine ordinance admonisheth to an internal freedom from
   all things that are not God. And whoso keepeth both these ordinances
   rightly in his works, he worketh always without mediation, in God and
   for God. This is because a perfect man, who liveth according to the
   order of the Gospel and according to divine order, is stripped of all
   creatures, inwardly and outwardly; hence God is his object, without
   mediation; for all means are departed, therefore also his works are
   without mediation, for they are worked without and above all creatures
   in God. And therefore Christ said, "Whoso leaveth not all that he hath,
   cannot be My disciple." He says "all things," and not to leave a part
   and keep a part, for this aims at natural means. But He saith we should
   leave all things and keep nothing, and this aims at God without any
   mediation. And he is a true disciple of God if he goeth only to the
   divine school, in which he learneth all truth, and if God alone is his
   schoolmaster, and teacheth him to work all his works according to
   divine order. Christ also saith: "Whoso doth not leave father and
   mother and sister, and all other things, is not worthy of Me." [158] In
   truth, whose selfhood cleaveth to a thing that is not simply God, let
   this thing be as small as you please, maketh himself thereby unworthy
   of a great God; for worth and dignity subsist in likeness, and whoso
   cleaveth to his selfhood is unlike to God.

66.

   The Sacrament of our Lord is God and man. Whoso wisheth to receive
   Christ here worthily, must as far as possible be like unto Him. As the
   Humanity is here pure, so must be also the man who receiveth Him in His
   externals be clear of all temporal things; and as God is here pure, so
   also must the spirit be freed from all things which are not purely
   godlike. In this way is the Sacrament worthily received. Christ saith,
   "Whoso doth not leave all, is not worthy of Me." Such a one alone
   receiveth the fruit in the most perfect manner, for he hath nothing in
   himself that can hinder him from this fruit. He can therefore go every
   day and receive his own food; no one can do this properly but he alone.
   Whoso would refuse him this food would take from him his Fatherly
   inheritance, that Christ hath left him through His death, to live upon
   it and still his desire. Whoso goeth otherwise to the table of the Lord
   than in true reality, he goeth not as a child to his fatherly
   inheritance. You can withhold from him his inheritance without sin, so
   long till he hath been chosen as a legitimate child of the covenant;
   such must hold themselves back from the Holy Sacrament till they are
   better prepared. They must have awe of the judgment of people, as it is
   not yet their proper inheritance, for they can be judged rightfully. If
   they still go up to receive, they give scandal and are thus guilty, for
   they take what is not their property. But the true children of the
   covenant, whose inheritance it is, need not omit for the sake of any
   man, unless their own heart did not consent to it. They must then turn
   to their Father, and keep to their inheritance. No one giveth them
   scandal if they use their inheritance; but they do not only use it, but
   divide it with all men who desire it. They need not hold in awe any
   judgment, for no one can deny their right. They must hold fast their
   inheritance, and if they let it be denied them, they prove thereby no
   love to their Father, but would make themselves illegitimate children.
   Whoso were to withhold from them the Sacrament, would be like unto a
   man whom a housefather inviteth to himself as guest, offereth him meat
   and drink, and accepts nothing from him therefor; but the guest driveth
   the host from his table, upsetting meat and drink, so that they must
   both fast. A wise and determined house-father would not pardon the
   guest, and if he were to do so, he would be a fool and a coward, who
   never possessed a manly character, and is not worthy to eat his meat.
   Whoso now knoweth that God feedeth him with Himself, let him eat and
   drink without fear, and let every one murmur and judge as he will; he
   giveth right to himself, to God, and to all men. But if he omitteth it
   on account of murmuring and judgments, he showeth that he is no child
   of the covenant, and that he doth not rightfully eat this food.

67.

   Some say you ought to consider your fellowmen and omit it for God's
   sake. Whoso goeth worthily to the table of the Lord, giveth alms to the
   whole of Christendom, and to each one is given according to his
   worthiness. But whoso omitteth it giveth nothing to any one, and
   letteth all men hunger. Whoso blameth a good man for receiving the Body
   of Christ maketh himself unworthy of all the good of the whole of holy
   Christendom; but the highest good of Christendom is this, that good men
   receive the Body of Christ. Now, he who sinneth and maketh himself
   unworthy in the highest, maketh himself also unworthy in small things;
   whoso treateth God with dishonour, he dishonoureth also all the saints.
   On account of this unworthiness of his Censor no one should omit the
   Sacrament, in order that all other men should not have to answer for it
   if one sinneth. If he omitteth it when he ought to do it, he falleth
   into the same unworthiness in which he is who blameth him. In doing
   thus he followeth him more than God, therefore he hath more likeness to
   his blamer than to God. He also showeth no use to him or any one if he
   omitteth it. Whoso standeth on a weak tree, which is shaken by a
   vehement wind, must fall down, and if he falleth not at the first gust
   of wind, he falleth after another; but as he must needs fall, it is
   better that he should fall through the first than through a following
   gust. But to receive the Body of Christ is an occasion of falling to no
   one; it is his own wickedness which is in him, and if it is not
   revealed in this, it will be revealed in another work, and therefore he
   cannot escape. It is quite right that such persons should be judged,
   for it is the greatest work to receive the Body of Christ, and man in
   his weakness cannot prepare himself worthily for it; therefore it is
   necessary that he should be helped, in order that he may the sooner
   step up to it worthily. God permitteth that a judgment should fall upon
   him; these judgments make him pure, so that he may the more worthily
   receive the Body of the Lord: if any one flee these judgments, he will
   not let himself be prepared for it. Hence it belongeth to a poor life
   that a man be judged, in order then to be free, that he may commune
   with God immediately and work out each virtue in the most perfect
   manner.

68.

   Man must also suffer every persecution, which helpeth very much to a
   poor life. Man, through Adam's fall and his defects, is full of sinful
   leanings, which hinder him from his best; this inrooted leaning and
   these defects must be rooted out by sufferings. Whoso doth not overcome
   Adam through sufferings, never attaineth to a pure poor life; whoso
   giveth him occasion to suffer helpeth him to this end. God willeth not
   that anything should be rooted out in man without sufferings; all that
   is untrue must disappear through these. He also lendeth no gifts if the
   ground for them is not purified by sufferings. Holy Writ saith, "No
   evil remaineth unpunished, and no good unrewarded." [159] If all evil
   is rooted out by suffering, then all good is given; therefore also
   Christ wished to suffer, that through His suffering all evil might be
   done away and all good given. Whoso suffereth most in his sufferings,
   has also the most use from the Passion of our Lord; but whoso fleeth
   this, fleeth his everlasting blessedness, as through nothing doth man
   come nearer to his blessedness than through sufferings. Suffering
   purifieth man as fire doth gold; the gold that is most burned in the
   fire is also the purest. So is it also with man; whoso suffereth most
   becometh also purest, whoso is purest is also nighest God, and thus
   suffering is the greatest gift that God lendeth here in time, for
   through this you come nighest to Him.

69.

   But no one is worthy of suffering except he who suffereth in the
   highest degree of divine love; he who hath not this is also not worthy.
   God letteth sinners suffer little upon earth; on the other hand, good
   men must suffer much, and if- any one is wise, he accepteth suffering
   more joyfully than if he received all the riches of the earth; for
   temporal good robbeth man of everlasting happiness if he tarries in it
   with joy. But temporal good giveth him suffering if he suffereth from
   love; he is also a fool who leaveth the good and chooseth the evil. Yet
   many fools are found on earth who desire and seek temporal good, but
   flee sufferings, therefore they are the wisest before the world and the
   most foolish before God. If God were to give sufferings to
   worldly-minded men, but temporal good to good men, He would act like
   one who were to kill his friend but would keep his foes alive, and give
   them, moreover, what they desired. Nothing bringeth more life into the
   soul than suffering. It rooteth out all that bringeth death to the
   soul, and when the deathly is thus removed, nothing more remaineth than
   life. Thus the most severe suffering begetteth the greatest joy, as joy
   springeth from suffering.

70.

   It may now be asked, Which suffering is better that which man hath
   occasioned to himself or what other people have wrought, or what God
   inflicts upon him? Just as much as it is better that God should bless
   man than that man should make himself happy, so much better is also the
   suffering that other people cause him and that God inflicts upon him
   than that which he occasions himself. Further, that suffering is the
   best where the greatest patience is called forth; but patience is
   greater when you suffer at the hands of others than when it is caused
   by yourself. A man easily endureth himself, but, on the contrary, he
   doth not so easily endure another.

71.

   It may be said: if, then, the suffering that is inflicted on us by
   others is better than that which we inflict on ourselves, it is also
   better that we should not seek any suffering, but allow it to be
   applied to us; and thus, therefore, the suffering of rich people is
   better, as they do not seek it, than that of poor people, who seek it?
   But I say thus: That suffering is the best which is endured in true
   love, and this is certainly greater love if you seek suffering from
   love, than if you fly from it out of fear. But rich folk flee from
   sufferings, whether caused by themselves or others. The rich man is
   much more loved than hated, therefore no one doeth injury to him, save
   he himself. But the man truly poor in spirit thrusteth himself into
   every suffering, he fleeth his sins, as such sufferings give no reward,
   and he seeketh that others should do him injury, as he hath reward from
   this. Your own proper suffering cometh from a man's own sins, and he
   suffereth quite rightly who liveth in sins, as each sin begetteth a
   special spiritual suffering. But if rich folk suffer thus, they have
   yet no merit unless they avoid the sins; if, however, they live in
   sins, they must endure severe sufferings. A suffering of this kind is
   like unto that of hell, for the more you suffer the worse you become;
   this happeneth to sinners; the more they suffer through their sins, the
   more wicked they become, and they fall continually more into them in
   order to get free from suffering; the more they flee external
   suffering, the more are they punished internally. Even if they have no
   external punishment, they are yet tortured internally by their sins,
   and complain of their great sufferings. They think it ought to bring
   them merit, because people say that suffering is good; but it is more a
   beginning of hellish torments than a preparation for heaven; for as
   good men have a foretaste of everlasting joys, so have sinners a
   foretaste of everlasting torments, as everlasting joy is begotten in
   virtue, and everlasting torment in sins. Therefore that suffering alone
   bringeth merit which out of love is borne with patience and for the
   sake of the truth. Such sufferings are sought by good men, therefore
   their suffering is also well pleasing to God.

72.

   Nothing bringeth man nearer to God than Buffering, and indeed for this
   reason, because suffering rooteth out all that is hateful and
   ungrateful to God in man, and thus man must remain free from all hatred
   and must love God. Therefore Christ saith through David: "I am with him
   in tribulation; I will deliver him, and glorify him; I will give him a
   long life, and show him My salvation." [160] "I am with him in
   suffering "meaneth that you have always God present in suffering. Nay,
   God cometh with suffering to man, and cannot come better to him; man is
   thus freed from all that is not God; he adhereth to God only, and God
   enlighteneth him with the light of His glory, and filleth him with
   everlasting blessedness, which is Himself. His suffering is like a
   wine-press in which grapes are pressed in wine making. If the grape is
   pressed, what is in it floweth from it; if it is sweet, sweet wine
   floweth forth, if sour, sour wine. So is it also if man is pressed by
   suffering, what is in him floweth from him. If he is a virtuous man,
   when he is seized by suffering, only divine sweetness issueth from him,
   which was hidden in him; it becometh manifest, so that he giveth good
   noble wine to drink to all men, and he can say, "Come all to me, ye
   that thirst, ye shall all be filled and satisfied with my own wine."
   [161] With this sweetness he now presseth into all things, he maketh
   them all good, and also receiveth the best. He disturbeth no man, and
   no man can trouble him; thus hath he then much likeness with God, if he
   remaineth quite immovable in his mind. Christ said also, "Blessed are
   they that are persecuted for justice' sake, for they shall be called
   the children of God; blessed are ye when men hate you and persecute
   you; rejoice and be exceeding glad, for your reward shall be great in
   heaven." [162] "Blessed," He saith, "are they who suffer persecution
   for justice' sake," and this is because persecution, hatred, and
   contempt bring salvation to man, and whoso doth not suffer this findeth
   also not happiness. No man can bless himself; if he is to be blessed,
   he must be holpen to this; this help rather than his works saveth him.
   Therefore also Jesus said, "Rejoice in the days of adversity, for your
   reward is great in heaven," that is, such a reward will be given to man
   as he could not have merited by his works. Therefore let no man be
   sorrowful in suffering, for it taketh away all sorrow, and procureth
   all peace. Good people are the most cheerful, because they have most
   sufferings, and the pressing winepress causeth the hidden joy to
   overflow. That is indeed a noble life, when man alway rejoiceth and is
   never thoroughly sorrowful.

73.

   Nevertheless our Lord saith, "My soul is sorrowful unto death." [163]
   How then can good people be always gladsome? There are two kinds of
   sorrow, first, a sorrow that ariseth from our sins; but Jesus and good
   souls have not this sorrow. The other sorrow is more one of compassion,
   and ariseth from the love of man; Jesus had this, and also all the
   pious. This sorrow can well subsist with divine joy, and he who loveth
   his neighbour most, and hath compassion with him, in him ariseth the
   greatest divine joy. Even though the good man must feel sufferings on
   account of its defects, this taketh place from divine love, and his
   suffering is not like that of the sinner, in whom the pangs of hell
   always are born, but his suffering cometh out of love, and begetteth
   divine joy. Whoso doth not rejoice in suffering giveth evidence that it
   is not fruit-bearing. St. Paul saith, "Rejoice in the Lord alway,"
   [164] and in another place he saith again, "Be joyful." "Rejoice in the
   Lord alway; "this meaneth that man should abide in everlasting joy in
   the Lord, but a joy issuing from a pure conscience. Whoso hath this
   joy, that is a sign that God dwelleth in his heart, who revealeth
   Himself in love and joy. Thus good souls cannot show much sadness, for
   God hath taken away from them all sadness, and hath taken the place of
   this in them; but where God is there is perpetual joy. "Be ye joyful,"
   that is, as often as a man meeteth a suffering, he should always have a
   peculiar joy. That is then a sign that God answereth him in all things,
   and always cometh to meet him with new gifts. Every suffering endured
   from love and with joy bringeth fresh gifts; and he who rejoiceth alway
   in suffering, proveth that God is always giving to him, and that no
   gift escapeth him. Fresh gifts bring fresh joys, and the joy is known
   by the gift; for no one rejoiceth if you take from him, but if you give
   to him. God giveth continually to good men, so they constantly also
   feel joy.

74.

   But it will be said that Jesus called those accursed who always live in
   joy here, [165] how can then good people always have such joy? Our Lord
   only calls those accursed who have their joy and their delight in this
   moment of time; this sham delight is sinful, therefore God rejecteth
   it. But the joy of the good doth not issue from the moment of time but
   from eternity, not from sin but from virtue. They do not procure this
   joy for themselves, but God giveth it to them.

75.

   It might again be said, If good people always have joy what is then
   their suffering? for suffering and joy cannot subsist together. I
   reply, Man is made up of body and soul, and each hath its separate
   work. But when the body rejoiceth in temporal things and sins, the
   spirit sorroweth, and sinners have this joy and sadness. Again, when
   the spirit rejoiceth in God, the body sorroweth in time, and this joy
   and sadness have good people. And the suffering of the body which they
   have in time bringeth them to life everlasting. Moreover, the joy that
   they have is the fruit of suffering, and thus suffering and joy subsist
   together, and the greater the suffering of the body, the greater is the
   joy of the spirit. That they can rejoice in sufferings is a sign that
   they belong to eternal life. Never was there to any man a divine joy in
   suffering, if he belonged to hell. From this cause also sinners have an
   everlasting sadness in their joy. The fruit of their temporal lust is
   much more a sham and a vain fancy than a truth. It is also in truth no
   joy but everlasting torment. These men, the more external delight they
   have, the more are they inwardly tortured. And this is a sign that they
   do not belong to God. For luck in this time is an affair of everlasting
   ill luck. He therefore who puffeth himself up with temporal luck is
   like unto a thief who rejoiceth when he is led over a green meadow; and
   so long as he is on the green meadow he thinketh it is well with him,
   but as soon as he hath passed over the meadow they hang him on the
   gallows, and all his joy is gone. So also it happeneth with the sinner
   who rejoiceth in this short time, and is afterwards hanged on the
   everlasting hellish gallows. And this is right, for they are thieves
   and steal from God what is His own. For all that they have is from God,
   and they give nothing back to Him, and therefore are they rightly
   hanged. And whoso is puffed up with good luck is puffed up because he
   is a thief and has to be hanged. Thus luck in time is a cause of hell
   and ill-luck, and pain a cause of everlasting life.

76.

   The remark might now be made: There be many good folk on earth who yet
   have little suffering, must they then on that account have less reward?
   I say, Whoso is a true friend of God is never without temporal
   suffering--he suffereth alway. This happeneth in a fourfold way. One
   suffering is in the works, another in the will, a third in the spirit,
   and a fourth in God, and each bringeth about a separate joy. The first
   suffering that a man endureth is from outer accidents. Thus God
   inflicts on man sickness, or condemnation, or letteth a man fall into
   poverty, so that he is exposed to hunger, thirst, and misery and
   insult, and whatever other sufferings he endureth he endureth all
   through God, and a right good man is seldom without such suffering; he
   must needs always suffer something. If such suffering were entirely
   withdrawn from him he would stray from the way to the kingdom of
   heaven. And let him know it or not, he must endure suffering in several
   ways. For on the road of God you must always go by your own strength,
   and yet no man can do this always unless God help him and give him
   power and power alway floweth into the soul through suffering. Whoso
   lacketh suffering lacketh strength, and whoso lacketh strength cannot
   always go of himself; but whoso cannot always go of himself, steppeth
   aside from the way of God. Hence good people must always suffer, that
   they may always have strength to go of themselves, and this they suffer
   privately or openly. It cometh often to pass that good men be hated
   privately, and that the worst things are said of them. Thus are they
   prepared by private sufferings. All this steadieth them on the way of
   God, and bringeth them great reward, and therefore Christ spake,
   "Rejoice in the day when ye are hated, for your reward shall be great
   in heaven." What He speaketh of the day is said of the light of truth.
   For as the sun enlighteneth the day, so suffering enlighteneth the
   reason to know the truth, therefore David said, "Suffering giveth
   understanding." [166] Therefore the men most tried by suffering are
   they of the most understanding. This is because suffering giveth to a
   man to know everything as it is. And it revealeth the secret nature of
   things. But what is revealed is also known. Now voluptuous delight and
   temporal luxury darken the reason, in the darkness of creatures, so
   that it becometh quite blind and loseth its natural discretion, and
   this is seen well in the love of the world. But suffering gathereth up
   the soul from all things that are not God into itself; and it loveth
   the truth, and in the light which is the spirit and God in the spirit,
   and in no other way can a man know the truth better than in suffering.
   This is because the sweetness of temporal things covereth the reason
   with darkness. But the bitterness of temporal things strippeth from the
   reason all darkness of creatures, as the knowledge of the truth is a
   going apart from all natural things. The sweetness of material things
   causeth the reason to cleave unto them, but the bitterness of things
   causeth the reason to turn away from all things, and thus suffering
   causeth detachment, and bringeth to the knowledge of the naked truth.
   Whoso would be right wise let him go to the school of suffering. For
   therein each thing showeth itself as it is, and of this Gregory
   speaketh, "Whatever was hid in man when suffering cometh, it is
   revealed." [167] In this way man cometh to a knowledge of himself and
   of all things in sufferings, as Paul saith, "Through much tribulation
   must we enter the kingdom of God." [168] For this kingdom of God
   consists in this, that we know God in us and know ourselves in God. But
   we know God in us and ourselves in God when all things that are not God
   are driven out of us with suffering, and thus God alone remaineth known
   in us. Therefore a teacher saith, "Whoso wish to live intimately with
   Christ must suffer persecution." [169] For suffering is driven out by
   suffering; and when a man hath endured all suffering he is free from
   all suffering, and thus he liveth in Christ intimately, that is, in
   right rest and peace of his heart. But whoso fleeth suffering is never
   free from suffering, that is because the ground of his heart never
   becomes clear, and thus the heart is always troubled. For all trouble
   must pass away with suffering, and therefore good people must always
   have some suffering, that they may always continue pure. For while man
   is in time he cannot always continue without sinful propensity, and
   sinful propensities must each one root out, and whosoever suffereth
   most, this is a sign that God loveth him most, especially removeth his
   sins, and maketh him pure from all sinful accidents. Hence suffering is
   a noble plant that quickly healeth the wounds of man. But to fools this
   plant hath not a pleasant smell, they turn away their noses from it and
   flee away. Therefore they must always be distressed, and moreover poor
   and unhappy, and right reprobate fools. But the richer and nobler they
   be in time, the greater fools without doubt. Therefore good people must
   always endure sufferings, that all folly may drop away from them, and
   that their reward may be always assigned them. Of this the wise man
   saith, "These are they whom we held as fools and mocked at them, but
   now are they counted among the sons of God." [170]

77.

   Secondly, man must have Buffering in the will, and what faileth him in
   works, he must fulfil in the will. This cometh to pass in this wise:
   when a man turneth into himself, and in the light of faith seeth the
   love of our Lord, which compelled Him to suffer such great martyrdom
   for him, then an answering love springeth up in man, who out of right
   love for our Lord would atone and make good all that which He hath
   suffered for his sake, and thus he falleth with the will on all the
   sufferings that might be inflicted upon him, and those he is willing
   again to suffer through and for Christ. Then his desire for suffering
   is greater than for all the things that are in time, and out of genuine
   answering love he throws off all that may bring him pleasure, comfort,
   and joy, and giveth himself a lack of all bodily delight and comfort,
   and of all creaturely joy, that he might repay Christ for a part of His
   sufferings. And this beginning of poverty is a sure way to a perfect
   life; and after a good beginning followeth easily a good middle course
   and a good end.

78.

   It is wonderful that these beings are never abandoned by God; they have
   begun in love, which is Christ, and Jesus must support them, and keep
   them with him for eternity. It also happens that their seduction will
   be attempted by nature, but the will bound to God with the
   determination to give up all things, can resist all other temptations.
   Such men then are the servants of God. All that bringeth the good to
   default is that their own will was never serious, for when a man
   standeth on his own responsibility he must fall, and cannot remain
   upright. But he who forceth on himself the atonement for the sufferings
   of Jesus, this earnest determination is aided by God, who raiseth him
   to godliness, and never letteth him fall again into a human will: this
   determination can therefore resist deadly falls. The following giveth
   us an example:--"A king who hath an enemy seeketh to catch him, and if
   he getteth him into his power he punisheth him, taketh his goods from
   him, and perchance killeth him." So is it also with the "will," when
   man standeth on it unaided. It is the enemy of God, God seeketh to get
   it into his power, He sendeth forth scouts, and those are the men who
   announce the word of God, and the warnings of conscience which God
   giveth: if the man through the light of his reason is led to recognise
   all that he had formerly sought he waxeth wrathful, and wisheth to
   leave all evil and that is a cause of evil. Thus now God persecuteth
   him, punisheth him with mental and external sufferings, taketh from him
   all his goods and greed; He killeth him entirely, and draweth all away
   from him which is deadly and not of God; thus is earthly attraction
   crushed and conquered by God. Those are blessed who thus die in God, as
   St. John says, "Blessed are those who die in God" (Rev. xiv. 13).

79.

   That worketh a great love which through the sufferings of our Lord is
   kindled by the burning fire of the Holy Ghost. This love forceth the
   volition, to suffer all pains that are forthcoming in atonement for the
   One who loved man so strongly. He now turneth all things to bring
   suffering upon him, and that which He cannot bring to him in action he
   bringeth to himself mentally: the will then bringeth before him all the
   torments suffered by our Lord, all the sufferings endured by the
   saints, and all that men must yet suffer. He uniteth himself in this
   with complete affection, and the wish to have suffered all things, or
   to suffer more. This love maketh the will receptive of all the
   advantage which is to be found in the agony of our Lord, and sufferings
   of all saints and pious souls. The following is to be read anent the
   holy Martin, that he, although not executed with the sword, hath none
   the less not lost the martyr's crown, because he suffered in the wish,
   what the martyrs suffered in the flesh, and because it gave him pain
   that he could not suffer bodily. [171] In this way many good people are
   able to be companions of the martyrs, when they have willed to suffer
   all their martyrdoms; but they must also bear in mind, that when they
   tramp in the footsteps of our Lord and of the saints they must endure
   in the love of God all sufferings that cross their path, however cruel,
   and with a firm will wish that they may suffer more. Thus can a man
   partake of all suffering.

80.

   But on the other hand, he who demandeth suffering and yet always
   attempteth to avoid it in action doth not present himself in the form
   of our Lord, which showeth that his desire was not complete (earnest),
   and he will therefore not take part in all sufferings. Man must, so
   long as he can work anything, work the work prescribed by God; first,
   when he hath accomplished all things, and desireth nothing more, God
   worketh instead of himself, and then for the first time beginneth the
   godly work in entirety, because the man in fact is freed from his own
   works. He beareth also now, though sinless, a suffering; what he can
   suffer he suffereth, what doth not occur to him he seeketh to suffer;
   love maketh the sufferings of strangers as his own, not one but all.
   Were God to impart him less than if he had suffered all he would not
   have rewarded him justly; but this is to be understood as essential and
   not as accidental reward, because essential reward is that one
   understandeth and loveth the pure truth. If in a perfect will is also
   an unbounded love of absolute truth, if absolute truth is the greatest
   reward, then the wish with love of suffering gains all essential
   reward. The object is simple, therefore also the reward. Some truly
   say, when a man hath come to complete truth he cannot increase it,
   because complete truth is simple, and he who once hath it hath it
   completely, and nothing can be wanting to him. True it is that in
   respect to the difference in number one cannot increase it, but in its
   simplicity and purity one can increase it so long as we live in time;
   the simpler and purer we are, the more we are able to understand
   absolute truth. If the man in the first attempt after absolute truth
   seeth not at once the highest pinnacle of pure internal simplicity, he
   can also not at once understand this truth; and as he increaseth in
   this singleness of purpose his reward will also increase. As his
   volition separateth itself from things to the one unity, which is God,
   after an essential manner, he therefore also increases in absolute
   reward; according as his spirit is united with God so also increaseth
   his absolute sanctity. When the will getteth into the condition that he
   increaseth in absolute reward, then he embraceth all good works with
   love, all virtues and sufferings, and perfects it all with charity
   (love). By love therefore he draweth forth the best fruit, and adheres
   to it, for it is God the fountain of all things; he compelleth God with
   this true love to place him as a co-worker in all good works in an
   essential manner. Whoever were to know what a hidden treasure he is
   bringing to himself by an humble and devoted will, would not stand on
   his own will, because with love he arrives at that point to which
   angels' reason does not reach, in the beginning without end. The
   beginning of God, which is, however, without beginning, no one can know
   except God. Him can the will alone love in the past, and therefore God
   must reward him, as if he himself had always been, and as if he had
   always loved.

81.

   We can here make use of the expression of Augustin, "What one doth not
   understand one doth not love," [172] Thus love springeth from the
   understanding. If, therefore, the eternity of God is beyond
   understanding, is it therefore impossible by volition to love His
   eternity? I answer, love is twofold, one springeth from the
   understanding, and with this will one cannot love Him in His eternity;
   the other ariseth from faith, and loveth Him for the sake of His
   eternity. As we can and must believe that God is without beginning and
   without end, so also can the will love Him entirely from the light of
   faith, as an always existing and everlasting God. According as the will
   loveth Him, so also will He reward it; He loveth it indeed as if it had
   been an eternal will, and equal will be the recompense. As Christ says,
   "With the same measure that ye measure out, will also be measured back,
   and a heaped up and overflowing measure will they give into your lap."
   Equal measure is equal love; God giveth not less to the soul than she
   loveth Him; He will measure out to her according to the summit of His
   love. The heaped up, overflowing measure is God Himself; when also the
   will understands God then more superfluity remaineth to her than she
   can comprehend; and in this godlike abundance the will hath more joy
   than in that which it comprehendeth. But God rewards the will with
   eternal love, for the will doth not rouse itself to love God, but the
   Holy Ghost is the love from which the will loveth, and as the Holy
   Ghost is without beginning or end, so also it loveth God without
   beginning and without end. But the will loves God thus in the love of
   the Holy Ghost only, when it has raised itself above the beginning and
   end of the creature world. If this is the case, then it goeth forth in
   the unending God, with whom there is neither beginning nor end. Then
   man loveth all in an essential manner, and will accordingly be
   rewarded. All suffering that hath been suffered and will yet be
   suffered, he wisheth may also occur to him; for the sake of the
   sufferings of Jesus Christ let him add his own sufferings, so that the
   suffering and reward may be complete. St. Paul had this love when he
   said, "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is troubled, and I am not
   troubled? Yes, I am all things to all men. that I might make you all
   holy." [173]

82.

   The third suffering abideth in the soul, when the spirit of man is
   seized by the godly Spirit, with the mantle of His love wound round it,
   so that he dependeth to it. The band of divine love is then so
   delightful to him that all other things revolt him; and if he meeteth
   anything, which is not from the love of the Holy Ghost, it paineth him.
   All that he seeth and heareth, and which is not divine, is a sad and
   unspeakable scathe.

83.

   When David saith, [174] "The righteous will not be troubled," that
   referreth to temporal things, which make him troubled and unclean; but
   this suffering of a clean soul is caused by all things that are not
   God, and it thereby causeth the soul to purify and retain purity. When
   anything sinful crosseth the spirit, it is of necessity that it should
   be met with bitterness; this bitterness (hostility) driveth away the
   unholy onslaught, and retaineth the soul in its cleanliness. If the
   soul is free from all sinful impressions, if it standeth in the form of
   divinity, then it findeth itself in the righteousness in which God had
   originally formed it. It has arrived there through grace, and it is not
   troubled, for it hath passed beyond where grief can reach, it hath
   united itself with that which is all rapture and joy, he revelleth, and
   no more sadness can approach him. Thus meaneth David when he saith,
   "The righteous cannot be troubled." Secondly, nothing could trouble the
   righteous unless God were stolen away; thus only the tearing away of
   his righteousness could trouble him. But so long as man liveth in time
   so long will he be persecuted, therefore he feeleth trouble and
   bitterness. But this trouble doth not injure the righteous, but rather
   holdeth him in his righteousness. Thirdly, the righteous man will also
   not be troubled when he existeth in the complete enjoyment of his
   righteousness. But this cannot be completely the case in time, but only
   in eternity. So long, therefore, as man is here below, so long his soul
   must be troubled, because he hath no power to enjoy his righteousness;
   but this trouble is also not destructive, but driveth him towards this
   complete righteousness. When there is hunger and thirst there is also
   trouble. Fourthly, the righteous man will not be troubled when his soul
   is given up to God, when all worldliness hath disappeared, and divinity
   standeth alone before him, in which he findeth joy. But if the man
   throweth a glance on his neighbour of human kind and seeth his misery
   he must then suffer with him. But such trouble doth not hinder the
   righteous, for righteousness springeth from charity. In the Gospel it
   is written of Jesus, "Jesus shuddered in spirit, and was troubled."
   This was sympathy which he had for us. Fifthly, the righteous soul is
   unable to be troubled when all created objects are set aside and it is
   wrapped in the uncreated, which is God, where it alone findeth peace
   and sufficiency. But when the interest of the man concentrateth itself
   in created objects, which lead the soul not to God, then the spirit is
   troubled, because its sanctity is not fashioned and formed in that
   shape, he is, therefore, not able to be quiet *of spirit; but even this
   disturbance of the spirit is not destructive, for it gradually driveth
   away all things that, are not God, until God finally alone abideth with
   him. But at the same lime when perchance a man hath for a time peace
   through the perception of reason, that is not complete rest but a
   natural one.

84.

   This peace had also the pagans; they put away all earthly things that
   they might enjoy bodily peace; therefore also the spirit was of joy,
   although not its true joy. But this natural joy should be avoided, and
   it should alone be sought in God; those who stand by this joy are more
   like unto the Gentiles than like Christ. It is possible, and also often
   happeneth, that a man putteth away all to have peace of spirit without
   obstacles, and therefore it is rather difficult to separate these
   natural pagan men from the Christian and divine; both of them avoid all
   earthly things, both have a similar life; they love poverty and
   venerate the Creator; both of them attempt externally to imitate the
   picture of our Lord; but inwardly they are unlike. Objects and forms
   are the aims of the natural men, they find their happiness in them; but
   the divine seek their happiness in the humanity and godliness of
   Christ, they come out from Him and they return to Him. But let no man
   attempt to find the difference between these two men, unless he hath
   divine light in his nature and is directed in spirit, lest he should
   attach sins to holy people. The best side should be looked on in all
   intentions, and no one should be pronounced wicked of whom the
   rottenness cannot here be known.

85.

   But if some one loveth a natural man (man of the world) as if he were a
   divine man, will God then reward him as if he were a true one? I
   answer, It is better that one should love a man who bears the name of a
   Christian, if he is good or bad, than that one should dislike and hate
   him, as God rewards love in any form more than if a man is without it;
   but love must be general, not directed to one individual nor
   intermittent. Who at the same time can love a worldly or ordinary man
   strongly, and yet keep God in view, hath but an impeded and forced
   love, for all attachments make an obstacle. But the man who loveth all
   his neighbours equally, without personal interest, hath a true love,
   which God will also reward. But if a man loveth another as if he were
   good, when he is not so, it would be unjust for God to reward him,
   because as love springeth from understanding, if that understanding is
   an unjust one so also is the love, therefore God rewardeth him not. It
   also happeneth that a man loveth another because he holdeth him as
   good, whilst another holdeth him as bad. God then gives more reward to
   the man who held him as wrong, if justly, than to the man who held him
   as right. Thus love becometh better according as it is lighted by
   divinity, and the more it is drawn away the less in value it becomes.
   It certainly does occur that one man is drawn to another by blind love,
   holding him for righteous when it is not the case; whereas another,
   being better awakened, does not act to him according to blind love, but
   loveth him according to his worth. This love is much nobler than the
   first blind love, God accordingly rewards it more thoroughly.

86.

   But a reversed view may here be taken. Thus love doth not come entirely
   from the understanding, but also from faith. Therefore if one man hath
   more faith than another, and loveth him from that reason, because he
   holdeth him for good, should God not reward him more than another who
   hath not so much faith, and therefore doth not love him so much? I
   answer, The man hath only so much real faith as he obtaineth from
   divine light; to whom the light faileth, faileth also the faith. He who
   hath learnt to know divine truth best hath also the truest faith; but
   no one hath this except the man who hath understood essential truth,
   and who loveth from complete faith; this love is the most useful and
   most worthy. It also happeneth that a man trusteth another, holding him
   to be righteous, and loving him, but he doth not exactly understand why
   he loveth him; whilst another hath no trust in him, doth not hold him
   as righteous, and doth not love him, and understandeth what he should
   believe; and this hostility is nobler and more useful than that love,
   for God doth not reward a false faith when some one believes a thing
   that is not true; it is, on the contrary, almost faithlessness and
   sinful, rather than perfection; such love is not rewarded by God which
   springs from faithlessness. Thus Jesus said, "Take heed of false
   prophets, that come to you in sheep's clothing, but are inwardly raging
   wolves." They are false prophets who point to themselves as respectable
   (righteous), but who are really bad; and holding such men as good is
   rather unrighteous than righteous. Jesus adviseth us to defend
   ourselves from them, therefore it is bad. In the latter time false
   teachers shall rise up and preach, but he who believeth in them showeth
   that he is not good. He who liketh the superficially righteous man
   (hypocrite), and holds him for good, is certainly not righteous
   himself; he is certainly, as a teacher saith, "a fool, that believeth
   anything or everything."

87

   The light of faith is above all understanding; a man requireth no
   reason with faith, for he is raised above it. Men without understanding
   believe truly; God giveth them therefore the same reward as to the
   awakened. Is it, therefore, not necessary to understand to believe
   because faith is simple? Understanding is twofold; one is required for
   faith, the other is faith itself. The first is that a man should
   understand the articles of faith and the teachings of Christ. Whosoever
   knoweth the teaching and liveth according to it, in him the fruit of
   the doctrine is revealed by which he will be known, because the tree is
   known by its fruit; if the man cometh to understanding, then he at once
   beginneth to believe, and it is certain that the faith is true. But the
   men who have not lived according to the doctrines of our Lord, also do
   not know the fruits of His teachings, and they also therefore do not
   know whether they believe rightly or wrongly. They believe only from
   hearsay, therefore their faith is not complete, and they can easily
   err. As now their faith is incomplete, so also is their love. The
   second understanding which perfect men have is united with faith (is
   one); when a man acteth on the doctrines of Christ in life, bringing
   all things into one, and this one into unity of knowledge in the light
   of faith, that is God, and where faith springs from faith, he
   penetrates into the hidden darkness of the pure divinity. His
   understanding consisteth then in suffering, but his faith is working
   with God. But this faith in God worketh on the understanding with
   burning love, this love feeleth it, and this feeling is its
   understanding; what is beyond it is true faith. Then the man is a true
   Christian, but not before. Who then, therefore, is not led forward by
   the doctrine of Jesus Christ, and by all virtue, until he without any
   distinction is brought to this oneness, he cannot have real faith; his
   faith is of course manifold, but it is not true; therefore also his
   love, which springs from it, is not right

88.

   The best and only way to arrive at the true faith, which contains all
   love, is that man should be monopolised with the doctrines of our Lord,
   and lead a holy life; that he should be illumined with the teachings of
   Jesus, in order to know the awakening spirit and believe it. From this
   faith man must love without any attachment, then he loveth not men
   alone, but also the image and life of our Lord, which love is always
   good and meritorious. Even if such a man who were loved in the image
   and life of our Lord were still hampered with defects, he would not
   lose the reward. Christ said, "He who taketh up a prophet in the name
   of a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet." He who discovereth
   that a man walketh on the road of Christ he should love him as a
   follower of Christ, he then receives the reward of a disciple of
   Christ. We should not only look on the image but also on the works, for
   there is the greatest importance. He who loveth outside the life of
   Christ his love is of the world or worldliness; this is wasted and bad;
   that which is not a pure truth and love is a pain to the spirit. He who
   will not be deceived with false lights and unrighteous loves must
   strive that his spirit may be emptied of all falsity, and that it may
   be inflamed by the love of the Holy Ghost. If the spirit standeth in
   purity everything showeth itself in its true light; if it is good the
   spirit remaineth in peace, if it is bad it loseth its peace: thus good
   men recognise all things through peace. In a pure heart nothing can
   err, evil must show itself, for that heart is like unto a clean
   looking-glass, in which one seeth all things which are held before it,
   and as everything is it showeth to the eye. So it is also with a pure
   spirit, which is united with God. God permitteth nothing to approach
   which could destroy the unity, what is of no value there will be thrown
   out. Pure men require not to see all things with difference of form,
   for appearances cause disturbance if one attendeth to them long;
   fallacy is treated by external forms, and the evil spirit clothes
   himself in them. In simplicity let a man take note of his heart, and
   let God work without any external images in this way the eye of reason
   remaineth clean and unmixed, and no mistake can occur; the evil spirit
   liketh not this purity, and flieth from it. The man who hath purity
   remaineth untempted by evil, for God worketh in a pure soul, and
   illumines it with the flame of divine love, and imparts His love to it.
   If the powers of evil feel this they avoid it as a thief flieth from
   the light in a house where he will steal. The sorcery of the devil is
   nothing else than a mixing up with sense and worldliness and its
   images, but if one avoideth these, if one throweth away all material
   images and interests then the enemy findeth no space.

89.

   But if man turn again to the senses he is befooled by the evil spirit,
   thus those men who live a life of the senses cannot long persist
   without a fall, for they have no refuge where they can stay. For God is
   the refuge of all men, and God doth not work in the senses nor in
   images, but He draweth away all the senses, and driveth out all images,
   and then he is the dwelling-place of man and his refuge against deadly
   falls. But those who do not stand withdrawn from their sensuality and
   stripped of all images they are on the verge of a fall, and it is a
   wonder if they still keep their footing. For this reason it is an
   absolute necessity that the senses be withdrawn into the highest reason
   and penetrate therewith into God, and thus you stand alone without a
   deadly fall. And if it were possible that the senses were always drawn
   in under the highest reason, and the reason were directed to God, a man
   thus placed would stand always untouched by death, and without venial
   sins, and would stand in original justice, in which God created the
   first man. Again, they who live in the senses cannot guard themselves
   against sins, and this is because all sensuality is death-giving,
   therefore they who live in sensuality live in death, and thus they
   cannot guard themselves against death, hence they must needs fall. The
   spirit that is raised above all things in God draweth up the senses
   with it, and turneth them as it is also turned, and maketh them subject
   to itself as it also is subject to God; and while there is obedience
   the spirit hath rest in God; but when the senses are rebellious in
   disobedience to the spirit the spirit is troubled and deprived of
   peace, and this is then a suffering of the spirit.

90.

   The fourth suffering that a man must have is in God. This happeneth
   when all unlikeness falleth away from the spirit through grace, and it
   is placed in a likeness when it is receptive of the work of God, and in
   this receptiveness God worketh, and the spirit suffereth the work of
   God.

91.

   There are two kinds of work in the soul, one is of reason and of grace,
   the other is essential and divine.

92.

   The first or reasonable work is when the reason courseth through all
   things with the distinction of images (ideas or conceptions), and
   findeth God in all things. For God is a good that hath flown into all
   things, and thus man offereth himself to serve all things that he may
   find God; and the reason calleth this an inworking reason, and it
   giveth to each thing its own proper thing that belongeth to it, and
   thus it findeth God in all things. For whoso could take things in the
   order, according to which God hath ordained them, would find God in all
   things. The cause why we do not find God in things is that we seek
   things without order, and with disorder we lose God in things. Now, as
   order is a matter of finding, so disorder is a matter of losing; but if
   the reason seeketh all things in proper order, it findeth a present
   God. And when it findeth God it forgetteth things and cleaveth to God
   alone, and it perceiveth that all things are unquiet, and that perfect
   rest is in God alone. Therefore she lifteth herself above all things
   and seekest God out of all things; and this cometh to pass by a working
   out of the images which she hath drawn into herself from creatures. And
   thus she freeth and strippeth herself from all creaturely imagery, and
   as the reason before drew in the images of creatures, that she might
   find God in them, so now she worketh off all the images of creatures
   that she may find an unveiled God. This, therefore, is called a working
   off reason, [175] for she casteth off all things, that she may be free
   from all works, and God be alone the working Master. This is also all
   of grace in an angelic light.

93.

   After this the godlike work goeth on; that is, when the reason has cut
   off all images of creatures, has unclothed itself from all created
   images, God cometh into the soul and placeth Himself in the stead of
   the working reason and worketh His works; in this case the reason is
   called a passive or suffering reason, for it suffereth what God
   worketh. And then and thus all works are worked in one work, and as all
   things are enclosed in God, so He encloseth all things in one work that
   He worketh in the soul. The soul hath received the eternal Word, when
   it is free from all else. If it hath entered the divine essence with
   ardent love it begetteth the Son in the Godhead.

94.

   This divine birth in the soul is, however, twofold, an internal and
   external. It is the internal, when the soul embraced by the divine
   light penetrateth into the divine heart, its heart and all its powers
   become a nutriment of the divine heart, so that it loseth at once its
   heart and its powers, and hath nothing more of them. But in return God
   giveth to the soul His heart and His powers, and the heart of the soul
   now is a godlike heart, and no more a human heart. Thus the heart
   liveth always in an ardour of the divine fire, is penetrated by it, so
   that it becometh faint through love, for human power faileth, so that
   all the members fall into weakness. And must needs be that this come to
   pass, for where the divine power shall work human power must become
   lost, as this is only inclined to error and sin. If this defective
   power is no more at hand God can pour out His power into the soul
   without hindrance. Therefore God sendeth the fire of His love into the
   heart that all evil may be consumed, all disorderly powers may be
   ordered, all defects may be healed, and an unlikeness removed. Then all
   things lose their proper form, and are transformed into godlike forms,
   as also Jesus said, "Behold I make all things new." [176] This taketh
   place also when God dwelleth in the soul, for thus He ordereth
   everything as He will have it, and maketh new that which is old.
   Therefore St. Paul admonisheth us, "Put off the old man and put on the
   new man, which is shapen after God, in holiness, justice, and truth."
   This old man is put off and a new man put on when God the Father
   begetteth His Son in the soul. By this birth He reneweth all that was
   fallen, and all cometh back again to its first nobility. Thus, then,
   man is created after God in holiness, justice, and truth, and is called
   a new man. Christ saith also, "If ye do not become as little children
   ye cannot enter the kingdom of God;" that is, unless a man be born
   again as a child of God he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. And as
   he is newly born internally so it cometh to pass also outwardly; the
   external man is transformed, so that he is deiform, or like in form
   unto God. As he had before offered hie members instruments of luxury,
   so now he devoteth them to the service of God in holiness and justice.
   As everything is new inwardly so it becometh also outwardly; as this
   divine fire inflameth the heart and consumeth inwardly all unlikeness,
   ordaining the powers for the best, so also the divine fire passeth over
   to the body, consumeth all sinful leaning, driveth it on to virtue and
   to all good works, and thus it arriveth at its original justice; he is
   called a new man who is created in righteousness after the likeness of
   God.

95.

   Thus this man is passive or suffering in this birth, and God worketh
   all in him. For this reason Jesus also said, "None is good, save God
   alone." No man's work is good, save that from God and by God. It is
   also the best thing that a man be free from all work, and let God alone
   work and suffer it If God is the working and man the passive being,
   then all is placed at rest in him. God's working in the soul is
   essential; it springeth out of the divine essence, and is fulfilled in
   the essence of the soul. By the divine work all evil that was ever
   exercised is rooted out of the soul. Punishment and guilt are remitted
   to the man, for when God revealeth Himself to the soul, all besides
   must give way, and God be alone let reign; and nothing can reign there
   save God.

96.

   Thus is it possible that man be preserved from deadly and venial sins,
   and this in a sixfold way.

97.

   First, man is overwhelmed with divine power, whereby all his powers are
   strengthened! If the divine birth is fulfilled in the essence of the
   soul, it passeth over into all its powers; each receiveth divine power
   to resist all that is against God. It is needful that the divine power
   work in us, for by human strength no one can resist sins. But man
   receiveth this divine power, when all his powers turn to the divine
   birth, which is brought about in the depths of the soul. But if each
   power seeketh to accomplish its work without turning to the birth, they
   cannot receive godly power. For whoso wisheth to receive anything from
   another, he must be nigh unto him; therefore all the powers must be
   united, waiting for the divine birth. All that bringeth good men to
   fall is mostly, that they take too much interest in unnecessary things,
   and thereby scatter their powers. The more they do this the more the
   divine power escapes them, and thus they must fall. Holy Writ saith,
   "The just falleth at least seven times a day," that is, he doth not
   constantly perceive the divine birth in the soul. If the powers were to
   always persist in this they would all always receive this divine power,
   and would be warded from falling.

98.

   Further, the second way to be preserved from venial sins is, that the
   lower powers be always subordinate to the higher powers; this keepeth
   man in his original justice, as Adam was. He fell by the lower powers
   turning away from the higher. This happeneth still to-day. When man
   turneth to sensuality without hearkening to the higher powers he
   falleth. But if he exerciseth an external work, while he listeneth to
   his reason, he doth not fall, nor doth his work bear the name of
   sinful. Though it is brought about by the senses, yet the reason hath
   more part in it than the senses. Therefore it is called a reasonable
   work, and is a virtue. Let him who doth not wish to fall look with
   every work, whether internal or external, to his higher reason, then
   his work becometh a virtue, and is more divine than human. Man's works
   are sensual when blindly brought about without the reason. Through
   these man falleth, and these man ought not to have. Therefore is it
   also said: "It is right that a man be free of all work, namely, of
   sensual works, which are sinful." Such works are man's proper own, but
   virtuous works are called God's works. God is alone the source of all
   good, therefore whatever good must be worked must spring from Him and
   end in Him. If the senses stand under the highest powers, and thus
   stand under God, they can obtain divine power to resist all defects.

99.

   Thirdly, man is guarded from venial sins when his will is entirely
   united to the divine will, and when the reason heareth always God's
   will in all things, and liveth according to it. By this giving up of
   one's own will man is capable of receiving all divine gifts; he is
   strengthened thereby to be able to resist everything that is not God.
   God only dowereth His will in us, and what is not His will is also not
   able to receive any gift. If the will of God liveth entirely in him,
   and if he have entirely given up his own will, he is able to receive
   all gifts; what he asketh God will he also receive. If he asketh that
   God may shield him from all sins against His holiest will, this taketh
   place, but if he still fall into a fault, this happens according to the
   will of God, not, however, as if the will of God consented to faults,
   but God inflicteth it on him, that man may learn to know his weakness,
   and may be put down in true humility, through which alone he can keep
   his footing against every fall. It is very hurtful if a man findeth his
   will without God's will, and holdeth himself to be somebody with much
   complacency. That this complacency may be killed out, and man come to
   the knowledge of his own weakness, God suffereth even a good man to
   fall, that he may be guarded from a greater fall. If now man is
   entirely dead to his own will, God becometh his life; not he liveth any
   more, but God liveth in him, and guardeth him from deadly falls.

100.

   Fourthly, a man is guarded from venial sins when he always employeth
   the proper measure in all things; whoso always observeth the proper
   measure in his words and works will not fail. For faults and sins come
   from this, that you take too much or too little, and through too much
   or too little arise faults. [177] He who doeth that which he ought to
   do, and omitteth what he ought to omit, to him God is alway present,
   and God is always in the midst. Of this also the Gospel speaketh:
   "Jesus stood in the midst of His disciples." [178] Jesus, that is
   salvation, stood in the midst of His disciples, that is the disciples
   reconciled by grace, received their salvation from the midst of the
   Godhead. Whoso were to have such order, that he would always take the
   medium or the right measure in all his words and works, would always
   find God. Yet it is said, we must draw near to God with mediation? This
   drawing nigh to and finding God is twofold. One lieth in the creature
   and in its works, here God is found in mediation, for God is in the
   midst of all creatures, and whosoever cometh there with his works
   findeth God. The other finding is that of God only, apart from all
   creatures in His simple being. But he only findeth God thus, who is the
   man freed from all creatures and their works. But if man busieth
   himself with creatures and their works, in creation, he must keep
   measure in the midst, and arriveth thus at God through God. He must
   observe this, if he wisheth to be freed from defects and to find God
   outside all things.

101.

   Fifthly, man is guarded from venial sins by voluntary poverty, inward
   and outward; for true poor men stand alway in suffering, and if such
   men fall with a fault or defect, their suffering removeth it directly.
   A teacher saith "Be careless about the defects of poor people, for what
   lacketh in them, is cancelled again by poverty." [179] Poverty also
   protecteth specially against faults, for if any one beggeth a poor man
   for a gift, he cannot give it, but doth not commit a fault in refusing
   the beggar; whereas they who have temporal goods, if they are begged
   and they refuse, these sin. They show a want of pity and a hardness,
   and this is a sin. Poverty is farther good against sins, for temporal
   possession giveth much occasion thereto; and since poor men are free
   from this property, they have no such motive for sin and can also
   exercise no sins, as a heathen teacher already said: "When the cause
   faileth, the work also faileth." [180] Nothing is without a cause, and
   nothing can lead astray him who hath not any cause. Lastly, poverty
   also guardeth against sins, for when a man hath parted with all things
   he hath a perfect will to all virtue, and whoso willeth all virtue he
   opposeth all and every vice; a perfect will hath the power to resist
   all vices, it exerciseth all virtues and denieth instantly all sins. If
   he yet faileth, it is not his will, therefore no sin, for sin taketh
   place with the will, as St. Austin saith: "If there were no will, there
   would be no sin." [181] Therefore he who hath not given up all things
   hath also not the power to will all virtues, for so long as man is
   hindered by outward things, he cannot bring forth virtue in acts. But
   whoso hath turned all to virtue, getteth the power of the will, to will
   all virtues and to abandon every vice. They who are tainted with
   temporal possession cannot do this.

102.

   Sixthly, a man in guarded from temporal sins by his own heart when it
   is inflamed with the love-fire of the Holy Ghost, for this consumeth
   all unlikeness in man, making him pure from all sins. Love and hatred
   cannot subsist together. If a man loveth, he must leave all that
   begetteth hatred, namely, sin; as long as he now loveth, he liveth also
   without sin. St. Paul saith, "Charity is a consuming fire." [182]

103.

   If now the love of the Holy Ghost destroyeth all sin, they who have
   received the Holy Ghost live always free from sins, for the gift that
   the Holy Ghost giveth abideth eternally; and St. John also saith,
   "Whoso is born of God cannot sin." [183] But I say that man must be
   viewed in two lights, according to his internal and external man. The
   gift of the Holy Ghost is received by the internal man this also
   destroyeth sins in the interior, and guardeth him farther from sins;
   but the outer man, on the other hand, is not receptive of the gifts,
   and will also not receive them, and therefore never be without venial
   sins; he is somewhat like unto time; but time is? fluctuating and
   defective, therefore also must his senses be defective and inclined to
   sin. Thus, therefore, the external man cannot live without venial sins
   save when his senses are drawn into the internal man, and this is found
   in God; so long as this lasteth, man is without sin, outwardly and
   inwardly, for whatever defects the sins may yet have are consumed by
   the fire of love. Were it possible that the senses were always drawn in
   by the internal man, he would always be united to God, and man would
   remain without sin; and for this reason, because sin is nothing else
   than a turning away from God and a leaning to creatures. But if the
   whole man be turned to God, no sin is brought to pass as long as this
   lasteth; but if he returneth to himself to the service of the senses,
   he will certainly fail again, and this without paying attention to the
   spirit, so that man forgetteth his duty entirely, and committeth faults
   and sins. But if man accomplisheth all his works, outwardly or
   inwardly, according to the statutes of his reason, lighted up with
   divine light, he would seldom fall into a sin; he would refer all his
   doing and suffering to the praise of God. This is worked by the ardent
   love of the Holy Ghost, which entirely inflameth him, driveth away all
   darkness, and enlighteneth him, so that he can accomplish all for the
   honour of God; it giveth him power to do all things, to give up all
   things that are against God, and to obtain all that is godly. This
   goodness of the Holy Ghost filleth him also with goodness, so that he
   receiveth all from the Holy Ghost The goodness of the Holy Ghost
   penetrates his heart and all his members, and filleth each; whatever
   was bitter and harsh in them must give way; and there abideth with man
   only goodness, which shieldeth him from all the bitterness of sin.

104.

   If such a man really committeth a sin from forgetfulness, and
   perceiveth it, he suffereth pain again more than another who were to
   commit a venial sin: for this reason, because he who hath tasted
   sweetness is more disgusted at bitterness than he who hath not yet
   tasted the former. So is it also with the men who love God; all things
   are bitter to them on account of the great sweetness of the Holy Ghost;
   what to another man is joyful is to such a man painful; nothing is
   dearer to him than to love God in the most perfect manner. Moreover,
   all is bitter to a good man; but this bitterness leadeth to purity and
   greater love, and God inflicts on many good men that they falter, in
   order to be brought to greater purity, and to love Him the more
   earnestly. Paul saith, "Where sin abounds there doth grace abound."
   [184] Paul also saith, "All turneth to good to them that love God."
   [185] For whoso loveth another giveth him the best. God loveth them who
   love Him, therefore giveth He to them always the best. If now such a
   man fall into a sin, this doth not come to pass through what is best,
   as though sin were a good, but it showeth to man his weakness, and
   bringeth him to humility; nor is this because sin enlighteneth man to
   self-knowledge; it is the cause that what is hidden should be made
   known. The light enlighteneth the darkness of sins, and thus then man
   attaineth unto the knowledge of his weakness, submits himself humbly to
   God, and to men for the sake of God. In this humility he standeth
   secure against falling, which would have brought him scathe. This is
   occasioned by the love of the Holy Ghost; through this all his defects
   are shown to man, it boweth him down before God, and guardeth him from
   sins. Thus, then, must man suffer and endure all if he wisheth to
   attain unto a God-seeing, poor life.

105.

   The fourth way that leadeth to a poor life is when man hath exercised
   himself in all virtues, with inner consideration of the Passion which
   our Lord hath undergone, by which he attaineth unto true rest and to
   the peace of heart. This is the fourth way to a perfect, poor life,
   which therefore is nothing else than a careful ward over all that which
   happeneth to man, whether spiritual or bodily, that he may receive it
   in such wise that the spirit doth not suffer scathe, but find itself
   always immediately in simple purity.

106.

   To this end man must turn himself away from all outward exercise, and
   exercise himself inwardly; for all outward exercise goeth over to en
   azures, all inward to God. Whoso therefore wisheth to find God must
   enter into himself, and seek Him within. Whoso seeketh God without may
   indeed find Him with creatures, but in this lieth not true blessedness;
   but if he seeketh God in himself, he findeth Him apart from all
   creatures, in His pure, simple essence, and in this lieth true
   blessedness. St. Austin saith: "Lord, when I knew Thee first, I knew
   that Thou art a good that hath entered into all creatures; and I gave
   myself up to the service of all created things, in order to find Thee
   in them, but so long as the seeking lasted my heart was alway in
   unrest. But, when I knew Thee better, I knew that Thou art a good that
   is without all creatures; I took myself apart from them, in order to
   find Thee alone outside all creatures. Then was my heart quiet; for it
   is disquieted save if it rest in Thee, for Thou hast created us solely
   for Thyself." [186]

   [174] This passage cannot be found in the Psalms, but in Proverbs xii.
   21. "There shall no evil happen to the just." Schmidt, p. 130, infers
   from the whole passage, that the soul united with God will, according
   to the author, never more be troubled; it is raised above all that is
   changeable, &c. In this case Denifle thinks that Schmidt can only have
   read the passage from Scripture, for from the context follows exactly
   the contrary.

   [175] Compare Eckhart, 19. 29; and Eckhart the Younger, in the Tractate
   of the Working and the Possible Reason, edited by Preger, in Sitzung's
   Berichten of the Phil. Hist. Class of the Royal Bavarian Academy of
   Sciences, 1871, p. 185. But Preger overlooked the fact that already,
   more than twenty years earlier, attention had been directed to a Low
   German MS. of this Tractate (Four Writings of John Rusbroek, Hanover,
   1848, p. xxxvi.), which ought to have been made the basis of the
   restoration of the text, because, as Preger himself confesses, the
   Tractate is not of High but Low German origin. Respecting the Possible
   and Working Reason, see further, Greith, p. 163. The same theme is
   treated in an unpublished sermon of the Mystic, Helwic von Germar, "Der
   lesemeister was zu Erforte." With reference to the doctrine itself, C.
   Werner (Der Heilige Thomas von Aquino, iii. 656) finds in it a false
   Gnosis, and Steffensen (Gelzer Protest. Monathsbl. xi. 274) says it is
   to be reckoned as the boldest speculation that can be found among the
   German Mystics. But Denifle pronounces that neither one nor the other
   of these views is true. He conceives that this view is based on the
   scholastic doctrine of the intellectus agens and the contemplatio pura.
   According to the Schoolmen, if a contemplatio without images of the
   fancy is possible, and if the intellectus agens has, according to the
   nature of light, the special function to enlighten the fancies or
   Phantasmata and to make what is intelligible in them perceptible to the
   mind, then in this case, during the contemplatio, the intellectus agens
   remains quiescent, and the essential imageless knowledge is then
   imparted to the spirit, without any co-operation on its part, as St.
   John of the Cross teaches (p. 515, ed. Mad. 1672), and from whence can
   it be imparted save from God? This view, continues Denifle, has nothing
   to do either with the views of William of Paris or Henry of Ghent
   respecting the intellectus agens, nor with those of Alexander of
   Aphrodisius and the Arabian peripatetics. On the contemplatio pura see
   Sandaeus, l.c. p. 144. 2 foll.

     __________________________________________________________________

  The fourth way that leadeth a man into a poor, perfect, contemplative life, is
  a zealous avoidance of all that which can please men, whether it be spiritual
  or bodily, so that whatever it be, it be so received as not to mis up the soul
  with it.

107.

   All things are fluctuating and unquiet, and whoso busies himself with
   things, his heart is always in unrest. In unrest we find not God, for
   He dwelleth only in peace; therefore he who wishes to find Him must
   have a heart at peace. St. Austin saith: "There be many that seek God,
   but there be few that find Him, for they seek Him all without, where He
   is not." [187] People say, however, God is everywhere; why should we
   then not find Him? The ground for this is, because God is in the
   interior, but we are without. God is a Spirit, we are in the body; God
   is separated from all creatures, but we are burthened with these; God
   is a pure, simple good, we are changeable; God is the Light, we are
   darkened through sin; God is Love, we are still tainted with hatred.
   This unlikeness maketh that we cannot find God. Would we find Him, we
   must have likeness in order to seek Him. As God is in the interior and
   in the spirit, separate from all creatures, simple and pure, the purest
   Light, which is Himself, full of burning love, thus must we be if we
   would find God. We must enter our heart, turned away from all external
   works; we must have a pure mind, freed from all images and forms, pure,
   simple, enlightened by divine light, inflamed with the love-fire of the
   Holy Ghost. In this likeness we find the pure Godhead who giveth us
   rest in which we enjoy Him immediately. Thus, then, man standeth in
   pure poverty, where he can behold God.

108.

   If man turneth to himself in this true purity, perceiveth the state of
   his heart, and seeketh God in it, all springeth up in him that maketh
   him like unto God. If he was before turned outwardly, he becometh now
   inward; if he was fleshly minded, he is now turned to the Spirit; if he
   clove to creatures, he is now free; if he was darkened, he is
   enlightened; if he was cold in godly love, he is now inflamed with the
   divine love-fire. He must seek all inwardly if he would find the right
   treasure which enricheth him with all the gifts of God. Whoso
   neglecteth this seeking in his interior also neglecteth the gifts of
   God which He imparteth. The senses are not receptive of the best gifts
   of God, for they are fluctuating and changeable, but the godly gifts
   remain everlastingly; to him who is wavering God imparteth them not.
   Therefore, if we would be receptive of these gifts, our senses must be
   withdrawn into the inner man, which hath likeness with God. Here the
   best gifts are imparted by the Father ot Light, with whom there is no
   shadow of turning; therefore all His gifts are unchangeable. We also
   must receive them in unchangeableness; but the senses do not possess
   this, for they have likeness to time. Only the internal man possesseth
   this property, who is created after the likeness of God in holiness,
   justice, and truth; he receiveth the unchangeable gifts of God, and God
   giveth him His best. As a lord doth not readily give over his rule and
   his property to a spendthrift, who can neither tend it nor protect it,
   so God doeth also with His own, which is in the hands of such
   spendthrifts, who squander all you give them, and keep nothing. No
   perfect gift, and no gift of God should be intrusted to external
   sensual men, for one would be deceived. God findeth no place in him
   which would make him receptive of the gifts; and even if God would
   gladly give His gifts to sensual men, He can it not, because He would
   find no suitable place for them. He would be a fool who would build a
   house on flowing water. But this water is the senses, which hurry on
   with time, and therefore God giveth not His gifts to them.

109.

   Externally good men can gain reward in heaven no doubt through good
   works, but that with time they come to this, that they receive the
   complete gifts which God offers to those, which turn into themselves,
   and give heed unto him, cannot be. Of this also David saith: "I will
   hear what God the Lord saith unto me. He will give peace to His people
   and those who are converted." [188] Some people kill their senses, fast
   and watch, and flagellate themselves much. This is very good; but he
   who wishes to annihilate his senses must first altogether set aside all
   material interests; he must live within himself; he must triumph here,
   then he can destroy his senses, or subdue them to obedience. Then the
   man revolveth in his inmost spirit; he seeth God truly. Then he maketh
   himself receptive of divine power, with which the senses are always
   forced to be obedient; in no other way can they be tamed. This strength
   the man only receives inwardly, and thereby he draweth in and
   controlleth the senses. But when this divine power faileth, the senses
   also remain unconquered. This we find to be the case with many men, who
   have much striven, and at the last have failed, and only because the
   senses were not controlled in the manner in which divine force
   controlleth them. Therefore the strength faileth them and they fall.
   Had Adam drawn back on his inward control, and not regarded his senses,
   he would not have fallen. But as he obeyed his senses his fall was
   certain; for he had not the divine power that holdeth upright. Such
   also is the case with all men who do thus, they must fall.

110.

   Why, it will be objected, doth God form men, so that they are exposed
   to fall? If he wished to hold back man, he should have fashioned him
   otherwise. But as it is, having soul and body, with a free will to
   direct himself whither he wisheth; he directed himself to his weakest
   side, that is to his senses, and therefore he met the most dangerous
   result, "death." Had he directed himself to the right direction, he
   would have seized the truth, and been forewarned of the fall. But as he
   followed the senses, he could not perceive the truth, and fell; for the
   senses cannot receive divine truth, only the inward man can do that,
   which is formed like God in truth. This then happeneth to all those who
   give way to the senses; this is right and just, and no one should
   wonder that God lets the others fall and go to destruction. It is the
   justice of God that must allow these men to fall, unless they turn
   themselves from their senses to their reason, then God must help them,
   for then they are receptive of His help. If the senses were the easier
   vessels of divine gifts, then certainly all men would be easily great
   saints, and could easily bear resistance to the sins, which the whole
   power of the senses would be used to restrain; but it is not so, they
   fall, and the greater the sensuality the greater the fall. God's
   justice damns these men, who always favour the senses, and live on in
   their sensuality. He wisheth strongly to give them eternal salvation,
   but they are unable to receive it, for they are dead and must die, and
   are therefore not vessels of life; for death and life cannot exist
   together.

111.

   He who wisheth to receive eternal Beatitude, must receive it inwardly,
   in the inner man, which is formed like God. When Christ saith, "Who
   believes, and is baptized, is saved;" [189] this also is to be
   understood, as applying to the case, when the faith is seized by the
   reason and not by the senses. The hearing takes a form, but the reason
   receives the life of faith. Enlightened are only those who have faith;
   they are baptized in the waters of repentance, and are twice born in
   the spirit of truth. Those who live on in their sensuality cannot have
   faith. They of course can say, I have faith; many a man saith, I have a
   hundred pounds of pfennigs, when he does not possess one. Such men are
   exactly like unto the Pagans, and are only Christians by name, which
   does not make them blessed. Christ also saith, "Not every one who saith
   to Me, Lord, Lord! will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who
   carrieth out the teachings of God." Not every one who saith, "I
   believe," but the one who doth good works. "For faith without works is
   dead." The senses bring death, faith is our blessedness, and brings
   eternal life. Therefore it must be received in the reason, and not in
   the senses; what the senses take up, they also lose. It is therefore
   necessary, that the essence of faith should be impressed upon the
   reason, for this alone retaineth faith. When the senses are commanded
   by the inward man, then he receives the impression of divine faith,
   which begetteth salvation.

112.

   Now a question could be asked: If the senses cannot receive the highest
   truth, why should they then be drawn to the inward man, so that he then
   be capable of seizing the truth? I answer: Where two have to receive a
   gift, the weakest must always attach itself to the strongest; what is
   defective in the one. must be set right by the other. One person is
   body and soul, therefore they have but one movement; but the soul
   cannot work without the body, therefore the soul would not be able to
   receive godly divine gifts, unless it was unhindered by the senses. But
   it is not hindered, when it is absolutely drawn away from all external
   matter; thus only therefore can it receive complete truth, and that
   reception it divides with the senses, and in this way the senses
   receive it, not as external independent objects, but as such which have
   given way and are controlled by the inward man. From here it penetrates
   into the senses, and forces them to follow.

  For three reasons man should draw in all his senses.

113.

   This decidedly is the most useful bond, with which to bind the senses;
   that they are entirely drawn inwards and bound together with divine
   truth, to the praise of God. Without this union no man can defend
   himself from fall. Why alone should the inward man be receptive of
   divine truth, and not also the senses? Now the inward man can also not
   receive divine truth, unless united with the senses; so the reason is
   only this, that, because there is only one God, and one faith, so also
   must a man have this unity, and also in his oneness he is receptive of
   his God, because oneness believes truly in God. Giving it more than one
   God and then believing, would render it impossible for a man to be
   inwardly united. But as there is only one God, and one faith, so also
   the man must be one, if he wisheth to be receptive of God and of true
   faith. So much as this unity faileth him, so much faileth him of God
   and of true faith; it is therefore necessary, that the senses should be
   drawn more together in inward unity. The more the senses are directed
   outwards, the more dissipated they are in their works; the more
   numerous these are in interest, so much the more are men inwardly
   impeded, to receive divine simple truth, which is God. Thus God is
   unable to be united with the changeable, external worldly man, for God
   is unable to be received in what is disunited, He can only enter inward
   unity. It standeth written by the prophets, "I will lead thee in the
   desert, and speak to thy heart;" [190] viz., the desert of internal
   unity, where all alien beings and all things are united in one, where
   alone the eternal Word is spoken from the fatherly heart; and only in
   this solitude can the unity be heard. If also God speaks His Word to
   the man engrossed with material interests it cannot be heard, for if
   two speak at once we cannot hear them; one must be silent. Just the
   same also is it when God speaks to the soul, then all creatures and all
   things must be as nothing to the man, and alone the Spirit, the Word of
   God, must be heard.

114.

   It is usual when the master speaketh that the servant listeneth; but if
   the servant is uncivil to the master, he often waxeth wrathful. So it
   is also when God speaketh His Word, all things must be as silent to the
   man, and he must hearken to the divine Word, through which all wisdom
   is learnt; whoever disturbeth Him, acteth with insolence to Him. But a
   man disturbeth God when he giveth way to his senses without giving
   attention to His advice; over this He waxeth wroth. These sensual men
   never again come to the love of God, because they fail in respect to
   Him. The greatest honour and love man can show to God is to hear His
   Word; but those who favour the senses cannot hear it, and cannot
   therefore love Him with a true love. He who wisheth this divine love
   must tame his passions, and have his powers at peace to be able to hear
   what God speaketh in the soul. In the mutual conversation which the
   soul holdeth with God there existeth the divine love; God loveth the
   soul with this love, and the soul returneth the love, and thus it will
   be loved justly. Jesus also saith, "He who loveth Me, heareth My Word;
   "those, therefore, who will not hear His Word can also not love Him.
   The origin of divine love is in the eternal word that God speaketh to
   the soul; he who ignoreth this faileth also in the foundation of divine
   love. Therefore man should direct all his senses and strength to the
   divine Word, so he will come to the true origin of divine love, he will
   drink from this fountain, will be intoxicated with love, and be swept
   away with it.

115.

   Love is his entire life, he can do nothing else than love; love hath
   penetrated him, without love he desireth nothing more. Who attributeth
   anything else than charity to him doeth him injustice, for he is all
   love; who attempteth to take it from him must also take his life.
   Charity is his life and death. If he liveth, he liveth from love; if he
   dieth, he dieth from love; let the lot fall, as it will, love is always
   one with him, and he is one with love. What happeneth to love also
   happeneth to him, what disturbeth love also disturbeth him. Whatever
   form it take is but love. Whosoever giveth to him giveth to charity,
   whosoever taketh from him taketh from charity. Whosoever wisheth
   closely to work with God bringeth it to completion through such
   God-loving men; for if these men receive a work of love, then love is
   uppermost, which is the consuming fire of divine love. Whosoever
   feedeth such men, feedeth also God. Thus when the food has been
   received love draweth the force of the food and consumeth it in the
   fountain of divine love, so that man knoweth not that he hath eaten.
   Everything cometh back with men of love to its origin, from which it is
   gone forth; he is the nearest to this origin, and what is accomplished
   by it must come through him. Whosoever showeth love and faith to such a
   man will not, most probably, be lost by God. For love and faith raised
   to this higher love cannot be overlooked by God. But those who love God
   are never loved by man, except by those who are worthy of His love. It
   is also quite natural that they are much hated, for very few are worthy
   of or equal to them. Of these St. Paul says, "The world is not worthy
   of them," therefore they must bear much insult.

116.

   But this unworthiness is the dignity of love; for worldly honour is
   contemptible to them, and whosoever showeth such to them offendeth
   them. The honour of such men is the cross of Jesus Christ, from this
   love hath its honour and dignity. St. Paul saith, "Let all worthiness
   be far from me, except through the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; "in
   this lies all my honour and worth. But the cross of Jesus Christ
   leadeth to, and is, degradation, hatred, persecution, and every form of
   agony. From these things love gaineth honour and notoriety. But
   whosoever wisheth to be honoured, and pleaseth himself with a worldly
   position of honour, showeth immediately that he hath not divine love;
   divine love wisheth equality with nothing except that which it loves.
   And whosoever attempteth to draw it away from this equality maketh it
   sick, but whosoever handleth it with equal love filleth it with
   pleasure; from this one knoweth those who possess divine love.

117.

   This true divine love springeth from the fatherly heart when God
   speaketh His eternal Word to the soul; for in this conversation the
   Spirit of the Holy Ghost poureth forth and floodeth the soul and all
   its forces, so that all that it breatheth forth is love (charity). But
   this causeth the senses to be drawn under the control of the inward
   man, silencing their forces, whilst the inner love gloweth in God--in
   this condition the soul expandeth whilst the eternal Word is
   pronounced, from which all complete love springs. It is, therefore,
   necessary that he who wisheth to attain a perfect life must take up an
   inward life, and drag himself away from all external sheen. When he has
   drawn himself from this, and freed himself from the numbing influence
   of temporal greed, and even if he had the desire to perform a material
   work, desireth also that he would find no property remaining to him,
   then, but not till then, can he live a complete internal life, and give
   God scope to work in him.

118.

   The highest perfection of poverty of spirit is then in being entirely
   devoted to God so completely that a man doth not perceive the doings
   and defects of outside creatures, so that God can finish His perfect
   work, which maketh eternal beatitude. Concerning this Christ also said,
   "If thou wilt be perfect, sell all thou hast and give it to the poor."
   Jesus doth not mean that all men without temporal goods are perfect, He
   only meaneth that to be perfect a man must have no property, and only
   give attention that God worketh direct on the soul. Thus a poor life
   leadeth to the highest perfection, and poverty is the only condition
   that permitteth a man to forget all creatures, and to hear God alone.
   As a master gives the first place to his disciple, and expecteth him to
   give only attention to him, and not to another, so also is poverty the
   highest place that God can give to His friends that they can better
   approach Him. But whosoever being poor, interesteth himself in external
   things, hath a poverty more damaging than perfect. God hath directed
   him to an inward life, and only to give attention to Him; but when he
   giveth his attention to outward attractions, he faileth in duty to God,
   and doth not live in the true road of humility of spirit. He who
   wisheth to serve man must have material goods, but whosoever wisheth to
   serve God must not make gain, but seek God. Therefore also Jesus
   directed Mary Magdalene that she should castaway all valuable objects
   that she might the more easily be , able to direct herself away from
   creatures, and look at Him without obstruction. Therefore He also
   saith, "She hath chosen the better part," that is, she left the service
   of creatures, for she left temporal gains, and turned towards God,
   where the best part is to be found. But whosoever possess temporal
   things must give attention to creatures, serving them according to the
   will of God, for through this devotion they reach God; but those who
   are free from property have only God in view, and that is their best
   means of reaching God. On this question Seneca saith, "Whosoever
   wisheth to have the freedom of poverty must be an absolute pauper, or
   live as a pauper." But that man is truly free if he is able to turn
   himself to the best part, which is God. But this only occurs by
   complete freedom from all temporal things. All temporal things are by
   their nature heavy, therefore they drag down the mind which is occupied
   with them. But whosoever is free from them hath a tendency which
   draweth him to God, and thus true freedom is to be found in the absence
   of all material goods.

119.

   It is quite a right sequence that they who are laden with the temporal
   should blame freedom, for they possess it not, and you cannot praise
   what you have not. True freedom consisteth in an internal life, and in
   perceiving God in it; but if man turneth to creatures he is bound by
   them, and this fetter hindereth him from going back to God in his
   interior. Therefore is it good to remain always very much in yourself,
   in order to be unfettered and unhindered by creatures, that we may
   always find God in the depths of the soul, where His real dwelling is.

120.

   Therefore man should hush his senses and attend to his inner man,
   because the man's best part is within; for it is quite fair that a man
   should serve the best and should give up evil. But whoso favoureth the
   senses is like a man who leaveth his best friend and giveth himself up
   to the public enemy; for what is sensual is the enemy of the soul;
   whoso serveth sense serveth his public enemy, and it is quite just that
   he should receive the reward of his enemy, that is, everlasting death.
   The senses bring death, their reward is therefore also death. No one
   giveth what he hath not therefore also they cannot also give life, for
   they have it not. It came to pass thus with Eve. When she saw that the
   fruit was good she desired it, ate thereof, thus served her sensuality,
   and death was also her portion. So it happeneth still to all who favour
   their senses. If she had followed her reason she would have gone apart
   from her senses, and then life would have been her portion. It is often
   said that God damneth man; God damneth no man, but man damneth himself,
   for by this, that he turneth himself wilfully to sensuality and liveth
   to it, he chooseth death and abandoneth life. If God were to give him
   life he could not take it, for he hath no place in which he could
   receive life. All is death that is in him, and death alone is his
   portion. Even if God were to give life to such sensual men, he would
   act like him, who throweth his best good that he hath, into impure
   dung. All that is sensual is impure dung; as also St. Paul saith, "I
   have held all things as dung." Life is the best good that God hath.
   That He may also not be mocked He giveth it to no one who liveth down
   in the senses. Let not therefore any one wonder if God doth not grant
   much grace to him; he ought not to do so. It doth not agree with his
   order to give divine good to them that serve sensuality. It is also
   said: If God would, He could give many gifts to man. This is true; and
   if man were to turn to grace God might give them to him, and he could
   take them; but as he turneth whither there is no grace, God also ought
   to give him none. Therefore, if man wisheth to receive grace from God
   he must subdue his senses and turn himself inwardly to God, then he can
   receive it. But if he liveth in the senses, if he turneth away from
   God, God also will grant him no grace. For whoso wisheth to receive
   something from another must be with him from whom he receiveth it;
   therefore all that is in man must be inwardly with God, as God is in
   our interior. Only thus can the divine grace be received.

121.

   Thirdly, man should draw his senses inward, for as often as he turneth
   outward, the senses receive something impure and bring it with them,
   which also sullieth the soul. Whoso, therefore, wisheth to abide always
   pure, let him keep his senses within, let him not suffer them to roam
   outwardly, then his heart remaineth pure and in peace. Whoso stirreth
   about too much outwardly, even if it be for good works, cometh never to
   the true peace of his heart, for the peace of God surpasseth all sense;
   whoso liveth on in the senses cannot attain to it. What is sensual is
   all unstable and unquiet. Therefore he who wisheth to attain to true
   rest must go apart from the senses and enter into the depths of the
   soul where stability is; there alone he findeth rest and peace. But let
   no one hold himself already so free and perfect that he fancy it would
   not harm him if he were to turn to outward works that are not necessary
   for him. I say to thee, that no one is so holy in time that he can
   remain as pure if he turneth himself outwardly as if he tarrieth in his
   interior, and for this reason, because if man, without any necessity,
   turneth outwardly, he turneth to creatures as they are found there. But
   if he turneth himself to his interior he turneth to God, as He dwelleth
   there. But no one can remain as pure with creatures as with God; the
   creature is unfruitful, but God fruitful. But he who denieth that this
   turning outwardly is hurtful, proveth that he hath never yet come to
   true internal piety. Some very small thing causeth pain to the eye, and
   we must take great heed and be provident if it is to remain clear. But
   a far smaller thing can injure the internal man, and you must take much
   more heed than with the outer eye if it is to remain always pure. All
   that is outward is impure; but if the senses turn thither they take up
   the impure with themselves, and if they come back again into the
   interior they bring this with them, and thereby trouble the heart. It
   is therefore meet and right, if man keepeth himself alway in the
   interior, that his heart may remain always pure. Internal life
   belongeth to a pure poor life. Whoso turneth himself without goeth
   aside from the way of true poverty; for poverty of spirit is a matter
   of the inner man, but the external man hath it not. Poverty of spirit
   is a pure, simple being, and whoso is outwardly cannot be pure. Purity
   is begotten of God inwardly, and not of creatures. If, therefore, thou
   wishest to keep poverty of spirit, live inwardly.

122.

   But no man can be really poor save if God maketh him poor, and God
   granteth this only to him who is inwardly with Him, from him He taketh
   away all that is ungodly. He who is the most internal is also the
   poorest, and he who is the poorest is also the most internal.
   Inwardness and poverty stand on the same degree. Whoso hath not left
   outer things in inwardness hath evidently not yet obtained true
   inwardness, for true inwardness is an entire abnegation of oneself and
   of all things; not only inwardly but outwardly must we suffer it to be;
   all must give way to true inwardness. Into it the will entereth into
   the most perfect will of God, and uniteth itself then with God; what
   God willeth for the best, the true internal will willeth also. But that
   is the most perfect will of God that we follow Jesus Christ in His life
   and in His teaching. This was the voice of the Father to the Son, when
   St. John baptized Him: "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well
   pleased: hear ye Him." "In whom I am pleased," this means that all the
   good pleasure of the Father is alone in the Son; and therefore it is
   the highest will of the Father for them that follow Him, to follow His
   Son as closely as possible. He said further: "Hear ye Him," this is a
   sign that it is His will for us to follow His teaching. But the life
   and the teaching of our Lord are outward and inward poverty, and the
   true will that penetrateth into God desireth this also. But whoso
   bringeth not his will to work, his will is not yet internal, nor is it
   yet united with the divine will. For from this, that the man is
   inwardly taken up and his will united with God's will, he will directly
   know what he ought to do or omit. God's will is only for him to follow
   Christ in life and in His teaching; and whoso followeth Him the closest
   is the most internal man, but whoso liveth most internally followeth
   Him also the closest.

123.

   Whoso attaineth to a poor life in this inwardness hath true poverty and
   no one else. It is needful that he who desireth to be right poor,
   should be so internally. Poverty without inwardness is like a king
   without lands or like a body without a soul, thus inwardness maketh
   man's life fruitful and well pleasing to God. Christ said also, "Unless
   the seed of corn falleth into the earth and dieth, it can bring forth
   no fruit." All things must die inwardly in us, and we in God, then we
   bring forth much fruit, that is, much life is born in us, which is well
   pleasing to God. Whoso doth not come thus into his interior, cannot
   also die internally or bring forth any fruit. The outward show of
   poverty hath no worth; the street beggars have also this show, but they
   are not on that account holy. Man must die inwardly in the ground of
   his soul; this belongeth to a poor life, in which perfection lieth.

124.

   It might now be asked: What is then an inward life, dead to all things?
   I give this answer: Man is then dead when he forsaketh all sin and
   obtaineth virtue, so that virtue becometh his very being. He is
   internal, when all that is outward is painful to him; he is poor, when
   his spirit is a mere instrument of God, so that God, without hindrance,
   can speak His Eternal Word in the ground of the soul. These three
   things stand on the same point, eternally, in the purity of a pure
   being genuine dying is unity, true unity is inwardness, and true
   poverty is unity. Christ said, "One thing is needful." This is needful
   if God is to work in the soul, that man should gather himself up in an
   internal, mortified, and pure unity. This alone is receptive of the
   work of God, and God can only work His most perfect in one, in this
   unity; whoso is most united is most receptive of God. When the heaven
   is clearest, the sun can best send out its rays through the air; so is
   it also, when the soul is quite simplified, the divine sun can spread
   out its splendour the most in the soul; it enlighteneth the soul with
   divine light. As much as the soul lacketh unity, so much it lacketh
   light; therefore also its working is in unity, for each thing worketh
   according to its nature; therefore the light, which is like unto God,
   worketh always in unity, and whoso turneth himself away from unity,
   turneth himself from the divine light. The highest perfection consists
   in this, that the soul be internal and united; whoso is and abideth
   eternally the most inward, increaseth most in perfection, he receiveth
   most the influx of the divine light, which enlighteneth his reason, to
   know the pure truth. Right knowledge of truth passeth on to unity; no
   man with scattered faculties, whose reason is occupied with the
   manifold, attaineth to true light, in which all divine truth revealeth
   itself. The light is simple, therefore also the ground must be simple
   if it reflects its splendour, for each thing must also find a place
   according to its value. It is therefore needful that he, who wisheth to
   have light should be internal and united, therefore also Jesus said,
   "If thine eye is single, thy whole body will be light." [191] Man's eye
   is the reason, if this is single, all that it understandeth is pure
   truth, and all its works are pure virtues.

125.

   What is not produced from a simple ground is all deception; therefore
   whoso doth not wish to be deceived, let him turn from the manifold to
   internal unity; no deception can be mixed up there. All that deceiveth
   man is that the phantasy forms too many things, and that it taketh
   these images to be the truth; the evil spirit can shut himself up in
   this, holdeth before him false images, and deceiveth him. He cannot
   reach a perfectly simple, pure ground, therefore also he cannot deceive
   the pure, simple man. He who attacheth weight to so-called visions, and
   busieth himself much with images, showeth that his ground is not simple
   or pure. For in a simple, pure ground, nothing is begotten save God,
   and what is like unto God. But God is invisible, raised above all
   images, therefore they are deceived who assume that they wish to see
   Him. What is produced in a pure ground is so fine and simple that no
   one can grasp it by images, and no one can speak of it; whoso knoweth
   the pure truth, he knoweth well that it is true, and maketh nothing of
   visions, especially at this time. For the truth hath been revealed in
   our Lord Jesus Christ, and whoso seeketh it outside Him and His
   teaching deceiveth himself, and also others. All that believe in this
   man are sick in faith, and have more in common with Antichrist than
   with Christ. They who live in Christ, and in whom He liveth, can hold
   and believe nothing else than Christ, and whatever else is revealed in
   them they hold to be false. Thus they alone remain undeceived by all
   falsity.

126.

   Nay, even a pure and simple man, of whose heart Christ hath taken
   possession must often resist a pure distinction of truth having a
   likeness to the God-like; he must do so in order to remain pure in his
   simplicity, that God may not be hindered in His working in him, which
   is raised above all the distinctions of truth by imagery. And even if
   they sometimes examine a thing by distinction, in order to be able to
   teach their fellow-men about it, yet as soon as they turn away from
   these works they loose the very image of the thing, return to Christ,
   and leave all the rest as it is, which keepeth them also in true
   purity. These men have the greatest labour and the greatest burthen
   that any one can have in time, for they must resist all that is in time
   and not God, they must overcome all with a heavy fight, all that is in
   them must be broken through and set aside. It happeneth indeed that
   some, who have a weak nature, or are burthened with sins, are so
   weakened that they must lie down sick, and can say with the loving
   soul, "Tell it to my Beloved, for I lie sick with love." [192]

127.

   The love of the Holy Ghost penetrateth all the members of man,
   inflameth them all with the love fire; and this fire burneth up all
   unlikeness, and maketh all things straight that were crooked before.
   Man fancieth that he will be entirely burnt up, and this is named the
   working and overwhelming love. And as something unlike is still in man,
   this love must work; but afterwards when working love hath worked off
   all unlikeness, a sweet love springeth up in man, and this is named
   passive love, which then suffereth in a calm and gentle rest what God
   worketh; and it worketh no more, but God worketh, and it suffereth. And
   now at length the soul is in an eternal entrance into God, and God
   draweth it with Himself, and maketh the soul one love with Himself, and
   thus man becometh entirely one love with God. Whoever would now give
   him a name would properly give him that of love, for nothing save love
   is in him. And those men do not trouble themselves with any vision, or
   with any strange ways, but only with simple, divine love. This is
   brought about by the simple, pure ground and foundation out of which
   simple, divine love springeth. In this is the greatest joy that exists
   in time, and the delight is not natural or contrary to truth, but it is
   God-like, and revealeth the truth, which is God. This rapture ought not
   to be blamed, for it is Irom God, and destroyeth all natural lust that
   is against God. But man should not linger with love because of this
   delight, so that he would love God on account of the delight; but he
   ought to love God for the sake of God, he must give up all delight, and
   cleave to God alone without any wherefore, and thus is his love
   perfect. For if he were to love God on account of delight, he would
   love Him in a natural way, or according to the love of creatures. And
   may God help us to love God in the most perfect manner.

       severiorem reddens; atque hoc est quod ait: iterum dico vobis,'
       quasi dicat," non solum quod modo dixi verum est, sed amplius etiam
       dico vobis, facilius esse camelum per foramen acus transire, quam
       divitem intrare in regnum coelorum . . .: [434]1
     * "Tum quia cupido divitiarum facit eus coacervari per fas et nefas;

       gulam, luxuriam, omniaque scelera." "Et iterum Christus enim
       adaugendo quasi corrigit id quod dixit." Dixi difficile esse

       . . . Quemlibet divitem accipias.: [435]1
     * "hanc autem" (divisionem); "operari in nobis solet vivus ille Dei

     * Apud homines hoc impossible est . . . Christumque voluisse
       sententiam suam magis et magis exaggerando confirmare. Primo enim
       simpliciter dixit, difficile esse divitem in regno coelorum
       introire; secundo dixit, facilius esse camelum, etc.; tertio,
       impossible omnino esse sed apud homines, non apud Deum.: [441]1
     * Bonum; quod in Deo vel in proximo diligam, diligendo faciam meum.:
       [442]1

       et vere plus quam humanum statum transire . . . ita ut ipse jam non
       sit ipse, eo duntaxat tempore quo Domino incipit altius inhaerere.:
       [445]1
     * Deus celsitudo humilium et fortitudo rectorum, qui per unigenitum

     * Ego sum ostium.: [452]1

       conspicitis, nolite despicere, quia fortasse quod superfluitas
       tenuissimae pravitatis inquinat, caminus paupertatis purgat: [453]1
     * Et sic transformatur quodammodo in Deum, quod nec cogitare nec
       intelligere nec amare nec memorari potest nisi Deum pariter et de
       Deo.: [454]1

       patet: [458]1
     * Illud quod unus videtur specialiter haberi inter homines,
