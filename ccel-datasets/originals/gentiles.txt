                                    Preface

   SOME years ago, a priest of singularly long and varied experience urged
   me to write "a book about God." He said that wrong and imperfect
   notions of God lay at the root of all our religious difficulties.
   Professor Lewis Campbell says the same thing in his own way in his
   work, Religion in Greek Literature, where he declares that the age
   needs "a new definition of God." Thinking the need over, I turned to
   the Summa contra Gentiles. I was led to it by the Encyclical of Leo
   XIII, Aeterni Patris, urging the study of St Thomas. A further motive,
   quite unexpected, was supplied by the University of Oxford in 1902
   placing the Summa Contra Gentiles on the list of subjects which a
   candidate may at his option offer in the Final Honour School of Literae
   Humaniores, -- a very unlikely book to be offered so long as it remains
   simply as St Thomas wrote it. Lastly I remembered that I had in 1892
   published under the name of Aquinas Ethicus a translation of the
   principal portions of the second part of St Thomas's Summa Theologica:
   thus I might be reckoned some thing of an expert in the difficult art
   of finding English equivalents for scholastic Latin.

   There are two ways of behaving towards St Thomas's writings, analogous
   to two several treatments of a church still standing, in which the
   saint might have worshipped. One way is to hand the edifice over to
   some Society for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments: they will keep
   it locked to the vulgar, while admitting some occasional connoisseur:
   they will do their utmost to preserve every stone identically the same
   that the mediaeval builder laid. And the Opera Omnia of St Thomas,
   handsomely bound, may fill a library shelf, whence a volume is
   occasionally taken down for the sole purpose of knowing what St Thomas
   said and no more. Another thirteenth-century church may stand, a parish
   church still, in daily use; an ancient monument, and something besides;
   a present-day house of prayer, meeting the needs of a twentieth-century
   congregation; and for that purpose refitted, repainted, restored,
   repaired and modernised; having had that done to it which its mediaeval
   architects would have done, had they lived in our time. Nothing is more
   remarkable in our old English churches than the sturdy self-confidence,
   and the good taste also lasting for some centuries, with which each
   successive age has superimposed its own style upon the architecture of
   its predecessors. If St Thomas's works are to serve modern uses, they
   must pass from their old Latinity into modern speech: their conclusions
   must be tested by all the subtlety of present-day science, physical,
   psychological, historical; maintained, wherever maintainable, but
   altered, where tenable no longer. Thus only can St Thomas keep his
   place as a living teacher of mankind.

   For the history of the Contra Gentiles I refer the reader to the folio
   edition printed at the Propaganda Press in 1878 cura et studio Petri
   Antonii Uccellii, pp. xiii-xxxlx. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) came to
   the University of Paris in 1245, and there for three years heard the
   lectures of Albertus Magnus, taking his Bachelor's degree in 1248. He
   returned to the University in 1253, took his Master's degree in 1257,
   and thereupon lectured in theology for two or three years, leaving the
   University in 1259 or 1260. He wrote the Summa contra Gentiles in
   Italy, under the pontificate of Urban IV (1261-1264), at the request of
   St Raymund of Pennafort. He went for the third time to the University
   of Paris in 1269, finally returning to Italy in 1271. Though the Summa
   contra Gentiles was written in Italy, there is reason to believe that
   the substance of it was got together during the Saint's second
   residence at Paris, and formed the staple of his lectures in the
   University. The more celebrated Summa Theologica was a later work.

   The Summa contra Gentiles is in the unique position of a classic
   whereof the author's manuscript is still in great part extant. It is
   now in the Vatican Library. The manuscript consists of strips of
   parchment, of various shades of colour, contained in an old parchment
   cover to which they were originally stitched. The writing is in double
   columns, minute and difficult to decipher, abounding in abbreviations,
   often passing into a kind of shorthand. Through many passages a line is
   drawn in sign of erasure: but these remain not less legible than the
   rest, and are printed as foot notes in the Propaganda edition: they do
   not appear in the present translation. To my mind, these erasures
   furnish the best proof of the authenticity of the autograph, which is
   questioned by S. E. Fretté, editor of Divi Thomae Opera Omnia (Vivès,
   Paris, 1874), vol. XII, preface iv-vi. An inscription on the cover
   states that the manuscript is the autograph of St Thomas, and that it
   was brought from Naples to the Dominican convent at Bergamo in 1354:
   whence its name of the Bergamo autograph.' Many leaves were lost in the
   sack of the convent by the armies of the first French Revolution; and
   the whole of Book IV is missing.

   The frequent erasures of the Saint himself lend some countenance to the
   omissions of his translator. Re-reading his manuscript in the twentieth
   century, St Thomas would have been not less ready than he showed
   himself in the thirteenth century to fulfil the Horatian precept, saepe
   stylum vertas.

   CHAPTER I--The Function of the Wise Man

   My mouth shall discuss truth, and my lips shall detest the ungodly
   (Prov. vii, 7).

   ACCORDING to established popular usage, which the Philosopher considers
   should be our guide in the naming of things, they are called wise' who
   put things in their right [1] order and control them well. Now, in all
   things that are to be controlled and put in order to an end, the
   measure of control and order must be taken from the end in view; and
   the proper end of everything is something good. Hence we see in the
   arts that art A governs and, as it were, lords it over art B, when the
   proper end of art B belongs to A. [2] Thus the art of medicine lords it
   over the art of the apothecary, because health, the object of medicine,
   is the end of all drugs that the apothecary's art compounds. These arts
   that lord it over others are called master-building,' or masterful
   arts'; and the master-builders' who practise them arrogate to
   themselves the name of wise men.' But because these persons deal with
   the ends in view of certain particular things, without attaining to the
   general end of all things, they are called wise in this or that
   particular thing,' as it is said, As a wise architect I have laid the
   foundation' (1 Cor. iii, 10); while the name of wise' without
   qualification is reserved for him alone who deals with the last end of
   the universe, which is also the first beginning of the order of the
   universe. Hence, according to the Philosopher, it is proper to the wise
   man to consider the highest causes.

   Now the last end of everything is that which is intended by the prime
   author or mover thereof. The prime author and mover of the universe is
   intelligence, as will be shown later (B. II, Chap. [1]XXIII, [2]XXIV).
   Therefore the last end of the universe must be the good of the
   intelligence, and that is truth. Truth then must be the final end of
   the whole universe; and about the consideration of that end [3] wisdom
   must primarily be concerned. And therefore the Divine Wisdom, clothed
   in flesh, testifies that He came into the world for the manifestation
   of truth: For this was I born, and unto this I came into the World, to
   give testimony to the truth (John xvii, 37). The Philosopher also rules
   that the first philosophy is the science of truth, not of any and every
   truth, but of that truth which is the origin of all truth, and
   appertains to the first principle of the being of all things; hence its
   truth is the principle of all truth, for things are in truth as they
   are in being.

   It is one and the same function to embrace either of two contraries and
   to repel the other. Hence, as it is the function of the wise man to
   discuss truth, particularly of the first beginning, so it is his also
   to impugn the contrary error. Suitably therefore is the double function
   of the wise man displayed in the words above quoted from the Sapiential
   Book, namely, to study, and upon study to speak out the truth of God,
   which of all other is most properly called truth, and this is referred
   to in the words, My mouth shall discuss truth, and to impugn error
   contrary to truth, as referred to in the words, And my lips shall
   detest the ungodly.

   CHAPTER II--Of the Author's Purpose

   OF all human pursuits, the pursuit of wisdom is the more perfect, the
   more sublime, the more useful, and the more agreeable. The more
   perfect, because in so far as a man gives himself up to the pursuit of
   wisdom, to that extent he enjoys already some portion of true
   happiness. Blessed is the man that shall dwell in wisdom (Ecclus xiv,
   22). The more sublime, because thereby man comes closest to the
   likeness of God, who hath made all things in wisdom (Ps. ciii, 24). The
   more useful, because by this same wisdom we arrive at the realm of
   immortality. The desire of wisdom shall lead to an everlasting kingdom
   (Wisd. vi, 21). The more agreeable, because her conversation hath no
   bitterness, nor her company any weariness, but gladness and joy (Wisd.
   viii, 16).

   But on two accounts it is difficult to proceed against each particular
   error: first, because the sacrilegious utterances of our various erring
   opponents are not so well known to us as to enable us to find reasons,
   drawn from their own words, for the confutation of their errors: for
   such was the method of the ancient doctors in confuting the errors of
   the Gentiles, whose tenets they were readily able to know, having
   either been Gentiles themselves, or at least having lived among
   Gentiles and been instructed in their doctrines. Secondly, because some
   of them, as Mohammedans and Pagans, do not agree with us in recognising
   the authority of any scripture, available for their conviction, as we
   can argue against the Jews from the Old Testament, and against heretics
   from the New. But these receive neither: hence it is necessary to have
   recourse to natural reason, which all are obliged to assent to. But in
   the things of God natural reason is often at a loss.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER III--That the Truths which we confess concerning God fall under
   two Modes or Categories

   BECAUSE not every truth admits of the same mode of manifestation, and
   "a well-educated man will expect exactness in every class of subject,
   according as the nature of the thing admits," as is very well remarked
   by the Philosopher (Eth. Nicom. I, 1094b), we must first show what mode
   of proof is possible for the truth that we have now before us. The
   truths that we confess concerning God fall under two modes. Some things
   true of God are beyond all the competence of human reason, as that God
   is Three and One. Other things there are to which even human reason can
   attain, as the existence and unity of God, which philosophers have
   proved to a demonstration under the guidance of the light of natural
   reason. That there are points of absolute intelligibility in God
   altogether beyond the compass of human reason, most manifestly appears.
   For since the leading principle of all knowledge of any given
   subject-matter is an understanding of the thing's innermost being, or
   substance -- according to the doctrine of the Philosopher, that the
   essence is the principle of demonstration -- it follows that the mode
   of our knowledge of the substance must be the mode of knowledge of
   whatever we know about the substance. Hence if the human understanding
   comprehends the substance of anything, as of a stone or triangle, none
   of the points of intelligibility about that thing will exceed the
   capacity of human reason. [4] But this is not our case with regard to
   God. The human understanding cannot go so far of its natural power as
   to grasp His substance, since under the conditions of the present life
   the knowledge of our understanding commences with sense; and therefore
   objects beyond sense cannot be grasped by human understanding except so
   far as knowledge is gathered of them through the senses. But things of
   sense cannot lead our understanding to read in them the essence of the
   Divine Substance, inasmuch as they are effects inadequate to the power
   that caused them. Nevertheless our understanding is thereby led to some
   knowledge of God, namely, of His existence and of other attributes that
   must necessarily be attributed to the First Cause. There are,
   therefore, some points of intelligibility in God, accessible to human
   reason, and other points that altogether transcend the power of human
   reason. [5]

   The same thing may be understood from consideration of degrees of
   intelligibility. [6] Of two minds, one of which has a keener insight
   into truth than the other, the higher mind understands much that the
   other cannot grasp at all, as is clear in the plain man' (in rustico),
   who can in no way grasp the subtle theories of philosophy. Now the
   intellect of an angel excels that of a man more than the intellect of
   the ablest philosopher excels that of the plainest of plain men
   (rudissimi idiotae). The angel has a higher standpoint in creation than
   man as a basis of his knowledge of God, inasmuch as the substance of
   the angel, whereby he is led to know God by a process of natural
   knowledge, is nobler and more excellent than the things of sense, and
   even than the soul itself, whereby the human mind rises to the
   knowledge of God. But the Divine Mind exceeds the angelic much more
   than the angelic the human. For the Divine Mind of its own
   comprehensiveness covers the whole extent of its substance, and
   therefore perfectly understands its own essence, and knows all that is
   knowable about itself; but an angel of his natural knowledge does not
   know the essence of God, because the angel's own substance, whereby it
   is led to a knowledge of God, is an effect inadequate to the power of
   the cause that created it. Hence not all things that God understands in
   Himself can be grasped by the natural knowledge of an angel; nor is
   human reason competent to take in all that an angel understands of his
   own natural ability. As therefore it would be the height of madness in
   a plain man' to declare a philosopher's propositions false, because he
   could not understand them, so and much more would a man show exceeding
   folly if he suspected of falsehood a divine revelation given by the
   ministry of angels, on the mere ground that it was beyond the
   investigation of reason. [7]

   The same thing manifestly appears from the incapacity which we daily
   experience in the observation of nature. We are ignorant of very many
   properties of the things of sense; and of the properties that our
   senses do apprehend, in most cases we cannot perfectly discover the
   reason. Much more is it beyond the competence of human reason to
   investigate all the points of intelligibility in that supreme excellent
   and transcendent substance of God. Consonant with this is the saying of
   the Philosopher, that "as the eyes of bats are to the light of the sun,
   so is the intelligence of our soul to the things most manifest by
   nature" (Aristotle, Metaphysics I, min. l).

   To this truth Holy Scripture also bears testimony. For it is said:
   Perchance thou wilt seize upon the traces of God, and fully discover
   the Almighty (Job xi, 7). And, Lo, God is great, and surpassing our
   knowledge (Job xxxvi, 26). And, We know in part (I Cor. xiii, 9). Not
   everything, therefore, that is said of God, even though it be beyond
   the power of reason to investigate, is at once to be rejected as false.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4] Kant's distinction between understanding and reason is not to be
   looked for in St Thomas, nor in his translator. St Thomas frequently
   uses the two terms indiscriminately: when he does distinguish them, it
   is inasmuch as understanding is intuitive, reason discursive.
   Understanding thus is the higher faculty. Understanding, not reason, is
   ascribed to God and the angels.

   [5] This argument will sound superfluous to most modern ears, content
   as men now are to register and argue phenomena, without regard to
   essences and substances, or altogether disbelieving in such things in
   themselves.' We have thousands of practical electricians; but who knows
   the essence of electricity? Even if molecular science shall ever
   conduct us to an accepted theory of the ultimate constituents of
   matter, we can scarcely hope thence to deduce the phenomena even of a
   pebble or one grain of sand. They are likely to prove complex beyond
   human calculation. The only essences that we know, and can use as a
   basis of deduction, are those which answer to certain abstract
   conceptions, as triangle,' fortitude,' 'sovereignty.' Starting with
   implicit confidence in the dicta of Aristotle, and lightly landing in
   conclusions by a priori methods, mediaeval philosophers generally had
   no idea of the vast complexity of nature and of their own ignorance of
   physics. We know more physics than they did, and we know our own
   ignorance better. We stand stupefied and bewildered before the
   intricacy and vastness of nature. And if nature is so far unknowable to
   us, how must God transcend our knowledge? This St Thomas recognises (B.
   IV, Chap. I). Not the mystery and unknowableness of God needs to be
   brought home to the modern mind, but the fact that anything can be
   known with certainty about God at all.

   [6] Measured objectively, that is the higher degree of intelligibility,
   which it takes a higher intelligence to understand. It contains more
   matter of understanding.

   [7] What the man might more reasonably suspect would be the fact of the
   thing having been divinely revealed by the ministry of angels. There is
   the whole difficulty of faith, not in the thing revealed, e.g.,
   transubstantiation, but in the fact of revelation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER IV--That it is an advantage for the Truths of God, known by
   Natural Reason, to be proposed to men to be believed on faith

   IF a truth of this nature were left to the sole enquiry of reason,
   three disadvantages would follow. One is that the knowledge of God
   would be confined to few. The discovery of truth is the fruit of
   studious enquiry. From this very many are hindered. Some are hindered
   by a constitutional unfitness, their natures being ill-disposed to the
   acquisition of knowledge. They could never arrive by study to the
   highest grade of human knowledge, which consists in the knowledge of
   God. Others are hindered by the needs of business and the ties of the
   management of property. There must be in human society some men devoted
   to temporal affairs. These could not possibly spend time enough in the
   learned lessons of speculative enquiry to arrive at the highest point
   of human enquiry, the knowledge of God. Some again are hindered by
   sloth. The knowledge of the truths that reason can investigate
   concerning God presupposes much previous knowledge. Indeed almost the
   entire study of philosophy is directed to the knowledge of God. Hence,
   of all parts of philosophy, that part stands over to be learnt last,
   which consists of metaphysics dealing with points of Divinity. [8]
   Thus, only with great labour of study is it possible to arrive at the
   searching out of the aforesaid truth; and this labour few are willing
   to undergo for sheer love of knowledge.

   Another disadvantage is that such as did arrive at the knowledge or
   discovery of the aforesaid truth would take a long time over it, on
   account of the profundity of such truth, and the many prerequisites to
   the study, and also because in youth and early manhood, the soul,
   tossed to and fro on the waves of passion, is not fit for the study of
   such high truth: only in settled age does the soul become prudent and
   scientific, as the Philosopher says. Thus, if the only way open to the
   knowledge of God were the way of reason, the human race would dwell
   long in thick darkness of ignorance: as the knowledge of God, the best
   instrument for making men perfect and good, would accrue only to a few,
   and to those few after a considerable lapse of time.

   A third disadvantage is that, owing to the infirmity of our judgement
   and the perturbing force of imagination, there is some admixture of
   error in most of the investigations of human reason. This would be a
   reason to many for continuing to doubt even of the most accurate
   demonstrations, not perceiving the force of the demonstration, and
   seeing the divers judgements of divers persons who have the name of
   being wise men. Besides, in the midst of much demonstrated truth there
   is sometimes an element of error, not demonstrated but asserted on the
   strength of some plausible and sophistic reasoning that is taken for a
   demonstration. And therefore it was necessary for the real truth
   concerning divine things to be presented to men with fixed certainty by
   way of faith. Wholesome therefore is the arrangement of divine
   clemency, whereby things even that reason can investigate are commanded
   to be held on faith, so that all might easily be partakers of the
   knowledge of God, and that without doubt and error. [9]

   Hence it is said: Now ye walk not as the Gentiles walk in the vanity of
   their own notions, having the understanding darkened (Eph. iv, 17, 18);
   and, I will make all thy sons taught of the Lord (Isa. liv, 1, 5).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [8] Metaphysica, quae circa divina versatur, answers pretty well to
   what is now called natural theology. In the order of sciences, then,
   natural theology comes last in philosophy, and presupposes a knowledge
   of all the rest. Ethics therefore do not presuppose natural theology,
   but are presupposed by it. It follows that ethical conclusions should
   be first reached by ethical reasonings, not by theological. This point
   is further explained in my Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 123-125.

   [9] It is true, absolutely speaking, that, without revelation, mankind
   might take their theology on trust from philosophers, relying for their
   spirituality upon philosophic experts, as upon legal experts for the
   maintenance of their proprietary rights. But then we should expect of
   the Providence of God a greater concord of religious views among
   philosophers than at present obtains. Philosophy, were she our sole
   guide, should not be permitted to say and unsay.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER V--That it is an advantage for things that cannot he searched
   out by Reason to be proposed as Tenets of Faith

   SOME may possibly think that points which reason is unable to
   investigate ought not to be proposed to man to believe, since Divine
   Wisdom provides for every being according to the measure of its nature;
   and therefore we must show the necessity of things even that transcend
   reason being proposed by God to man for his belief.

   1. One proof is this. No one strives with any earnestness of desire
   after anything, unless it be known to him beforehand. Since, then, as
   will be traced out in the following pages (B. III, Chap. [3]CXLVIII),
   Divine Providence directs men to a higher good than human frailty can
   experience in the present life, the mental faculties ought to be evoked
   and led onward to something higher than our reason can attain at
   present, learning thereby to desire something and earnestly to tend to
   something that transcends the entire state of the present life. And
   such is the special function of the Christian religion, which stands
   alone in its promise of spiritual and eternal goods, whereas the Old
   Law, carrying temporal promises, proposed few tenets that transcended
   the enquiry of human reason. [10]

   2. Also another advantage is thence derived, to wit, the repression of
   presumption, which is the mother of error. For there are some so
   presumptuous of their own genius as to think that they can measure with
   their understanding the whole nature of the Godhead, thinking all that
   to be true which seems true to them, and that to be false which does
   not seem true to them. In order then that the human mind might be
   delivered from this presumption, and attain to a modest style of
   enquiry after truth, it was necessary for certain things to be proposed
   to man from God that altogether exceeded his understanding.

   3. There is also another evident advantage in this, that any knowledge,
   however imperfect, of the noblest objects confers a very high
   perfection on the soul. And therefore, though human reason cannot fully
   grasp truths above reason, nevertheless it is much perfected by holding
   such truths after some fashion at least by faith. And therefore it is
   said: Many things beyond the understanding of man are shown to thee
   (Ecclus iii, 23). And, The things that are of God, none knoweth but the
   Spirit of God: but to us God hath revealed them through his Spirit (1
   Cor. ii, 10, 11).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] Cf. Vatican Council, Sess. 2, cap. 2: "Though it is due to divine
   revelation that truths of God, in themselves not inaccessible to human
   reason, in the present condition of mankind can be known by all
   readily, with firm certitude, and without admixture of error; still not
   on that account is revelation to be called absolutely necessary, but
   because God in His infinite goodness has destined man to a supernatural
   end, that is, to a share in the good things of God, which altogether
   surpass the intelligence of the human mind." Faith is the indispensable
   prelude to the beatific vision, the supernatural end of man. Both are
   immediate knowledges of God, faith the hearing of His word on earth,
   vision the seeing of His face in heaven. Without revelation there would
   be some natural knowledge of God, but not the knowledge of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER VI--That there is no lightmindedness in assenting to Truths of
   Faith, although they are above Reason

   THE Divine Wisdom, that knows all things most fully, has deigned to
   reveal these her secrets to men, and in proof of them has displayed
   works beyond the competence of all natural powers, in the wonderful
   cure of diseases, in the raising of the dead, and what is more
   wonderful still, in such inspiration of human minds as that simple and
   ignorant persons, filled with the gift of the Holy Ghost, have gained
   in an instant the height of wisdom and eloquence. [11] By force of the
   aforesaid proof, without violence of arms, without promise of
   pleasures, and, most wonderful thing of all, in the midst of the
   violence of persecutors, a countless multitude, not only of the
   uneducated but of the wisest men, flocked to the Christian faith,
   wherein doctrines are preached that transcend all human understanding,
   pleasures of sense are restrained, and a contempt is taught of all
   worldly possessions. That mortal minds should assent to such teaching
   is the greatest of miracles, and a manifest work of divine inspiration
   leading men to despise the visible and desire only invisible goods. Nor
   did this happen suddenly nor by chance, but by a divine disposition, as
   is manifest from the fact that God foretold by many oracles of His
   prophets that He intended to do this. The books of those prophets are
   still venerated amongst us, as bearing testimony to our faith. This
   argument is touched upon in the text: Which (salvation) having begun to
   be uttered by the Lord, was confirmed by them that heard him even unto
   us, God joining in the testimony by signs and portents and various
   distributions of the Holy Spirit (Heb. ii, 3, 4). This so wonderful
   conversion of the world to the Christian faith is so certain a sign of
   past miracles, that they need no further reiteration, since they appear
   evidently in their effects. It would be more wonderful than all other
   miracles, if without miraculous signs the world had been induced by
   simple and low-born men to believe truths so arduous, to do works so
   difficult, to hope for reward so high. And yet even in our times God
   ceases not through His saints to work miracles for the confirmation of
   the faith. [12]

   Newman, is drawn out in the concluding pages of the Grammar of Assent,

   CHAPTER VII--That the Truth of reason is not contrary to the Truth of
   Christian Faith

   THE natural dictates of reason must certainly be quite true: it is
   impossible to think of their being otherwise. Nor a gain is it
   permissible to believe that the tenets of faith are false, being so
   evidently confirmed by God. [13] Since therefore falsehood alone is
   contrary to truth, it is impossible for the truth of faith to be
   contrary to principles known by natural reason.

   2. Whatever is put into the disciple's mind by the teacher is contained
   in the knowledge of the teacher, unless the teacher is teaching
   dishonestly, which would be a wicked thing to say of God. But the
   knowledge of principles naturally known is put into us by God, seeing
   that God Himself is the author of our nature. Therefore these
   principles also are contained in the Divine Wisdom. Whatever therefore
   is contrary to these principles is contrary to Divine Wisdom, and
   cannot be of God.

   3. Contrary reasons fetter our intellect fast, so that it cannot
   proceed to the knowledge of the truth. If therefore contrary
   informations were sent us by God, our intellect would be thereby
   hindered from knowledge of the truth: but such hindrance cannot be of
   God.

   4. What is natural cannot be changed while nature remains. [14] But
   contrary opinions cannot be in the same mind at the same time:
   therefore no opinion or belief is sent to man from God contrary to
   natural knowledge.

   And therefore the Apostle says: The word is near in thy heart and in
   thy mouth, that is, the word of faith which we preach (Rom. x, 8). But
   because it surpasses reason it is counted by some as contrary to
   reason, which cannot be. To the same effect is the authority of
   Augustine (Gen. ad litt. ii, 18): " What truth reveals can nowise be
   contrary to the holy books either of the Old or of the New Testament."
   Hence the conclusion is evident, that any arguments alleged against the
   teachings of faith do not proceed logically from first principles of
   nature, principles of themselves known, and so do not amount to a
   demonstration; but are either probable reasons or sophistical; hence
   room is left for refuting them. [15]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [13] The evidently refers to believers. To other men the thing is not
   so evident: why, it is not for us to enquire. But to one who has the
   faith, "the tenets of faith" are "so evidently confirmed by God" that
   he feels that for him to reject any of these tenets would be tantamount
   to throwing over his God.

   [14] A notable pronouncement against the Nominalists.

   [15] A reference to the Aristotelian demonstration' by strict logical
   reasoning from necessary truths, as laid down in the Posterior
   Analytics. This chapter goes to set aside the notion that unsound
   theology may still be sound philosophy. But as a truth, undiscernible
   by reason, may be discerned by revelation, so also may an error, or a
   flaw in an argument, be evident on grounds of revelation only, and not
   on any other grounds, where the argument is complicated and the matter
   removed from every-day experience, as in many Old Testament
   difficulties.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER VIII--Of the Relation of Human Reason to the first Truth of
   Faith [16]

   THE things of sense, from whence human reason takes its beginning of
   knowledge, retain in themselves some trace of imitation of God,
   inasmuch as they are, and are good; yet so imperfect is this trace that
   it proves wholly insufficient to declare the substance of God Himself.
   Since every agent acts to the producing of its own likeness, effects in
   their several ways bear some likeness to their causes: nevertheless the
   effect does not always attain to the perfect likeness of the agent that
   produces it. In regard then to knowledge of the truth of faith, which
   can only be thoroughly known to those who behold the substance of God,
   human reason stands so conditioned as to be able to argue some true
   likenesses to it: which likenesses however are not sufficient for any
   sort of demonstrative or intuitive comprehension of the aforesaid
   truth. Still it is useful for the human mind to exercise itself in such
   reasonings, however feeble, provided there be no presumptuous hope of
   perfect comprehension or demonstration. With this view the authority of
   Hilary agrees, who says (De Trinitate, ii, 10), speaking of such truth:
   "In this belief start, run, persist; and though I know that you will
   not reach the goal, still I shall congratulate you as I see you making
   progress. But intrude not into that sanctuary, and plunge not into the
   mystery of infinite truth; entertain no presumptuous hope of
   comprehending the height of intelligence, but understand that it is
   incomprehensible."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] The "first truth of faith" is God, not only that He is (His
   existence), but also what He is (His essential nature).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER IX--The Order and Mode of Procedure in this Work

   THERE is then a twofold sort of truth in things divine for the wise man
   to study: one that can be attained by rational enquiry, another that
   transcends all the industry of reason. This truth of things divine I do
   not call twofold on the part of God, who is one simple Truth, but on
   the part of our knowledge, as our cognitive faculty has different
   aptitudes for the knowledge of divine things. To the declaration
   therefore of the first sort of truth we must proceed by demonstrative
   reasons that may serve to convince the adversary. But because such
   reasons are not forthcoming for truth of the second sort, our aim ought
   not to be to convince the adversary by reasons, but to refute his
   reasonings against the truth, which we may hope to do, since natural
   reason cannot be contrary to the truth of faith. The special mode of
   refutation to be employed against an opponent of this second sort of
   truth is by alleging the authority of Scripture confirmed from heaven
   by miracles. There are however some probable reasons available for the
   declaration of this truth, to the exercise and consolation of the
   faithful, but not to the convincing of opponents, because the mere
   insufficiency of such reasoning would rather confirm them in their
   error, they thinking that we assented to the truth of faith for reasons
   so weak. [17]

   According then to the manner indicated we will bend our endeavour,
   first, to the manifestation of that truth which faith professes and
   reason searches out, alleging reasons demonstrative and probable, some
   of which we have gathered from the books of philosophers and saints,
   for the establishment of the truth and the confutation of the opponent.
   Then, to proceed from what is more to what is less manifest in our
   regard, we will pass to the manifestation of that truth which
   transcends reason, solving the arguments of opponents, and by probable
   reasons and authorities, so far as God shall enable us, declaring the
   truth of faith.

   Taking therefore the way of reason to the pursuit of truths that human
   reason can search out regarding God, the first consideration that meets
   us is of the attributes of God in Himself; secondly of the coming forth
   of creatures from God; thirdly of the order of creatures to God as to
   their last end. [18]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [17] I invite the reader, especially if he be an adversary,' carefully
   to read this sentence and bear it in mind throughout the book. The
   arguments alleged are never fanciful or frivolous, if you understand
   them, except where they involve some mediaeval ignorance of physics,
   cases usually omitted in this translation. But they frequently fall
   short of demonstration, as their author was well aware, who was often
   content with probabilities.

   [18] These three divisions answer to Books I, II, III respectvely. Book
   IV is devoted to that truth of God which transcends reason, and is
   known only, or principally, by faith. These first nine chapters form
   the introduction to the work.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER X--Of the Opinion of those who say that the Existence of God
   cannot he proved, being a Self-evident Truth

   THIS opinion rests on the following grounds: [19]

   1. Those truths are self-evident which are recognised at once, as soon
   as the terms in which they are expressed are known. Such a truth is the
   assertion that God exists: for by the name God' we understand something
   greater than which nothing can be thought. This notion is formed in the
   understanding by whoever hears and understands the name God,' so that
   God must already exist at least in the mind. Now He cannot exist in the
   mind only: for what is in the mind and in reality is greater than that
   which is in the mind only; but nothing is greater than God, as the very
   meaning of the name shows: it follows that the existence of God is a
   self evident truth, being evidenced by the mere meaning of the name.

   2. The existence of a being is conceivable, that could not be conceived
   not to exist; such a being is evidently greater than another that could
   be conceived not to exist. Thus then something greater than God is
   conceivable if He could be conceived not to exist; but anything greater
   than God' is against the meaning of the name God.' It remains then that
   the existence of God is a self-evident truth.

   3. Those propositions are most self-evident which are either
   identities, as Man is man,' or in which the predicates are included in
   the definitions of the subjects, as Man is an animal.' But in God of
   all beings this is found true, that His existence is His essence, as
   will be shown later ([4]Chap. XXII); and thus there is one and the same
   answer to the question What is He?' and Whether He is.' [20] Thus then,
   when it is said God is,' the predicate is either the same with the
   subject or at least is included in the definition of the subject; and
   thus the existence of God will be a self-evident truth.

   4. Things naturally known are self-evident: for the knowledge of them
   is not attained by enquiry and study. But the existence of God is
   naturally known, since the desire of man tends naturally to God as to
   his last end, as will be shown further on (B. III, Chap. [5]XXV).

   5. That must be self-evident whereby all other things are known; but
   such is God; for as the light of the sun is the principle of all visual
   perception, so the divine light is the principle of all intellectual
   cognition.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] This opinion is St Anselm's, and the first two arguments alleged
   for it are his "Ontological argument for the existence of God," revived
   by Descartes, rejected by Kant. See Fr Bödder's Natural Theology, pp.
   24-29 (Manuals of Catholic Philosophy).

   [20] The answer is that given in Exodus iii, 14: I am who am.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XI--Rejection of the aforesaid Opinion, and Solution of the
   aforesaid Reasons

   THE above opinion arises partly from custom, men being accustomed from
   the beginning to hear and invoke the name of God. Custom, especially
   that which is from the beginning, takes the place of nature; hence
   notions wherewith the mind is imbued from childhood are held as firmly
   as if they were naturally known and self-evident. Partly also it owes
   its origin to the neglect of a distinction between what is self-evident
   of itself absolutely and what is self-evident relatively to us.
   Absolutely indeed the existence of God is self-evident, since God's
   essence is His existence. But since we cannot mentally conceive God's
   essence, his existence is not self-evident relatively to us.

   1. Nor is the existence of God necessarily self-evident as soon as the
   meaning of the name God' is known. First, because it is not evident,
   even to all who admit the existence of God, that God is something
   greater than which nothing can be conceived, since many of the ancients
   said that this world was God. Then granting that universal usage
   understands by the name God' something greater than which nothing can
   be conceived, it will not follow that there exists in rerum natura
   something greater than which nothing can be conceived. For thing' and
   "notion implied in the name of the thing" must answer to one another.
   From the conception in the mind of what is declared by this name God'
   it does not follow that God exists otherwise than in the mind. Hence
   there will be no necessity either of that something, greater than which
   nothing can be conceived, existing otherwise than in the mind; and from
   this it does not follow that there is anything in rerum natura greater
   than which nothing can be conceived. And so the supposition of the
   nonexistence of God goes untouched. For the possibility of our thought
   outrunning the greatness of any given object, whether of the actual or
   of the ideal order, has nothing in it to vex the soul of any one except
   of him alone who already grants the existence in rerum natura of
   something than which nothing can be conceived greater. [21]

   2. Nor is it necessary for something greater than God to be
   conceivable, if His non-existence is conceivable. For the possibility
   of conceiving Him not to exist does not arise from the imperfection or
   uncertainty of His Being, since His Being is of itself most manifest,
   but from the infirmity of our understanding, which cannot discern Him
   as He is of Himself, but only by the effects which He produces; and so
   it is brought by reasoning to the knowledge of Him.

   3. As it is self-evident to us that the whole is greater than its part,
   so the existence of God is most self-evident to them that see the
   divine essence, inasmuch as His essence is His existence. But because
   we cannot see His essence, we are brought to the knowledge of His
   existence, not by what He is in Himself but by the effects which He
   works. [22]

   4. Man knows God naturally as he desires Him naturally. Now man desires
   Him naturally inasmuch as he naturally desires happiness, which is a
   certain likeness to the divine goodness. Thus it is not necessary that
   God, considered in Himself, should be naturally known to man, but a
   certain likeness of God. Hence man must be led to a knowledge of God
   through the likenesses of Him that are found in the effects which He
   works.

   5. God is that wherein all things are known, not as though other things
   could not be known without His being known first, as happens in the
   case of self-evident principles, but because through His influence all
   knowledge is caused in us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [21] St Thomas means: If I form a notion of a thing, and then get a
   name to express that notion, it does not follow that the thing,
   answering to such name and notion, exists.' St Anselm's disciples
   reply: True of the notions of all other things, as islands or dollars,
   which may or may not be; but not true of the notion of that one thing,
   whereof existence is a very part of the notion.' In other words,
   whereas St Thomas denies the lawfulness of the transition from the
   ideal to the actual order, they maintain that the transition is lawful
   in arguing the existence of that one Being, who is the actuality of all
   that is ideal. But is such actuality possible?' It is conceivable,
   therefore possible.' It may be conceivable, only because it is
   conceived inadequately, without insight into the inconsistencies which
   it involves.' You have no right to assume inconsistencies where you
   discern none,' rejoins Leibnitz. And so this ontological argument' will
   be tossed up and down, as an apple of discord, to the end.

   [22] Is a conceptual view of His essence a sufficient argument of His
   existence?' That is the question which St Anselm raises.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XII--Of the Opinion of those who say that the Existence of God
   is a Tenet of Faith alone and cannot be demonstrated

   THE falseness of this opinion is shown to us as well by the art of
   demonstration, which teaches us to argue causes from effects, as also
   by the order of the sciences, for if there be no knowable substance
   above sensible substances, there will be no science above physical
   science; as also by the efforts of philosophers, directed to the proof
   of the existence of God; as also by apostolic truth asserting: The
   invisible things of God are clearly seen, being understood by the
   things that are made (Rom. i, 20). [23]

   The axiom that in God essence and existence are the same is to be
   understood of the existence whereby God subsists in Himself, the manner
   of which is unknown to us, as also is His essence; not of the existence
   which signifies an affirmative judgement of the understanding. For in
   the form of such affirmative judgement the fact that there is a God
   falls under demonstration; as our mind is led by demonstrative reasons
   to form such a proposition declaratory of the existence of God. [24] In
   the reasonings whereby the existence of God is demonstrated it is not
   necessary to assume for a premise the essence or quiddity [25] of God:
   but instead of the quiddity the effect is taken for a premise, as is
   done in demonstrations a posteriori from effect to cause. All the names
   of God are imposed either on the principle of denying of God Himself
   certain effects of His power, or from some habitude of God towards
   those effects. [26] Although God transcends sense and the objects of
   sense, nevertheless sensible effects are the basis of our demonstration
   of the existence of God. Thus the origin of our own knowledge is in
   sense, even of things that transcend sense.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [23] As also by the Vatican Council defining: "If any one says that the
   one and true God, our Creator and Lord, cannot be known with certitude
   by the natural light of reason through the things that are made, let
   him be anathema" (Sess. 3, can. 1, De Revel.)

   [24] Compositionem intellectus. In the language of the schoolmen,
   componere et dividere, to put together or put asunder notions,' means
   to make judgements, affirmative and negative.

   [25] Quiddity, quidditas, the answer to the question quid est? -- What
   is the thing essentially?'

   [26] Uncreated, as a name of God, would be an example of the first;
   Father, of the second.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XIII--Reasons in Proof of the Existence of God

   WE will put first the reasons by which Aristotle proceeds to prove the
   existence of God from the consideration of motion as follows.

   Everything that is in motion is put and kept in motion by some other
   thing. It is evident to sense that there are beings in motion. A thing
   is in motion because something else puts and keeps it in motion. That
   mover therefore either is itself in motion or not. If it is not in
   motion, our point is gained which we proposed to prove, namely, that we
   must posit something which moves other things without being itself in
   motion, and this we call God. But if the mover is itself in motion,
   then it is moved by some other mover. Either then we have to go on to
   infinity, or we must come to some mover which is motionless; but it is
   impossible to go on to infinity, therefore we must posit some
   motionless prime mover. In this argument there are two propositions to
   be proved: that everything which is in motion is put and kept in motion
   by something else; and that in the series of movers and things moved it
   is impossible to go on to infinity. [27]

   The Philosopher also goes about in another way to show that it is
   impossible to proceed to infinity in the series of efficient causes,
   but we must come to one first cause, and this we call God. The way is
   more or less as follows. In every series of efficient causes, the first
   term is cause of the intermediate, and the intermediate is cause of the
   last. But if in efficient causes there is a process to infinity, none
   of the causes will be the first: therefore all the others will be taken
   away which are intermediate. But that is manifestly not the case;
   therefore we must posit the existence of some first efficient cause,
   which is God. [28]

   Another argument is brought by St John Damascene (De Fid. Orthod. I,
   3), thus: It is impossible for things contrary and discordant to fall
   into one harmonious order always or for the most part, except under
   some one guidance, assigning to each and all a tendency to a fixed end.
   But in the world we see things of different natures falling into
   harmonious order, not rarely and fortuitously, but always or for the
   most part. Therefore there must be some Power by whose providence the
   world is governed; and that we call God. [29]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [27] I refrain from translating the rest of this lengthy argument,
   based upon the treacherous foundation of Aristotelian Physics. See
   Aristotle, Physics, vii, viii Metaphysics, xi, 7. Whoever will derive
   an argument for the divine existence from the mechanism of the heavens
   must take his principles from Newton, not from Aristotle. Besides
   Motion he must take account of Force and Energy, not to say of Cosmic
   Evolution. He must know not only the motion of impact, as when a row of
   ninepins knock one another down from a push given to the first, but
   also the motion that is set up by gravitation. Aristotle knew nothing
   of gravitation; and only half knew the inertia of matter declared by
   Newton's first law of motion. He supposed that motion, of its own
   nature, not only needed starting but also needed continual keeping up
   by some continually acting cause. He did not know that the question
   with a moving body is, not what there is to keep it in motion, but what
   there is to stop it. It would be a mistake to represent the
   Aristotelian argument of the Prime Mover as referring to some primitive
   push, or some rotary motion started in the primitive nebula, at the
   first creation of matter. Matter, to Aristotle, to Plato, and to the
   Greeks generally, is eternal, not created. I need hardly add that
   between an immovable Prime Mover and a Personal God a wide gulf
   intervenes which Aristotle does not bridge over. See however [6]Chapter
   XXIII of this Book. The whole idea of a Prime Mover has vanished from
   modern physics. The whole universe, as we know it, is a congeries of
   sun-and-planet systems -- some of them apparently still in process of
   formation -- arranged possibly in the shape of a huge convex lens.
   These bodies act and react on each other. And besides these molar
   motions there are also molecular motions quite as real. The causes of
   these motions are innumerable forces. The study of them carries us back
   to consider the primitive collocation' of the forces of the universe, a
   collocation whereby they were arranged in a position of advantage,' so
   that out of their interaction has ensued this orderly world, and in it
   our earth, fit habitation for living things. On this primitive
   collocation,' Father Bödder writes (Natural Theology, p. 56): "Although
   we have nothing to say against the assumption made by astronomers, that
   our cosmic system resulted from the condensation and division of a
   primitive rotating nebula; yet we cannot admit this nebula without
   observing that there must have been a first arrangement of the material
   elements which constituted it, one which already contained the present
   system, or else the said system could never have resulted from it. Now
   this first arrangement was neither the effect of the forces of matter,
   nor was it essential to matter. . . . Therefore if we would explain the
   origin of that system without violation of reason, we are forced to say
   that its first beginning, nebular or otherwise, is due to an
   intelligent cause." To this effect he adds this quotation from Huxley
   (Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, II, 201, 202): "The teleological
   and the mechanical views of nature are not, necessarily, mutually
   exclusive. On the contrary, the more purely a mechanist the speculator
   is, the more firmly does he assume a primordial molecular arrangement
   of which all the phenomena of the universe are consequences, and the
   more completely is he thereby at the mercy of the teleologist, who can
   always defy him to disprove that this primordial molecular arrangement
   was not intended to evolve the phenomena of the universe." Omne quod
   movetur ab alio movetur, I translate "Everything in motion is put and
   kept in motion by another": such is the sense of St Thomas and of
   Aristotle. The ab alio however is not in Aristotle. His words are:
   "Everything in motion must be put and kept in motion by something"
   (Phys. vii, 1); and he adds: "Everything in local motion is moved
   either by itself or by another" (Physics, vii, 2) Things that had souls
   he thought were moved by themselves, and especially the heavenly
   bodies, which were guided by some sort of animating soul in perpetual
   circular motion. St Thomas (B. III, Chap. [7]LXXXVII, in the Latin) has
   his doubts as to the heavenly bodies being animated. He considers
   however (B. III, Chap. [8]LXXXII) "that sublunary bodies are ruled by
   God through the heavenly bodies." Taking movement' for local motion,'
   the argument of the Prime Mover, for a modern mind, resolves itself
   into the question of primitive collocation.' Some collocation is
   presupposed to every mechanical problem. Why this collocation rather
   than that?" is a question answerable only either by a regressus in
   infinitum (Q.E.A.) or by an invocation of Mind and Design. The argument
   however may, avail itself of a wider meaning of motus, namely, change;
   and contend that, at the back of the changes apparent everywhere, there
   must he some Changeless Being, author and guide of this changing
   universe. So presented, it is sometimes called the argument from
   contingent to necessary being.'

   trace of it in the Metaphysics of Aristotle, ii, 3.

     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XIV--That in order to a Knowledge of God we must use the Method
   of Negative Differentiation [30]

   AFTER showing that there is a First Being, whom we call God, we must
   enquire into the conditions of His existence. We must use the method of
   negative differentiation, particularly in the consideration of the
   divine substance. For the divine substance, by its immensity,
   transcends every form that our intellect can realise; and thus we
   cannot apprehend it by knowing what it is, but we have some sort of
   knowledge of it by knowing what it is not. [31] The more we can
   negatively differentiate it, or the more attributes we can strike off
   from it in our mind, the more we approach to a knowledge of it: for we
   know each thing more perfectly, the fuller view we have of its
   differences as compared with other things; for each thing has in itself
   a proper being, distinct from all others. Hence in dealing with things
   that we can define, we first place them in some genus, by which we know
   in general what the thing is; and afterwards we add the differentias
   whereby the thing is distinguished from other things; and thus is
   achieved a complete knowledge of the substance of the thing. But
   because in the study of the divine substance we cannot fix upon
   anything for a genus (Chap. [9]XXV), nor can we mark that substance off
   from other things by affirmative differentias, we must determine it by
   negative differentias. In affirmative differentias one limits the
   extension of another, and brings us nearer to a complete designation of
   the thing under enquiry, inasmuch as it makes that thing differ from
   more and more things. And the same holds good also of negative
   differentias. For example, we may say that God is not an accident, in
   that He is distinguished from all accidents; then if we add that He is
   not a body, we shall further distinguish Him from some substances; and
   so in order by such negations He will be further distinguished from
   everything besides Himself; and then there will be a proper notion of
   His substance, when He shall be known as distinct from all. Still it
   will not be a perfect knowledge, because He will not be known for what
   He is in Himself. [32]

   To proceed therefore in the knowledge of God by way of negative
   differentiation, let us take as a principle what has been shown in a
   previous chapter, that God is altogether immovable, which is confirmed
   also by the authority of Holy Scripture. For it is said: I am the Lord
   and change not (Mal. iii, 6); With whom there is no change (James i,
   17); God is not as man, that he should change (Num. xxiii, 19). [33]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [30] Negative differentiation,' the chapter will explain the phrase. In
   St Thomas it is remotio.

   [31] St Gregory Nazianzen, in one of his poems, calls God "one and all
   things and nothing." In the Summa Theologica, B. I, q. 13, art. 2, St
   Thomas guards his statement thus: "Of the names that are predicated of
   God absolutely and affirmatively, as good,' wise,' and the like, some
   have said that all such names are invented rather to remove something
   from God than to posit anything in Him. . . . . But this account is
   unsatisfactory. . . . And therefore we must say otherwise, that such
   names do signify the divine substance . . . . but fail to represent it
   perfectly. . . . None of them is a perfect expression of the substance
   of God, but each of them signifies it imperfectly, as creatures also
   represent it imperfectly."

   [32] Not every notion can be absolutely denied of God, as 'spirit,'
   power,' wise,' just.' Although He is none of these things in a purely
   human sense, He is all of them in a more excellent way.

   [33] St Thomas passes from immovable' to immutable.' Aristotle
   (Physics, vii, 2), distinguishes three sorts of motion': local motion'
   (now the subject matter of dynamics); change,' or motion in quality'
   (now the matter of chemistry); growth and decay,' or motion in
   quantity' (matter of biology). Thus three incongruous things were
   labelled with one name, to the prejudice of science for many centuries.

   CHAPTER XV--That God is Eternal

   THE beginning of anything and its ceasing to be is brought about by
   motion or change. But it has been shown that God is altogether
   unchangeable: He is therefore eternal, without beginning or end. [34]

   2. Those things alone are measured by time which are in motion,
   inasmuch as time is an enumeration of motion. [35] But God is
   altogether without motion, and therefore is not measured by time.
   Therefore in Him it is impossible to fix any before or after: He has no
   being after not being, nor can He have any not being after being, nor
   can any succession be found in His being, because all this is
   unintelligible without time. He is therefore without beginning and
   without end, having all His being at once, wherein consists the essence
   of eternity.

   3. If at some time God was not, and afterwards was, He was brought
   forth by some cause from not being to being. But not by Himself,
   because what is not cannot do anything. But if by another, that other
   is prior to Him. But it has been shown that God is the First Cause;
   therefore He did not begin to be: hence neither will He cease to be;
   because what always has been has the force of being always.

   4. We see in the world some things which are possible to be and not to
   be. But everything that is possible to be has a cause: for seeing that
   of itself it is open to two alternatives, being and not being; if being
   is to be assigned to it, that must be from some cause. But we cannot
   proceed to infinity in a series of causes: therefore we must posit
   something that necessarily is. Now everything necessary either has the
   cause of its necessity from elsewhere, [36] or not from elsewhere, but
   is of itself necessary. But we cannot proceed to infinity in the
   enumeration of things necessary that have the cause of their necessity
   from elsewhere: therefore we must come to some first thing necessary,
   that is of itself necessary; and that is God. Therefore God is eternal,
   since everything that is of itself necessary is eternal.

   Hence the Psalmist: But thou, O Lord, abidest for ever: thou art the
   self-same, and thy years shall not fail (Ps. ci, 13-28).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [34] But all our experience of life involves change. Our experience
   lends itself more readily to the conception of eternal death than of
   eternal life. To our eye, the motionless and changeless is the dead,
   the effete and exhausted, or the inanimate. Yet we dare to predicate
   eternity of a living God! The difficulty is met in the next chapter,
   where it is argued that God is pure actuality, an activity and life so
   full as to be above change.

   [35] "An enumeration of motion in respect of before and after," says
   Aristotle, Physics, iv, 11 ult. The unit in this enumeration is one
   revolution of the earth on its axis.

   [36] In which case it is what Aristotle calls not absolutely necessary,
   but following necessarily' upon the existence of something else, which
   may or may not be.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVI--That in God there is no Passive Potentiality [37]

   EVERYTHING that has in its substance an admixture of potentiality, to
   the extent that it has potentiality is liable not to be: because what
   can be, can also not be. But God in Himself cannot not be, seeing that
   He is everlasting; therefore there is in God no potentiality.

   2. Although in order of time that which is sometimes in potentiality,
   sometimes in actuality, is in potentiality before it is in actuality,
   yet, absolutely speaking, actuality is prior to potentiality, [38]
   because potentiality does not bring itself into actuality, but is
   brought into actuality by something which is already in actuality. [39]
   Everything therefore that is any way in potentiality has something else
   prior to it. But God is the First Being and the First Cause, and
   therefore has not in Himself any admixture of potentiality.

   4. Everything acts inasmuch as it is in actuality. [40] Whatever then
   is not all actuality, does not act by its whole self, but by something
   of itself. But what does not act by its whole self, is not a prime
   agent; for it acts by participation in something else, not by its own
   essence. The prime agent then, which is God, has no admixture of
   potentiality, but is pure actuality.

   6. We see that there is that in the world which passes from
   potentiality to actuality. But it does not educe itself from
   potentiality to actuality, because what is in potentiality is not as
   yet, and therefore cannot act. Therefore there must be some other prior
   thing, whereby this thing may be brought out from potentiality to
   actuality. And again, if this further thing is going out from
   potentiality to actuality, there must be posited before it yet some
   other thing, whereby it may be reduced to actuality. But this process
   cannot go on for ever: therefore we must come to something that is only
   in actuality, and nowise in potentiality; and that we call God. [41]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [37] Potentia passiva, the Aristotelian potentiality' in its opposition
   to act.' Taken actively, the word potentia is to be rendered Power,'
   not potentiality.' As God possesses the power to create whatever can be
   made at all, there is in Him the promise and potency of all possible
   being. In Him all things that are or ever can be exist eminently and
   virtually.' He is all that they are, but in a better and more excellent
   way, -- in some such way as a seal is in regard of all the impressions
   that ever can be taken of it, or as a king in regard of a viceroy or
   lord-lieutenant: so much so that actual creation makes no addition to
   God or to the sum total of Being absolutely speaking. -- Cf. Isa. xl.

   [38] Actuality is prior to potentiality.' The whole metaphysical proof
   of the existence of God may be said to be summed up in these words.

   [39] A metaphysical and therefore more general statement of the
   physical law of inertia.

   [40] Every agent acts inasmuch as it is in actuality,' is a favourite
   axiom of the schoolmen, to which there is a reciprocal: Everything that
   is acted upon is acted upon inasmuch as it is in potentiality': which
   is also put thus, Everything received is received according to the mode
   of the recipient.' To be in actuality,' is something akin to the modern
   conception of energy.' Every agent then acts according to its
   proximately available energy. A man does only what he is up to doing.'

   [41] This last is in substance the whole argument of Chap. XIII. St
   Thomas is thinking of such an instance in the first place as the birth
   of a child, or the growth of a crop of wheat. Intellectual agents have
   some limited power of educing themselves from potentiality to
   actuality, e.g., from armed peace to war: but their case is not under
   consideration here.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVIII--That in God there is no Composition

   IN every compound there must be actuality and potentiality. For a
   plurality of things cannot become one thing, unless there be actuality
   and potentiality. For things that are not one absolutely, are not
   actually united except by being in a manner tied up together or driven
   together: in which case the parts thus got together are in potentiality
   in respect of union; for they combine actually, after having been
   potentially combinable. But in God there is no potentiality: therefore
   there is not in Him any composition. [42]

   3. Every compound is potentially soluble in respect of its being
   compound, although in some cases there may be some other fact that
   stands in the way of dissolution. But what is soluble is in
   potentiality not to be, which cannot be said of God, seeing that He is
   of Himself a necessary Being.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] Read: "Non enim plura possunt fieri unum, nisi aliquid ibi sit
   actus et aliquid potentia. Quae enim non sunt unum simpliciter, actu
   non uniuntur, nisi quasi colligata vel sicut congregata: in quibus
   etiam ipsae partes congregatae sunt sicut in potentia respectu
   unionis."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XX--That God is Incorporeal

   EVERY corporeal thing, being extended, is compound and has parts. But
   God is not compound: therefore He is not anything corporeal.

   5. According to the order of objects is the order and distinction of
   powers: therefore above all sensible objects there is some intelligible
   object, existing in the nature of things. But every corporeal thing
   existing in nature is sensible: therefore there is determinable above
   all corporeal things something nobler than they. If therefore God is
   corporeal, He is not the first and greatest Being. [43]

   With this demonstrated truth divine authority also agrees. For it is
   said: God is a spirit (John iv, 24): To the King of ages, immortal,
   invisible, only God (1 Tim. i, 17): The invisible things of God are
   understood and discerned by the things that are made (Rom. i, 29). For
   the things that are discerned, not by sight but by understanding, are
   incorporeal.

   Hereby is destroyed the error of the first natural philosophers, who
   posited none but material causes. The Gentiles also are refuted, who
   set up the elements of the world, and the powers therein existing, for
   gods; also the follies of the Anthropomorphite heretics, who figured
   God under bodily lineaments; also of the Manicheans, who thought God
   was an infinite substance of light diffused through infinite space. The
   occasion of all these errors was that, in thinking of divine things,
   men came under the influence of the imagination, which can be cognisant
   only of bodily likeness. And therefore we must transcend imagination in
   the study of things incorporeal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [43] I have not translated the rest of this long chapter, founded as
   most of it is upon Aristotelian physics. One leading characteristic of
   bodies, inertia, may be confidently fixed upon as not predicable of the
   Supreme Being.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXI--That God is His own Essence [44]

   IN everything that is not its own essence, quiddity, or nature, there
   must be some composition. For since in everything its own essence is
   contained, -- if in anything there were contained nothing but its
   essence, the whole of that thing would be its essence, and so itself
   would be its own essence. If then anything is not its own essence,
   there must be something in that thing besides its essence, and so there
   must be in it composition. Hence also the essence in compound things is
   spoken of as a part, as humanity in man. But it has been shown that in
   God there is no composition. God therefore is His own essence.

   2. That alone is reckoned to be beyond the essence of a thing, which
   does not enter into its definition: for the definition declares what
   the thing essentially is. But the accidents of a thing are the only
   points about it which fall not within the definition: therefore the
   accidents are the only points about a thing besides its essence. But in
   God there are no accidents, as will be shown (Chap. [10]XXIII):
   therefore there is nothing in Him besides His essence.

   3. The forms that are not predicable of subsistent things, whether in
   the universal or in the singular, are forms that do not of themselves
   subsist singly, individualised in themselves. It is not said that
   Socrates or man or animal is whiteness; because whiteness is not
   anything subsisting singly in itself, but is individualised by the
   substance in which it exists. Also the essences or quiddities of genera
   or species are individualised according to the definite matter of this
   or that individual, although the generic or specific quiddity includes
   form and matter in general: hence it is not said that Socrates or man
   is humanity. But the Divine Essence is something existing singly by
   itself, and individualised in itself, as will be shown ([11]Chap.
   XLII). The Divine Essence therefore is predicated of God in such a way
   that it can be said: God is His own essence.' [45]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [44] That is to say, whatever God is, He essentially is, which cannot
   be said of man: for there are many things in and about every man over
   and above what is essential to his being man

   [45] Humanity is not man, but Deity is God. In every man, besides his
   humanity, or specific nature, there are his individual characteristics
   (accidentia individuantia). God is not made up of a specific nature
   with individual characteristics.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXII--That in God Existence and Essence is the same [46]

   IT has been shown above (Chap. [12]XV, n. 4) that there is an Existence
   which of itself necessarily is; and that is God. If this existence,
   which necessarily is, is contained in some essence not identical with
   it, then either it is dissonant and at variance with that essence, as
   subsistent existence is at variance with the essence of whiteness; or
   it is consonant with and akin to that essence, as existence in
   something other than itself is consonant with whiteness. In the former
   case, the existence which of itself necessarily is will not attach to
   that essence, any more than subsistent existence will attach to
   whiteness. In the latter case, either such existence must depend on the
   essence, or both existence and essence depend on another cause, or the
   essence must depend on the existence. The former two suppositions are
   against the idea of a being which of itself necessarily is; because, if
   it depends on another thing, it no longer is necessarily. From the
   third supposition it follows that that essence is accidental and
   adventitious to the thing which of itself necessarily is; because all
   that follows upon the being of a thing is accidental to it; and thus
   the supposed essence will not be the essence at all. God therefore has
   no essence that is not His existence.

   2. Everything is by its own existence. Whatever then is not its own
   existence does not of itself necessarily exist. But God does of Himself
   necessarily exist: therefore God is His own existence.

   4. Existence' denotes a certain actuality: for a thing is not said to
   be' for what it is potentially, but for what it is actually. But
   everything to which there attaches an actuality, existing as something
   different from it, stands to the same as potentiality to actuality. If
   then the divine essence is something else than its own existence, it
   follows that essence and existence in God stand to one another as
   potentiality and actuality. But it has been shown that in God there is
   nothing of potentiality (Chap. [13]XVI), but that He is pure actuality.
   Therefore God's essence is not anything else but His existence. [47]

   5. Everything that cannot be except by the concurrence of several
   things is compound. But nothing in which essence is one thing, and
   existence another, can be except by the concurrence of several things,
   to wit, essence and existence. Therefore everything in which essence is
   one thing, and existence another, is compound. But God is not compound,
   as has been shown (Chap. [14]XVIII). Therefore the very existence of
   God is His essence.

   This sublime truth was taught by the Lord to Moses (Exod. iii, 13, 14)
   If they say to me, What is his name? what shall I say to them? Thus
   shalt thou say to the children of Israel: He who is hath sent me to
   you: showing this to be His proper name, He who is. But every name is
   given to show the nature or essence of some thing. Hence it remains
   that the very existence or being of God is His essence or nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [46] That is to say, it is the same thing for God to be at all and to
   be exactly what He is. Godhead' and this God' are identical. No one
   possibly could be God save Him alone who actually is God. In God the
   ideal order and the actual order coincide, the order of thought
   (essence) and the order of being (existence).

   [47] This distinction of actuality and potentiality is the saving of
   philosophy. Even physical science in our day has found potential' a
   convenient term. The distinction is heedlessly abolished by those who
   put activity for being, and seem to think that the human mind itself
   would perish the moment it ceased to act, as though there could be no
   reality that was not actualised. But perfect actuality can be nothing
   less than God: so that if actuality alone exists without potentiality,
   God alone exists. Nature by the institution of sleep teaches us to
   distinguish the potential from the actual. If mind may be dormant and
   yet not cease to be, so may the objects of mind be dormant --
   unobserved by human sense, unpictured in human imagination, unrecalled
   in human memory, or even wholly out of the ken of human knowledge, --
   and still really and truly be, as "permanent possibilities of
   sensation" or of cognition. This phrase of J. S. Mill is felicitous, if
   we remember, as he did not, that a "permanent possibility" is something
   raised above nothingness. Here then we have the confutation of
   idealism, of Berkeley and Kant and all their tribe. Phenomena, or
   appearances, cannot be actual to man except as objects of sensation or
   other human cognition: but they may very well be and are potential,
   observable though unobserved, out of all human mind. Potentiality
   however cannot be mere potentiality: it must rest on something actual.
   The actuality on which potential phenomena, appearances or accidents
   rest, is the substance in which they inhere. The horns then of idealism
   are broken. Subject is not percipere; object is not percipi. If any one
   claims the liberty of using such a terminology, he must at least be
   brought to an admission that there is much of Mind which is not subject
   in his sense, and much of Matter that is not object. Mind and Matter
   are like sea and land, two vast potentialities. They meet on the
   coast-line: but the coast-line of percipere and percipi is far from
   being the whole reality.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXIII--That in God there is no Accident

   EVERYTHING that is in a thing accidentally has a cause for its being
   therein, seeing that it is beside the essence of the thing wherein it
   is. If then there is anything in God accidentally, this must be by some
   cause. Either therefore the cause of the accident is the Divinity
   itself, or something else. If something else, that something must act
   upon the divine substance: for nothing induces any form, whether
   substantial or accidental, in any recipient, except by acting in some
   way upon it, because acting is nothing else than making something
   actually be, which is by a form. Thus God will be acted upon and moved
   by some agent, which is against the conclusions of Chapter [15]XIII.
   But if the divine substance itself is the cause of the accident
   supposed to be in it, then, -- inasmuch as it cannot possibly be the
   cause of it in so far as it is the recipient of it, because at that
   rate the same thing in the same respect would actualise itself, -- then
   this accident, supposed to be in God, needs must be received by Him in
   one respect and caused by Him in another, even as things corporeal
   receive their proper accidents by the virtue of their matter, and cause
   them by their form. Thus then God will be compound, the contrary of
   which has been above proved. [48] &gt;

   4. In whatever thing anything is accidentally, that thing is in some
   way changeable in its nature: for accident as such may be and may not
   be in the thing in which it is. If then God has anything attaching to
   Him accidentally, it follows that He is changeable, the contrary of
   which has above been proved (Chap. [16]XIII, [17]XV).

   5. A thing into which an accident enters, is not all and everything
   that is contained in itself: because accident is not of the essence of
   the subject. But God is whatever He has in Himself. Therefore in God
   there is no accident. -- The premises are proved thus. Everything is
   found more excellently in cause than in effect. [49] But God is cause
   of all: therefore whatever is in Him is found there in the most
   excellent way possible. But what most perfectly attaches to a thing is
   the very thing itself. This unity of identity is more perfect than the
   substantial union of one element with another, e.g., of form with
   matter; and that union again is more perfect than the union that comes
   of one thing being accidentally in another. It remains therefore that
   God is whatever He has.

   Hence Augustine (De Trinitate, v, c. 4, n. 5): "There is nothing
   accidental in God, because there is nothing changeable or perishable."
   The showing forth of this truth is the confutation of sundry Saracen
   jurists, who suppose certain "ideas" superadded to the Divine Essence.
   [50]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [48] A body, according to St Thomas, is made up of a potential subject,
   called matter,' connaturally extended in space; and further of an
   actuating principle of energy, called 'substantial form,' which is so
   united to the potential subject, or matter,' that the latter thereby
   becomes an individual body within a definite species, deriving its
   power of action from the 'substantial form,' or principle of energy.

   [49] Shakespeare's genius was a better thing than Shakespeare's
   Othello. Ordinarily, the cause is not permanently exhausted by the
   effort of causation; more remains behind than has been put into the
   effect. A man is more proud of what he can do than of what he has done.
   There would be small satisfaction in viewing a work of your mind, or of
   your hands, if you felt that your hand had lost its cunning, and your
   mind was now effete.

   [50] Intentiones. For intentio meaning idea, see B. I, Chap. LIII. The
   reference is to archetypal ideas of creation, something akin to the
   Platonic Ideas, the "multitude of things intelligible," discussed in
   Chap. L-LV of this book. The Saracen jurists' (Saracenorum in jure
   loquentium) are apparently Avicenna and his school, against whom these
   chapters are directed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXIV--That the Existence of God cannot he characterised by the
   addition of any Substantial Differentia [51]

   IT is impossible for anything actually to be, unless all things exist
   whereby its substantial being is characterised. An animal cannot
   actually be without being either a rational or an irrational animal.
   Hence the Platonists, in positing Ideas, did not posit self-existent
   Ideas of genera, seeing that genera are characterised and brought to
   specific being by addition of essential differentias; but they posited
   self-existent Ideas of species alone, seeing that for the (further)
   characterising of species (in the individuals belonging to it) there is
   no need of essential differentias. [52] If then the existence of God is
   characterised and receives an essential characteristic by the addition
   of something else, that existence will not of itself actually be except
   by having that other thing superadded to it. But the existence of God
   is His own very substance, as has been shown. It would follow that the
   substance of God could not actually be except by something supervening
   upon it; and thence the further conclusion would ensue that the
   substance of God is not of itself necessarily existent, the contrary of
   which has been shown above (Chap. [18]XV, n. 4)

   2. Everything that needs something superadded to enable it to be, is in
   potentiality in respect of that addition. Now the divine substance is
   not in any way in potentiality, as has been shown (Chap. [19]XVI), but
   God's own substance is God's own being. Therefore His existence cannot
   be characterised by any superadded substantial characteristic.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [51] This and the next chapter go to show that the logical arrangement
   is inapplicable to God, by which genus and differentia together
   constitute the species or definition, as animal and rational make up
   man.

   [52] There is an ideal or typical man in the Platonic scale, but no
   ideal animal. The former is specific in reference to Socrates, the
   latter would be generic. The type stops at the species. This piece of
   Platonism is not formulated in the writings of Plato.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXV--That God is not in any Genus

   EVERYTHING that is in any genus has something in it whereby the nature
   of the genus is characterised and reduced to species: for there is
   nothing in the genus that is not in some species of it. But this is
   impossible in God, as has been shown in the previous chapter.

   2. If God is in any genus, He is either in the genus of accident or the
   genus of substance. He is not in the genus of accident, for an accident
   cannot be the first being and the first cause. Again, He cannot be in
   the genus of substance: for the substance that is a genus is not mere
   existence [53] : otherwise every substance would be its own existence,
   since the idea of the genus is maintained in all that is contained
   under the genus: at that rate no substance would be caused by another,
   which is impossible (Chap. [20]XIII, [21]XV). But God is mere
   existence: therefore He is not in any genus.

   3. Whatever is in a genus differs in point of existence from other
   things that are in the same genus: otherwise genus would not be
   predicated of several things. But all things that are in the same genus
   must agree in the quiddity, or essence, of the genus: because of them
   all genus is predicated so as to answer the question what (quid) each
   thing is. [54] Therefore the existence of each thing that exists in a
   genus is something over and above the quiddity of the genus. But that
   is impossible in God. [55]

   4. Everything is placed in a genus by reason of its quiddity. But the
   quiddity of God is His own mere (full) existence [56] . Now a thing is
   not ranked in a genus on the score of mere (bare) existence: otherwise
   being,' in the sense of mere (bare) existence, would be a genus. But
   that being' cannot be a genus is proved in this way. If being' were a
   genus, some differentia would have to be found to reduce it to species.
   But no differentia participates in its genus: I mean, genus is never
   comprehended in the idea of the differentia: because at that rate genus
   would be put twice over in the definition of the species. [57]
   Differentia then must be something over and above what is understood in
   the idea of genus. Now nothing can be over and above what is understood
   by the idea of being'; since being' enters into the conceivability of
   all things whereof it is predicated, and thus can be limited by no
   differentia. [58]

   Hence it is also apparent that God cannot be defined, because every
   definition is by genus and differentias. It is apparent also that there
   can be no demonstration of God except through some effect of His
   production: because the principle of demonstration is a definition of
   the thing defined. [59]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [53] There is always an ambiguity in this term of mere existence,'
   ipsum esse, auto to einai. Either it means ens abstractissimum, the
   thinnest and shallowest of concepts, denoting the barest removal from
   nothingness: or it is ens plenissimum, being that includes (virtually
   at least) all other being, as the Platonic auto to kalon virtually
   includes all beauty. In this latter sense the term is predicable of God
   alone. In God mere existence' means pure actuality.

   [54] Quod quid est, to ti en einai, where quod is a clumsy equivalent
   for to.

   [55] God is mere and sheer existence, not existence modelled upon some
   quiddity (Chap. XXII). In this study it should be borne in mind that
   essence' represents the ideal order: existence' the actual. God is the
   unity of essence and existence, of the ideal and the actual; the point
   at which the potential finally vanishes into the actual. In every
   existent being, under God, there is an admixture of potentiality. This
   is to be kept steadily in view in bringing St Thomas to bear upon Kant
   and Hegel.

   [56] If God and the creatures were included in one genus, the genus
   could not he the full existence' (esse plenissimum) of God, for that is
   not predicable of the creature. We should have to fall back upon the
   other meaning of ipsum esse, namely, bare existence,' and upon that St
   Thomas argues.

   [57] As if we took living' for a differentia attachable to the genus
   animal,' and so formed a species living animal.'

   [58] Being means anything and everything that in any way is, and can at
   all be said to be removed from the merest nothing. There is being in
   thought, conceptual, or ideal being; and there is being of thing, --
   actually existent being. Being in this latter sense of what actually
   exists cannot be a genus, because the whole apparatus of genus, species
   and differentia belongs to the business of definition; and definition
   does not lay down actual existence (esse), but ideal being (essentia).
   It is no part of the definition of a triangle to state that any such
   things as triangles do actually exist. Therefore we read in this
   chapter (n. 3): "The existence of each thing that exists in a genus is
   something over and above the quiddity of the genus." In other words,
   existence' lies outside every possible generic notion. Nor again can
   being in the sense of what is in thought be a genus, because such
   conceptual being penetrates and pervades the whole ideal order, to
   which genus, species and differentia belong: it is the fundamental
   notion of the order, and appears everywhere, and therefore cannot be
   screened off as a genus. -- See Metaphysics in the Stonyhurst Series of
   "Manuals of Catholic Philosophy," pp. 35-38.

   [59] God cannot be demonstrated in the Aristotelian sense, as truths
   are demonstrated in the exact sciences, notably mathematics. You can
   demonstrate in this sense nothing but what you thoroughly comprehend.

   CHAPTER XXVI--That God is not the formal or abstract being of all
   things

   THINGS are not distinguished from one another in so far as they all
   have being, because in this they all agree. If therefore things do
   differ from one another, either being' itself must be specified by
   certain added differentias, so that different things have a different
   specific being; or things must differ in this that being' itself
   attaches to specifically different natures. The first alternative is
   impossible, because no addition can be made to being,' in the way that
   differentia is added to genus, as has been said (Chap. [22]XXV, n. 4).
   It remains therefore that things differ in that they have different
   natures, to which being' accrues differently. But the divine being is
   not something accessory to any nature, but is the very nature or
   essence of God (Chap. [23]XXII). If therefore the divine being were the
   formal and abstract being of all things, all things would have to be
   absolutely one. [60]

   4. What is common to many is not anything over and above the many
   except in thought alone. For example, animal' is not anything over and
   above Socrates and Plato and other animals, except in the mind that
   apprehends the form of animal' despoiled of all individualising and
   specifying marks: for what is really animal is man: otherwise it would
   follow that in Plato there were several animals, to wit, animal in
   general, and man in general, and Plato himself. Much less then is bare
   being in general anything over and above all existing things, except in
   the mind alone. If then God be being in general, God will be nothing
   more than a logical entity, something that exists in the mind alone.

   This error is set aside by the teaching of Holy Scripture, which
   confesses God lofty and high (Isa. vi, 1), and that He is above all
   (Rom. ix, 5). For if He is the being of all, then He is something of
   all, not above all. The supporters of this error are also cast out by
   the same sentence which casts out idolaters, who gave the
   incommunicable name of God to stocks and stones (Wisd. xiv, 8, 21). For
   if God were the being of all, it would not be more truly said, A stone
   is a being,' than A stone is God.'

   What has led men into this error is a piece of faulty reasoning. For,
   seeing that what is common to many is specialised and individualised by
   addition, they reckoned that the divine being, to which no addition is
   made, was not any individual being, but was the general being of all
   things: failing to observe that what is common or universal cannot
   really exist without addition, but merely is viewed by the mind without
   addition. Animal' cannot be without rational' or irrational' as a
   differentia, although it may be thought of without these differentias.
   [61] Moreover, though the universal be thought of without addition, yet
   not without susceptibility of addition. Animal' would not be a genus if
   no differentia could be added to it; and so of other generic names. But
   the divine being is without addition, not only in thought, but also in
   rerum natura; and not only without addition, but without even
   susceptibility of addition. Hence from this very fact, that He neither
   receives nor can receive addition, we may rather conclude that God is
   not being in general, but individual being: for by this very fact His
   being is distinguished from all other beings, that nothing can be added
   to it. (Chap. [24]XXIV).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [60] If all things agreed in being -- and that the divine being -- all
   things would agree also in nature, since the being of God is simply
   identical with His nature. Agreeing at once in being and in nature,
   they would agree all over, all would be absolutely one, and one great
   and sole Reality would pervade and constitute the universe. To erect
   such a Reality,' or Idea,' or Absolute,' and then to proclaim it God,
   is pantheism. St Thomas argues that this all-pervading entity is not
   the universe, still less is it God: it has no concrete existence
   whatever: it is the shallowest, poorest and barest of the mind's
   creations, extending to and denoting everything, and therefore meaning
   and comprehending next to nothing. In its fourth canon, De Deo
   Creatore, the Vatican Council anathematises any who say that "God is a
   universal or indefinite being, which by self-determination constitutes
   the universe."

   [61] This statement, along with the previous ([25]n. 4), is St Thomas's
   repudiation of ultra-realism, a doctrine with which the schoolmen are
   often charged, as though they gave the objects of universal concepts,
   as universal, a place in rerum natura. The neo-Kantian school,
   identifying reality with thought, may be more open to the accusation.
   Is not the old mediaeval strife about universals' still being waged
   under other names? Modern scholars make a great difficulty of admitting
   that the "common element" in a number of similar objects, e.g., of
   dogs, can be thought of without addition of colour, size, and other
   points, which go to individualise this dog. Take all those points away,
   they say, and you have nothing left. Certainly you have no picture in
   the imagination left. But cursory, rapid thinking, -- and such is our
   usual thinking, -- is done without any picture in the imagination; we
   think vaguely, or, as Cardinal Newman in the Grammar of Assent calls
   it, "notionally." Only in vivid thought is a sensible picture in the
   imagination formed, and the apprehension becomes what Newman calls
   "real." The object then appears with its individualising features upon
   the imaginative canvas, the mind meanwhile remarking to itself that
   this figure, e.g., of this dog, is a specimen or type, to which other
   objects will conform with various differences.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXVIII--That God is Universal Perfection

   AS all perfection and nobility is in a thing inasmuch as the thing is,
   so every defect is in a thing inasmuch as the thing in some manner is
   not. As then God has being in its totality, so not-being is totally
   removed from Him, because the measure in which a thing has being is the
   measure of its removal from not-being. Therefore all defect is absent
   from God: He is therefore universal perfection.

   2. Everything imperfect must proceed from something perfect: therefore
   the First Being must be most perfect.

   3. Everything is perfect inasmuch as it is in actuality; imperfect,
   inasmuch as it is in potentiality, with privation of actuality. That
   then which is nowise in potentiality, but is pure actuality, must be
   most perfect; and such is God. [62]

   4. Nothing acts except inasmuch as it is in actuality: action therefore
   follows the measure of actuality in the agent. It is impossible
   therefore for any effect that is brought into being by action to be of
   a nobler actuality than is the actuality of the agent. It is possible
   though for the actuality of the effect to be less perfect than the
   actuality of the acting cause, inasmuch as action may be weakened on
   the part of the object to which it is terminated, or upon which it is
   spent. Now in the category of efficient causation everything is
   reducible ultimately to one cause, which is God, of whom are all
   things. Everything therefore that actually is in any other thing must
   be found in God much more eminently than in the thing itself; God then
   is most perfect.

   Hence the answer given to Moses by the Lord, when he sought to see the
   divine face or glory: I will show thee all good (Exod. xxxiii, 19).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] It does not follow from this that human perfection is perfect
   self-realisation, in the sense of every power being realised to the
   utmost. The powers of man are many, not all of equally high quality.
   The utmost realisation of one might and would interfere with the
   realisation of another: the baser might be brought out to the loss of
   nobler and better: the perfection of man is a harmony of powers, which
   implies both use and restraint of them severally according to the
   excellence of their several functions. In man, much must be left in
   potentiality, if the best actuality that he is capable of is to be
   realised. In an orchestra, where every instrument played (or brayed)
   continuously at its loudest, the result would be din indescribable, a
   maximum of noise with a minimum of music. Perfection is actuality up to
   standard. In a finite nature, the standard imposes limitations,
   according to the Aristotelian canon of the golden mean, a canon not
   framed for the infinite.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXIX--How Likeness to God may be found in Creatures

   EFFECTS disproportionate to their causes do not agree with them in name
   and essence. And yet some likeness must be found between such effects
   and their causes: for it is of the nature of an agent to do something
   like itself. Thus also God gives to creatures all their perfections;
   and thereby He has with all creatures a likeness, and an unlikeness at
   the same time. For this point of likeness, however, it is more proper
   to say that the creature is like God than that God is like the
   creature. For that is said to be like a thing, which possesses its
   quality or form. Since then that which is found to perfection in God is
   found in other beings by some manner of imperfect participation, the
   said point of likeness belongs to God absolutely, but not so to the
   creature. And thus the creature has what belongs to God, and is rightly
   said to be like to God: but it cannot be said that God has what belongs
   to the creature, nor is it fitting to say that God is like the
   creature; as we do not say that a man is like his picture, and yet his
   picture is rightly pronounced to be like him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXX--What Names can be predicated of God

   WE may further consider what may be said or not said of God, or what
   may be said of Him only, what again may be said of God and at the same
   time also of other beings. Inasmuch as every perfection of the creature
   may be found in God, although in another and a more excellent way, it
   follows that whatever names absolutely denote perfection without
   defect, are predicated of God and of other beings, as for instance,
   goodness,' wisdom,' being,' and the like. But whatever names denote
   such perfection with the addition of a mode proper to creatures, cannot
   be predicated of God except by way of similitude and metaphor, whereby
   the attributes of one thing are wont to be adapted to another, as when
   a man is called a block' for the denseness of his understanding. Of
   this sort are all names imposed to denote the species of a created
   thing, as man,' and 'stone': for to every species is due its own proper
   mode of perfection and being. In like manner also whatever names denote
   properties that are caused in things by their proper specific
   principles, [63] cannot be predicated of God otherwise than
   metaphorically. But the names that express such perfections with that
   mode of supereminent excellence in which they appertain to God, are
   predicated of God alone, as for instance, Sovereign Good,' First
   Being,' and the like. I say that some of the aforesaid names imply
   perfection without defect, if we consider that which the name was
   imposed to signify. But if we consider the mode of signification, every
   name is attended with defect: for by a name we express things as we
   conceive them in our understanding: but our understanding, taking its
   beginning of knowledge from sensible objects, does not transcend that
   mode which it finds in such sensible objects. In them the form is one
   thing, and that which has the form another. The form, to be sure, is
   simple, but imperfect, as not subsisting by itself: while that which
   has the form subsists, but is not simple -- nay, is concrete and
   composite. [64] Hence whatever our understanding marks as subsisting,
   it marks in the concrete: what it marks as simple, it marks, not as
   something that is, but as that whereby something is. [65] And thus in
   every name that we utter, if we consider the mode of signification,
   there is found an imperfection that does not attach to God, although
   the thing signified may attach to God in some eminent way, as appears
   in the name goodness' and good.' Goodness' denotes something as not
   subsisting by itself: good,' something as concrete and composite. In
   this respect, then, no name befits God suitably except in respect of
   that which the name is imposed to signify. Such names therefore may be
   both affirmed and denied of God, affirmed on account of the meaning of
   the name, denied on account of the mode of signification. But the mode
   of supereminence, whereby the said perfections are found in God, cannot
   be signified by the names imposed by us, except either by negation, as
   when we call God eternal' or infinite,' or by reference or comparison
   of Him to other things, as when He is called the First Cause' or the
   Sovereign Good.' For we cannot take in (capere) [66] of God what He is,
   but what He is not, and how other beings stand related to Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [63] e.g., space-enclosing as a property of triangles.

   [64] Concretionem habens. The concrete to St Thomas means the
   composite. Any existing created substance, as he teaches, is compounded
   of specific nature and individualising notes, of actuality and
   potentiality, of essence and existence. Thus, in creation, the abstract
   alone is simple, concrete being is compound.

   [65] Thus the concrete man is something that is: the abstract humanity
   is that whereby man is man, not something that is by itself.

   [66] Capere is chorein, find room for' in our (limited) understanding.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXI--That the Plurality of divine Names is not inconsistent
   with the Simplicity of the Divine Being predicated of God and of other
   Beings

   THE perfections proper to other things in respect of their several
   forms must be attributed to God in respect of His productivity alone,
   which productivity is no other than His essence. Thus then God is
   called wise,' not only in respect of His producing wisdom, but because,
   in so far as we are wise, we imitate in some measure His productivity,
   which makes us wise. But He is not called 'stone,' though He has made
   stones, because in the name of 'stone' is understood a determinate mode
   of being wherein a stone is distinguished from God. Still a stone is an
   imitation of God its cause, in being, in goodness, and other such
   respects. Something of the sort may be found in the cognitive and
   active powers of man. The intellect by its one power knows all that the
   sentient part knows by several powers, and. much more besides. Also,
   the higher the intellect, the more it can know by one effort, to which
   knowledge an inferior intellect does not attain without many efforts.
   Again, the royal power extends to all those particulars to which the
   divers powers under it are directed. Thus also God by His one simple
   being possesses all manner of perfection, all that other beings compass
   by divers faculties -- yea, much more. Hereby the need is clear of many
   names predicated of God: for as we cannot know Him naturally otherwise
   than by arriving at Him from the effects which He produces, the names
   whereby we denote His perfections must be several and diverse,
   answering to the diverse perfections that are found in things. But if
   we could understand His essence as it is in itself, and adapt to it a
   name proper to it, we should express it by one name only, as is
   promised to those who shall behold Him in essence: In that day there
   shall be one Lord, and his name shall be one (Zach. xiv, 9).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXII--That nothing is predicated of God and other beings
   synonymously [67]

   AN effect that does not receive a form specifically like the form
   whereby the agent acts, is incapable of receiving in synonymous
   predication the name taken from that form. [68] But, of the things
   whereof God is cause, the forms do not attain to the species of the
   divine efficacy, since they receive piecemeal and in particular what is
   found in God simply and universally.

   3. Everything that is predicated of several things synonymously, is
   either genus species, differentia, accidens, or proprium. But nothing
   is predicated of God as genus, as has been shown (Chap. [26]XXV); and
   in like manner neither as differentia; nor again as species, which is
   made up of genus and differentia; nor can any accident attach to Him,
   as has been shown (Chap. [27]XXIII); and thus nothing is predicated of
   God either as accident or as proprium, for proprium is of the class of
   accidents. The result is that nothing is predicated synonymously of God
   and other beings.

   6. Whatever is predicated of things so as to imply that one thing
   precedes and the other is consequent and dependent on the former, is
   certainly not predicated synonymously. Now nothing is predicated of God
   and of other beings as though they stood in the same rank, but it is
   implied that one precedes, and the other is consequent and dependent.
   Of God all predicates are predicated essentially. He is called being'
   to denote that He is essence itself; and good,' to denote that He is
   goodness itself. But of other beings predications are made to denote
   participation. Thus Socrates is called a man,' not that he is humanity
   itself, but one having humanity. It is impossible therefore for any
   predicate to be applied synonymously and in the same sense to God and
   other beings.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] Synonymously,' that is, in the same sense. This and the next three
   chapters suppose the doctrine of Aristotle about synonyma and homonyma
   to be found in the beginning of his Categories, and in the text-books.
   The conclusion of this chapter, if accepted, renders pantheism
   untenable.

   [68] e.g., one who has no genius for painting, taking lessons in
   painting from a Murillo, is incapable of receiving a form, or quality,
   of painter like that which his master has. Murillo is a painter of
   another species than his pupil. If both are called painters, they do
   not bear the designation in the same sense.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXIII--That it is not at all true that the application of
   common Predicates to God and to Creatures involves nothing beyond a
   mere Identity of Name

   WHERE there is a mere accidental identity of name, there is no order or
   respect implied of one thing to another, but quite by accident one name
   is applied to several different things. But this is not the case with
   the names applied to God and to creatures: for in such a community of
   names we have regard to the order of cause and effect (Chap. [28]XXIX,
   [29]XXXII). [69]

   2. Moreover, there is some manner of likeness of creatures to God
   (Chap. [30]XXIX).

   3. When there is no more than a mere identity of name between several
   things, we cannot be led from one of them to the knowledge of another;
   but from the attributes found in creatures we are led to a knowledge of
   the attributes of God (Chap. [31]XXX, [32]XXXI).

   5. There is no use predicating any name of any thing unless by the name
   we come to understand something about the thing. But if names are
   predicated of God and creatures by a mere coincidence of sound, we
   understand by those names nothing whatever about God, seeing that the
   significations of those names are known to us only inasmuch as they
   apply to creatures: there would at that rate be no use in saying or
   proving of God that God is a good being, or anything else of the sort.

   If it is said that by such names we only know of God what He is not --
   in that, e.g., He is called living' as not being of the genus of
   inanimate things -- at least it must be allowed that the predicate
   living,' applied to God and to creatures, agrees in the negation of the
   inanimate, and thus will be something more than a bare coincidence of
   name. [70]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [69] The theological and devotional terms which we derive from
   creatures and apply to God are not as the Aristotelian homonyma, where,
   under sameness of name, two different senses are expressed of two
   entirely different thing, mere namesakes and nothing more, as when we
   call a post alike a log stuck in the ground and a delivery of letters.

   [70] St Thomas says what suffices for his present argument: he is not
   undertaking to exhaust the sense of the phrase living God.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXIV--That the things that are said God and Creatures are said
   analogously

   THUS then from the foregoing arguments the conclusion remains that
   things said alike of God and of other beings are not said either in
   quite the same sense, or in a totally different sense, but in an
   analogous sense, that is, in point of order or regard to some one
   object. And this happens in two ways: in one way inasmuch as many
   things have regard to one particular, as in regard to the one point of
   health an animal is called healthy' as being the subject of health
   medicine is called healthful' as being productive of health; food is
   healthy,' being preservative of health; urine, as being a sign of
   health: in another way, inasmuch as we consider the order or regard of
   two things, not to any third thing, but to one of the two, as being' is
   predicated of substance and accident inasmuch as accident is referred
   to substance, not that substance and accident are referred to any third
   thing. Such names then as are predicated of God and of other beings are
   not predicated analogously in the former way of analogy -- for then we
   should have to posit something before God -- but in the latter way.
   [71]

   In this matter of analogous predication we find sometimes the same
   order in point of name and in point of thing named, sometimes not the
   same. The order of naming follows the order of knowing, because the
   name is a sign of an intelligible concept. When then that which is
   prior in point of fact happens to be also prior in point of knowledge,
   there is one and the same priority alike in point of the concept
   answering to the name and of the nature of the thing named. Thus
   substance is prior to accident by nature, inasmuch as substance is the
   cause of accident; [72] and prior also in knowledge, inasmuch as
   substance is put in the definition of accident; and therefore being' is
   predicated of substance before it is predicated of accident, alike in
   point of the nature of the thing and in point of the concept attaching
   to the name. [73] But when what is prior in nature is posterior in
   knowledge, in such cases of analogy there is not the same order alike
   in point of the thing named and in point of the concept attaching to
   the name. Thus the power of healing, that is in healing remedies, is
   prior by nature to the health that is in the animal, as the cause is
   prior to the effect: but because this power is known from its effect,
   it is also named from its effect: hence, though healthful' or health-
   producing,' is prior in order of fast, yet the application of the
   predicate healthy' to the animal is prior in point of the concept
   attaching to the name. Thus then, because we arrive at the knowledge of
   God from the knowledge of other realities, the thing signified by the
   names that we apply in common to God and to those other realities --
   the thing signified, I say, is by priority in God, in the mode proper
   to God: but the concept attaching to the name is posterior in its
   application to Him: hence He is said to be named from the effects which
   He causes. [74]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [71] Therefore we call God good' as being the origin of goodness, and
   creatures good' as being effects of divine goodness. But at that rate,
   it appears, we ought to know the goodness of God before we know the
   goodness of creatures, which seems not to be the case. This objection
   St Thomas proceeds to clear away.

   [72] The thing appearing is the cause of the appearance, of actual
   appearance, when a capable finite mind is present, as in the case of a
   book being read; of the potentiality of appearance, when, as with an
   unread book, no such capable finite mind is there.

   [73] Children have some inkling of substance before they have any of
   accidents, as is shown by this, that the first names they use are nouns
   substantive, not adjectives. On dumb animals Cardinal Newman writes in
   his Grammar of Assent (p. 111, cd. 1895) "It is one peculiarity of
   animal natures to be susceptible of phenomena through the channels of
   sense: it is another to have in those sensible phenomena a perception
   of the individuals to which this or that group of them belongs. This
   perception of individual things, amid the mass of shapes and colours
   which meets their sight, is given to brutes in large measure, and that,
   apparently, from the moment of their birth. It is by no mere physical
   instinct, such as that which leads him to his mother for milk, that the
   new-dropped lamb recognises each of his fellow-lambkins as a whole,
   consisting of many parts bound up in one, and, before he is an hour
   old, makes experience of his and their rival individualities. And much
   more distinctly do the horse and dog recognise even the personality of
   their master."

   [74] This distinction between the thing signified' (res nominis) and
   the concept attaching to the name' (ratio nominis) is of interest to
   the idealist. It supposes -- as Kant also supposes, though Hegel
   apparently does not -- a distinction between things and our way of
   looking at them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXV--That the several Names predicated of God are not
   synonymous

   THOUGH the names predicated of God signify the same thing, still they
   are not synonymous, because they do not signify the same point of view.
   For just as divers realities are by divers forms assimilated to the one
   simple reality, which is God, so our understanding by divers concepts
   is in some sort assimilated to Him, inasmuch as, by several different
   points of view, taken from the perfections of creatures, it is brought
   to the knowledge of Him. And therefore our understanding is not at
   fault in forming many concepts of one thing; because that simple divine
   being is such that things can be assimilated to it in many divers
   forms. According to these divers conceptions the understanding invents
   divers names, an assigns them to God -- names which, though they denote
   one and the same thing, yet clearly are not synonymous, since they are
   not assigned from the same point of view. The same meaning does not
   attach to the name in all these cases, seeing that the name signifies
   the concept of the understanding before it signifies the thing
   understood.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXVI--That the Propositions which our Understanding forms of
   God are not void of meaning

   FOR all the absolute simplicity of God, not in vain does our
   understanding form propositions concerning Him, putting together and
   putting asunder. [75] For though our understanding arrives by way of
   divers concepts to the knowledge of God, still it understands the
   absolute oneness of the object answering to all those concepts. Our
   mind does not attribute the manner of its understanding to the object
   is understood: [76] thus it does not attribute immateriality to a
   stone, though it knows the stone immaterially. [77] And therefore it
   asserts unity of the object by an affirmative proposition, which is a
   sign of identity, when it says, God is good': in which case any
   diversity that the composition shows is referable to the understanding,
   but unity to the thing understood. And on the same principle sometimes
   our mind forms a statement about God with some mark of diversity by
   inserting a preposition, as when it is said, Goodness is in God.'
   Herein is marked a diversity, proper to the understanding; and a unity,
   proper to the thing.

   [75] That is, affirmative and negative propositions.

   [76] Kant would have said: The mind does not, or anyhow should not,
   mistake the forms of its own thought for properties of noumena. Hegel
   denied that there were any noumena, and held thought-forms to be
   everything that is. Forms of thought, e.g., universality, were quite
   recognised by the schoolmen.

   [77] All our knowledge is immaterial, or in other words, universal, got
   by a spiritualisation of the impressions of sense: we know at once hoc
   aliquid et tale. To know hoc aliquid by itself would be impossible. The
   first knowledge is a judgement.

   CHAPTER XXXVIII--That God is His own Goodness [78]

   EVERY good thing, that is not its own goodness, is called good by
   participation. But what is called good by participation presupposes
   something else before itself, whence it has received the character of
   goodness. This process cannot go to infinity, as there is no processus
   in infinitum in a series of final causes: for the infinite is
   inconsistent with any end, while good bears the character of an end.
   [79] We must therefore arrive at some first good thing, which is not
   good by participation in reference to anything else, but is good by its
   own essence; and that is God.

   4. What is, may partake of something; but sheer being can partake of
   nothing. For that which partakes, is potentiality: but being is
   actuality. But God is sheer being, as has been proved (Chap. [33]XXII):
   He is not then good by participation, but essentially so. [80]

   5. Every simple being has its existence and what it is, in one: [81] if
   the two were different, simplicity would be gone. But God is absolute
   simplicity, as has been shown (Chap. [34]XVIII): therefore the very
   goodness that is in Him is no other than His own very self.

   The same reasoning shows that no other good thing is its own goodness:
   wherefore it is said: None is good but God alone (Mark x, 18; Luke
   xviii, 19).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [78] It is possible, I fear, in any school of learning to pass
   examinations and take degrees, philosophical and theological, by
   consistent repeating of an accepted phraseology that one does not
   really understand. What is the meaning of the axiom that God is His own
   goodness, His own wisdom, His own power, and the rest? It means that
   goodness, wisdom, power, is inseparable from God; and that each of the
   divine attributes, could we but view it adequately, would be found to
   involve all the rest. On the other hand, any given man, as Dr Smith, is
   not inseparable from his own learning except hypothetically, if his
   learning is to be at all, inasmuch as Dr Smith's learning has and can
   have no existence apart from Dr Smith. Formally speaking, the Doctor
   gives being to his own learning, so long as it lasts. But, besides that
   he might die and his learning with him -- whereas God and God's
   goodness cannot cease to be -- he might also forget all that he knows,
   and still remain Dr Smith. Nor does his learning involve his other
   attributes, his stature, for example, or his irascibility.

   [79] "The infinite is inconsistent with any end, while good bears the
   character of an end." It may be urged that end does not bear the same
   sense in both these propositions. In the former it means limit (peras:
   in the latter it means, end in view, the perfection that crowns growth
   and effort (telos). The answer is that the infinite is inconsistent
   with any end, if infinity has to be traversed before that end is
   reached: for infinity is untraversable.

   [80] Whereas Dr Smith is not essential wisdom.

   [81] That is, its existence and its essence are the same (Chap. XXII).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXIX--That in God there can be no Evil

   ESSENTIAL being, and essential goodness, and all other things that bear
   the name of essential,' contain no admixture of any foreign element;
   although a thing that is good may contain something else besides being
   and goodness, for there is nothing to prevent the subject of one
   perfection being the subject also of another. Everything is contained
   within the bounds of its essential idea in such sort as to render it
   incapable of containing within itself any foreign element. But God is
   goodness, not merely good. There cannot therefore be in Him anything
   that is not goodness, and so evil cannot be in Him at all.

   3. As God is His own being, nothing can be said of God that signifies
   participation. If therefore evil could be predicated of Him, the
   predication would not signify participation, but essence. Now evil
   cannot be predicated of any being so as to be the essence of any: for
   to an essentially evil thing there would be wanting being, since being
   is good. [82] There cannot be any extraneous admixture in evil, as
   such, any more than in goodness. Evil therefore cannot be predicated of
   God.

   5. A thing is perfect in so far as it is in actuality: therefore it
   will be imperfect inasmuch as it is failing in actuality. Evil
   therefore is either a privation, or includes a privation, or is
   nothing. But the subject of privation is potentiality; and that cannot
   be in God: therefore neither can evil.

   This truth also Holy Scripture confirms, saying: God is light, and
   there is no darkness in Him, (1 John i, 5) Far from God impiety, and
   iniquity from the Almighty (Job xxxiv, 10).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [82] Denied by Buddhists, and by other Asiatic-minded and dissatisfied
   persons, who will have it that being is thought, or will, and that
   thought, will, and all conscious effort is misery.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XL--That God is the Good of all Good

   GOD in His goodness includes all goodnesses, and thus is the good of
   all good.

   2. God is good by essence: all other beings by participation: therefore
   nothing can be called good except inasmuch as it bears some likeness to
   the divine goodness. He is therefore the good of all good.

   Hence it is said of the Divine Wisdom: There came to me all good things
   along with it (Wisd. vii, 11).

   From this it is further shown that God is the sovereign good (Chap.
   [35]XLI.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLII--That God is One

   THERE cannot possibly be two sovereign goods. But God is the sovereign
   good. Therefore there is but one God.

   2. God is all-perfect, wanting in no perfection. If then there are
   several gods, there must be several thus perfect beings. But that is
   impossible: for if to none of them is wanting any perfection, nor is
   there any admixture of imperfection in any, there will be nothing to
   distinguish them one from another.

   7. If there are two beings, each necessarily existent, they must agree
   in point of necessary existence. Therefore they must be distinguished
   by some addition made to one only or to both of them; and thus either
   one or both must be composite. But no composite being exists
   necessarily of itself, as has been shown above (Chap. [36]XVIII).
   Therefore there cannot be several necessary beings, nor several gods.

   9. If there are two gods, this name God' is predicated of each either
   in the same sense or in different senses. If in different senses, that
   does not touch the present question: for there is nothing to prevent
   anything from being called by any name in a sense different from that
   in which the name is ordinarily borne, if common parlance so allows.
   [83] But if the predication is in the same sense, there must be in both
   a common nature, logically considered. [84] Either then this nature has
   one existence in both, or it has two different existences. If it has
   one existence, they will be not two but one being: for there is not one
   existence of two beings that are substantially distinct. But if the
   nature has a different existence in each possessor, neither of the
   possessors will be his own essence, or his own existence, as is proper
   to God (Chap. [37]XXII): therefore neither of them is that which we
   understand by the name of God. [85]

   12. If there are many gods, the nature of godhead cannot be numerically
   one in each. There must be therefore something to distinguish the
   divine nature in this and that god: but that is impossible, since the
   divine nature does not admit of addition or difference, whether in the
   way of points essential or of points accidental (Chap. [38]XXIII,
   [39]XXIV).

   13. Abstract being is one only: thus whiteness, if there were any
   whiteness in the abstract, would be one only. But God is abstract being
   itself, seeing that He is His own being (Chap. [40]XXII). [86]
   Therefore there can be only one God.

   This declaration of the divine unity we can also gather from Holy Writ.
   For it is said: Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one Lord (Deut. vi,
   4) And, One Lord, one faith (Eph. iv, 5).

   By this truth the Gentiles are set aside in their assertion of a
   multitude of gods. Yet it must be allowed that many of them proclaimed
   the existence of one supreme God, by whom all the other beings to whom
   they gave the name of gods had been created. [87] They awarded the name
   of godhead to all everlasting substances, [88] chiefly on the score of
   their wisdom and felicity and their government of the world. And this
   fashion of speech is found even in Holy Scripture, where the holy
   angels, or even men bearing the office of judges, are called gods:
   There is none like thee among gods, O Lord (Ps. lxxxv, 8.); and, I have
   said, Ye are gods (Ps. lxxxi, 6). [89] Hence the Manicheans seem to be
   in greater opposition to this truth in their maintenance of two first
   principles, the one not the cause of the other. [90]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [83] A name thus applied goes for no more than a nickname, or a family
   name. There is or was a French family bearing the name Dieu.

   [84] Secundum rationem; where ratio, meaning our mode of thinking,' is
   opposed to res. The phrase suffices to show that St Thomas was no
   ultra-realist: he did not take the humanity, common to Peter and John,
   to be one and the same physical reality.

   [85] If either of the two supposed possessors of a common divine
   nature, existing separately in each, were his own nature (essence), or
   his own existence, that nature, or that existence, could not be
   repeated in another possessor of it.

   [86] By abstract here is meant ideal, in the Platonic sense: thus ens
   abstractum answers to auto to on. It is not abstract in the sense of
   indeterminate: it is not that thinnest of abstractions, being in
   general. It is being, sheer, simple, and full. See Chap. [41]XXV note
   §, [42]XXVI. In fact ens abstractum here is tantamount to ens
   perfectum: cf. the argument about perfectum bonum, III, Chap. XLVIII,
   5. But probably this argument is not St Thomas's at all. It is wanting
   in the Bergamo autograph in the Vatican library.

   [87] So Plato, Timaeus, 40, 41

   [88] Spiritual substances are meant, i.e., angels.

   [89] Cf. John X, 34, for the meaning of gods here. Ps. lxxxv, 8, might
   refer to the false gods of the Gentiles. A better instance might be Ps.
   xlix, God, the Lord of gods, spoke: and Ps. lxxvii, The bread of
   angels, where the Hebrew is elim (gods).

   [90] Manicheism, in its essential duality of good and evil, is much
   older than Manes. The earliest savages peopled the earth with spirits,
   some friendly, some hostile to man: the reduction of these friendly and
   hostile spirits to two several heads, and the neglecting to confess
   one, supreme over good and evil alike, (cf. Isa. xlv, 6, 7) was the
   genesis of Manicheism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLIII--That God is Infinite

   INFINITY cannot be attributed to God on the score of multitude, seeing
   there is but one God. Nor on the score of quantitative extension,
   seeing He is incorporeal. It remains to consider whether infinity
   belongs to Him in point of spiritual greatness. Spiritual greatness may
   be either in power or in goodness (or completeness) of nature. Of these
   two greatnesses the one follows upon the other: for by the fact of a
   thing being in actuality it is capable of action. According then to the
   completeness of its actuality is the measure of the greatness of its
   power. Thus it follows that spiritual beings are called great according
   to the measure of their completeness, as Augustine says: "In things in
   which greatness goes not by bulk, being greater means being better" (De
   Trinit. vi, 9). But in God infinity can be understood negatively only,
   inasmuch as there is no term or limit to His perfection. And so
   infinity ought to be attributed to God.

   2. Every actuality inhering in another takes limitation from that
   wherein it is: for what is in another is therein according to the
   measure of the recipient. An actuality therefore that is in none, is
   bounded by none: thus, if whiteness were self-existent, the perfection
   of whiteness in it would have no bounds till it attained all the
   perfection of whiteness that is attainable. [91] But God is an
   actuality in no way existent in another: He is not a form inherent in
   matter; nor does His being inhere in any form or nature; since He is
   His own being, His own existence (Chap. [43]XXI). The conclusion is
   that He is infinite.

   4. Actuality is more perfect, the less admixture it has of
   potentiality. Every actuality, wherewith potentiality is blended, has
   bounds set to its perfection: while that which is without any blend of
   potentiality is without bounds to its perfection. But God is pure
   actuality without potentiality (Chap. [44]XVI), and therefore infinite.

   6. There cannot be conceived any mode in which any perfection can be
   had more perfectly than by him, who is perfect by his essence, and
   whose being is his own goodness. But such is God: therefore anything
   better or more perfect than God is inconceivable. He is therefore
   infinite in goodness.

   7. Our intellect, in understanding anything, reaches out to infinity; a
   sign whereof is this, that, given any finite quantity, our intellect
   can think of something greater. But this direction of our intellect to
   the infinite would be in vain, if there were not something intelligible
   that is infinite. There must therefore be some infinite intelligible
   reality, which is necessarily the greatest of realities; and this we
   call God.

   8. An effect cannot reach beyond its cause: now our understanding
   cannot come but of God, who is the First Cause. If then our
   understanding can conceive something greater than any finite being, the
   conclusion remains that God is not finite. [92]

   9. Every agent shows greater power in action, the further from
   actuality is the potentiality which it reduces to actuality, as there
   is need of greater power to warm water than to warm air. But that which
   is not at all, is infinitely distant from actuality, and is not in any
   way in potentiality: therefore if the world was made a fact from being
   previously no fact at all, the power of the Maker must be infinite.

   This argument avails to prove the infinity of the divine power even to
   the mind of those who assume the eternity of the world. For they
   acknowledge God to be the cause of the substantial being of the world,
   although they think that substance to have been from eternity, saying
   that the eternal God is the cause of an ever-existing world in the same
   way that a foot would be the cause of an everlasting foot-print, if it
   had been from eternity stamped on the dust. Still, even accepting the
   position thus defined, it follows that the power of God is infinite.
   For whether He produced things in time, according to us, or from
   eternity, according to them, there can be nothing in the world of
   reality that He has not produced, seeing that He is the universal
   principle of being; and thus He has brought things to be, without
   presupposition of any matter or potentiality. Now the measure of active
   power must be taken according to the measure of potentiality or
   passivity; for the greater the pre-existing or preconceived passivity,
   the greater the active power required to reduce it to complete
   actuality. The conclusion remains that, as finite power in producing an
   effect is conditioned on the potentiality of matter, the power of God,
   not being conditioned on any potentiality, is not finite, but infinite,
   and so is His essence infinite.

   To this truth Holy Scripture bears witness: Great is the Lord and
   exceedingly to he praised, and of his greatness there is no end (Ps.
   cxliv, 3).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [91] This argument for the infinity seems to make against the
   personality of God. "An actuality that is in none," it will be said, is
   no one's actuality. If personality is some sort of limitation, how can
   the infinite be other than the impersonal? This ground is beset with
   formidable difficulties. See General Metaphysics, Stonyhurst Series, p.
   282. Such reply as I can make is the following: I would rather call
   personality an exclusiveness than a limitation. Then I might observe
   that the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity, while having one and the
   same nature in common, are mutually exclusive of one another as
   Persons. But as this mystery lies beyond the ken of philosophy, I
   prefer to reply that the actuality of God is exclusive of absolutely
   everything that comes within our direct cognition: it is exclusive of
   the entire universe. So St Thomas, though not so the pantheistic
   school, who make their Absolute formally inclusive of all. Here surely
   is a great difference. God then, according to St Thomas, is not
   infinite in the sense of formally containing within His own being, as
   part of Himself, the being of this world. He is distinct with a real,
   physical distinction from the universe which He has created. He is
   infinite, not as being identified with the universe, but as being
   infinitely above it: and better than it, so far above it and so far
   better than it that the universe, as compared with His being, has in
   that comparison no being and no goodness at all. See note § on page 15.
   True, His actuality is "in none," but that is because it is complete
   and perfect in itself, individualised in itself, filling up the measure
   of divinity and identified with it, so that there can be no second God,
   and none could possibly be God but He who is God. Thus God can be
   called by no proper name, as Michael or John, applied to angel and to
   man, to distinguish one individual from his compeers. Is not this
   completeness and exclusiveness to be called personality? Personality, a
   distinguishing perfection of the highest of creatures, cannot well be
   denied to the most perfect of beings, their Creator.

   [92] Our concept of an infinite being is invoked to prove not the
   existence but the infinity of God, His existence as First Cause being
   supposed to be already proved from other sources. There is then here no
   tacit falling back upon the argument of St Anselm, rejected in Chap.
   XI.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLIV--That God has Understanding

   IN no order of causes is it found that an intelligent cause is the
   instrument of an unintelligent one. But all causes in the world stand
   to the prime mover, which is God, as instruments to the principal
   agent. Since then in the world there are found many intelligent causes,
   the prime mover cannot possibly cause unintelligently.

   5. No perfection is wanting in God that is found in any kind of beings
   (Chap. [45]XXVIII): nor does any manner of composition result in Him
   for all that (Chap. [46]XVIII). But among the perfections of creatures
   the highest is the possession of understanding: for by understanding a
   thing is in a manner all things, having in itself the perfections of
   all things. [93]

   6. Everything that tends definitely to an end, either fixes its own
   end, or has its end fixed for it by another: otherwise it would not
   tend rather to this end than to that. But the operations of nature tend
   to definite ends: the gains of nature are not made by chance: for if
   they were, they would not be the rule, but the exception, for chance is
   of exceptional cases. Since then physical agents do not fix their own
   end, because they have no idea of an end, they must have an end fixed
   for them by another, who is the author of nature. But He could not fix
   an end for nature, had He not Himself understanding. [94]

   7. Everything imperfect is derived from something perfect: for
   perfection is naturally prior to imperfection, as actuality to
   potentiality. [95] But the forms that exist in particular things are
   imperfect, for the very reason that they do exist in particular, and
   not in the universality of their idea, or the fulness of their ideal
   being. They must therefore be derived from some perfect forms, which
   are not under particular limitations. Such forms cannot be other than
   objects of understanding, seeing that no form is found in its
   universality or ideal fulness, except in the understanding.
   Consequently such forms must be endowed with understanding, if they are
   to subsist by themselves: for only by that endowment can they be
   operative. God therefore, who is the first actuality existing by
   itself, whence all others are derived, must be endowed with
   understanding. [96]

   This truth also is in the confession of Catholic faith: for it is said:
   He is wise of heart and mighty of power (Job ix, 4): With him is
   strength and wisdom (Ibid. xii, 16): Thy wisdom is made wonderful to me
   (Ps. cxxxviii, 6): O depth of riches, of wisdom and of knowledge of God
   (Rom. vi, 33).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [93] The vastness of the stellar universe is in a manner the reach and
   amplitude of my mind, when I come to form some slight idea of it.

   [94] This is the Argument from Design, so valuable to the theologian in
   dealing with evolution. See Chap. XIII.

   [95] Evolutionism says just the opposite. Is not the whole notion of
   development a process from the imperfect to the perfect? But the
   eternal question abides -- What begot the first germ, containing in
   itself the promise and potency of the vast development which we see? St
   Thomas asserts a priority of nature of the perfect to the imperfect,
   not a priority of time. God, though prior in duration, is not prior in
   time to the creature, as He is not in time at all: there is no time
   antecedent to creation. In the series of created causes, the imperfect
   is doubtless prior in time to the perfect. The first verses of Genesis
   assure us of that, as well as all sound study of evolution.

   [96] The forms' here spoken of (not the human soul) are entities
   denoted by abstract names, as beauty, dexterity, squareness. They exist
   only in particular substances, and in each case imperfectly according
   to the imperfections of that in which they exist. Thus beauty is marred
   by the age, bodily infirmities and accidents, of any beautiful living
   being. No living being on earth is ideally beautiful. Is then every
   ideal form' something that practically cannot be? St Thomas thinks not.
   Recognising that the ideal cannot be except in a mind, he thereupon
   posits ideals which are themselves minds -- self-conscious ideals, and
   these are the angels. The Platonic ideas, or ideals, are thus brought
   into rerum natura as angels, one angel being the self-conscious ideal
   of one quality, as, perhaps, of swiftness, another of another, as,
   perhaps, of accuracy. Thus he says in [47]II, 93: "Separate substances
   (i.e., angels) are certain essences existing by themselves (quidditates
   subsistentes)." This essence, existing by itself, and conscious of
   itself -- existing therefore in a mind, its own mind, as all ideal
   being needs to exist in a mind -- this ideal essence, I say, is not
   limited, as forms are limited in the material universe, by being
   reduced to the particular. An angel, says St Thomas (Contra Gent.,
   [48]II, 93), is not reduced to the particular as one individual of many
   in a species: each angel is a species by himself, a living, conscious
   specific essence, sole of its kind. Thus among angels there are
   particular species, but not particular individuals of a species: this
   or that species is this or that individual, containing an ample
   measure, though not a divine fulness, of the specific essence. St
   Thomas does not say that specific forms necessarily exist by
   themselves: he does not teach the necessary existence of angels: all he
   argues is that, if these forms exist by themselves at all (si sint
   subsistentes), they must be self-conscious and intelligent beings. The
   utmost that he can be said to contend for is that angels are a fitting
   complement of the universe (II, 91). All that is absolutely necessary
   is the existence of a Supreme Being, who virtually contains in Himself
   all perfections which are represented in our minds by various abstract
   forms; a Being who is the Actuality of all ideal perfection (Chap.
   [49]XXVIII). The argument then in the text is: Imperfect forms are
   apparent everywhere in the material creation. Imperfect forms must come
   of perfect forms; perfect forms are ideal forms: ideal forms can exist
   nowhere but in the mind: if these ideal forms exist anywhere by
   themselves, they must themselves be minds conscious of what they are:
   such self-conscious ideals are the angels: anyhow, whether existing by
   themselves or not, ideals must be represented in one Perfect Mind: God
   therefore is Mind.' The argument is Platonic; or rather, Neoplatonist,
   as the making of the ideals into angels shows. It is rather a probable
   intuition than an argument. As an argument, it has many difficulties.
   St Thomas cannot have meant to say that any angel was living perfect
   beauty, or living perfect wisdom, for then it would be God: but perhaps
   we might have a living perfect fragrance, or a living perfect agility;
   and we may suppose that only these minor perfections, which do not
   carry all other perfections with them, are personified in the angels,
   and that only in an imperfect way. Omitting the theory of angels, which
   will recur again (Book II, Chap. [50]LV, [51]XCVIII, with notes) we may
   formulate the matter finally thus: The ideal must be realised
   somewhere. It is realisable only in mind. Now whatever we may think of
   angels, and their intermediate realisation of ideals, we must arrive
   ultimately at one mind that realises the whole ideal order. That one
   grand realiser and realisation of all ideals is the Mind of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLV--That in God the Understanding is His very Essence

   TO understand is an act of an intelligent being, existing in that
   being, not passing out to anything external, as the act of warming
   passes out to the object warmed: [97] for an intelligible object
   suffers nothing from being understood, but the intelligence that
   understands it is perfected thereby. But whatever is in God is the
   divine essence. Therefore the act of understanding in God is the divine
   essence.

   5. Every substance is for the sake of its activity. If therefore the
   activity of God is anything else than the divine substance, His end
   will be something different from Himself; and thus God will not be His
   own goodness, seeing that the good of every being is its end.

   From the act of understanding in God being identical with His being, it
   follows necessarily that the act of His understanding is absolutely
   eternal and invariable, exists in actuality only, and has all the other
   attributes that have been proved of the divine being. God then is not
   potentially intelligent, nor does He begin anew to understand anything,
   nor does He undergo any change or composition in the process of
   understanding.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [97] In other words, the act of understanding is what is called an
   immanent act,' not a transient act.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLVI--That God understands by nothing else than by His own
   Essence

   UNDERSTANDING is brought actually to understand by an impression made
   on the understanding, just as sense comes actually to feel by an
   impression made on sense. The impression made on the understanding then
   is to the understanding as actuality to potentiality. If therefore the
   divine understanding came to understand by any impression made on the
   understanding other than the understanding itself, the understanding
   would be in potentiality towards that impression, which, it has been
   shown, cannot be (Chap. [52]XVI, [53]XVII).

   3. Any impression on the understanding that is in the understanding
   over and above its essence, has an accidental being: by reason of which
   fact our knowledge reckons as an accident. But there can be no accident
   in God. Therefore there is not in His understanding any impression
   besides the divine essence itself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLVII--That God perfectly understands Himself

   WHEN by an impression on the understanding that power is brought to
   bear on its object, the perfection of the intellectual act depends on
   two things: one is the perfect conformity of the impression with the
   thing understood: the other is the perfect fixing of the impression on
   the understanding: which perfection is the greater, the greater the
   power of the understanding to understand. Now the mere divine essence,
   which is the intelligible representation whereby the divine
   understanding understands, is absolutely one and the same with God
   Himself and with the understanding of God. God therefore knows Himself
   most perfectly.

   6. The perfections of all creatures are found at their best in God. But
   of perfections found in creatures the greatest is to understand God:
   seeing that the intellectual nature is pre-eminent above other natures,
   and the perfection of intellect is the act of understanding, and the
   noblest object of understanding is God. God therefore understands
   Himself perfectly.

   This also is confirmed by divine authority, for the Apostle says: The
   spirit of God searcheth into even the deep things of God (1 Cor. ii,
   10).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLVIII--That God primarily and essentially knows Himself alone

   THE Understanding is in potentiality in regard of its object, in so far
   as it is a different thing from that object. If therefore the primary
   and essential object of divine understanding be something different
   from God, it will follow that God is in potentiality in respect of some
   other thing, which is impossible (Chap. [54]XVI).

   5. A thing understood is the perfection of him who understands it: for
   an understanding is perfected by actually understanding, which means
   being made one with the object understood. [98] If therefore anything
   else than God is the first object of His understanding, something else
   will be His perfection, and will be nobler than He, which is
   impossible.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [98] An Aristotelian phrase, meaning no more than that the object is
   represented by an image in the mind.

   CHAPTER XLIX--That God knows other things besides Himself

   WE are said to know a thing when we know its cause. But God Himself by
   His essence is the cause of being to others. Since therefore He knows
   His own essence most fully, we must suppose that He knows also other
   beings.

   3. Whoever knows anything perfectly, knows all that can be truly said
   of that thing, and all its natural attributes. But a natural attribute
   of God is to be cause of other things. Since then He perfectly knows
   Himself, He knows that He is a cause: which could not be unless He knew
   something also of what He has caused, which is something different from
   Himself, for nothing is its own cause.

   Gathering together these two conclusions, it appears that God knows
   Himself as the primary and essential object of His knowledge, and other
   things as seen in His essence. [99]
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER L--That God has a particular Knowledge of all things

   EVERY agent that acts by understanding has a knowledge of what it does,
   reaching to the particular nature of the thing produced; because the
   knowledge of the maker determines the form of the thing made. But God
   is cause of things by His understanding, seeing that in Him to be and
   to understand are one. But everything acts inasmuch as it is in
   actuality. God therefore knows in particular, as distinct from other
   things, whatever He causes to be. [100]

   3. The collocation of things, distinct and separate, cannot be by
   chance, for it is in regular order. This collocation of things, then,
   distinct and separate from one another, must be due to the intention of
   some cause. It cannot be due to the intention of any cause that acts by
   physical necessity, because physical nature is determined to one line
   of acton. Thus of no agent, that acts by physical necessity, can the
   intention reach to many distinct effects, inasmuch as they are
   distinct. [101] The distinct arrangement and collocation of things must
   proceed from the intention of some knowing cause. [102] Indeed it seems
   the proper function of intellect to remark the distinction of things.
   It belongs therefore to the First Cause, which of itself is distinct
   from all others, to intend the distinct and separate collocation of all
   the materials of the Universe.

   4. Whatever God knows, He knows most perfectly: for there is in Him all
   perfection (Chap. [55]XXVIII). Now what is known only in general is not
   known perfectly: the main points of the thing are not known, the
   finishing touches of its perfection, whereby its proper being is
   completely realised and brought out. Such mere general knowledge is
   rather a perfectible than a perfect knowledge of a thing. If therefore
   God in knowing His essence knows all things in their universality, He
   must also have a particular knowledge of things.

   8. Whoever knows any nature, knows whether that nature be communicable:
   for he would not know perfectly the nature of animal,' who did not know
   that it was communicable to many. But the divine nature is communicable
   by likeness. God therefore knows in how many ways anything may exist
   like unto His essence. Hence arises the diversity of types, inasmuch as
   they imitate in divers ways the divine essence. God therefore has a
   knowledge of things according to their several particular types. [103]

   This also we are taught by the authority of canonical Scripture. God
   saw all things that he had made, and they were very good (Gen. i, 31).
   Nor is there any creature invisible in his sight, but all things are
   naked and open to his eyes (Heb. iv, 13).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [100] Since the Creator is an understanding, He understands whatever He
   gives being to; and giving being to each thing in particular, He
   understands each in particular.

   [101] This merely means that physical causes act without any definite
   intention on their part of any particular results to follow from their
   action. Electrical tension in the air tends to discharge itself in the
   form of lightning, but not to kill this particular man under the tree,
   although it does kill. The volcanic nisus prompts to an eruption, but
   not to the destruction of such and such a city that is built over the
   volcano. So far as physical agencies are concerned, the lava, or
   flaming gas, takes its determined path, neither making for the city, as
   such, nor avoiding it, as such.

   [102] St. Thomas does not use the word collocatio. His repeated phrase
   is distinctio rerum, which I have rendered distinct arrangement and
   collocation,' first, because such is really the meaning, and, secondly,
   because this argument has attracted attention, and been acknowledged to
   have weight, in respect of what is called the primitive collocation' of
   the materials of the universe, a collocation impossible to explain by
   any physical causation, and pointing evidently to some ordering and
   disposing Intelligence.

   [103] This is an important principle, often laid down as follows: --
   God knows His own nature in all the various modes in which that nature
   can be copied outside Himself In knowing this, He knows the ideal
   order, every detail and all inter-relations of details in any possible
   universe. This is called the knowledge of simple understanding,
   inasmuch as it is the knowledge of all creatable creatures and their
   ongoings, antecedent to and apart from the creation and actual
   existence of any: this knowledge however dwells only in the ideal order
   of possibilities, and may therefore be called general and universal,
   though not abstract, inasmuch as it deals with types of individual
   things, but not with particular existences in rerum natura as actually
   existing, but only as potentialities. God further knows things outside
   Himself as they actually and individually exist, inasmuch as all things
   are of His causation and creation, and exist and act under His will and
   power. He knows them by insight of Himself, not as He is a mere nature,
   but as He is a nature willing to create on these particular lines. This
   knowledge of the universe as the universe actually is for all time, is
   called the knowledge of vision. For these two knowledges see Chap.
   LXVI. The knowledge of simple understanding is not abstract, inasmuch
   as God knows, not only types of species, but types of different
   individuals possible in each species; and all these several types He
   knows, not by so many several ideas, but in the one act by which He
   knows Himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LI--Some Discussion of the Question how there is in the Divine
   Understanding a Multitude of Objects

   THIS multitude cannot be taken to mean that many objects of
   understanding have a distinct being in God. For these objects of
   understanding would be either the same with the divine essence, and at
   that rate multitude would be posited in the essence of God, a doctrine
   above rejected on many grounds (Chap. [56]XXXI); or they would be
   additions made to the divine essence, and at that rate there would be
   in God some accident, which we have above shown to be an impossibility
   (Chap. [57]XXXIII). Nor again can there be posited any separate
   existence of these intelligible forms, which seems to have been the
   position of Plato, who, by way of avoiding the above inconveniences,
   introduced the doctrine of Ideas. For the forms of physical things
   cannot exist without matter, as neither can they be understood without
   matter. And even supposing them so to exist, even this would not
   suffice to explain God understanding a multitude of objects. For,
   assuming the aforesaid forms to exist outside the essence of God, and
   that God could not understand the multitude of things without them,
   such understanding being requisite to the perfection of His intellect,
   it would follow that God's perfection in understanding depended on
   another being than Himself, and consequently His perfection in being,
   seeing that His being is His understanding: the contrary of all which
   has been shown (Chap. [58]XL). Moreover, assuming what shall be proved
   hereafter (Bk II, Chap. [59]XV), that whatever is beyond the essence of
   God is caused by God, the above forms, if they are outside of God, must
   necessarily be caused by Him. But He is cause of things by His
   understanding, as shall be shown (Bk II, Chap. [60]XXIII, [61]XXIV).
   Therefore God's understanding of these intelligible forms is a natural
   prerequisite for the existence of such forms. God's understanding then
   of the multitude of creatures is not to be explained by the existence
   of many intelligible abstract forms outside of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LII--Reasons to show how the Multitude of intelligible Ideal
   Forms has no Existence except in the Divine Understanding

   IT is not to be supposed that the multitude of intelligible ideal forms
   is in any other understanding save the divine, say, the understanding
   of an angel. For in that case the divine understanding would depend, at
   least for some portion of its activity, upon some secondary intellect,
   which is impossible: for as substances are of God, so also all that is
   in substances: hence for the being of any of these forms in any
   secondary intellect there is prerequired an act of the divine
   intelligence, whereby God is cause.

   2. It is impossible for one intellect to perform an intellectual
   operation by virtue of another intellect being disposed to that
   operation: that intellect itself must operate, which is disposed so to
   do. The fact then of many intelligible forms being in some secondary
   intellect cannot account for the prime intellect knowing the multitude
   of such forms.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIII--How there is in God a Multitude of Objects of
   Understanding

   AN external object, coming to be an object of our understanding, does
   not thereby exist in our understanding in its own proper nature: but
   the impression (species) of it must be in our understanding, and by
   that impression our understanding is actualised, or comes actually to
   understand. The understanding, actualised and informed' by such an
   impression, understands the thing in itself.' The act of understanding
   is immanent in the mind, and at the same time in relation with the
   thing understood, inasmuch as the aforesaid impression,' which is the
   starting-point of the intellectual activity, is a likeness of the thing
   understood. Thus informed by the impression (species) of the thing, the
   understanding in act goes on to form in itself what we may call an
   intellectual expression' (intentio) of the thing. This expression is
   the idea (ratio, logos) of the thing, and so is denoted by the
   definition. So it must be, for the understanding understands alike the
   thing absent and the thing present; in which respect imagination and
   understanding agree. [104] But the understanding has this advantage
   over the imagination, that it understands the thing apart from the
   individualising conditions without which the thing exists not in rerum
   natura. This could not be except for the understanding forming to
   itself the aforesaid expression.' This expression' (intentio) in the
   understanding, being, we may say, the term of the intellectual
   activity, is different from the intellectual impression' (species
   intelligibilis), which actualises the understanding and which must be
   considered the starting-point of intellectual activity; and yet both
   the one and the other, both the impression' (species) and the
   expression' (intentio), are likenesses of the thing in itself,' which
   is the object of the understanding. From the fact of the intellectual
   impression, which is the form of the intellect and the starting-point
   of intellectual knowledge, being a likeness of the external thing, it
   follows that the expression, or idea, formed by the understanding, is
   also like the thing: for as an agent is, so are its activities. And
   again, from the fact of the expression, or idea, in the understanding
   being like to its object, it follows that the understanding in the act
   of forming such an idea understands the said object.

   But the divine mind understands by virtue of no impression other than
   its own essence (Chap. [62]XLVI). At the same time the divine essence
   is the likeness of all things. It follows therefore that the concept of
   the divine understanding itself, which is the Divine Word, is at once a
   likeness of God Himself understood, and also a likeness of all things
   whereof the divine essence is a likeness. Thus then by one intelligible
   impression (species intelligibilis), which the divine essence, and by
   one intellectual recognition (intentio intellecta), which is the Divine
   Word, many several objects may be understood by God. [105]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [104] The impression' (species) can come only from the thing being
   present: but the expression (intentio ratio, logos, verbum mentale) of
   the thing endures in the understanding when the thing is away. So too
   does the corresponding phantasma, or sense-picture in the imagination,
   endure in the absence of the object. See Father Maher's Psychology,
   Stonyhurst Series, Longmans, ed. 4, pp. 51-53, 310.

   [105] Few modern readers, I fear, will read this explanation with the
   same zest which St Thomas evidently felt in writing it. Kantian
   idealism on the one hand, and physical science on the other, have
   averted the modern mind -- is it for ever? -- from species
   intelligibilis and intentio intellecta, or verbum mentale. Accidents,
   scientifically considered, as colour, odour, shape, are not to us what
   they were to the mediaeval schoolman. We busy ourselves with the
   sensation of colour, the effect on retina and brain and inner
   consciousness, and further with the vibrations from without that are
   apt to set up such a sensation in a creature organised as man is. And
   at the back of colour we discern with the mind's eye, what the bodily
   eye is insensible to, a colourless, invisible molecular structure, and
   a complication of interacting forces all but infinite in multitude, all
   but infinitesimal in power. Whoever would rehabilitate Thomist
   philosophy to the requirements of modern science, has before him work
   for a lifetime, no old man's labour. One thing however I will say about
   the likeness' (similitudo) here said to obtain between the thing in
   itself and our impression or idea of the thing. There can be no
   question here of any such likeness as obtains between a portrait, or
   photograph, and the person who sits for it. What can be maintained on
   behalf of Realistic Dualism is this, that between the impression or
   idea in consciousness and the thing in itself there is a certain
   correlation or proportion, inasmuch as the thing in itself, striking
   our senses and thereby our understanding, is apt to induce in us
   certain sensations and consequent ideas. These aptitudes, or
   potentialities, relative to man, are the objective properties, or
   accidents, of the thing in itself as cognizable by man. This doctrine
   is simply an extension to all substance of a conclusion generally
   received in respect to those interesting substances whom we call our
   friends and acquaintances. We have impressions and ideas of them,
   gathered from their conversation and their dealings with us. We trust
   that our friends are at heart such as their conversation represents
   them. If they are not, they are false and deceitful, or at least
   unknowable and unlovable persons; and there is an end of friendship.
   But assuming that our fellow-men, or some of them, as things in
   themselves, answer to our impressions and ideas of them, what of horses
   and dogs, and the lower sentient creation generally? What again of
   plants, of minerals and gases? Are they not all so many potential
   energies, to some extent impressing us, but in great measure beyond us,
   and even when away from us still real? And in the ascending scale, what
   of angels and of God? These are interesting questions to all except the
   solipsist. Abandon solipsism, and any extreme form of idealism becomes
   impossible; nay, it may be found necessary to come to terms with
   Realistic Dualism. Does not monism spell solipsism? I have translated
   similitudo likeness,' but the intelligent reader will take it to mean
   no more than proportion,' or correspondence,' of the impression or idea
   in the mind with the thing in itself. Things in themselves' are
   knowable in point of their aptitudes in our regard, aptitudes which
   remain potential, and do not drop to zero, when not exercised. If any
   one will venture on the fatal denial of potentiality, and assume that,
   as in God, so also in the creatures of God, nothing is but what is
   actualised, no logic can save him from the last excesses of pantheism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIV--That the Divine Essence, being One, is the proper Likeness
   and Type of all things Intelligible [106]

   BUT again it may seem to some difficult or impossible that one and the
   same simple being, as the divine essence, should be the proper type
   (propria ratio) and likeness of different things. For as different
   things are distinguished by means of their proper forms, it needs must
   be that what is like one thing according to its proper form should be
   found unlike to another.

   True indeed, different things may have one point of likeness in so far
   as they have one common feature, as man and ass, inasmuch as they are
   animals. If it were by mere discernment of common features that God
   knew things, it would follow that He had not a particular but only a
   general knowledge of things (contrary to Chap. [63]L). To return then
   to a proper and particular knowledge, of which there is here question.

   The act of knowledge is according to the mode in which the likeness of
   the known object is in the knowing mind: for the likeness of the known
   object in the knowing mind is as the form by which that mind is set to
   act. If therefore God has a proper and particular knowledge of many
   different things, He must be the proper and particular type of each. We
   have to enquire how that can be. [107]

   As the Philosopher says, the forms of things, and the definitions which
   mark such forms, are like numbers, in which the addition or subtraction
   of unity varies the species of the number. So in definitions: one
   differentia subtracted or added varies the species: thus sentient
   substance' varies in species by the addition of irrational' or
   rational.' But in instances of the many in one' the condition of the
   understanding is not as the condition of concrete nature. The nature of
   a concrete being does not admit of the severance of elements, the union
   of which is requisite to the existence of that being: thus animal
   nature will not endure if the soul be removed from the body. But the
   understanding can sometimes take separately elements that in actual
   being are united, when one of them does not enter into the concept of
   the other; thus in three' it may consider two' only, and in rational
   animal' the 'sentient' element alone. Hence the understanding may take
   what is inclusive of many elements for a proper specimen of many, by
   apprehending some of them without others. It may take ten' as a proper
   specimen of nine by subtraction of one unit, and absolutely as a proper
   specimen of all the numbers included in ten.' So also in man' it might
   recognise a proper type of irrational animal' as such, and of all the
   species of irrational animal,' unless these species involved some
   positive differentias. [108] Therefore a certain philosopher, named
   Clement, said that in the scale of beings the nobler are types and
   patterns of the less noble. [109] Now the divine essence contains in
   itself the noble qualities of all beings, not by way of a compound but
   by way of a perfect being (Chap. [64]XXXI). Every form, as well
   particular as general, is a perfection in so far as it posits
   something; and involves imperfection only in so far as it falls short
   of true being. The divine understanding then can comprehend whatever is
   proper to each in its essence, by understanding wherein each thing
   imitates the divine essence, and wherein it falls short of the
   perfection proper to that essence. Thus, by understanding its own
   essence as imitable in the way of life without consciousness, it
   gathers the proper form of a plant, by understanding the same essence
   as imitable in the way of consciousness without intellect, the proper
   form of an animal; and so of the rest. Evidently then the divine
   essence, inasmuch as it is absolutely perfect, may be taken as the
   proper type of each entity; and hence by it God may have a particular
   knowledge of all. But because the proper type of one is distinct from
   the proper type of another -- and distinction is the principle of
   plurality -- there must be observable in the divine intellect a
   distinction and plurality of recognised types, in so far as the content
   of the divine mind is the proper type of different things. And as it is
   in this way that God is cognisant of the special relation of likeness
   that each creature bears to Him, it follows that the types (rationes)
   of things on the divine mind are not several or distinct, except in so
   far as God knows things to be in several divers ways capable of
   assimilation to Himself.

   And from this point of view Augustine says that God has made man in one
   plan and horse on another; and that the plans or types of things exist
   severally in the divine mind (De div. quaest., LXXXIII, 46). And herein
   also is defensible in some sort the opinion of Plato, who supposes
   Ideas, according to which all beings in the material world are formed.
   [110]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [106] The doctrine in this chapter should be compared with the Hegelian
   doctrine of the background,' which lies beyond all differences -- on
   which all distinctions are projected' -- in which all contradictions
   are reconciled, all opposites meet in unity.

   [107] Knowledge is by likeness of the mental impression to the thing
   known. As the likeness, so the knowledge. For a knowledge at once
   particular and all-embracing, there must be in the mind a likeness of
   all and each of the things known. But God has such a particular
   knowledge of all and each of His creatures, as well actual as possible
   (Chap. L). There must then be in God a mental likeness of each and
   every such creature. But whatever is in God is God's own essence, which
   is one and simple. How then can the one, simple essence of God be a
   particular likeness of each of the whole multitude of actual and
   possible creatures? That is the question.

   [108] A positive differentia would be an attribute, which by what it
   was, not by what it came short of being, could not possibly have place
   in man. Winged might be suggested as such a differentia.

   [109] Quoted from the pseudo-Dionysius, De div. Nom. c. 5, a writer of
   the fifth or sixth century, who well may be quoting Clement of
   Alexandria.

   [110] This explains how God knows types, but not His knowledge of
   existing individuals, as John, this tree, my violin. Incidentally, to
   take a favourite thought of Newman's, as all possible creation exists
   typically in the divine essence, so the Catholic faith contains all the
   truths, speculative and practical, of all religions and all moralities,
   minus their negations, in which, so far as they are false, their
   falsehood lies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LV--That God understands all things at once and together

   THE reason why our understanding cannot understand many things together
   in one act is because in the act of understanding the mind becomes one
   with the object understood; [111] whence it follows that, were the mind
   to understand many things together in one act, it would be many things
   together, all of one genus, which is impossible. Intellectual
   impressions are all of one genus: they are of one type of being in the
   existence which they have in the mind, although the things of which
   they are impressions do not agree in one type of being: hence the
   contrariety of things outside the mind does not render the impressions
   of those things in the mind contrary to one another. And hence it is
   that when many things are taken together, being anyhow united, they are
   understood together. Thus a continuous whole is understood at once, not
   part by part; and a proposition is understood at once, not first the
   subject and then the predicate: because all the parts are known by one
   mental impression of the whole. [112] Hence we gather that whatever
   several objects are known by one mental presentation, can be understood
   together: but God knows all things by that one presentation of them,
   which is His essence; therefore He can understand all together and at
   once.

   2. The faculty of knowledge does not know anything actually without
   some attention and advertence. Hence the phantasms, stored in the
   sensorium, are at times not actually in the imagination, because no
   attention is given to them. We do not discern together a multitude of
   things to which we do not attend together: but things that necessarily
   fall under one and the same advertence and attention, are necessarily
   understood together. Thus whoever institutes a comparison of two
   things, directs his attention to both and discerns both together. But
   all things that are in the divine knowledge must necessarily fall under
   one advertence; for God is attentive to behold His essence perfectly,
   which is to see it to the whole reach of its virtual content, which
   includes all things. God therefore, in beholding His essence, discerns
   at once all things that are.

   6. Every mind that understands one thing after another, is sometimes
   potentially intelligent, sometimes actually so; for while it
   understands the first thing actually, it understands the second
   potentially. But the divine mind is never potentially intelligent, but
   always actually: it does not, then, understand things in succession,
   but all at once.

   Holy Scripture witnesses to this truth, saying that with God there is
   no change nor shadow of vicissitude (James i, 17).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [111] There is no idealism in this statement. See Aristotle, De Anima,
   iii, 8. The act of understanding consists in forming in the mind an
   image of the thing understood. The mind in understanding becomes an
   image, and the object in being understood becomes that same image. So
   St Thomas explains in the opening of Chapter LIII.

   [112] The argument is this. The mind cannot resolve itself into several
   distinct and independent things at once: but unify those things
   somehow, subordinate and make a whole of them, so doing the mind can be
   all those things,' that is to say, it makes to itself a representation
   of them altogether, regarding them as one, lumping them together from
   one point of view.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVI--That there is no Habitual Knowledge in God

   IN whatever minds there is habitual knowledge, not all things are known
   together: but some things are known actually, others habitually. But in
   God all things are known actually (Chap. [65]LV).

   2. He who has a habit of knowledge, and is not adverting to what he
   knows, is in a manner in potentiality, although otherwise than as he
   was before he understood at all: but the divine mind is nowise in
   potentiality.

   3. In every mind that knows anything habitually, the mind's essence is
   different from its intellectual activity, which is the act of attentive
   thought. To such a mind, in habitual knowledge, activity is lacking,
   though the essence of the mind itself cannot be lacking. [113] But in
   God His essence is His activity (Chap. [66]XLV).

   4. A mind that knows habitually only, is not in its ultimate
   perfection: hence that best of goods, happiness, is not taken to be in
   habit but in act. If then God is habitually knowing, He will not be
   all-perfect (contrary to Chap. [67]XXVIII).

   5. As shown in chapter [68]XLVI, God has understanding by His essence,
   not by any intelligible forms superadded to His essence. But every mind
   in habitual knowledge understands by some such forms: for a habit is
   either a predisposition of the mind to receive mental impressions, or
   forms, whereby it comes actually to understand; or it is an orderly
   aggregation of such forms, existing in the mind, not in complete
   actuality, but in some manner intermediate between potentiality and
   actuality. [114]

   6. A habit is a quality: but in God there can be neither quality nor
   any other accident (Chap. [69]XXIII): habitual knowledge therefore is
   not proper to God.

   Because the mental state of thinking, or willing, or acting habitually
   only, is like the state of a sleeper, David says, by way of removing
   all habitual states from God: Lo, he shall not slumber or sleep who
   keepeth Israel (Ps. cxx, 4). And again it is said: The eyes of the Lord
   are far brighter than the sun (Ecclus xxiii, 28), for the sun is always
   in the act of shining.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [113] For the idealist, this distinction does not hold between the
   essence and the activity of mind, or of any other substantial being.

   [114] This latter is the habit,' made so much of in the Nicomachean
   Ethics, according to which knowledge is a habit, and virtue a habit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVII--That the Knowledge of God is not a Reasoned Knowledge

   OUR thought is then reasoned, when we pass from one object of thought
   to another, as in making syllogisms from principles to conclusions.
   Reasoning or arguing does not consist in seeing how a conclusion
   follows from premises by inspection of both together. That is not
   argument, but judging of argument. [115] Now God does not think of one
   thing after another in any sort of succession, but of all things at
   once (Chap. [70]LV). His knowledge therefore is not reasoned or
   argumentative, although He knows the argument and reason of all things.

   2. Every reasoner intues principles with one thought, and the
   conclusion with another. There would be no need to proceed to a
   conclusion from the consideration of premises, if the mere
   consideration of the premises at once laid the conclusion bare. But God
   knows all things by one act which is His essence (Chap. [71]LV). His
   knowledge therefore is not argumentative.

   3. All argumentative knowledge has something of actuality and something
   of potentiality, for conclusions are potentially in premises. But in
   the divine mind potentiality has no place.

   5. Things that are known naturally are known without reasoning, as
   appears in the case of first principles. But in God there can be no
   knowledge that is not natural, nay, essential: for His knowledge is His
   essence.

   7. Only in its highest advance does the inferior touch upon the
   superior. But the highest advance of our knowledge is not reasoning,
   but intuition (intellectus), which is the starting-point of reasoning.
   God's knowledge then is not rational,' in the sense of argumentative,'
   but intuitive only. [116]

   8. Reasoning means a lack of intuition: the divine knowledge therefore
   is not reasoned.

   If any should take it amiss that God cannot make a syllogism, let them
   mark that He has the knowledge how to make syllogisms as one judging of
   them, not as one arguing syllogistically.

   To this there is witness of Holy Scripture in the text: All things are
   naked and open to his eyes (Heb. iv, 13): whereas things that we know
   by reasoning are not of themselves naked and open to us, but are opened
   out and laid bare by reason.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [115] St Thomas's words here and in the next argument should be
   considered by any student of J. S. Mill's Logic. Mill judged the
   syllogism from ready-made specimens, failing to note that the power of
   syllogism and the ability of a syllogiser is displayed, not in the made
   syllogism, but in syllogising. It is such a view as would be that of
   the biologist, who considered only dead plants and animals, and
   undervalued life accordingly.

   [116] Reasoning all rests ultimately on intuitive first principles. All
   men intue' something: but a man of genius intues far beyond other men.
   His followers take his word an trust. To the world at large, the
   soundness of his judgement is vindicated by experience: scholars and
   critics arrive at some appreciation of it by a slow process of
   reasoning. Instances are found in Newton's Principia and the campaigns
   of Marlbro'.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVIII--That God does not understand by Combination and
   Separation of Ideas

   THINGS mentally combinable and separable are naturally considered by
   the mind apart from one another: for there would be no need of their
   combination and separation, if by the mere apprehension of a thing as
   being it were at once understood what was in it or not in it. [117] If
   therefore God understood by a mental process of combination and
   separation, it would follow that He did not take in all things at one
   glance, but each thing apart, contrary to what has been shown above
   (Chap. [72]LV).

   3. A mind that combines and separates, forms different judgements by
   different combinations. For a mental combination does not go beyond the
   terms of the combination. Hence, in the combination, or affirmative
   judgement (compositione), whereby the mind judges that man is an
   animal, it does not judge that a triangle is a figure. Now combination
   or separation is an operation of the mind. If God therefore views
   things by mentally combining and separating them, His mental act will
   not be one only but manifold; and so His essence will not be one only.

   Not for this however must we say that He is ignorant of tenable
   propositions: for His one and simple essence is the pattern of all
   things manifold and compound; and so by it God knows the whole
   multitude and complexity as well of actual nature as of the ideal world
   (tam naturae quam rationis).

   This is in consonance with the authority of Holy Scripture: for it is
   said, For my thoughts are not your thoughts (Isa. lv, 8); and yet, The
   Lord knoweth the thoughts of men (Ps. xciii, 11), which certainly
   proceed by combination and separation of ideas.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [117] If the English language would allow us, we might say: If from the
   mere is-ness (esse) of the thing we at once knew its what-ness
   (quidditas, essentia).'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIX--That the Truth to be found in Propositions is not excluded
   from God

   THOUGH the knowledge of the divine mind is not after the manner of
   combination and separation of ideas in affirmative and negative
   propositions, nevertheless there is not excluded from it that truth
   which, according to the Philosopher, obtains only in such combinations
   and separations. [118] For since the truth of the intellect is an
   equation of the intellect and the thing, inasmuch as the intellect says
   that to be which is, or that not to be which is not, truth belongs to
   that in the intellect which the intellect says, not to the act whereby
   it says it; for it is not requisite to the truth of the intellect that
   the mere act of understanding be equated to the thing, but what the
   mind says and knows by understanding must be equated to the thing, so
   that the case of the thing shall be as the mind says it is. But God by
   his simple understanding, in which there is no combination and
   separation of ideas, knows not only the essence of things, but also the
   propositions that are tenable concerning them (Chap. [73]LVII,
   [74]LVIII). Thus what the divine mind says by understanding is
   affirmation and negation. [119] Therefore the simplicity of the divine
   mind does not import the shutting out from it of truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [118] The allusion is to a doctrine, common in the schools, that truth
   and falsehood, strictly speaking, are not found in ideas and words, but
   in judgements and propositions. How then is there truth in God, if He
   makes no propositions? That is the difficulty. The answer is, that He
   knows what might be said of everything, all true propositions that
   might be made about it, though His mind does not express itself in
   propositions, but is one simple apprehension.

   [119] That is to say, it is equivalent to all the knowledge that can
   ever be got into any affirmative or negative propositions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LX--That God is Truth

   TRUTH is a perfection of the understanding and of its act. But the
   understanding of God is His substance; and the very act of
   understanding, as it is the being of God, is perfect as the being of
   God is perfect, not by any superadded perfection, but by itself. It
   remains therefore that the divine substance is truth itself.

   4. Though truth is properly not in things but in the mind, nevertheless
   a thing is sometimes called true, inasmuch as it properly attains the
   actuality of its proper nature. Hence Avicenna says that the truth of a
   thing is a property of the fixed and appointed being of each thing,
   inasmuch as such a thing is naturally apt to create a true impression
   of itself, and inasmuch as it expresses the proper idea of itself in
   the divine mind. [120] But God is His own essence: therefore, whether
   we speak of truth of the intellect or truth of the object, God is His
   own truth.

   This is also confirmed by the authority of our Lord saying of Himself:
   I am the way and the truth and the life (John xiv, 6).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [120] As we speak of a true soldier.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXI--That God is pure Truth

   THE understanding is not liable to error in its knowledge of abstract
   being, as neither is sense in dealing with the proper object of each
   sense. [121] But all the knowledge of the divine mind is after the
   manner of a mind knowing abstract being (Chap. [75]LVIII): it is
   impossible therefore for error or deception or falsehood to creep into
   the cognitive act of God.

   3. The intellect does not err over first principles, but over reasoned
   conclusions from first principles. But the divine intellect is not
   reasoning or argumentative (Chap. [76]LVII), and is therefore not
   liable to deception. [122]

   4. The higher any cognitive faculty is, the more universal and
   far-reaching is its proper object: hence what sight is cognisant of
   accidentally, [123] general sensibility or imagination seizes upon as a
   content of its proper object. But the power of the divine mind is the
   acme of cognitive power: therefore all things knowable stand to it as
   proper and ordinary objects of knowledge, not as accidental objects.
   But over proper and ordinary objects of knowledge a cognitive faculty
   never makes a mistake.

   5. An intellectual virtue is a perfection of the understanding in
   knowing. It never happens that the understanding utters anything false,
   but its utterance is always true, when prompted by any intellectual
   virtue; for it is the part of virtue to render an act good, and to
   utter truth is the good act of the understanding. But the divine mind,
   being the acme of perfection, is more perfect by its nature than the
   human mind by any habit of virtue.

   6. The knowledge of the human mind is in a manner caused by things:
   hence it comes to be that things knowable are the measure of human
   knowledge: for the judgement of the mind is true, because the thing is
   so. But the divine mind by its knowledge is the cause of things. [124]
   Hence God's knowledge must be the measure of things, as art is the
   measure of products of art, whereof the perfection of each varies
   according to its agreement with art. Thus the divine mind stands to
   things as things stand to the human mind. But any error that arises out
   of any inequality between the human mind and the thing is not in
   things, but in the mind. If therefore there were not an absolutely
   perfect correspondence of the divine mind with things, the error would
   be in the things, not in the divine mind. There is however no error in
   the things that be: because each has so much of truth as it has of
   being. There is then no failure of correspondence between the divine
   mind and the things that be.

   Hence it is said: God is truthful (Rom. iii, 4): God is not like man,
   that he should lie (Num. xxiii, 19): God is light, and there is no
   darkness in him (1 John i, 5).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [121] If an ear mistakes a sound or the eye a colour, the aurist, or
   the oculist, at once infers that the organ is unhealthy; as sound is
   the "proper object" of hearing, and colour of sight. But a mistake
   about the direction of a sound, or the distance of a hill, shows, not
   an unhealthy, but an untrained ear or eye; as direction and distance
   are "accidental objects" of hearing and sight. In like manner the
   understanding in health, or the normal understanding, never errs when
   it says, Here's something': this is the cognition of "abstract being,"
   the "proper object " of the understanding.

   [122] Man is never out in his intuitions, only in his reasonings: but
   the divine mind is one all-comprehensive intuition. Such is the
   argument. But man is out in his intuitions often, when he ventures on
   intuition of complex matter, taking for self-evident what is not even
   true. Next door to the intuitions of a genius are the blunders of a
   fool. An error of judgement,' as it is called, is not usually a wrong
   piece of reasoning, but a bad attempt at intuition. St Thomas might
   reply that this comes of man attempting intuitions beyond his sphere of
   vision. But the sphere of divine vision embraces all things.

   [123] Accidentally,' i.e., not merely by sight, but by association with
   some other faculty, as when we see that a dog looks fierce.

   [124] Understand, in the ideal order of possibility and conceptual
   truth, a necessary order, -- but for contingent actual things there
   must be some reference to the divine will. Of actual things, the divine
   mind by its knowledge is the exemplar, but not the efficient cause.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXII--That the Truth of God is the First and Sovereign Truth

   THE standard in every genus is the most perfect instance of the genus.
   But the divine truth is the standard of all truth. The truth of our
   mind is measured by the object outside the mind: our understanding is
   called true, inasmuch as it is in accordance with that object. And
   again the truth of the object is measured by its accordance with the
   divine mind, which is the cause of all things (B. II, Chap. [77]XXIV),
   as the truth of artificial objects is measured by the art of the
   artificer. Since then God is the first understanding and the first
   object of understanding, the truth of every understanding must be
   measured by His truth, as everything is measured by the first and best
   of its kind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXIII--The Arguments of those who wish to withdraw from God the
   Knowledge of Individual Things [125]

   THE first argument is drawn from the very condition of individuality.
   For as matter (materia signata) [126] is the principle of
   individuality, it seems that individuals cannot be known by any
   immaterial faculty, inasmuch as all knowledge is a certain
   assimilation, and hence even in us those powers alone apprehend
   individual objects, that make use of material organs, as do the
   imagination and senses, but our understanding, which is immaterial,
   does not recognise individuals as such: much less then is the divine
   understanding apt to take cognisance of individuals, being, as it is,
   the furthest removed from matter.

   2. The second argument is that individual things do not always exist.
   Either then they will always be known by God, or they will sometimes be
   known and sometimes not known. The former alternative is impossible,
   because there can be no knowledge of that which is not: for knowledge
   is only of things true, and things that are not cannot be true. The
   second alternative is also impossible, because the knowledge of the
   divine mind is absolutely invariable (Chap. [78]XLV).

   3. The third argument is from the consideration that not all individual
   things come of necessity, but some are by contingency: hence there can
   be no certain knowledge of them except when they exist. For that
   knowledge is certain, which is infallible: but all knowledge of
   contingent being is fallible while the thing is still in the future;
   for the opposite may happen of that which is held in cognition: for if
   the opposite could not happen, the thing would be a necessity: hence
   there can be no science in us of future contingencies, only a
   conjectural reckoning. On the other hand we must suppose that all God's
   knowledge is most certain and infallible (Chap. [79]LXI). It is also
   impossible for God to begin to know anything, by reason of His
   immutability. From this it seems to follow that He does not know
   individual contingencies.

   4. The fourth argument is from this, that some individual effects have
   their cause in will. Now an effect, before it is produced, can be known
   only in its cause: for so only can it have being before it begins to
   have being in itself. But the motions of the will can be known with
   certainty by none other than the willing agent, in whose power they
   are. It is impossible therefore that God should have certain knowledge
   of such individual effects as derive their causation from a created
   will.

   5. The fifth argument is from the infinite multitude of individual
   things. The infinite as such is unknown: for all that is known is
   measured in a manner by the comprehension of the knower, measurement
   being nothing else than a marking out and ascertaining of the thing
   measured: hence every art repudiates infinities. But individual
   existences are infinite, at least potentially.

   6. The sixth argument is from the vileness of individual things. As the
   nobility of knowledge is weighed according to the nobility of the thing
   known, so the vileness also of the thing known seems to redound to the
   vileness of the knowledge. Therefore the excellent nobility of the
   divine mind does not permit of God knowing sundry most vile things that
   have individual existence.

   7. The seventh argument is from the evil that is found in sundry
   individual things. Since the object known is in some manner in the
   knowing mind, and evil is impossible in God, it seems to follow that
   God can have no knowledge at all of evil and privation: only the mind
   that is in potentiality can know that, as privation can be only in
   potentiality. [127]

   CHAPTER LXIV--A list of things to be said concerning the Divine
   Knowledge

   TO the exclusion of the above error we will show first that the divine
   mind does know individual things; secondly, that it knows things which
   actually are not; thirdly, that it knows future contingencies with
   infallible knowledge; fourthly, that it knows the motions of the will;
   fifthly, that it knows infinite things; sixthly, that it knows the
   vilest and least of things that be; seventhly, that it knows evils and
   all manner of privations or defects.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXV--That God Knows Individual Things

   GOD knows things in so far as He is the cause of them. But the
   substantial effects of divine causation are individual things,
   universals not being substantial things, but having being only in
   individuals.

   2. Since God's cognitive act is His essence, He must know all that is
   in any way in His essence; and as this essence is the first and
   universal principle of being and the prime origin of all, it virtually
   contains in itself all things that in any way whatsoever have being.

   5. In the gradation of faculties it is commonly found that the higher
   faculty extends to more terms, and yet is one; while the range of the
   lower faculty extends to fewer terms, and even over them it is
   multiplied, as we see in the case of imagination and sense, for the
   single power of the imagination extends to all that the five senses
   take cognisance of, and to more. But the cognitive faculty in God is
   higher than in man: whatever therefore man knows by the various
   faculties of understanding, imagination and sense, God is cognisant of
   by His one simple intuition. God therefore is apt to know the
   individual things that we grasp by sense and imagination.

   6. The divine mind, unlike ours, does not gather its knowledge from
   things, but rather by its knowledge is the cause of things; and thus
   its knowledge of things is a practical knowledge. But practical
   knowledge is not perfect unless it descends to individual cases: for
   the end of practical knowledge is work, which is done on individuals.

   9. As the Philosopher argues against Empedocles, God would be very
   wanting in wisdom, if He did not know individual instances, which even
   men know.

   This truth is established also by the authority of Holy Scripture, for
   it is said: There is no creature invisible in his sight: also the
   contrary error is excluded by the text: Say not, I shall be hidden from
   God; and from the height of heaven who shall mind me? (Ecclus xvi, 16).

   From what has been said it is evident how the objection to the contrary
   (Chap. [80]LXIII, 1) is inconclusive: for though the mental
   presentation whereby divine understanding understands is immaterial, it
   is still a type both of matter and form, as being the prime productive
   principle of both.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVI--That God knows things which are not [128]

   THE knowledge of the divine mind stands to things as the knowledge of
   the artificer to the products of his art. But the artificer by the
   knowledge of his art knows even those products of it which are not yet
   produced.

   3. God knows other things besides Himself by His essence, inasmuch as
   His essence is the type of other things that come forth from Him (Chap.
   [81]LIV). But since the essence of God is infinitely perfect (Chap.
   [82]XLIII), while of every other thing the being and perfection is
   limited, it is impossible for the whole sum of other things to equal
   the perfection of the divine essence. Therefore the representative
   power of that essence extends to many more things than the things that
   are. As then God knows entirely the power and perfection of His
   essence, His knowledge reaches not only to things that are, but also to
   things that are not.

   6. The understanding of God has no succession, as neither has His
   being: it is all together, ever abiding, which is the essential notion
   of eternity, whereas the duration of time extends by succession of
   before and after. The proportion of eternity to the whole duration of
   time is as the proportion of an indivisible point to a continuous
   surface, -- not of that indivisible point which is a term of the
   surface, and is not in every part of its continuous extent: for to such
   a point an instant of time bears resemblance; but of that indivisible
   point which lies outside of the surface, and yet co-exists with every
   part or point of its continuous extent: [129] for since time does not
   run beyond motion, eternity, which is altogether beyond motion, is no
   function of time. Again, since the being of the eternal never fails,
   eternity is present to every time or instant of time. Some sort of
   example of this may be seen in a circle: for a point taken on the
   circumference does not coincide with every other point; but the centre,
   lying away from the circumference, is directly opposite to every point
   on the circumference. [130] Whatever therefore is in any portion of
   time, co-exists with the eternal, as present to it, although in respect
   to another portion of time it be past or future. But nothing can
   co-exist in presence with the eternal otherwise than with the whole of
   it, because it has no successive duration. Whatever therefore is done
   in the whole course of time, the divine mind beholds it as present
   throughout the whole of its eternity; and yet it cannot be said that
   what is done in a definite portion of time has always been an existing
   fact. The conclusion is that God has knowledge of things that in the
   course of time as yet are not.

   By these reasons it appears that God has knowledge of nonentities. But
   all nonentities do not stand in the same regard to His knowledge.
   Things that neither are, nor shall be, nor have been, are known by God
   as possible to His power: hence He does not know them as being anywise
   in themselves, but only as being within the compass of divine power.
   These sort of things are said by some to be known by God with the
   knowledge of simple understanding' (notitia simplicis intelligentiae).
   But as for those things that are present, past, or future to us, God
   knows them as they are within the compass of His power; and as they are
   within the compass of their own several created causes; and as they are
   in themselves; and the knowledge of such things is called the knowledge
   of vision' (notitia visionis). For of the things that are not yet with
   us, [131] God sees not only the being that they have in their causes,
   but also the being that they have in themselves, inasmuch as His
   eternity is indivisibly present to all time. We must remember that God
   knows the being of everything through His own essence: for His essence
   is representable by many things that are not, nor ever shall be, nor
   ever have been. That same essence is the type of the power of every
   cause, in virtue of which power effects pre-exist in their causes.
   Again the being of everything, that it has in itself, is modelled upon
   the being of the divine essence. Thus then God knows nonentities
   inasmuch as in some way they have being, either in the power of God, or
   in their (creature) causes, or in themselves. [132]

   To this the authority of Holy Scripture also gives testimony: All
   things are known to the Lord our God before their creation; as also,
   after they are fully made, he regardeth all (Ecclus xxiii, 29): and,
   Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee (Jer. i, 5).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [128] The difficulty is that untractableness of the concept of Not
   Being, which is enlarged upon by Plato, Sophist, 237 sq. In so far as
   Not Being is potentially, though not actually, it is knowable by man,
   and still more by God. In fact the proper objects of abstract science
   are in this potential and ideal order, of which the actual furnishes
   illustrations. Cf. Plato, Rep. VII, 529 C.D. As St Thomas says
   presently: "Our mind could grasp the ideal essence of a lion or a
   horse, even though all such animals were destroyed."

   [129] The "continuous surface " is that of a ring, and the "point which
   lies outside of the surface" is the centre of the ring.

   [130] As between any two points you can draw a straight line, every
   point in space is directly opposite' every other point. What St Thomas
   means is that the line drawn from the centre of the circle to any point
   in the circumference makes a right angle with the tangent at that
   point.

   [131] e.g., children yet unborn.

   [132] "In themselves" so far as there is question of things that now
   are not, but have been or shall be.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVII--That God knows Individual Contingent Events [133]

   HENCE we may gather some inkling of how God has had an infallible
   knowledge of all contingent events from eternity, and yet they cease
   not to be contingent. For contingency is not inconsistent with certain
   and assured knowledge except so far as the contingent event lies in the
   future, not as it is present. While the event is in the future, it may
   not be; and thus the view of him who reckons that it still be may be
   mistaken: but once it is present, for that time it cannot but be. Any
   view therefore formed upon a contingent event inasmuch as it is present
   may be a certitude. But the intuition of the divine mind rests from
   eternity upon each and every [one] of the events that happen in the
   course of time, viewing each as a thing present. There is nothing
   therefore to hinder God from having from eternity an infallible
   knowledge of contingent events.

   2. A contingent event differs from a necessary event in point of the
   way in which each is contained in its cause. A contingent event is so
   contained in its cause as that it either may not or may ensue
   therefrom: [134] whereas a necessary event cannot but ensue from its
   cause. But as each of these events is in itself, the two do not differ
   in point of reality; and upon reality truth is founded. In a contingent
   event, considered as it is in itself, there is no question of being or
   not being, but only of being: although, looking to the future, a
   contingent event possibly may not come off. But the divine mind knows
   things from eternity, not only in the being which they have in their
   causes, but also in the being which they have in themselves.

   3. As from a necessary cause the effect follows with certainty, with
   like certainty does it follow from a contingent cause, when the cause
   is complete, provided no hindrance be placed. But as God knows all
   things (Chap. [83]L). He knows not only the causes of contingent
   events, but like-wise the means whereby they may be hindered from
   coming off. He knows therefore with certitude whether they are going to
   come off or not. [135]

   6. The knowledge of God would not be true and perfect, if things did
   not happen in the way that God apprehends them to happen. But God,
   cognisant as He is of all being of which He is the principle, knows
   every event, not only in itself, but also in its dependence on any
   proximate causes on which it happens to depend: but the dependence of
   contingent events upon their proximate causes involves their ensuing
   upon them contingently. [136] God therefore knows sundry events to
   happen, and to happen contingently: thus the certitude and truth of
   divine knowledge does not remove the contingency of events.

   7. When it is said, God knows, or knew, this coming event,' an
   intervening medium is supposed between the divine knowledge and the
   thing known, to wit, the time to which the utterance points, in respect
   to which that which is said to be known by God is in the future. But
   really it is not in the future in respect of the divine knowledge,
   which existing in the instant of eternity is present to all things. In
   respect of such knowledge, if we set aside the time of speaking, it is
   impossible to say that so-and-so is known as non-existent; and the
   question never arises as to whether the thing possibly may never occur.
   As thus known, it should be said to be seen by God as already present
   in its existence. Under this aspect, the question of the possibility of
   the thing never coming to be can no longer be raised: what already is,
   in respect of that present instant cannot but be. The fallacy then
   arises from this, that the time at which we speak, when we say God
   knows,' co-exists with eternity; or again the last time that is marked
   when we say God knew'; and thus a relation of time, past or present, to
   future is attributed to eternity, which attribution does not hold; and
   thus we have fallacia accidentis. [137]

   8. Since everything is known by God as seen by Him in the present, the
   necessity of that being true which God knows is like the necessity of
   Socrates's sitting from the fact of his being seen seated. This is not
   necessary absolutely, by necessity of the consequent,' as the phrase
   is, but conditionally, or by necessity of the consequence.' For this
   conditional proposition is necessary: He is sitting, if he is seen
   seated.' Change the conditional proposition into a categorical of this
   form: What is seen sitting, is necessarily seated': it is clear that
   the proposition is true as a phrase, where its elements are taken
   together (compositam), but false as a fact, when its elements are
   separated (divisam). [138] All these objections against the divine
   knowledge of contingent facts are fallacia compositionis et divisionis.

   That God knows future contingencies is shown also by the authority of
   Holy Scripture: for it is said of Divine Wisdom, It knows signs and
   portents beforehand, and the issues of times and ages (Wisd. viii, 8):
   and, There is nothing hidden from his eyes: from age to age he
   regardeth (Ecclus xxxix, 24, 25).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [133] A contingent event' is an event that depends on what Mill calls a
   plurality of causes': that is to say, a certain number of causes being
   jointly present; and again preventing causes, almost innumerable, being
   all absent. The absence of any of the requisite joint causes, or the
   presence of any of the preventing causes, is enough to wreck the
   sequence; and as we cannot well know what cause will be present, and
   what absent, the event to us looking forward is an uncertainty,
   something that may or may not be; and looking back upon it, after it
   has happened, we regard it as something which has been, but might not
   have been. But, to an omniscient mind, all events, so far as they
   involve mere physical causation, are hypothetically necessary: they
   must be, causes and conditions standing as they do. This hypothetical
   necessity of physical causation is otherwise called the uniformity of
   nature.' With this chapter, Book II, Chap. XXX should be compared: see
   also B. II, Chap. LV, footnote. Human acts, or acts of free will, which
   are not even hypothetically necessary, are not included in the category
   of contingent events here spoken of.

   [134] This uncertainty, as I have argue in the previous note, is a mere
   incident of the ignorance and infirmity of our minds in dealing with a
   complex case of causality. To an omniscient mind there would be no
   uncertainty. Such a mind would read the contingent event as necessarily
   contained in and necessarily following from its causes. I speak of
   events of pure physical causation: for, as I have said, of such only is
   there question here. I allow for the dependence of all physical nature
   upon the free will of God, creating things, preserving them in being
   and activity, fixing a certain collocation of causes from the first,
   and occasionally by His own special action interfering (as man in an
   inferior way also interferes) with the course of nature, by what is
   called a miracle.

   [135] The contingent' is nothing else than the hypothetically
   necessary. A wide range of causative elements and conditions, as well
   negative as positive, is requisite and must be presupposed to the
   sequence of a contingent' event. But, where all requisite conditions
   are fulfilled, the sequence of a contingent' event in physical
   causation is as necessary as that of any necessary' event from its
   cause.

   [136] Contingently' upon the whole array of proximate causes being
   present, and every effectual let or hindrance being absent.

   [137] Fallacia accidentis is when an irrelevant accident is introduced
   into the conclusion, as, You ate what you bought: but you bought raw
   fish.' Time is in irrelevant accident to the divine knowledge.

   [138] This distinction appears in modern logic books as in sensu
   composito and in sensu diviso. It has its value in the disputes on
   efficacious grace. There is a tradition of Father Gregory de Valentia,
   S.J., fainting away when it was administered to him by a Dominican
   disputant. Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire was built by "the building
   countess," of whom it was said that she would never die, while she kept
   on building. True in sensu composito only. In point of fact the lady
   died in a great frost, which stopped her building and her breath
   together.

   CHAPTER LXVIII--That God knows the Motions of the Will

   GOD knows the thoughts of minds and the volitions of hearts in virtue
   of their cause, as He is Himself the universal principle of being. All
   that in any way is, is known by God in His knowledge of His own essence
   (Chap. [84]XLIX). Now there is a certain reality in the soul, and again
   a certain reality in things outside the soul. The reality in the soul
   is that which is in the will or thought. God knows all these varieties
   of reality.

   3. As God by knowing His own being knows the being of everything, so by
   knowing His own act of understanding and will He knows every thought
   and volition.

   5. God knows intelligent substances not less well than He knows or we
   know sensible substances, seeing that intelligent substances are more
   knowable, as being better actualised.

   This is confirmed by the testimony of Holy Scripture: -- God searcher
   of hearts and reins (Ps. vii, 10): Hell and perdition are before the
   Lord: how much more the hearts of the sons of men? (Prov. xi, 11): He
   needed not that any one should bear testimony of what was in man: for
   he himself knew what was in man (John ii, 25).

   The dominion of the will over its own acts, whereby it has it in its
   power to will and not to will, is inconsistent with will-force being
   determined to one fixed mode of action: it is inconsistent also with
   the violent interference of any external agency; but it is not
   inconsistent with the influence of that Higher Cause, from whence it is
   given to the will both to be and to act. And thus in the First Cause,
   that is, in God, there remains a causal influence over the motions of
   the will, such that, in knowing Himself, God is able to know these
   motions. [139]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [139] This or that actual motion of this individual will, not being
   determinately contained in its cause, since "will-force" is not
   "determined to any fixed mode of action," how can God, by any knowledge
   of causes, gain cognisance of this particular motion of free-will as
   actually taking place? By "a causal influence over the motions of the
   will," says St Thomas. The discussion of this obscure "causal
   influence" made the strife of Thomist and Molinist in the seventeenth
   century.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXIX--That God knows infinite things [140]

   BY knowing Himself as the cause of things, He knows things other than
   Himself (Chap. [85]XLIX). But He is the cause of infinite things, if
   beings are infinite, for He is the cause of all things that are. [141]

   2. God knows His own power perfectly (Chap. [86]XLIX). But power cannot
   be perfectly known, unless all the objects to which it extends are
   known, since according to that extent the amount of the power may be
   said to be determined. But His power being infinite (Chap. [87]XLIII)
   extends to things infinite, and therefore also His knowledge.

   3. If the knowledge of God extends to all things that in any sort of
   way are, He must not only know actual being, but also potential being.
   But in the physical world there is potential infinity, though not
   actual infinity, as the Philosopher proves. God therefore knows
   infinite things, in the way that unity, which is the principle of
   number, would know infinite species of number if it knew whatever is in
   its potentiality: for unity is in promise and potency every number.
   [142]

   4. God in His essence, as in a sort of exemplar medium, knows other
   things. But as He is a being of infinite perfection, there can be
   modelled upon Him infinite copies with finite perfections, because no
   one of these copies, nor any number of them put together, can come up
   to the perfection of their exemplar; and thus there always remains some
   new way for any copy taken to imitate Him.

   10. The infinite defies knowledge in so far as it defies counting. To
   count the parts of the infinite is an intrinsic impossibility, as
   involving a contradiction. To know a thing by enumeration of its parts
   is characteristic of a mind that knows part after part successively,
   not of a mind that comprehends the several parts together. Since then
   the divine mind knows all things together without succession, it has no
   more difficulty in knowing things infinite than in knowing things
   finite.

   11. All quantity consists in a certain multiplication of parts; and
   therefore number is the first of quantities. [143] Where then plurality
   makes no difference, no difference can be made there by anything that
   follows upon quantity. But in God's knowledge many things are known in
   one, not by many different presentations, but by that one species, or
   presentation, which is the essence of God. Hence a multitude of things
   is known by God all at once; and thus plurality makes no difference in
   God's knowledge: neither then does infinity, which follows upon
   quantity.

   In accordance with this is what is said in Psalm cxlvi: And of his
   wisdom there is no telling.

   From what has been said it is clear why our mind does not know the
   infinite as the divine mind does. Our mind differs from the divine mind
   in four respects; and they make all the difference. The first is that
   our mind is simply finite, the divine mind infinite. The second is that
   as our mind knows different things by different impressions, it cannot
   extend to an infinity of things, as the divine mind can. The third
   results in this way, that as our mind is cognisant of different things
   by different impressions, it cannot be actually cognisant of a
   multitude of things at the same time; [144] and thus it could not know
   an infinity of things except by counting them in succession, which is
   not the case with the divine mind, which discerns many things at once
   as seen by one presentation. The fourth thing is that the divine mind
   is cognisant of things that are and of things that are not (Chap.
   [88]LXVI).

   It is also clear how the saying of the Philosopher, that the infinite,
   as infinite, is unknowable, is in no opposition with the opinion now
   put forth: because the notion of infinity attaches to quantity;
   consequently, for infinite to be known as infinite, it would have to be
   known by the measurement of its parts, for that is the proper way of
   knowing quantity: but God does not know the infinite in that way.
   Hence, so to say, God does not know the infinite inasmuch as it is
   infinite, but inasmuch as, to His knowledge, it is as though it were
   finite. [145]

   It is to be observed however that God does not know an infinity of
   things with the knowledge of vision,' because infinite things neither
   actually are, nor have been, nor shall be, since, according to the
   Catholic faith, there are not infinite generations either in point of
   time past or in point of time to come. But He does know an infinity of
   things with the knowledge of simple understanding': for He knows
   infinite things that neither are, nor have been, nor shall be, and yet
   are in the power of the creature; [146] and He also knows infinite
   things that are in His own power, which neither are, nor shall be, nor
   have been. Hence to the question of the knowledge of particular things
   it may be replied by denial of the major: for particular things are not
   infinite: if however they were, God would none the less know them.
   [147]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [140] See General Metaphysics, Stonyhurst Series, pp. 207-220.

   [141] &gt;At the end of this chapter, St Thomas tells us that beings
   are not infinite: i.e., there is not an infinite multitude of actual
   existences, and by no process of creation ever will there be. God's
   knowledge of infinite things then can only refer to an infinite
   multitude of things possible, but nonexistent. Then the curious
   question comes: how far do things, purely possible and never existent,
   make number, or multitude? Are ten purely possible soldiers ten
   distinct entities? I think not, if they are taken to be perfectly
   alike. But possible differences are infinite. The question has a
   bearing on the reality of the abstract science of number.

   [142] Unity is the principle of number,' but is not itself number. The
   first number, as the Greeks saw, is two. Infinity is no number either.
   It is not the crowning number of a series of finite quantities, for it
   can never be got at by counting. As compared with an infinity of a
   higher order, the infinity of a lower order again is no number: it is
   (relatively) zero. Neither in lateral extension, then, nor in vertical
   superimposition, is infinity a number. The numbers are two, three,
   four, and so on as far as you can count. Each of these terms is called
   by the schoolmen a species of number.'

   [143] Other quantities are extension, time and motion: but their parts
   are not so well marked off.

   [144] "The understanding can understand many things together, taking
   them as one, but not many things together, taking them as many. By
   taking them as one or many' I mean, by one or by several intellectual
   presentations. . . . . Whatsoever things therefore the mind can
   understand by one presentation, it can understand together. Hence God
   sees all things by one thing, which is His essence." -- St Thomas,
   Sum.Theol. I, q. 85, art. 4.

   [145] The reference is to Aristotle, Physics III, 6. The whole chapter
   is worth reading, but these words in particular: "The infinite, as
   such, is unknowable. . . . . We must not take the infinite to be any
   one definite reality, as a man, or a house, but in the sense in which
   we speak of the day' and the performance,' entities of which is
   predicated no substantial reality, but a reality that consists in
   perpetually coming to be and ceasing to be; a reality which, though
   limited, is continually other and other. For the infinite is not that,
   beyond which is nothing, but beyond which there is always something."
   Aristotle then does not admit the possibility of the actual infinite,
   full and complete, but only of the series running on without stopping,
   and never reaching a final term, which is called potential infinity.

   [146] Whether this knowledge includes act of free will, which under
   certain conditions would have been elicited, but in point of fact never
   will be elicited, by men and angels, has been the theme of a mighty
   dispute between Thomists saying no and Molinists saying yes.

   [147] The reference is to the fifth argument objected in Chap.
   [89]LXIII, which might take this form: The infinite is unknowable. But
   particular things are infinite. Therefore particular things are
   unknowable -- even to God. The major, which St Thomas speaks of
   denying, is really the minor premise of this syllogism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXX--That God knows Base and Mean Things [148]

   THE stronger an active power is, to the more remote objects does it
   extend its action. But the power of the divine mind in knowing things
   is likened to active power: since the divine mind knows, not by
   receiving aught from things, but rather by pouring its influence upon
   things. Since then God's mind is of infinite power in understanding
   (Chap. [90]XLIII), its knowledge must extend to the remotest objects.
   But the degree of nobility or baseness in all things is determined by
   nearness to or distance from God, who is the fulness of nobility.
   Therefore the very vilest things in being are known to God on account
   of the exceeding great power of His understanding.

   2. Everything that is, in so far as it has place in the category of
   substance or quality, is in actuality: it is some sort of likeness of
   the prime actuality, and is ennobled thereby. Even potential being,
   from its reference to actuality shares in nobility, and so comes to
   have the name of being.' It follows that every being, considered in
   itself, is noble; and is only mean and vile in comparison with some
   other being, nobler still. But the noblest creatures are removed from
   God at a distance not less than that which separates the highest in the
   scale of creation from the lowest. If then the one distance were to bar
   God's knowledge, much more would the other; and the consequence would
   be that God would know nothing beyond Himself.

   3. The good of the order of the universe is nobler than any part of the
   universe. If then God knows any other noble nature, most of all must He
   know the order of the universe. But this cannot be known without taking
   cognisance at once of things nobler and things baser: for in the mutual
   distances and relations of these things the order of the universe
   consists.

   4. The vileness of the objects of knowledge does not of itself redound
   on to the knower; for it is of the essence of knowledge that the knower
   should contain within himself impressions of the object known according
   to his own mode and manner. Accidentally however the vileness of the
   objects known may redound upon the knower, either because in knowing
   base and mean things he is withdrawn from the thought of nobler things,
   or because from the consideration of such vile objects he is inclined
   to some undue affections: which cannot be the case with God.

   5. A power is not judged to be small, which extends to small things,
   but only that which is limited to small things. A knowledge therefore
   that ranges alike over things noble and things mean, is not to be
   judged mean; but that knowledge is mean, which ranges only over mean
   things, as is the case with us: for we make different studies of divine
   and of human things, and there is a different science of each. But with
   God it is not so; for with the same knowledge and the same glance He
   views Himself and all other beings.

   With this agrees what is said of the Divine Wisdom: It findeth place
   everywhere on account of its purity, and nothing defiled stealeth in to
   corrupt it (Wisdom vii, 24, 25).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [148] Against Averroes, who says (Destructio destructionum, disp. 3):
   "The meaner does not understand of the nobler that which the nobler
   understands of himself; nor does the nobler understand what the meaner
   understands of himself."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXI--That God knows Evil Things

   WHEN good is known, the opposite evil is known. But God knows all
   particular good things, to which evil things are opposed: therefore God
   knows evil things.

   2. The ideas of contraries, as ideas in the mind, are not contrary to
   one another: otherwise they could not be together in the mind, or be
   known together: the idea therefore whereby evil is known is not
   inconsistent with good, but rather belongs to the idea of good (ratio
   qua cognoscitur malum ad rationem boni pertinet). [149] If then in God,
   on account of His absolute perfection, there are found all ideas of
   goodness (rationes bonitatis, as has been proved (Chap. [91]XL), It
   follows that there is in Him the idea (ratio) whereby evil is known.

   3. Truth is the good of the understanding: for an understanding is
   called good inasmuch as it knows the truth. But truth is not only to
   the effect that good is good, but also that evil is evil: for as it is
   true that what is, is, so it is true that what is not, is not. The good
   of the understanding therefore consists even in the knowledge of evil.
   But since the divine understanding is perfect in goodness, there cannot
   be wanting to it any of the perfections of understanding; and therefore
   there is present to it the knowledge of things evil.

   4. God knows the distinction of things (Chap. [92]L). But in the notion
   of distinction there is negation: for those things are distinct, of
   which one is not another: hence the first things that are of themselves
   distinct, mutually involve the exclusion of one another, by reason of
   which fast negative propositions are immediately verified of them,
   e.g., No quantity is a substance.' God then knows negation. But
   privation is a sort of negation: He therefore knows privation, and
   consequently evil, which is nothing else than a privation of due
   perfection.

   8. In us the knowledge of evil things is never blameworthy in mere
   point of knowledge, that is in the judgement that is passed about evil
   things, but accidentally, inasmuch as by the observation of evil things
   one is sometimes inclined to evil. But that cannot be in God; and
   therefore there is nothing to prevent His knowing evil.

   With this agrees what is said, that Evil surpasseth not [God's] wisdom
   (Wisd. vii, 30) and, Hell and perdition are before the Lord (Prov. xv,
   11) and, My offences are not hidden from thee (Ps. lxviii, 6); and, He
   knoweth the vanity of men, and seeing doth he not consider iniquity?
   (Job xi, 11.)

   It is to be observed however that if God's knowledge were so limited as
   that His knowledge of Himself did not involve His knowing other beings
   of finite and partial goodness, at that rate He would nowise know
   privation or evil: because to the good which is God Himself there is no
   privation opposed, since privation and its opposite are naturally about
   the same object; and so to that which is pure actuality no privation is
   opposed, and consequently no evil either. Hence on the supposition that
   God knows Himself alone, by knowing the excellences of His own being,
   He will not know evil. [150] But because in knowing Himself He knows
   beings in which privations naturally occur, He must know the opposite
   privations, and the evils opposite to particular goods.

   It must be further observed that as God, without any argumentative
   process, knows other beings by knowing Himself, so there is no need of
   His knowledge being argumentative in coming to the knowledge of evil
   things through good things: for good is as it were the ground of the
   knowledge of evil, evil being nothing else than privation of good:
   hence what is evil is known through what is good as things are known
   through their definitions, not as conclusions through their premises.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [149] "Evil is not knowable by itself, because it is of the essence of
   evil to be a privation of good; and thus it can neither be defined nor
   known except through good" (Sum. Theol., I, q. 14, art. 10, ad 4).
   "Vinegar and oil," as Aeschylus says (Agam. 322-3), "poured into the
   same vessel, stand apart in unfriendly separation." But in the vessel
   of the mind contraries do not indeed blend, but stand together, and
   even call for one another's presence, as elements mutually
   complementary. Thus, though darkness excludes light, and good evil, the
   idea of darkness is complementary to that of light, and the idea of
   evil complementary to that of good. This difference between the ideal
   and the actual order, that in actuality, contraries are mutually
   exclusive, while as thoughts they are mutually complementary, I do not
   remember to have seen noticed elsewhere.

   [150] As pure actuality, God is incapable of potentiality, and
   therefore of privation. Thus the contemplation of His own being, merely
   as His own, will not reveal to Him that of which His own being is
   incapable, -- potentiality, privation, evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXII--That God has a Will

   FROM the fact that God has understanding, it follows that He has a
   will. Since good apprehended in understanding is the proper object of
   the will, understood good, as such, must be willed good. But anything
   understood involves an understanding mind. A mind then that understands
   good, must, as such, be a mind that wills good.

   3. What is consequent upon all being, is a property of being, as such.
   Such a property must be found in its perfection in the first and
   greatest of beings. Now it is a property of all being to seek its own
   perfection and the preservation of its own existence. Every being does
   this in its own way: intelligent beings, by their will: animals, by
   their sensitive appetite: unconscious nature, by a certain physical
   nisus. [151] It makes a difference however whether the thing craved for
   is possessed or not. Where it is not possessed, the nisus of desire
   proper to each several kind goes out to seek what is wanting: where the
   thing is possessed, it is rested in and clung to. This characteristic
   of all being cannot be wanting in the first of beings, which is God.
   Since then God has understanding, He has also a will, whereby He takes
   complacency in His own being and His own goodness.

   4. The more perfect the act of understanding is, the more delightful to
   the understanding mind. But God has understanding and a most perfect
   act thereof (Chap. [93]XLIV): therefore that act yields Him the utmost
   delight. But as sensible delight is through the concupiscible appetite,
   so is intellectual delight through the will. God then has a will.

   This will of God the testimonies of Holy Scripture confess: All things
   whatsoever he hath willed, the Lord hath done (Ps. cxxxiv, 6): Who
   resisteth his will? (Rom. ix, 19).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [151] Appetitum naturalem. It is not easy to kill a willow tree, nor to
   break up an atom of water. Unstable compounds are easily broken up; but
   the more perfect and stable, with difficulty. This resistance offered
   to destruction is the physical nisus,' often spoken of by the schoolmen
   under the name of appetitus naturalis. The will is appetitus
   rationalis; and the region of soul in which passion dwells is a
   appetitus sensibilis.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIII--That the Will of God is His Essence

   GOD has will inasmuch as He has understanding. But He has understanding
   by His essence (Chap. [94]XLIV, [95]XLV), and therefore will in like
   manner.

   2. The act of will is the perfection of the agent willing. But the
   divine being is of itself most perfect, and admits of no superadded
   perfection (Chap. [96]XXIII): therefore in God the act of His willing
   is the act of His being.

   3. As every agent acts inasmuch as it is in actuality, God, being pure
   actuality, must act by His essence. But to will is an act of God:
   therefore God must will by His essence.

   4. If will were anything superadded to the divine substance, that
   substance being complete in being, it would follow that will was
   something adventitious to it as an accident to a subject; also that the
   divine substance stood to the divine will as potentiality to actuality;
   and that there was composition in God: all of which positions have been
   rejected (Chap. [97]XVI, [98]XVIII, [99]XXIII). [152]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [152] Does not this argument prove too much, either that in man too
   essence and will are the same, or that the human will is an accident to
   human substance? St Thomas would reply by a distinction between act and
   faculty. In God, the distinction does not obtain. Act and faculty are
   one in Him, one with His essence. But in man act and faculty are
   distinct. The act of volition is accidental in man, it comes and it
   goes: but the faculty or power of willing is not an accident to human
   substance, it is in essential property of the same.

   CHAPTER LXXIV--That the Object of the Will of God in the First Place is
   God Himself

   GOOD understood is the object of the will. But what is understood by
   God in the first place is the divine essence: therefore the divine
   essence is the first object of the divine will.

   3. The object in the first place willed is the cause of willing to
   every willing agent. For when we say, I wish to walk for the benefit of
   my health,' we consider that we are assigning a cause; and if we are
   further asked, Why do you wish to benefit your health?' we shall go on
   assigning causes until we come to the final end, which is the object
   willed in the first place, and is in itself the cause of all our
   willing. If then God wills anything else than Himself in the first
   place, it will follow that that 'something else' is to Him a cause of
   willing. But His willing is His being (Chap. [100]LXXIII), Therefore
   something else will be the cause of His being, which is contrary to the
   notion of the First Being.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXV--That God in willing Himself wills also other things
   besides Himself [153]

   EVERY one desires the perfection of that which for its own sake he
   wills and loves: for the things which we love for their own sakes we
   wish to be excellent, and ever better and better, and to be multiplied
   as much as possible. But God wills and loves His essence for its own
   sake. Now that essence is not augmentable and multipliable in itself
   (Chap. [101]XLII), but can be multiplied only in its likeness, which is
   shared by many. God therefore wills the multitude of things, inasmuch
   as He wills and loves His own perfection.

   3. Whoever loves anything in itself and for itself, wills consequently
   all things in which that thing is found: as he who loves sweetness in
   itself must love all sweet things. But God wills and loves His own
   being in itself and for itself; and all other being is a sort of
   participation by likeness of His being.

   6. The will follows the understanding. But God with His understanding
   understands Himself in the first place, and in Himself understands all
   other things: therefore in like manner He wills Himself in the first
   place, and in willing Himself wills all other things.

   This is confirmed by the authority of Holy Scripture: Thou lovest all
   things that are, and hatest nothing of the things that thou hast made
   (Wisd. xi, 25)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [153] Taken by itself, this chapter might seem to argue that God wills
   the existence of all things that He understands as possible, and that
   He necessarily wills the existence of things outside Himself, and so
   necessarily creates them. These conclusions are rejected in Chap.
   LXXXI. Though God understands all things possible, He does not will
   them all. If He willed them all, they would all be, which is absurd. It
   is impossible for all things severally possible ever to come to be
   conjunctively realised in actuality.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVI--That with one and the same Act of the Will God wills
   Himself and all other Beings

   EVERY power tends by one and the same activity to its object and to
   that which makes the said object an object to such a power, as with the
   same vision we see light and the colour which is made actually visible
   by light. But when we wish a thing for an end, and for that alone, that
   which is desired for the end receives from the end its character of an
   object of volition. Since then God wills all things for Himself (Chap.
   [102]LXXIV), with one act of will He wills Himself and other things.

   2. What is perfectly known and desired, is known and desired to the
   whole extent of its motive power. But a final end is a motive not only
   inasmuch as it is desired in itself, but also inasmuch as other things
   are rendered desirable for its sake. He therefore who perfectly desires
   an end, desires it in both these ways. But it is impossible to suppose
   any volitional act of God, by which He should will Himself, and not
   will Himself perfectly: since there is nothing imperfect in God. By
   every act therefore by which He wills Himself, He wills Himself and
   other things for His own sake absolutely; and other things besides
   Himself He does not will except inasmuch as He wills Himself.

   3. As promises are to conclusions in things speculative, so is the end
   to the means in things practical and desirable: for as we know
   conclusions by premises, so from the end in view proceeds both the
   desire and the carrying out of the means. If then one were to wish the
   end apart, and the means apart, by two separate acts, there would be a
   process from step to step in his volition (Chap. [103]LVII). But this
   is impossible in God, who is beyond all movement.

   7. To will belongs to God inasmuch as He has understanding. As then by
   one act He understands Himself and other beings, inasmuch as His
   essence is the pattern of them all, so by one act He wills Himself and
   all other beings, inasmuch as His goodness is the type of all goodness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVII--That the Multitude of the Objects of God's Will is not
   inconsistent with the Simplicity of His Substance

   GOD wills other things inasmuch as He wills His own goodness (Chap.
   [104]LXXV). Things then come under the will of God according as they
   are included in His goodness. But in His goodness all things are one:
   for they are in Him according to the mode that befits Him; material
   things, immaterially; and things many, in union (Chap. [105]LV,
   [106]LVIII). Thus the multitude of the objects of the divine will does
   not multiply the divine substance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVIII--That the Divine Will reaches to the good of Individual
   Existences

   THE excellence of order in the universe appears in two ways, first,
   inasmuch as the whole universe is referred to something beyond the
   universe, as an army to its leader: secondly, inasmuch as the parts of
   the universe are referred to one another, like the parts of an army;
   and the second order is for the sake of the first. But God, in willing
   Himself as an end, wills other things in their reference to Him as an
   end. He wills therefore the excellence of order in the universe in
   reference to Himself, and the excellence of order in the universe in
   mutual reference of its parts to one another. But the excellence of
   order is made up of the good of individual existences.

   This is confirmed by the authority of Scripture: God saw the light,
   that it was good (Gen. i, 4); and similarly of His other works; and
   lastly of them altogether: God saw all things that he had made, and
   they were very good (Gen. i, 31).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIX--That God wills things even that as yet are not

   SOME one might perhaps think that God wills only the things that are:
   for correlatives go together; and if one perishes, the other perishes;
   if then willing supposes a relation of the willing subject to the
   object willed, none can will any but things that are. Besides, the will
   and its objects are to one another as Creator and creature: now God
   cannot be called Creator, or Lord, or Father, except of things that
   are: neither then can He be said to will any but things that are. And
   it may be further argued, that if the divine will is invariable, as is
   the divine being, and wills only actual existences, it wills nothing
   but what always is.

   Let us say then in answer to these objections, that as good apprehended
   by the intellect moves the will, the act of the will must follow the
   condition of the mental apprehension. Now the mind apprehends the
   thing, not only as it is in the mind, but also as it is in its own
   nature: for we not only know that the thing is understood by us (for
   that is the meaning of its being in the mind'), but also that the thing
   exists, or has existed, or is to exist in its own nature. Though then
   at the time the thing has no being other than in the mind, still the
   mind stands related to it, not as it is in the mind, but as it is in
   its own nature, which the mind apprehends. Therefore the relation of
   the divine will to a non-existent thing is to the thing according as it
   is in its own nature, attached to some certain time, and not merely to
   the thing as it is in the knowledge of God. For God wills the thing,
   that is not now, to be in some certain time: He does not merely will it
   inasmuch as He Himself understands it. [154]

   Nor is the relation of the will to its object similar to the relation
   of Creator to creature, of Maker to made, of Lord to subject. For will,
   being an immanent act, does not involve the actual external existence
   of the thing willed: [155] whereas making and creating and governing do
   signify an action terminated to an external effect, such that without
   its existence such action is unintelligible.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [154] God wills the thing, not merely, to be in His eternal
   understanding of it; but to be in rerum natura at some fixed time; and
   (contrary to what idealists generally hold) its existence in rerum
   natura is other than its existence in the divine understanding.

   [155] And yet, "If He willed them, those creatures would exist" (Chap.
   LXXXI, n. 3), -- Of course, for such time as God's will determined for
   them to exist in. This touches the difficult point of the distinction,
   if any is to be drawn, between the will and the power of the Almighty.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXX--That God of necessity wills His own Being and His own
   Goodness

   GOD wills His own being and His own goodness as His first object and
   reason for willing all other things (Chap. [107]LXXIV), and this He
   wills in everything that He does will. Nor is it possible for Him to
   will it merely potentially: He must will it actually, as His willing is
   His being.

   4. All things, in so far as they have existence, are likened to God,
   who is the first and greatest being. But all things, in so far as they
   have existence, cherish their own being naturally in such manner as
   they can. Much more therefore does God cherish His own being naturally.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXI--That God does not of necessity love other things than
   Himself

   A WILL does not of necessity tend to the means to an end, if the end
   can be had without those means. Since then the divine Goodness can be
   without other beings, -- nay, other beings make no addition to it, --
   God is under no necessity of willing other things from the fact of His
   willing His own goodness.

   2. Since good, understood to be such, is the proper object of the will,
   the will may fasten on any object conceived by the intellect in which
   the notion of good is fulfilled. Hence though the being of anything, as
   such, is good, and its not-being, as such, is evil; still the very not-
   being of a thing may become an object to the will, though not of
   necessity, by reason of some notion of good fulfilled: for it is good
   for a thing to be, even though some other thing is not. [156] The only
   good then which the will by the terms of its constitution cannot wish
   not to be, is the good whose non-existence would destroy the notion of
   good altogether. Such a good is no other than God. The will then by its
   constitution can will the non-existence of anything else except of God.
   [157] But in God there is will according to the fulness of the power of
   willing. God then can will the non-existence of any other being besides
   Himself.

   3. God in willing His own goodness wills also other things than Himself
   as sharing His goodness. But since the divine goodness is infinite, and
   partakable in infinite ways, if by the willing of His own goodness He
   of necessity willed the beings that partake of it, the absurdity would
   follow that He must will the existence of infinite creatures sharing
   His goodness in infinite ways: because, if He willed them, those
   creatures would exist, since His will is the principle of being to
   creatures.

   We must consider therefore why God of necessity knows other beings than
   Himself, and yet does not of necessity will them to exist,
   notwithstanding that His understanding and willing of Himself involves
   His understanding and willing other beings. The reason of it is this:
   an intelligent agent's understanding anything arises from a certain
   condition of the understanding, -- for by a thing being actually
   understood its likeness is in the mind: but a volitional agent's
   willing anything arises from a certain condition of the object willed,
   -- for we will a thing either because it is an end, or because it is a
   means to an end. Now the divine perfection necessarily requires that
   all things should so be in God as to be understood in Him. But the
   divine goodness does not of necessity require that other things should
   exist to be referred to Him as means to an end; and therefore it is
   necessary that God should know other things, but not that He should
   will other things. [158] Hence neither does He will all things that are
   referable to His goodness: but He knows all things which are in any way
   referable to His essence, whereby He understands.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [156] How can mere not-being, as such, be an object of the will at all?
   St Thomas perhaps is speaking of two existences incompatible with one
   another. But it is well to remark, there is a difference between
   not-willing, which is a mere vacuity of will, and willing-not, which is
   a positive act of will. The question may be raised, whether for things
   possible, but eternally non existent, any divine decree is requisite to
   keep them out of existence. Is it not enough that there is no decree to
   call them into existence? Or is such a decree of exclusion rendered
   requisite by the conjuntion of a perfect will with a perfect actual
   knowledge? Anyhow God is under no antecedent necessity of decreeing the
   existence of any creature, because He is well enough without creatures,
   supremely self-sufficient and independent of all creation: which
   independence and self-sufficiency is the root of the divine free-will
   ad extra: which free-will again alone bars pantheism, disconcerts
   idealism (by taking away the determinism to which it leads), saves the
   notion of a Personal God, and with it prayer, miracles, Christianity.

   [157] A perverse will can will the non-existence of God Himself. St
   Thomas is speaking of the normal will, which takes a right view of God,
   as the perverse will does not.

   [158] It is necessary that He should know other things as intelligible
   and possible, not that He should will other things to come to actual
   existence. Once more the ideal order is necessary, but not the actual
   order of creation. The one necessary actuality is God. Though creatures
   are means to God's end, they are not necessary means to any necessary
   end of His: therefore their existence is not necessarily willed by Him,
   albeit their possibility is necessarily discerned.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXII--Arguments against the aforesaid Doctrine and Solutions
   of the same

   THESE awkward consequences seem to follow, if any things that God wills
   He does not will of necessity.

   1. If the will of God in respect of certain objects of will is not
   determined by any of them, it seems to be indifferent. But every
   faculty that indifferent is in a manner in potentiality.

   2. Since potential being, as such, is naturally changeable, -- for what
   can be can also not be, -- it follows that the divine will is variable.
   [159]

   4. Since what hangs loose, indifferent between two alternatives, does
   not tend to one rather than to the other, unless it be determined by
   one or other, either God wills none of the things to which He is
   indifferent, or He is determined by one or other of them, in which case
   there must be something antecedent to God to determine Him.

   But none of the above objections can stand.

   1. The indifference, or indeterminateness, of a faculty may be
   attributable either to the faculty itself or to its object. To the
   faculty itself, when its indeterminateness comes from its not having
   yet attained to its perfection. This argues imperfection in the
   faculty, and an unfulfilled potentiality, as we see in the mind of a
   doubter, who has not yet attained to premises sufficient to determine
   him to take either of two sides. To the object of the faculty, when the
   perfect working of the faculty does not depend on its adoption of
   either alternative, and yet either alternative may be adopted, as when
   art may employ different instruments to do the same work equally well.
   This argues no imperfection in the faculty, but rather its pre-eminent
   excellence, inasmuch as it rises superior to both opposing
   alternatives, and therefore is indifferent to both and determined by
   neither. Such is the position of the divine will with respect to things
   other than itself. Its perfection depends on none of them; being as it
   is intimately conjoined with its own last end and final perfection.
   [160]

   2. In the divine will there is no potentiality. Unnecessitated, it
   prefers one alternative to another respecting the creatures which it
   causes to be. It is not to be looked upon as being in a potential
   attitude to both alternatives, so as first to be potentially willing
   both, and then to be actually willing one. It is for ever actually
   willing whatever it wills, as well its own self as the creatures which
   are the objects of its causation. But whatever creature God wills to
   exist, that creature stands in no necessary relation to the divine
   goodness, which is the proper object of the divine will.

   4. We cannot admit that either the divine will wills none of the
   effects of its causation, or that its volition is determined by some
   exterior object. The proper object of the will is good apprehended as
   such by the understanding. Now the divine understanding apprehends, not
   only the divine being, or divine goodness, but other good things
   likewise (Chap. [108]XLIX); and it apprehends them as likenesses of the
   divine goodness and essence, not as constituent elements of the same.
   Thus the divine will tends to them as things becoming its goodness, not
   as things necessary to its goodness. So it happens also in our will:
   which, when it inclines to a thing as absolutely necessary to its end,
   tends to it with a certain necessity; but when it tends to a thing
   solely on account of its comeliness and appropriateness, does not tend
   to it necessarily.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [159] The difficulty is, that if the created object of God's will is a
   thing that may be or may not be, God's will also of creating it may be
   or may not be.

   [160] God in willing His own goodness is not thereby necessitated to
   will the existence of, let us say, St Augustine, as though, if there
   were no Augustine, the goodness of God would be incomplete. This
   argument of God's absolute self-sufficiency, His supreme independence
   of creation, and consequent perfect liberty to create or not, is, I am
   informed, the tenet of some at least of the wisest Brahmins of India.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXIII--That God wills anything else than Himself with an
   Hypothetical Necessity [161]

   IN every unchangeable being, whatever once is, cannot afterwards cease
   to be. Since then God's will is unchangeable, supposing Him to will
   anything, He cannot on that supposition not will it.

   2. Everything eternal is necessary. But God's will for the causation of
   any effect is eternal: for, as His being, so His willing is measured by
   eternity. That will therefore is necessary, yet not absolutely so,
   since the will of God has no necessary connexion with this objection
   willed. It is therefore necessary hypothetically, on a supposition.

   3. Whatever God once could do, He can still. His power does not grow
   less, as neither does His essence. But He cannot now not-will what He
   is already supposed to have willed, because His will cannot change:
   therefore He never could not-will whatever He once willed (nunquam
   potuit non velle quidquid voluit). [162] It is therefore hypothetically
   necessary for Him to have willed whatever He has willed, as it is for
   Him to will whatever He does will: but in neither case is the necessity
   absolute.

   4. Whoever wills anything, necessarily wills all that is necessarily
   requisite to that purpose, unless there be some defect on his part,
   either by ignorance, or because his will sometimes is drawn away by
   some passion from a right choice of means to the end: nothing of which
   can be said of God. If God then in willing Himself wills anything else
   besides Himself, He needs must will all that is necessarily required to
   the effecting of the thing willed, as it is necessary that God should
   will the being of a rational soul, if He wills the being of a man.
   [163]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [161] Otherwise called a consequent, as distinguished from an
   antecedent, or absolute, necessity.

   [162] Once God wills absolutely, even though freely, He wills
   irrevocably. He never has to change His mind upon any unforeseen
   obstacle or intercession. He threatened the Ninivites, whose repentance
   He foresaw, and whose pardon upon repentance He had decreed.

   [163] And, possibly, the human shape, if He wishes the being of a
   rational animal. Or is a rational animal possible in the shape of a
   pig? Who shall reckon or particularise the essential connexions and
   repugnances of things? How much, that we might wish to cast out,
   cleaves to nature and must be, if natural things are to be at all! How
   thoughtlessly may we murmur at God for not severing two elements
   essentially inseparable, or not conjoining two others mutually
   repugnant! Is it possible under any circumstances, or under what
   circumstances, for man's final happiness to be secured without toil and
   trial, a crown without a cross? This is not a difficult chapter, but it
   suggests a great difficulty: how God, willing from eternity this
   present creation, is perfectly the same God as He might have been from
   eternity willing no such thing; of how, there being not the slightest
   entitative difference between God willing to create and God having no
   such will, creation, which was nothing to begin with, ever came to be
   rather than not to be. The difficulty has its foundation in this, that,
   within our experience, every new effect involves some antecedent change
   either in the agent or in the matter acted upon. The more powerful the
   agent, the less change is required, as when a strong man with little or
   no effort lifts a weight, which a weaker one would have to strain
   himself to raise from the ground. Hence we may faintly surmise how in
   the limit' an Almighty agent would act without being in the least
   altered by his action from the being that he would have been, had he
   remained at rest. Not that I take this suggestion to remove the whole
   difficulty.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXIV--That the Will of God is not of things in themselves
   Impossible

   THOSE things are in themselves impossible, which involve an
   inconsistency, as that man should be an ass, which involves the
   rational being irrational. But what is inconsistent with a thing,
   excludes some one of the conditions requisite to it, as being an ass
   excludes a man's reason. If therefore God necessarily wills the things
   requisite to that which by supposition He does will, it is impossible
   for Him to will what is inconsistent therewith.

   2. God, in willing His own being, wills all other things, that He does
   will, in so far as they have some likeness to it. But in so far as
   anything is inconsistent with the notion of being as such, there cannot
   stand therein any likeness to the first or divine being, which is the
   fountain of being. God therefore cannot will anything that is
   inconsistent with the notion of being as such, as that anything should
   be at once being and not being, that affirmation and negation should be
   true together, or any other such essential impossibility,
   inconsistency, and implied contradiction.

   3. What is no object of the intellect, can be no object of the will.
   But essential impossibilities, involving notions mutually inconsistent,
   are no objects of intellect, except perchance through the error of a
   mind that does not understand the proprieties of things, which cannot
   be said of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXV--That the Divine Will does not take away Contingency from
   things [164]

   HYPOTHETICAL necessity in the cause cannot lead to absolute necessity
   in the effect. But God's will about a creature is not absolutely
   necessary, but hypothetically so (Chap. [109]LXXXIII). Therefore the
   divine will is no argument of absolute necessity in creatures. But only
   this absolute necessity excludes contingency: for even a contingent
   fact may be extended either way into an hypothetical necessity: thus it
   is necessary that Socrates moves, if he runs. It does not therefore
   follow that a thing happens of necessity, if God wills it: all that
   holds is the necessary truth of this conditional: If God wills
   anything, the thing will be': but the consequent' (as distinguished
   from the consequence') need not be a necessary truth. [165]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [164] A contingent' thing, be it remembered, is a thing that actually
   is, but absolutely might not be. Except God, all actuality is
   ultimately contingent, however it be often hypothetically necessary.

   [165] Thus in the proposition: If I find the money, I shall pay twenty
   shillings in the pound': the truth of the consequence' is small comfort
   to my rueful creditors for the falsity of the consequent'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXVI--That Reason can be assigned for the Divine Will [166]

   THE end is a reason for willing the means. But God wills His own
   goodness as an end, and all things else as means thereto: His goodness
   therefore is a reason why He wills other things different from Himself.

   2. The good of a part is ordained to the end of the good of the whole,
   as the imperfect to the perfect. But things become objects of the
   divine will according as they stand in the order of goodness. It
   follows that the good of the universe is the reason why God wills every
   good of any part of the universe.

   3. Supposing that God wills anything, it follows of necessity that He
   wills the means requisite thereto. But what lays on others a necessity
   for doing a thing, is a reason for doing it. Therefore the
   accomplishment of a purpose, to which such and such means are
   requisite, is a reason to God for willing those means.

   We may therefore proceed as follows. God wishes man to have reason, to
   the end that he may be man: He wishes man to be, to the end of the
   completion of the universe: He wishes the good of the universe to be,
   because it befits His own goodness. [167] The same proportion however
   is not observable in all three stages of this ratiocination. The divine
   goodness does not depend on the perfection of the universe, and
   receives no accession thereby. The perfection of the universe, though
   depending necessarily on the good of some particular components, which
   are essential parts of the universe, has no necessary dependence on
   others, although even from them some goodness or beauty accrues to the
   universe, such things serving solely for the fortification (munimentum)
   or embellishment of the rest. But any particular good depends
   absolutely on the elements that are requisite to it: and still even
   such goods have adjuncts that go merely to better their condition.
   Sometimes therefore the reason of the divine will involves mere
   becomingness, sometimes utility, sometimes also hypothetical necessity,
   but never absolute necessity, except when the object of God's volition
   is God Himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [166] Reason is absolutely assignable for the volitions of God
   regarding the universe: but relatively to us, we can assign it but
   vaguely, and, revelation apart, with much uncertainty. By aid of the
   Aristotelian and Ptolemaic cosmogonies, mediaeval writers had much to
   say of "the perfection of the universe," over which sayings the modern
   astronomer stands amazed, murmuring low to himself, if he is a pious
   man, Nimis profundae factae sunt cogitationes tuae (Ps. xci). A
   characteristic of the Middle Ages is idealisation of unity, permanence,
   and systematic completeness in the social, political, religious, and
   even in the cosmic order. To us "the perfection of the universe" is a
   less obvious ground of argument, There is such a perfection, doubtless,
   as the Creator is wise and good; and much of the wisdom and beauty of
   His work is manifest to our eyes; but the entirety is beyond us. We
   cannot comprehend it, as we cannot comprehend Him.

   CHAPTER LXXXVII--That nothing can be a Cause to the Divine Will

   THOUGH some reason may be assigned for the divine will, yet it does not
   follow that there is any cause of that will's volition. For the cause
   of volition is the end in view: now the end in view of the divine will
   is its own goodness: that then is God's cause of willing, which is also
   His own act of willing. But of other objects willed by God none is to
   God a cause of willing, but one of them is cause to another of its
   being referred to the divine goodness, and thus God is understood to
   will one for the sake of another. But clearly we must suppose no
   passing from point to point of God's will, where there is only one act,
   as shown above of the divine intellect (Chap. [110]LVII). For God by
   one act wills His own goodness and all other things, as His action is
   His essence.

   By this and the previous chapter the error is excluded of some who say
   that all things proceed from God by sheer will, so that no reason is to
   be rendered of anything that He does beyond the fact that God so wills.
   Which position is even contrary to divine Scripture, which tells us
   that God has done all things according to the order of His wisdom: Thou
   hast done all things in wisdom (Ps. ciii, 24); and God has shed wisdom
   over all his works (Ecclus i, 10).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXVIII--That there is a Free Will in God

   GOD does not necessarily will things outside Himself (Chap.
   [111]LXXXI).

   3. Will is of the end: choice of the means. [168] Since then God wills
   Himself as end, and other things as means, it follows that in respect
   of Himself He has will only, but in respect of other things choice. But
   choice is always an act of free will.

   4. Man by free will is said to be master of his own acts. But this
   mastery belongs most of all to the Prime Agent, whose act depends on no
   other. [169]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [168] The terminology is from Aristotle, Eth. Nic. III, 1113. What St
   Thomas here calls voluntas, and elsewhere intentio is the Aristotelian
   boulesis. Choice, electio, is proairesis. See my Ethics and Natural
   Law, pp. 31 sq.; Aquinas Ethicus I, 52-54.

   [169] For Scripture authority St Thomas might have quoted: The Lord is
   high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens (Ps. CXII).
   God's free will is contained in His real physical distinctness from the
   universe, His sovereign pre-eminence over it, and absolute independence
   of it. Identify God with the universe, and logically He is no longer
   free. Pushed to extremity, Idealism means Pantheism, and Pantheism
   Determinism. For if God has no free will, still less has man.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXIX--That there are no Passions in God

   PASSION is not in the intellectual appetite, but only in the sensitive.
   But in God there is no sensitive appetite, as there is no sensible
   knowedge.

   2. Every passion involves some bodily alteration, [170] a thing
   impossible in the incorporeal Deity.

   3. In every passion the subject is more or less drawn out of his
   essential condition or connatural disposition: which is not possible in
   the unchangeable God. [171]

   4. Every passion fixes determinedly on some one object, according to
   the mode and measure of the passion. Passion, like physical nature,
   rushes blindly at some one thing: that is why passion needs repressing
   and regulating by reason. But the divine will is not determined of
   itself to any one object in creation: but proceeds according to the
   order of its wisdom (Chap. [112]LXXXII).

   5. Every passion is the passion of a subject that is in potentiality.
   But God is altogether free from potentiality, being pure actuality.

   Thus every passion, generically as such, is removed from God. But
   certain passions are removed from God, not only generically, but also
   specifically. For every passion takes its species from its object: if
   then an object is altogether unbefitting for God, the passion specified
   by that object is removed from God also on specific grounds. Such a
   passion is Sadness and Grief, the object of which is evil already
   attaching to the sufferer. Hope, again, though it has good for its
   object, is not of good obtained, but to be obtained, a relation to good
   which is unbefitting for God by reason of His so great perfection, to
   which addition is impossible. Much more does that perfection exclude
   any potentiality in the way of evil. But Fear regards an evil that may
   be imminent. In two ways then Fear, specifically as such, is removed
   from God, both because it supposes a subject that is in potentiality,
   and because it has for its object some evil that may come to be in the
   subject. Regret again, or Repentance, is repugnant to God, as well
   because it is a species of sadness, as also because it involves a
   change of will.

   Moreover, without an error of the intellectual faculty, it is
   impossible for good to be mistaken for evil. And only in respect of
   private advantages is it possible for the loss of one being to be the
   gain of another. But to the general good nothing is lost by the good of
   any private member; but every private good goes to fill in the public
   good. [172] But God is the universal good, by partaking in whose
   likeness all other things are called good. No other being's evil then
   can possibly be good for God. Nor again, seeing that God's knowledge
   makes no mistakes, can He apprehend as evil that which is simply good,
   and no evil to Him. Envy therefore is impossible to God, specifically
   as Envy, not only because it is a species of sadness, but also because
   it is sadness at the good of another, and thus takes the good of
   another as evil to itself. [173]

   It is part of the same procedure to be sad at good and to desire evil.
   Such sadness arises from good being accounted evil: such desire, from
   evil being accounted good. Now Anger is desire of the evil of another
   for vengeance' sake. Anger then is far from God by reason of its
   species, not only because it is a species of sadness, but also because
   it is a desire of vengeance, conceived for sadness at an injury done
   one.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [170] What Alexander Bain calls "the diffusive wave of emotion." Bodily
   expression is of the essence of a passion. A passion is as much
   corporeal as a sensation.

   [171] Passion is a disturbance of physical equilibrium. Hence it comes
   to be forbidden by physicians; and may, as St Thomas says, accelerate
   dissolution.

   [172] As the flood-tide is filled in' (repraesentatur) by every
   advancing wave. The axiom should go down in the pocket-book of the
   economist.

   [173] The Greek dread is well known of the envy, or evil eye, of Heaven
   lighting upon any exuberance of human prosperity. See the story of
   Polycrates and his ring in Herodotus, III, 41. Julius Caesar and
   Augustus felt this dread, nor is it yet extinct. Aeschylus
   philosophises upon it (Agam. 750-762). Cf. Daniel iv, 29-34; St Luke
   xii, 16-21.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XC--That there is in God Delight and Joy

   THERE are some passions which, though they do not befit God as
   passions, nevertheless, so far as their specific nature is considered,
   do not involve anything inconsistent with divine perfection. Of the
   number of these is Delight and Joy. Joy is of present good. Neither by
   reason of its object, which is good, nor by reason of the relation in
   which the object, good actually possessed, stands to the subject, does
   joy specifically contain anything inconsistent with divine perfection.
   Hence it is manifest that joy or Delight has being properly in God. For
   as good and evil apprehended is the object of the sensitive appetite,
   so also is it of the intellectual appetite, or will. It is the ordinary
   function of both appetites to pursue good and to shun evil, either real
   or apparent, except that the object of the intellectual appetite is
   wider than that of the sensitive, inasmuch as the intellectual appetite
   regards good and evil simply, while the sensitive appetite regards good
   and evil felt by sense; as also the object of intellect is wider than
   the object of sense. But the activities of appetite are specified by
   their objects. There exist therefore in the intellectual appetite, or
   will, activities specifically similar to the activities of the
   sensitive appetite, and differing only in this, that in the sensitive
   appetite they are passions on account of the implication of a bodily
   organ, but in the intellectual appetite they are simple activities.
   [174] For as by the passion of fear, coming over the sensitive
   appetite, one shuns evil looming in the future, so the intellectual
   appetite works to the same effect without passion. [175] Since then joy
   and Delight are not repugnant to God specifically, but only inasmuch as
   they are passions, it follows that they are not wanting even in the
   divine will.

   2. Joy and Delight are a sort of rest of the will in its object. But
   God singularly rests in Himself as in the first object of His own will,
   inasmuch as He has all sufficiency in Himself.

   3. Delight is the perfection of activity, perfecting activity as bloom
   does youth. [176] But the activity of the divine understanding is most
   perfect. If therefore our act of understanding, coming to its
   perfection, yields delight, most delightful must be the act whereby God
   understands.

   4. Everything naturally feels joy over what is like itself, except
   accidentally, inasmuch as the likeness hinders one's own gain, and two
   of a trade' quarrel. But every good thing is some likeness of the
   divine goodness, and nothing is lost to God by the good of His
   creature. Therefore God rejoices in good everywhere.

   Joy and Delight differ in our consideration: for Delight arises out of
   good really conjoined with the subject; while Joy does not require this
   real conjunction, but the mere resting of the will on an agreeable
   object is sufficient for it. [177] Hence, strictly speaking, Delight is
   at good conjoined with the subject: Joy over good external to the
   subject. Thus, in strict parlance, God takes delight in Himself: but
   has Joy both over Himself and over other things.

     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCI--That there is Love in God. [178]

   IT is of the essential idea of love, that whoever loves wishes the good
   of the object loved. But God wishes His own good and the good of other
   beings (Chap. [113]LXXV); and in this respect He loves Himself and
   other beings.

   2. It is a requisite of true love to love the good of another inasmuch
   as it is his good. But God loves the good of every being as it is the
   good of that being, though He does also subordinate one being to the
   profit of another.

   3. The essential idea of love seems to be this, that the affection of
   one tends to another as to a being who is in some way one with himself.
   The greater the bond of union, the more intense is the love. And again
   the more intimately bound up with the lover the bond of union is, the
   stronger the love. But that bond whereby all things are united with
   God, namely, His goodness, of which all things are imitations, is to
   God the greatest and most intimate of bonds, seeing that He is Himself
   His own goodness. There is therefore in God a love, not only true, but
   most perfect and strong.

   But some might be of opinion that God does not love one object more
   than another; for a higher and a lower degree of intensity of affection
   is characteristic of a changeable nature, and cannot be attributed to
   God, from whom all change is utterly removed. Besides, wherever else
   there is mention of any divine activity, there is no question of more
   and less: thus one thing is not known by God more than another. In
   answer to this difficulty we must observe that whereas other activities
   of the soul are concerned with one object only, love alone seems to
   tend to two. For love wishes something to somebody: hence the things
   that we desire, we are properly said to desire,' not to love,' but in
   them we rather love ourselves for whom we desire them. Every divine act
   then is of one and the same intensity; but love may be said to admit of
   greater and less' in two ways, either in point of the good that we will
   to another, in which way we are said to love him more to whom we wish
   greater good; or again in point of the intensity of the act, in which
   way we are said to love him more to whom we wish, not indeed a greater
   good, but an equal good more fervently and effectually. In the former
   way then there is nothing to object to in the saying that God loves one
   more than another, inasmuch as He wishes him a greater good: but,
   understood of the second way, the saying is not tenable.

   Hence it appears that of our affections there is none that can properly
   be in God except joy and love, though even these are in Him not by way
   of passion, as they are in us. That there is in God joy or delight is
   confirmed by the authority of Holy Scripture. I was delighted day by
   day playing before him, says the Divine Wisdom, which is God (Prov.
   viii, 30). The Philosopher also says that God ever rejoices with one
   simple delight. [179] The Scripture also speaks of love in God: With
   everlasting love I have loved thee (Jer. xxxi, 3); For the Father
   himself loveth you (John xvi, 27).

   But even other affections (affectiones), which are specifically
   inconsistent with divine perfection, are predicated in Holy Writ of
   God, not properly but metaphorically, on account of likeness of
   effects. Thus sometimes the will in following out the order of wisdom
   tends to the same effect to which one might be inclined by a passion,
   which would argue a certain imperfection: for the judge punishes from a
   sense of justice, as an angry man under the promptings of anger. So
   sometimes God is said to be angry,' inasmuch as in the order of His
   wisdom He means to punish some one: When his anger shall blaze out
   suddenly (Ps. ii, 13). He is said to be compassionate,' inasmuch as in
   His benevolence He takes away the miseries of men, as we do the same
   from a sentiment of pity: The Lord is merciful and compassionate,
   patient and abounding in mercy (Ps. cli, 8). Sometimes also He is said
   to be repentant,' inasmuch as in the eternal and immutable order of His
   providence, He builds up what He had previously destroyed, or destroys
   what He had previously made, as we do when moved by repentance: It
   repenteth me that I have made man (Gen. vi, 6, 7). God is also said to
   be 'sad,' inasmuch as things happen contrary to what He loves and
   approves, as sadness is in us at what happens against our will: And the
   Lord saw, and it seemed evil in his eyes, because judgement is not: God
   saw that there is no man, and he was displeased, because there was none
   to meet him (Isa. lix, 15, 16).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] Quod Deus est Amor, is the heading of the chapter: but all the
   conclusion argued and drawn in the text is "that God loves," "that
   there is love in God." God is love, and God is light, says St John (1
   John iv, 9; i, 5); and, owing to the divine simplicity (Chap. XVIII),
   it may be argued that whatever attribute is in God, is God.

   [179] "God's delight is ever one and simple," says Aristotle, Eth. Nic.
   vii, 1154b. He adds: "For there is not only an actuality involving
   change, but also one involving unchangeableness." In the latter there
   is nothing of potentiality.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCII--In what sense Virtues can be posited in God

   AS the divine goodness comprehends within itself in a certain way all
   goodnesses, and virtue is a sort of goodness, the divine goodness must
   contain all virtues after a manner proper to itself. But no virtue is
   predicated as an attribute of God after the manner of a habit, as
   virtues are in us. For it does not befit God to be good by anything
   superadded to Him, but only by His essence, since He is absolutely
   simple. Nor again does He act by anything superadded to His essence, as
   His essence is His being (Chap. [114]XLV). Virtue therefore in God is
   not any habit, but His own essence.

   2. A habit is an imperfect actuality, half-way between potentiality and
   actuality: hence the subjects of habits are compared to persons asleep.
   But in God actuality is most perfect. Virtue therefore in Him is not
   like a habit or a science, but is as a present act of consciousness,
   which is the extremest perfection of actuality.

   Since human virtues are for the guidance of human life, and human life
   is twofold, contemplative and active, the virtues of the active life,
   inasmuch as they perfect this present life, cannot be attributed to
   God: for the active life of man consists in the use of material goods,
   which are not assignable to God. Again, these virtues perfect human
   conduct in political society: hence they do not seem much to concern
   those who keep aloof from political society: much less can they befit
   God, whose conversation and life is far removed from the manner and
   custom of human life. [180] Some again of the virtues of the active
   life direct us how to govern the passions: but in God there are no
   passions. [181]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [180] But is not God the head of all political society? Yes, that is
   allowed for in the next chapter.

   [181] On these passion-controlling virtues (temperance and fortitude)
   see Ethics and Natural Law pp. 74-76, n. 3: pp. 85, 86, nn. 2, 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCIII--That in God there are the Virtues which regulate Action

   THERE are virtues directing the active life of man, which are not
   concerned with passions, but with actions, as truth, justice,
   liberality, magnificence, prudence, art. Since virtue is specified by
   its object, and the actions which are the objects of these virtues are
   not inconsistent with the divine perfection, neither is there in such
   virtues, specifically considered, anything to exclude them from the
   perfection of God.

   3. Of things that come to have being from God, the proper plan of them
   all is in the divine understanding (Chap. [115]LXVI). But the plan of a
   thing to be made in the mind of the maker is Art: hence the Philosopher
   says that Art is "the right notion of things to be made." There is
   therefore properly Art in God, and therefore it is said: Wisdom,
   artificer of all, taught me (Wisd. vii, 21).

   4. Again, the divine will, in things outside God, is determined by His
   knowledge (Chap. [116]LXXXII). But knowledge directing the will to act
   is Prudence: because, according to the Philosopher, Prudence is "the
   right notion of things to be done." There is therefore Prudence in God;
   and hence it is said: With him is prudence (Job xii, 13).

   5. From the fact of God wishing anything, He wishes the requisites of
   that thing. But the points requisite to the perfection of each several
   thing are due to that thing: there is therefore in God Justice, the
   function of which is to distribute to each his own. Hence it is said:
   The Lord is just, and hath loved justice (Ps. x, 8).

   6. As shown above (Chapp. [117]LXXIV, [118]LXXV), the last end, for the
   sake of which God wills all things, in no way depends on the means to
   that end, neither in point of being nor in point of well-being. Hence
   God does not wish to communicate His goodness for any gain that may
   accrue to Himself thereby, but simply because the mere communication
   befits Him as the fountain of goodness. But to give, not from any
   advantage expected from the gift, but out of sheer goodness and the
   fitness of giving, is an act of Liberality. God therefore is in the
   highest degree liberal; [182] and, as Avicenna says, He alone can
   properly be called liberal: for every other agent but Him is in the way
   of gaining something by his action and intends so to gain. This His
   liberality the Scripture declares, saying: As thou openest thy hand,
   all things shall be filled with goodness (Ps. ciii, 28) ; and, Who
   giveth to all abundantly, and reproacheth not (James i, 5).

   7. All things that receive being from God, necessarily bear His
   likeness, in so far as they are, and are good, and have their proper
   archetypes in the divine understanding (Chap. [119]LIV). But this
   belongs to the virtue of Truth, that every one should manifest himself
   in his deeds and words for such as he really is. There is therefore in
   God the virtue of Truth. [183] Hence, God is true (Rom. iii, 4); and,
   All thy ways are truth (Ps. cxviii, 151).

   In point of exchange, the proper act of commutative justice, justice
   does not befit God, since He receives no advantage from any one; hence,
   Who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him? (Rom.
   xi, 35;) and, Who bath given to me beforehand, that I may repay him?
   (Job xli, 2.) Still, in a metaphorical sense, we are said to give
   things to God, inasmuch as He takes kindly what we have to offer Him.
   Commutative justice therefore does not befit God, but only distributive
   justice. [184]

   To judge of things to be done, or to give a thing, or make a
   distribution, is not proper to man alone, but belongs to any and every
   intellectual being. Inasmuch therefore as the aforesaid actions are
   considered in their generality, they have their apt place even in
   divinity: for as man is the distributer of human goods, as of money or
   honour, so is God of all the goods of the universe. The aforesaid
   virtues therefore are of wider extension in God than in man: for as the
   justice of man is to a city or family, so is the justice of God to the
   entire universe: hence the divine virtues are said to be archetypes of
   ours. But other virtues, which do not properly become God, have no
   archetype in the divine nature, but only, as is the case with corporeal
   things generally, in the divine wisdom, which contains the proper
   notions of all things. [185]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [182] Deus igitur est maxime liberalis. Liberal,' as an adjective, may
   connote either liberalism or (as here) liberality.

   [183] See my Ethics and Natural Law, pp.228, 229.

   [184] Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 104-106. A corollary follows, that
   the creature has no rights against the Creator.

   [185] The divine nature' is here spoken of as nature' is technically
   defined the principle of action.' Such a virtue as temperance has no
   place in the principle of divine action. Bodily appetites not being
   proper to His being, God never acts the temperate man. He does act the
   just judge.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCIV--That the Contemplative (Intellectual) Virtues are in God

   IF Wisdom consists in the knowledge of the highest causes; and God
   chiefly knows Himself, and knows nothing except by knowing Himself, as
   the first cause of all (Chap. [120]XLVI), it is evident that Wisdom
   ought to be attributed to God in the first place. Hence it is said: He
   is wise of heart (Job ix, 4.); and, All wisdom is of the Lord God, and
   hath been with him alway (Ecclus i, 1). The Philosopher also says at
   the beginning of his Metaphysics that Wisdom is a divine possession,
   not a human.

   2. If Knowledge (Science) is an acquaintance with a thing through its
   proper cause, and God knows the order of all causes and effects, and
   thereby the several proper causes of individual things (Chapp.
   [121]LXV, [122]LXVII), it is manifest that Knowledge (Science) is
   properly in God; hence God is the Lord of sciences (1 Kings ii, 3)

   3. If the immaterial cognition of things, attained without discussion,
   is Understanding (Intuition), [186] God has such a cognition of all
   things (Chap. [123]L); and therefore there is in Him Understanding.
   Hence, He hath counsel and understanding (Job xii, 13).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [186] Intellectus. This word in St Thomas means sometimes the faculty
   of understanding'; sometimes, as here, the act, or habit of
   understanding, of which so much is made in modern philosophy under the
   name of intuition.' St Thomas too makes much of it. Thus his
   intellectus principiorum is intuition of first principles.' The
   corresponding Aristotelian and Platonic word is nous as distinguished
   from dianoia. Kant's Reason' is his equivalent for nous and
   intellectus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCV--That God cannot will Evil

   EVERY act of God is an act of virtue, since Ills virtue is His essence
   (Chap. [124]XCII).

   2. The will cannot will evil except by some error coming to be in the
   reason, at least in the matter of the particular choice there and then
   made. For as the object of the will is good, apprehended as such, the
   will cannot tend to evil unless evil be somehow proposed to it as good;
   and that cannot be without error. [187] But in the divine cognition
   there can be no error (Chap. [125]LXI).

   3. God is the sovereign good, admitting no intermixture of evil (Chap.
   [126]LXI).

   4. Evil cannot befall the will except by its being turned away from its
   end. But the divine will cannot be turned away from its end, being
   unable to will except by willing itself (Chap. [127]LXXV). It cannot
   therefore will evil; and thus free will in it is naturally established
   in good. This is the meaning of the texts: God is faithful and without
   iniquity (Deut. xxxii, 4); Thine eyes are clean, O Lord, and thou canst
   not look upon iniquity (Hab. i, 13).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [187] This is explained in Book III, Chap. VI.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCVI--That God hates nothing

   AS love is to good, so is hatred to evil; we wish good to them whom we
   love, and evil to them whom we hate. If then the will of God cannot be
   inclined to evil, as has been shown (Chap. [128]XCV), it is impossible
   for Him to hate anything.

   2. The will of God tends to things other than Himself inasmuch as, by
   willing and loving His own being and goodness, He wishes it to be
   diffused as far as is possible by communication of His likeness. This
   then is what God wills in beings other than Himself, that there be in
   them the likeness of His goodness. Therefore God wills the good of
   everything, and hates nothing.

   4. What is found naturally in all active causes, must be found
   especially in the Prime Agent. But all agents in their own way love the
   effects which they themselves produce, as parents their children, poets
   their own poems, craftsmen their works. Much more therefore is God
   removed from hating anything, seeing that He is cause of all. [188]

   Hence it is said: Thou lovest all things that are, and hatest nothing
   of the things that Thou hast made (Wisd. xi, 25).

   Some things however God is said, to hate figuratively
   (similitudinarie), and that in two ways. The first way is this, that
   God, in loving things and willing their good to be, wills their evil
   not to be: hence He is said to have hatred of evils, for the things we
   wish not to be we are said to hate. So it is said: Think no evil in
   your hearts every one of you against his friend, and love no lying
   oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the Lord (Zach. viii,
   17). But none of these things are effects of creation: they are not as
   subsistent things, to which hatred or love properly attaches. The other
   way is by God's wishing some greater good, which cannot be without the
   privation of a lesser good; and thus He is said to hate, whereas it is
   more properly love. Thus inasmuch as He wills the good of justice, or
   of the order of the universe, which cannot be without the punishment or
   perishing of some, He is said to hate those beings whose punishment or
   perishing He wills, according to the text, Esau I have hated (Malach.
   i, 3); and, Thou hatest all who work Iniquity, thou wilt destroy all
   who utter falsehood: the man of blood and deceit the Lord shall
   abominate (Ps. v, 7). [189]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [188] God loves all the works of His hands antecedently. His first
   disposition to every creature is one of good will. This much these
   arguments may be said to evince. But how the will of God may stand to
   certain creatures consequently upon certain events, is not here
   considered.

   [189] In this view, the wicked and their punishment form part of the
   order of the universe, one side of the eternal antithesis of good and
   evil. St Thomas's exposition is succinct enough. Further elucidations
   must be sought from theologians; who, even when orthodox, are far from
   consentient here. Who has found the answer to Job's question: Why then
   do the wicked live? (Job xxi, 7.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCVII--That God is Living

   IT has been shown that God is intelligent and willing: but to
   understand and will are functions of a living being only.

   2. Life is attributed to beings inasmuch as they appear to move of
   themselves, and not to be moved by another. Therefore things that seem
   to move of themselves, the moving powers of which the vulgar do not
   perceive, are figuratively said to live, as we speak of the living'
   (running) water of a flowing stream, but not so of a cistern or
   stagnant pool; and we call quicksilver' that which seems to have a
   motion of its own. This is mere popular speech, for properly those
   things alone move of themselves, which do so by virtue of their
   composition of a moving force and matter moved, as things with souls;
   hence these alone are properly said to live: [190] all other things are
   moved by some external force, a generating force, or a force removing
   an obstacle, or a force of impact. [191] And because sensible
   activities are attended with movement, by a further step everything
   that determines itself to its own modes of activity, even though
   unattended with movement, is said to live; hence to understand and
   desire and feel are vital actions. But God, of all beings, is
   determined to activity by none other than Himself, as He is prime agent
   and first cause; to Him therefore, of all beings, does it belong to
   live.

   3. The divine being contains the perfection of all being (Chap.
   [129]XXVIII). But living is perfect being; hence animate things in the
   scale of being take precedence of inanimate. With God then to be is to
   live.

   This too is confirmed by authority of divine Scripture: I will raise to
   heaven my hand, and swear by my right hand, and say: I live for ever
   (Deut. xxxii, 40): My heart and my flesh) have rejoiced in the living
   God (Ps. lxxiii, 3).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [190] It must be remembered that the schoolmen assign some sort of
   soul, an anima vegetativa, to plants. Others have thought that soul
   goes no further than consciousness.

   [191] A generating force' was St Thomas's notion of the forces of
   chemistry. The fall of a stone he put down to removens prohibens, the
   support being removed, and the stone left free to gratify its natural
   appetite for rest on earth. The motion of the heavenly bodies he
   attributed, not without hesitation, to their being animated by a soul
   (Book II, Chap. LXX). Had he followed out the idea, here obscurely
   expressed, of the inertia of matter, he might have been led to divine
   the force of gravitation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCVIII--That God is His own Life

   IN living things, to live is to be: for a living thing is said to be
   alive inasmuch as it has a soul; and by that soul, as by its own proper
   form, it has being: living in fact is nothing else than living being,
   arising out of a living form. [192] But, in God, Himself is His own
   being (Chap. [130]XXII): Himself therefore is His own life.

   2. To understand is to live: but God is His own act of understanding
   (Chap. [131]XLV).

   3. If God is living, there must be life in Him. If then He is not His
   own life, there will be something in Him that is not Himself, [193] and
   thus He will be compound, -- a rejected conclusion (Chap. [132]XVIII).

   And this is the text: I am life (John xiv, 6). [194]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [192] Hence of a dead man we say truly: He is no more.'

   [193] Not Himself, that is, not His whole self. It might be part of
   Himself, but then He would have parts.

   [194] This text may be not so immediately applicable as it seems, if it
   be the utterance, not of God as God, ad intra, but of God made Man,
   communicator of a divine life to His elect, ad extra. See my notes on
   St John i, 3, 4; xi, 25; xiv, 6. Be that application as it may, the
   conclusion of this chapter, and so many similar conclusions in this
   book, amount to this: that God is one self-conscious act, the
   realisation of the whole ideal order, of life, of wisdom, of power, of
   goodness, of necessary being, -- what Plato was groping after (Acts
   xvii, 27) in his theory of Ideas, -- gathered all in one, living,
   conscious, pure actuality.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCIX--That the Life of God is everlasting

   IT is impossible for God to cease to live, since Himself He is His own
   life (Chap. [133]XCVIII).

   2. Everything that at one time is and at another time is not, has
   existence through some cause. But the divine life has no cause, as
   neither has the divine being. God is therefore not at one time living
   and at another not living, but always lives.

   3. In every activity the agent remains, although sometimes the activity
   passes in succession: hence in motion the moving body remains the same
   in subject throughout the whole course of the motion, although not the
   same in our consideration. Where then the action is the agent himself,
   nothing there can pass in succession, but all must be together at once.
   But God's act of understanding and living is God Himself (Chapp.
   [134]XLV, [135]XCVIII): therefore His life has no succession, but is
   all together at once, and everlasting.

   Hence it is said: This is the true God and life everlasting (1 John v,
   20).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER C--That God is Happy

   HAPPINESS is the proper good of every intellectual nature. Since then
   God is an intellectual being, happiness will be His proper good. But
   God in regard of His proper good is not as a being that is still
   tending to a proper good not yet possessed: that is the way with a
   nature changeable and in potentiality; but God is in the position of a
   being that already possesses its proper good. Therefore He not only
   desires happiness, as we do, but is in the enjoyment of happiness.

   2. The thing above all others desired or willed by an intellectual
   nature is the most perfect thing in that nature, and that is its
   happiness. But the most perfect thing in each is its most perfect
   activity: for power and habit are perfected by activity: hence the
   Philosopher says that happiness is a perfect activity. [195] Now the
   perfection of activity depends on four conditions. First, on its kind,
   that it be immanent in the agent. I call an activity immanent in the
   agent,' when nothing else comes of it besides the act itself: such are
   the acts of seeing and hearing: such acts are perfections of the agents
   whose acts they are, and may have a finality of their own in so far as
   they are not directed to the production of anything else as an end. On
   the other hand, any activity from which there results something done
   besides itself, is a perfection of the thing done, not of the doer: it
   stands in the relation of a means to an end, and therefore cannot be
   the happiness of an intellectual nature. Secondly, on the principle of
   activity, that it be an activity of the highest power: hence our
   happiness lies not in any activity of sense, but in an activity of
   intellect, perfected by habit. Thirdly, on the object of activity; and
   therefore our happiness consists in understanding the highest object of
   understanding. Fourthly, on the form of activity, that the action be
   perfect, easy, and agreeable. But the activity of God fulfils all these
   conditions: since it is (1) activity in the order of understanding; and
   (2) His understanding is the highest of faculties, not needing any
   habit to perfect it; and (3) His understanding is bent upon Himself,
   the highest of intelligible objects; and (4) He understands perfectly,
   without any difficulty, and with all delight. He is therefore happy.

   3. Boethius says that happiness is a state made perfect by a gathering
   of all good things. But such is the divine perfection, which includes
   all perfection in one single view (Chapp. [136]XXVIII, [137]LIV).

   4. He is happy, who is sufficient for himself and wants nothing. But
   God has no need of other things, seeing that His perfection depends on
   nothing external to Himself; and when He wills other things for Himself
   as for an end, it is not that He needs them, but only that this
   reference befits His goodness.

   5. It is impossible for God to wish for anything impossible (Chap.
   [138]LXXXIV). Again it is impossible for anything to come in to Him
   which as yet He has not, seeing that He is nowise in potentiality
   (Chap. [139]XVI). Therefore He cannot wish to have what He has not:
   therefore He has whatever He wishes; and He wishes nothing evil (Chap.
   [140]XCV). Therefore He is happy, according to the definition given by
   some, that "he is happy who has what he wishes and wishes nothing
   evil."

   His happiness the Holy Scriptures declare: Whom he will show in his own
   time, the blessed and powerful one (1 Tim. vi, 15).

   6-13
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CI--That God Is His own Happiness

   GOD'S happiness is the act of His understanding (Chap. [141]C). But
   that very act of God's understanding is His substance (Chap. [142]XLV).
   He therefore is His own happiness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CII--That the Happiness of God is most perfect, and exceeds all
   other happiness

   WHERE there is greater love, there is greater delight in the attainment
   of the object loved. But every being, other things being equal, loves
   itself more than it loves anything else: a sign of which is that, the
   nearer anything is to oneself, the more it is naturally loved. God
   therefore takes greater delight in His happiness, which is Himself,
   than other blessed ones in their happiness, which is not what they are.

   3. What is by essence, ranks above what is by participation. But God is
   happy by His essence, a prerogative that can belong to no other: for
   nothing else but God can be the sovereign good; and thus whatever else
   is happy must be happy by participation from Him. The divine happiness
   therefore exceeds all other happiness.

   4. Perfect happiness consists in an act of the understanding. But no
   other act of understanding can compare with God's act: as is clear, not
   only from this that it is a subsistent act, [196] but also because by
   this one act God perfectly understands Himself as He is, and all things
   that are and are not, good and evil; whereas in all other intellectual
   beings the act of understanding is not itself subsistent, but is the
   act of a subsistent subject. Nor can any one understand God, the
   supreme object of understanding, so perfectly as He is perfect, because
   the being of none is so perfect as the divine being, nor can any act
   ever be more perfect than the substance of which it is the act. [197]
   Nor is there any other understanding that knows even all that God can
   do: for if it did, it would comprehend the divine power. Lastly, even
   what another understanding does know, it does not know all with one and
   the same act. God therefore is incomparably happy above all other
   beings.

   5. The more a thing is brought to unity, the more perfect is its power
   and excellence. But an activity that works in succession, is divided by
   different divisions of time: in no way then can its perfection be
   compared to the perfection of an activity that is without succession,
   all present together, especially if it does not pass in an instant but
   abides to eternity. Now the divine act of understanding is without
   succession, existing all together for eternity: whereas our act of
   understanding is in succession by the accidental attachment to it of
   continuity and time. Therefore the divine happiness infinitely exceeds
   human happiness, as the duration of eternity exceeds the now in flux'
   of time (nunc temporis fluens).

   6. The fatigue and various occupations whereby our contemplation in
   this life is necessarily interrupted, -- in which contemplation
   whatever happiness there is for man in this life chiefly consists, --
   and the errors and doubts and various mishaps to which the present life
   is subject, show that human happiness, in this life particularly, can
   in no way compare with the happiness of God.

   7. The perfection of the divine happiness may be gathered from this,
   that it embraces all happinesses according to the most perfect mode of
   each. By way of contemplative happiness, it has a perfect and perpetual
   view of God Himself and of other beings. By way of active life, it has
   the government, not of one man, or of one house, or of one city, or of
   one kingdom, but of the whole universe. Truly, the false happiness of
   earth is but a shadow of that perfect happiness. For it consists,
   according to Boethius, in five things, in pleasure, riches, power,
   dignity and fame. God then has a most excellent delight of Himself, and
   a universal joy of all good things, without admixture of contrary
   element. For riches, He has absolute self-sufficiency of all good. For
   power, He has infinite might. For dignity, He has primacy and rule over
   all beings. For fame, He has the admiration of every understanding that
   in any sort knows Him.

   To Him then, who is singularly blessed, be honour and glory for ever
   and ever, Amen. [198]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [196] That is to say, an act which has all the permanence and
   self-containedness of substance.

   [197] It would follow from this, that a man cannot perfectly comprehend
   an angel, nor even another man vastly superior to himself. The saint
   then, on some points of his character, is not amenable to the judgement
   of the ordinary man of common sense; nor the philosopher, or
   theologian, or man of science, to the unrevised verdict of the plain
   man; nor the statesman, or hero, to the man in the street.

   [198] The interest of all this to us is that the heaven, which is the
   term of the labours of a Christian man, is a participation in the
   perfect and transcendent happiness here shadowed forth. I will
   anticipate and quote the conclusion of B. III, Chap. LI. -- "By this
   vision we are made like to God, and become partakers of His happiness.
   For God Himself by His essence understands His substance, and that is
   His happiness. Hence it is said: When he appeareth, he shall be like
   unto him, because he shall see him as he is (1 John iii, 2). And the
   Lord said: I dispose unto you, as my Father hath disposed unto me, a
   kingdom, that ye eat and drink at my table in my kingdom (Luke xxii,
   29). This cannot be understood of corporal meat or drink, but must be
   spoken of that food which is taken at the table of Wisdom, whereof
   Wisdom herself says: Eat my bread, and drink the wine that I have
   mingled for you (Prov. ix, 5). They then eat and drink at the table of
   God, who enjoy the same happiness wherewith God is happy, seeing Him in
   the way in which He sees Himself."

GOD THE ORIGIN OF CREATURES
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER I--Connexion of what follows with what has gone before.

   THERE can be no perfect knowledge of anything unless its activity be
   known: for from the mode of activity proper to a thing, and the species
   to which it belongs, the measure and quality of its power is estimated;
   and the power shows the nature of the thing, for each thing is
   naturally active according to the nature with which it is actually
   endowed. [199] But there is a twofold activity: [200] one immanent in
   the agent, and a perfection of his, as feeling, understanding and
   willing; the other passing out to an exterior thing, and a perfection
   of the thing made and constituted thereby, as warming, cutting and
   building. Both of these acts are proper to God: the first, inasmuch as
   he understands, wills, rejoices and loves; the second inasmuch as He
   produces and brings things into being, conserves and governs them. Of
   the first act of God we have spoken in the previous book, treating of
   the divine knowledge and will. It remains now to treat of the second
   action, whereby things are produced and governed by God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [199] Hence nature' is defined in the school the principle of
   operation.'

   [200] Immanent' and transient,' as presently described.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER IV--That the Philosopher and the Theologian view Creatures from
   Different Standpoints

   HUMAN philosophy considers creatures as they are in themselves: hence
   we find different divisions of philosophy according to the different
   classes of things. But Christian faith considers them, not in
   themselves, but inasmuch as they represent the majesty of God, and in
   one way or another are directed to God, as it is said: Of the glory of
   the Lord his work is full: hath not the Lord made his saints to tell of
   his wonders? (Ecclus xlii, 16, 17.) Therefore the philosopher and the
   faithful Christian (fidelis) consider different points about creatures:
   the philosopher considers what attaches to them in their proper nature:
   the faithful Christian considers about creatures only what attaches to
   them in their relation to God, as that they are created by God, subject
   to God, and the like. [201] Hence it is not to be put down as an
   imperfection in the doctrine of faith, if it passes unnoticed many
   properties of things, as the configuration of the heavens, or the laws
   of motion. And again such points as are considered by philosopher and
   faithful Christian alike, are treated on different principles: for the
   philosopher takes his stand on the proper and immediate causes of
   things; but the faithful Christian argues from the First Cause, showing
   that so the matter is divinely revealed, or that this makes for the
   glory of God, or that God's power is infinite. Hence this speculation
   of the faithful Christian ought to be called the highest wisdom, as
   always regarding the highest cause, according to the text: This is your
   wisdom and understanding before the nations (Deut. iv, 6). And
   therefore human philosophy is subordinate to this higher wisdom; and in
   sign of this subordination divine wisdom sometimes draws conclusions
   from premises of human philosophy. Further, the two systems do not
   observe the same order of procedure. In the system of philosophy, which
   considers creatures in themselves and from them leads on to the
   knowledge of God, the first study is of creatures and the last of God;
   but in the system of faith, which studies creatures only in their
   relation to God, the study is first of God and afterwards of creatures;
   and this is a more perfect view, and more like to the knowledge of God,
   who, knowing Himself, thence discerns other beings. Following this
   latter order, after what has been said in the first book about God in
   Himself, it remains for us to treat of the beings that come from God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [201] We have not gained by the divorce between philosophy and what is
   now called science,' as though philosophy were not science, or
   (physical) science were not one branch of philosophy. The word
   philosopher' in the text therefore includes the physicist. Nor does the
   word philosopher' exclude the faithful Christian man.' It is a
   difference of formalities, or characters, as between professor' and
   volunteer,' not an incompatibility.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER V--Order of Matters to be Treated

   THE order of our treatise will be to deal first with the production and
   bringing of things into being (Chapp VI-XXXVIII); secondly with the
   distinction of things (Chapp. XXXIX-XLV); thirdly, with the nature of
   things thus produced and distinct so far as it appertains to the truth
   of faith (Chapp. XLVI-CI).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER VI--That it belongs to God to be to other Beings the Principle
   of Existence

   IN inferior agents it is a sign of attained perfection, when they can
   produce their own likeness. But God is sovereignly perfect (B.I. Chap.
   [143]XXVIII). Therefore it belongs to Him to make some being like
   Himself in actual existence.

   6. The more perfect any principle of activity is, the wider its sphere
   of action. But that pure actuality, which is God, is more perfect than
   actuality mingled with potentiality, such as is in us. Now actuality is
   the principle of action. Since then by the actuality which is in us, we
   are not only capable of immanent acts, such as understanding and
   willing, but also of acts tending to exterior things and productive of
   effects, much more can God, by virtue of His actuality, not only
   understand and will, but also produce an effect.

   Hence it is said: Who maketh great and wonderful and inscrutable works
   without number (Job v. 9).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER VII--That there is in God Active Power

   AS passive power, or passivity, follows upon being in potentiality, so
   active power follows upon being in actuality; for everything acts by
   being in actuality, and is acted upon by being in potentiality. But it
   belongs to God to be in actuality; and therefore there is suitably
   ascribed to Him active power, but not passive power.

   Hence it is said: Thou art powerful, O Lord (Ps. lxxxviii, 9); and Thy
   power and thy justice, O God, are even to the highest heaven, in the
   wonders that thou hast made (Ps. lxx, 18, 19).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER VIII--That God's Power is His Substance

   ACTIVE power belongs to the perfection of a thing. But every divine
   perfection is contained in God's own being (B. I, Chap. [144]XXVIII).
   God's power therefore is not different from his being. But God is His
   own being (B. I, Chap. [145]XXII); He is therefore His own power.

   4. In things the powers of which are not their substance, the said
   powers are accidents. [202] But there can be no accident in God (B. I,
   Chap. [146]XXIII), who is therefore his own power.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [202] Without discussing this statement, it is at least safe to say
   that, for their working to any orderly purpose, these powers depend
   upon a concatenation of conditions accidental to the powers themselves,
   -- conditions, that is to say, which may or may not be present where
   the agents are present.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER IX--That God's Power is His Action

   GOD'S power is His substance, as has been shown in the previous
   chapter: also His action is His substance, as has been shown of His
   intellectual activity (B. I, Chap. [147]XLV), and the same argument
   holds of His other activities. Therefore in God power and action are
   not two different things. [203]

   2. The action of any being is a complement of its power; for it stands
   to power as the second actuality to the first. [204] But the divine
   power, being God's very essence, has no other complement than itself.
   And therefore in God action and power are not distinct.

   4. Any action that is not the agent's very substance is in the agent as
   an accident in its subject. But in God there can be nothing accidental.
   Therefore in God His action is none other than His substance and His
   power.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [203] But hence a difficulty. God necessarily has the power of
   creating: if His power be His action, it appears that the action of
   creating in Him is also necessary, and He cannot but create, contrary
   to what has been already argued (B. I, Chap. LXXXI). This difficulty is
   met in Chapp. XXXII, XXXV, arg. 2.

   [204] In Aristotelian philosophy, an agent, quite ready to act but not
   yet acting, is said to be in the first actuality,' e.g. a soldier with
   his rifle levelled and sighted; in acting, an agent is said to be in
   the second actuality,' e.g. the soldier firing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER X--In what manner Power is said to be in God

   SINCE the divine action is nothing else than the divine power, it is
   manifest that power is not said to be in God as a principle of His
   action (for nothing is the principle of itself), but as a principle of
   the thing made or done: also that when power is said to be in God in
   respect of the things made or done by Him, this is a predication of
   objective fact: but when it is said to be in Him in respect of His own
   action, such predication regards only our way of viewing things,
   inasmuch as our understanding views under two different concepts God's
   power and God's action. [205] Hence if there be any actions proper to
   God, that do not pass into anything made or done, but are immanent in
   the agent, in respect of these actions there is not said to be power in
   God except in our way of viewing things, not in objective fact. There
   are such actions, namely, understanding and willing. Properly speaking,
   the power of God does not regard these actions, but only effects
   produced in the world external to Him. Intellect and will, then, are in
   God, not as faculties,' or powers,' but only as actions. It is also
   clear from the aforesaid that the multitude of actions which are
   attributed to God, as understanding, willing, producing creatures, and
   the like, are not different things, since each one of these actions in
   God is His own being, which is one and the same.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [205] Writing in Mind for November, 1902, Mr Bradley refuses to allow
   the term will' in man to bear any other meaning than that of actual
   volition.' He merges power,' or faculty,' in act,' an identification
   which, St Thomas says, holds only in God. This is in keeping with Mr
   Bradley's steady and uncompromising repudiation of all potential being.
   Potential being, if it be at all, is the undoing of his philosophy. But
   see Appearance and Reality, pp. 384-7.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XI--That something is predicated of God in relation to
   Creatures

   SINCE power is proper to God in respect of the effects of His
   production, and power ranks as a principle, and a principle is so
   called in relation to its derivative; it is clear that something may be
   predicated of God in relation to the effects of His production.

   2. It is unintelligible how one thing can be made a subject of
   predication in relation to another thing, unless contrariwise the other
   thing be made a subject of predication in relation to it. But other
   beings are made subjects of predication in relation to God, as when it
   is said that they have their being from God and depend on Him. God
   therefore must be made a subject of predication in relation to
   creatures.

   3. Likeness is a relation. But God, as other agents, acts to the
   production of His own likeness.

   4. Knowledge is predicated in relation to the thing known. But God has
   knowledge of other beings.

   5. Whatever is first and sovereign, is so in relation to others, But
   God is the first being and the sovereign good.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XII--That the Relations, predicated of God in regard to
   Creatures, are not really in God [206]

   THESE relations cannot be in God as accidents in a subject, seeing that
   in God there is no accident (B. I, Chap [148]XXIII). Nor again can they
   be in the very substance of God: for then the substance of God in its
   very essence would be referred to another; but what is referred to
   another for its very essence, in a manner depends on that other, as it
   can neither be nor be understood without it; but this would make the
   substance of God dependent on another being, foreign to itself.

   2. God is the first measure of all beings (B. I, Chap. [149]XXVIII). He
   is to them as the object is to our knowledge, that is to say, its
   measure. But though the object is spoken of in relation to the
   knowledge of it, nevertheless the relation really is not in the object
   known, but only in the knowledge of it. The object is said to be in
   relation, not because it is itself related, but because something else
   is related to it.

   3. The aforesaid relations are predicated of God, not only in respect
   of things that actually are, but also in respect of things that
   potentially are, because of them also He has knowledge, and in respect
   of them He is called both first being and sovereign good. But what
   actually is bears no real relation to what is not actually but
   potentially. Now God is not otherwise related to things that actually
   are than to things that potentially are, because he is not changed by
   producing anything. [207]

   4. To whatsoever is added anything fresh, the thing receiving that
   addition must be changed, either essentially or accidentally. Now
   sundry fresh relations are predicated of God, as that He is lord or
   ruler of this thing newly come into being. If then any relation were
   predicated as really existing in God, it would follow that something
   fresh was added to God, and therefore that He had suffered some change,
   either essential or accidental, contrary to what was shown above (B. I,
   Chapp. [150]XXIII, [151]XXIV) [208]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [206] It is the general doctrine of the school, that while the
   relations of creatures to God are real (relationes reales), those of
   God to creatures are only conceptual (relationes rationis). The meaning
   is that any change wrought by divine action is in creatures, not in God

   [207] This doctrine is not devoid of difficulties. Love and hatred are
   certain relative affections. Can it be then that God has no more love
   for me, now that He has created me, than He would have had for me as a
   mere possible creature never to be realised? no more hatred of the sin
   that I have committed than of the sin that I might commit? Not so, for
   God loves more where He sees more of His own, and hates more that which
   is in greater opposition to Himself. There is more of God in an
   existing reality than in a possible one; and sin is in greater
   opposition to God for being actually committed. Hence greater love and
   greater hatred. Is not God then more closely related to actualities
   than to potentialities? But, St Thomas would contend, the relation,
   even though closer, still remains conceptual. God is not really
   affected by my existing, or by anything of my doing.

   [208] From the following chapter (XIII) it appears that we not only
   know God in His relations to us of Creator, Lord, etc., relations which
   in Him are conceptual, not real; but also to some extent in His
   absolute attributes of omnipotence, wisdom, goodness, intelligence and
   will, attributes which are realities in God, and are by us imperfectly
   apprehended as such.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XIII--How the aforesaid Relations are predicated of God

   IT cannot be said that the aforesaid relations are things existing
   outside of God. [209] For since God is first of beings and highest of
   excellencies, we should have to consider other relations of God to
   those relations, supposing them to be things; and if the second
   relations again were things, we should have to invent again a third set
   of relations, and so on to infinity. [210] Again, there are two ways in
   which a denomination may be predicated. A thing is denominated from
   what is outside it, as from place a man is said to be somewhere,' and
   from time once'; and again a thing is denominated from what is within
   it, as white' from whiteness. But from relation nothing is found to
   bear a denomination as from something outside itself, but only as from
   something within itself: thus a man is not called father' except from
   the paternity that is in him. It is impossible therefore for the
   relations, whereby God has relation to the creature, to be anything
   outside God. Since then it has been shown that they are not in Him
   really and yet are predicated of Him, the only possible conclusion is
   that they are attributed to Him merely by our mode of thought, inasmuch
   as other beings are in relation to Him: for when our understanding
   conceives that A is related to B, it further conceives that B is
   related to A, even though sometimes B is not really so related.

   Hence it is also clear that the aforesaid relations are not predicated
   of God in the same way that other things are predicated of God: for all
   other things, as wisdom or will, are predicated of His essence, while
   the aforesaid relations are by no means so predicated, but only
   according to our mode of thought. And yet our thought is not at fault:
   for, by the very fact of our mind knowing that the relations of effects
   of divine power have God himself for their term it predicates some
   things of Him relatively.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [209] It is not difficult to recognise as combated here the sequel of a
   theory rejected already (B.I, Chap. LI), the theory of Avicenna.

   [210] This is the celebrated tritos anthropos argument, originated by
   Plato himself against his own theory of Ideas, Parmenides, 132.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XIV--That the Predication of many Relations of God is no
   prejudice to the Simplicity and Singleness of His Being

   IT is no prejudice to the simplicity of God's being that many relations
   are predicated of Him, not as denoting anything affecting His essence,
   but according to our mode of thought. For our mind, understanding many
   things, may very well be related in manifold ways to a being that is in
   itself simple; and so it comes to view that simple being under manifold
   relations. Indeed the more simple anything is, the greater is its
   power, and the more numerous the effects whereof it is the principle;
   and thus it is viewed as coming into relation in more manifold ways.
   The fact then that many things are predicated of God relatively is an
   attestation of the supreme simplicity and singleness of His being.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XV--That God is to all things the Cause of their being

   HAVING shown (Chap [152]VI) that God is to some things the cause of
   their being, we must further show that nothing out of God has being
   except of Him. Every attribute that attaches to anything otherwise than
   as constituting its essence, attaches to it through some cause, as
   whiteness to man. [211] To be in a thing independently of causation is
   to be there primarily and immediately, as something ordinary (per se)
   and essential. It is impossible for any one attribute, attaching to two
   things, to attach to each as constituting its essence. What is
   predicated as constituent of a thing's essence, has no extension beyond
   that thing: as the having three angles together equal to two right
   angles has no extension beyond triangle,' of which it is predicated,
   but is convertible with triangle.' Whatever then attaches to two
   things, cannot attach to them both as constituting the essence of each.
   It is impossible therefore for any one attribute to be predicated of
   two subjects without its being predicated of one or the other as
   something come there by the operation of some cause: either one must be
   the cause of the other, or some third thing must be cause of both. Now
   being' is predicated of everything that is. It is impossible therefore
   for there to be two things, each having being independently of any
   cause; but either these things must both of them have being by the
   operation of a cause, or one must be to the other the cause of its
   being. Therefore everything which in any way is, must have being from
   that which is uncaused; that is, from God (B. I, Chap. [153]XV).

   2. What belongs to a thing by its nature, and is not dependent on any
   causation from without, cannot suffer diminution or defect. For if
   anything essential is withdrawn from or added to nature, that nature,
   so increased or diminished, will give place to another. If on the other
   hand the nature is left entire, and something else is found to have
   suffered diminution, it is clear that what has been so diminished does
   not absolutely depend on that nature, but on some other cause, by
   removal of which it is diminished. Whatever property therefore attaches
   to a thing less in one instance than in others, does not attach to that
   thing in mere virtue of its nature, but from the concurrence of some
   other cause. The cause of all effects in a particular kind will be that
   whereof the kind is predicated to the utmost. Thus we see that the
   hottest body is the cause of heat in all hot bodies, and the brightest
   body the cause of brightness in all bright bodies. But God is in the
   highest degree being' (B. I, Chap. [154]XIII). He then is the cause of
   all things whereof being' is predicated. [212]

   3. The order of causes must answer to the order of effects, since
   effects are proportionate to their causes. Hence, as special effects
   are traced to special causes, so any common feature of those special
   effects must be traced to some common cause. Thus, over and above the
   particular causes of this or that generation, the sun is the universal
   cause of all generation; and the king is the universal cause of
   government in his kingdom, over the officials of the kingdom, and also
   over the officials of individual cities. But being is common to all
   things. There must then be over all causes some Cause to whom it
   belongs to give being.

   4. What is by essence, is the cause of all that is by participation, as
   fire is the cause of all things fiery, as such. But God is being by His
   essence because He is pure being; while every other being is being by
   participation, because there can only be one being that is its own
   existence (B. I, Chapp. [155]XXII, [156]XLII). God therefore is cause
   of being to all other beings.

   5. Everything that is possible to be and not to be, has some cause:
   because, looked at by itself, it is indifferent either way; and thus
   there must be something else that determines it one way. Hence, as a
   process to infinity is impossible, there must be some necessary being
   that is cause of all things which are possible to be and not to be.
   [213]

   6. God in His actuality and perfection includes the perfections of all
   things (B. I, Chap. [157]XXVIII); and thus He is virtually all. He is
   therefore the apt producing cause of all.

   This conclusion is confirmed by divine authority: for it is said: Who
   made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are therein (Ps.
   cxlv, 6). And, All things were made by him, and without him was made
   nothing (John i, 3). And From whom are all things, by whom are all
   things, in (unto) whom are all things (Rom. xi, 16).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [211] We do not ask, what made man a rational animal, because man must
   be a rational animal, if he is to be man at all. But we may well ask:
   What made the Englishman white and the Chinaman yellow?

   [212] This argument rests unfortunately on a theory of physical nature,
   to which there is no counterpart in rerum natura, the theory of the
   four elements,' a physical presentation of Plato's doctrine of Ideas.
   Fire was taken to be ideally hot, and the cause of all heat: air
   ideally cold, and the cause of all cold: water ideally humid, and cause
   of all humidity; earth ideally dry, and cause of all dryness. The
   mediaeval mind delighted in this recurrence to unity, ascribing all the
   particulars of a kind to some one source and cause, the perfect
   expression of that kind. Thus motion was traced to one primum mobile,
   political power to the Emperor, etc. The unities of nature are not so
   easy to discern in the light of our increased knowledge. Nature is more
   manifold and broken into detail than as St Thomas knew it. It is true
   that the sun, "warmest and brightest of beings," is the chief cause of
   heat and light that make human existence on earth possible; -- to the
   sun we owe the coal-forests, -- and we may observe that the sun is thus
   an image of God in the universe: but this is an analogy, not an
   argument. St Thomas's conclusion, so far as I see, gains no support
   from modern physics: but, metaphysically, it may be urged thus. -- God
   is ex hypothesi the ideal Being, the fulness of Being: the name God'
   means no less than that. If then there be a God at all, all other being
   must be derived from Him.

   [213] Understand, and yet are.' This is the argument for the existence
   of God, known as the argument from contingent being.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVI--That God has brought things into being out of nothing

   TO every effect produced by God there is either something pre-existent
   or not. If not, the thesis stands, that God produces some effect out of
   nothing pre-existent. If anything pre-exists, we either have a process
   to infinity, which is impossible, or we must come to something
   primitive, which does not presuppose anything else previous to it. Now
   this primitive something cannot be God Himself, for God is not the
   material out of which anything is made (B. I, Chap. [158]XVI): nor can
   it be any other being, distinct from God and uncaused by God (Chap.
   [159]XV).

   3. The more universal the effect, the higher the cause: for the higher
   the cause, the wider its range of efficiency. Now being is more
   universal than motion. Therefore above any cause that acts only by
   moving and transmitting must be that cause which is the first principle
   of being; and that we have shown to be God (B. I, Chap. [160]XIII). God
   therefore does not act merely by moving and transmuting: whereas every
   cause that can only bring things into being out of pre-existing
   material acts merely in that way, for a thing is made out of material
   by movement or some change.

   4. It is not proper to the universal cause of being, as such, to act
   only by movement and change: for not by movement and change is being,
   as such, made out of not-being, as such, but being this' is made out of
   not being this.' But God is the universal principle of being (Chap.
   [161]XV). Therefore it is not proper to Him to act only by movement or
   change, or to need pre-existent material to make anything.

   5. Every agent has a term of action like itself, for its acts inasmuch
   as it is in actuality. Given then an agent in actuality by some form
   inherent in it, and not to the whole extent of its substance, [214] it
   will be proper to such an agent to produce its effect by causing a form
   in some way inherent in matter. But God is in actuality, not by
   anything inhering in Him, but to the whole extent of His substance (B.
   I, Chap. [162]XVIII). Therefore the proper mode of divine action is to
   produce the whole subsistent thing, and not a mere inherent thing, as
   is form in matter.

   10. Between actuality and potentiality such an order obtains, that,
   though in one and the same being, which is sometimes in potentiality
   sometimes in actuality, potentiality is prior in time to actuality
   (although actuality is prior in nature), yet, absolutely speaking,
   actuality must be prior to potentiality, as is clear from this, that
   potentiality is not reduced to actuality except by some actual being.
   But matter is being in potentiality. [215] Therefore God, first and
   pure actuality, must be absolutely prior to matter, and consequently
   cause thereof.

   This truth divine Scripture confirms, saying: In the beginning God
   created heaven and earth (Gen. i, 1). For to create is nothing else
   than to bring a thing into being without any pre-existent material.

   Hereby is confuted the error of the ancient philosophers, who supposed
   no cause at all for matter, since in the actions of particular agents
   they always saw some matter pre-existent to every action. Hence they
   took up the common opinion, that nothing is made out of nothing, which
   indeed is true of the actions of particular agents. But they had not
   yet arrived at a knowledge of the universal agent, the active cause of
   all being, whose causative action does not necessarily suppose any
   pre-existent material. [216]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [214] That is to say, given a corporeal agent: for the schoolmen held
   that material forms on earth did not actuate the whole potentiality of
   the matter in which they inhered. So they explained the mutability of
   sublunary substances. Cf. Chap. XXX.

   [215] By matter' St Thomas does not mean material substances (corpora),
   but a sort of matrix, or mother-stuff, conceived as not yet determined
   by any active principle, or form,' and therefore in potentiality to all
   manner of material forms. This is called by the schoolmen materia
   prima, or primordial matter. Primordial (or formless) matter, as such,
   nowhere exists: that is to say, all existing matter is determined by
   some particular form, so as to make this or that material substance or
   body: but primordial matter underlies all material substances. For a
   first notion (I do not mean St Thomas's notion) of primordial matter,
   see Plato, Timaeus, 50, 51, 52.

   [216] That is to say, who works unconditionally, being Himself the
   Unconditioned. The "error of the ancient philosophers" was the error of
   Plato (Timaeus, 30), who certainly had arrived to some, though an
   imperfect, knowledge of the Universal Agent. Plato's reluctance to
   confess God as more than the Demiurge, -- or ordering Mind of the
   universe, not its Creator, -- came from his discerning, as he thought,
   the origin of evil in the existence of matter, matter being more or
   less an irrational product, not originated by mind, and but imperfectly
   controlled by mind. Monists at least will not deny the derivation of
   matter from mind. To them, all reality is One and of One: but they deny
   creation out of nothing, and consider matter a necessary and eternal
   outcome of the Divine Mind. On Monism St Thomas touches, Chapp.
   LXXIII-LXXV.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVII--That Creation is not a Movement nor a Change

   EVERY movement or change is the actualisation of something that was in
   potentiality, as such: but in this action of creation there is nothing
   pre-existent in potentiality to become the object of the action.

   2. The extremes of movement or change fall under the same order, [217]
   being either of the same kind, as contraries are, or sharing one common
   potentiality of matter. But nothing of this can be in creation, to
   which no previous condition of things is supposed.

   3. In every change or movement there must be something coming to be
   otherwise than as it was before. But where the whole substance of a
   thing is brought into being, there cannot be any permanent residuum,
   now in this condition, now in that: because such a residuum would not
   be produced, but presupposed to production.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [217] The "extremes" are the situation from which the movement or
   change starts, and the situation in which it ends.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVIII--Solution of Arguments against Creation [218]

   HENCE appears the futility of arguments against creation drawn from the
   nature of movement or change, -- as that creation must be in some
   subject, or that non-being must be transmuted into being: for creation
   is not a change, but is the mere dependence of created being on the
   principle by which it is set up, and so comes under the category of
   relation: hence the subject of creation may very well be said to be the
   thing created. [219] Nevertheless creation is spoken of as a change'
   according to our mode of conceiving it, inasmuch as our understanding
   takes one and the same thing to be now non-existent and afterwards
   existing. If Creation (creaturedom) is a relation, it is evidently some
   sort of reality; and this reality is neither uncreated, nor created by
   a further act of creation. For since the created effect really depends
   on the Creator, this relation must be a certain reality. Now every
   reality is brought into being by God; and therefore also this reality
   is brought into being by God, and yet was not created by any other
   creation than that of the first creature, because accidents and forms
   do not exist by themselves, and therefore neither are they terms of
   separate creation, since creation is the production of substantial
   being; but as they are in another,' so are they created in the creation
   of other things.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [218] The addition of ab aeterno is evidently out of place in the title
   of this chapter. It contains no reference to the question raised in
   Chap. XXXVIII.

   [219] Creation' here spoken of is not the action as it is of God, but
   the action as it is received in the creature, constituting a relation
   to God which we may call creaturedom.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XIX--That Creation is not Successive

   SUCCESSION is proper to movement. But creation is not movement.
   Therefore there is in it no succession.

   2. In every successive movement there is some medium between the
   extremes. But between being and not-being, which are the extremes in
   creation, there can be no medium, and therefore no succession.

   3. In every making, in which there is succession, the process of being
   made is before the state of achieved completion. But this cannot happen
   in creation, because, for the process of being made to precede the
   achieved completion of the creature, there would be required some
   subject in which the process might take place. Such a subject cannot be
   the creature itself, of whose creation we are speaking, because that
   creature is not till the state of its achieved completion is realised.
   Nor can it be the Maker, because to be in movement is an actuality, not
   of mover, but of moved. And as for the process of being made having for
   its subject any pre-existing material, that is against the very idea of
   creation. Thus succession is impossible in the act of creation.

   5. Successive stages in the making of things become necessary, owing to
   defect of the matter, which is not sufficiently disposed from the first
   for the reception of the form. Hence, when the matter is already
   perfectly disposed for the form, it receives it in an instant. Thus
   because a transparent medium is always in final disposition for light,
   it lights up at once in the presence of any actually shining thing. Now
   in creation nothing is prerequisite on the part of the matter, nor is
   anything wanting to the agent for action. It follows that creation
   takes place in an instant: a thing is at once in the act of being
   created and is created, as light is at once being shed and is shining.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXI--That it belongs to God alone to create

   SINCE the order of actions is according to the order of agents, and the
   action is nobler of the nobler agent, the first and highest action must
   be proper to the first and highest agent. But creation is the first and
   highest action, presupposing no other, and in all others presupposed.
   Therefore creation is the proper action of God alone, who is the
   highest agent.

   2. Nothing else is the universal cause of being but God (Chap.
   [163]XV).

   3. Effects answer proportionally to their causes. Thus actual effects
   we attribute to actual causes, potential effects to potential causes,
   particular effects to particular causes, and universal effects to
   universal causes. Now the first thing caused is being,' as we see by
   its presence in all things. Therefore the proper cause of being,'
   simply as such, is the first and universal agent, which is God. Other
   agents are not causes of being,' simply as such, but causes of being
   this,' as man' or white': but being,' simply as such, is caused by
   creation, which presupposes nothing, because nothing can be outside of
   the extension of being,' simply as such. Other productions result in
   being this,' or being of this quality': for out of pre-existent being
   is made being this,' or being of this quality.' [220]

   6. Every agent that acts as an instrument completes the action of the
   principal agent by some action proper and connatural to itself, as a
   saw operates to the making of a stool by cutting. If then there be any
   nature that operates to creation as an instrument of the prime creator,
   this being must operate through some action due and proper to its own
   nature. Now the effect answering to the proper action of an instrument
   is prior in the way of production to the effect answering to the
   principal agent; hence it is that the final end answers to the
   principal agent: [221] for the cutting of the wood is prior to the form
   of the stool. There must then be some effect due to the proper
   operation of the instrument used for creation; and this effect must be
   prior in the way of production to being': for being' is the effect
   answering to the action of the prime creator. But that is impossible:
   for the more general is prior in the way of generation to the more
   particular. [222]

   Hereby is destroyed the error of certain philosophers, who said that
   God created the first spirit, and by it was created the second, and so
   in order to the last.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [220] tode ti, or toionde ti, as Aristotle would say, the former
   expressing some particular substance, as this steam,' the latter some
   particular quality, as the whiteness of these washed garments.' The
   argument lies open to this difficulty. -- Effects answer proportionally
   to their causes: but being, simply as such,' is an abstract effect:
   therefore it answers to an abstract cause: which argues the Creator to
   be an abstract Being: now abstract Being is mere mental fiction. -- St
   Thomas would not admit this Nominalist position, that abstract Being is
   mere mental fiction. Force, Energy, Work, Life, surely are not mere
   mental fictions, and yet they are abstract beings. Abstract Being does
   not exist as abstract: it is a reality in these and these particulars.
   St Thomas, in one place, if indeed the argument is really his, calls
   God an abstract Being: see B. I, Chap. [164]XLII, n. 13, with note. He
   means that God is a Being of ideal perfection. God is ideal Being,
   actualised: He is the actuality of ideality. To say that God gives
   being to things is by no means to deny that He gives also particular
   determinations of being. The first being was created under certain
   particular determinations. Once created, created agents act and react,
   modifying these determinations. But Being, as such, they can neither
   give nor take away. They can neither create nor annihilate anything.
   Matter is indestructible; and the light of intelligence, once kindled
   by the Creator's touch, burns for eternity.

   [221] The final end which the work is intended to achieve directs the
   progress of the work, as the principal agent also directs it. The final
   end first exists as an idea in the mind of the principal agent: this
   idea guides the execution; and is realised last thing of all, when the
   work is done.

   [222] What shall a thing be, before it has being at all?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXII--That God is Almighty

   AS creation is the work of God alone, so whatever beings are producible
   only by creation must be immediately produced by Him. Such are all
   spirits, [223] the existence of which for the present let us suppose,
   [224] and likewise all bodily matter. These several existences are
   immediate effects of creative power. Now power is not determined and
   limited to one effect, when it is productive of several effects
   immediately, and that not out of any pre-existent material. I say
   immediately,' because if the production were through intermediate
   agents, the diversity of effects might be ascribed to those
   intermediate causes. I say again not out of any pre-existent material,'
   because the same agent by the same action causes different effects
   according to the difference of material. God's power then is not
   determined and limited to one effect.

   2. Every perfect active power is co-extensive with and covers all cases
   of its own proper effect: thus perfect building power would extend to
   everything that could be called a house. But the divine power is of
   itself the cause of being, and being is its proper effect. Therefore
   that power extends to all things that are not inconsistent with the
   idea of being: for if the divine power were available only for one
   particular effect, it would not be the ordinary cause of being, as
   such, but cause of this being.' Now what is inconsistent with the idea
   of being' is the opposite of being,' which is not-being.' God then can
   do all things that do not include in themselves the element of
   not-being, that is to say, that do not involve a contradiction.

   3. Every agent acts inasmuch as it is in actuality. According then to
   the mode of actuality of each agent in the mode of its active power.
   Now God is perfect actuality, having in Himself the perfections of all
   beings (B. I, Chap. [165]XXVIII): therefore His active power extends to
   all things that are not inconsistent with actual being.

   5. There are three ways in which an effect may not be in the power of
   an agent. In one way, because it has no affinity or likeness to the
   agent, for every agent acts to the production of its own likeness
   somehow: [225] hence man cannot be the parent of brute or plant, though
   he can be parent of man, who is more than they. In another way, on
   account of the excellence of the effect, transcending the compass of
   the active power: thus the active power of matter cannot produce
   spirit. In a third way, on account of the material being determined to
   some effect, and the agent having no power over it: thus a carpenter
   cannot make a saw, because his art gives him no power over iron. But in
   none of these ways can an effect be withdrawn from the divine power:
   not for the unlikeness of the effect, since every being, in so much as
   it has being, is like God (Chap. [166]XV): nor again for the excellence
   of the effect, since God is above all in goodness and perfection (B. I,
   Chapp. [167]XXVIII, [168]XLI): nor lastly for the defect of the
   material, since God in His action needs no material (Chap. [169]XVI).

   This also is taught by divine Scripture as a tenet of faith. I am God
   Almighty, walk before me and be perfect (Gen. xvii, 1): I know that
   thou canst do all things (Job xlii, 2): No word shall be impossible
   with God (Luke i, 37).

   Hereby is excluded the error of sundry philosophers, who have laid it
   down that God can do nothing except according to the course of nature.
   On such it is said: As though the Almighty had no power, they reckoned
   of him (Job xxii, 17).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [223] The term here translated spirit' is substantia separata, a
   substance existing by itself apart' from matter. The expression seems
   to be taken from the aute kath' hauten ousia of the Platonic Ideas,
   which the Neo-Platonists personified as spirits.

   [224] He undertakes to prove it in Chap. XLVI.

   [225] Thus my writing is like, or proportioned to, my thought, as a
   sign to the thing signified.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXIII--That God's Action in Creation is not of Physical
   Necessity, but of Free Choice of Will

   THE power of every necessary agent is determined and limited to one
   effect. That is the reason why all physical effects always come out in
   the same way, unless there be some interference: but acts of the will
   not so. But the divine power is not directed to one effect only (Chap.
   [170]XXII). God then does not act by physical necessity, but by will.
   [226]

   2. Whatever does not involve a contradiction, is within the range of
   the divine power. But many things that do not exist in creation would
   still involve no contradiction if they did exist. This is most
   evidently the case in regard of the number and size and distances of
   the stars and other bodies. They would present no contradiction, no
   intrinsic absurdity, if they were arranged on another plan. Many things
   therefore lie within the range of divine power, that are not found in
   nature. But whoever does some and leaves out others of the things that
   he can do, acts by choice of will and not by physical necessity. [227]

   4. Since God's action is His substance (B. I, Chap. [171]LXXIII), the
   divine action cannot come under the category of those acts that are
   transient' and not in the agent, but must be an act immanent' in the
   agent, such as are acts of knowing and desiring, and none other. God
   therefore acts and operates by knowing and willing.

   6. A self-determined agent is prior to an agent determined from
   without: for all that is determined from without is reducible to what
   is self-determined, or we should have process to infinity. But he who
   is not master of his own action is not self-determined: for he acts as
   led by another, not as his own leader. The prime agent then must act in
   such a way as to remain master of his own action. But no one is master
   of his own action except he be a voluntary agent.

   7. Will-action is naturally prior to physical action: for that is
   naturally prior which is more perfect, albeit in the individual it be
   posterior in time. But will-action is the more perfect, as within our
   experience voluntary agents are more perfect than physical. Therefore
   will-action must be assigned to God, the prime agent.

   8. Where will-action and physical action go together, will-action
   represents the higher power and uses the other as an instrument. But
   the divine power is supreme, and therefore must act by will-action, not
   under physical necessity.

   This truth also divine Scripture teaches us. All things, whatsoever he
   hath willed, the Lord hath done (Ps. cxxxiv, 6): Who worketh all things
   according to the counsel of his will (Eph. i, 11).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [226] The proof referred to rests principally on this, that the Creator
   works not upon any pre-existent material. But this and the other
   arguments of Chap. XXII do not touch the idealist and pantheist
   position, that the Supreme Mind thinks in necessary grooves or forms;
   that what theologians call creatures' are but the necessary thoughts of
   God; and that nothing is really possible but what thus actually comes
   to be. This position is taken account of more in Chap. XXVI. It may be
   also met thus. We may lay down a psychological proof of the freedom of
   the human will; and thence argue that a perfection so conspicuous in
   the human mind cannot be denied to the Supreme Mind. -- see Free-will
   in God and Man in Oxford and Cambridge Conferences, 1900, 1901, pp. 142
   sq. (Sands and Co., London).

   [227] This is the argument above referred to (B. I, Chap. XIII notes)
   of the primitive collocation of the materials of the universe being no
   consequence of physical necessity but an ordinance of mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXIV--That God acts by His Wisdom [228]

   THE will is moved by some apprehension. [229] But God acts by willing.
   Since then in God there is intellectual apprehension only, and He
   understands nothing otherwise than by understanding Himself, whom to
   understand is to be wise (B. I, Chap. [172]LIV), it follows that God
   works out all things according to His wisdom.

   2. Every agent acts in so far as it has within it something
   corresponding to the effect to be produced. But in every voluntary
   agent, as such, what corresponds to the effect to be produced is some
   intellectual presentation of the same. Were there no more than a mere
   physical disposition to produce the effect, the agent could act only to
   one effect, because for one physical cause there is only one physical
   mode of operation (ratio naturalis unius est una tantum). Every
   voluntary agent therefore produces its effect according to the mode of
   intellectual operation proper to itself. But God acts by willing, and
   therefore it is by the wisdom of His intellect that he brings things
   into being.

   3. The function of wisdom is to set things in order. Now the setting of
   things in order can be effected only through a knowledge of the
   relation and proportion of the said things to one another, and to some
   higher thing which is the end and purpose of them all: for the mutual
   order of things to one another is founded upon their order to the end
   which they are to serve. But it is proper to intelligence alone to know
   the mutual relations and proportions of things. Again, it is proper to
   wisdom to judge of things as they stand to their highest cause. [230]
   Thus every setting of things in order by wisdom must be the work of
   some intelligence. [231] But the things produced by God bear an orderly
   relation to one another, which cannot be attributed to chance, since it
   (sit not sint) obtains always or for the most part. Thus it is evident
   that God, in bringing things into being, intended them in a certain
   order. Therefore His production of them was a work of wisdom.

   All this is confirmed by divine authority, for it is said: Thou has
   made all things in wisdom (Ps. ciii, 24); and the Lord in wisdom
   founded the earth (Prov. iii, 19).

   Hereby is excluded the error of some who said that all things depend on
   the absolute will of God, independent of any reason.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [228] That is to say, not by arbitrary whim or irrational wilfulness.
   The thesis is against the Nominalists, who denied the intelligible
   essences (intelligibilia) which are the reasons of things (rationes
   rerum).

   [229] The apprehension may be of a sensible object, provoking passion,
   or it may be an intellectual apprehension. In God of course there is no
   passion, and no intellect that can present things otherwise than as
   they are.

   [230] The highest cause' is here then to be the final cause. Thus the
   purpose of the navigation is the highest cause' of the parts of a ship,
   as such; and to judge of those parts in view of navigation belongs to
   nautical wisdom.'

   [231] A formal logician might quarrel with this argument: All work of
   intelligence and wisdom is a setting of things in order; therefore all
   setting of things in order is a work of intelligence and wisdom:' an
   illogical conversion. St Thomas however does not argue in that way. He
   gives us to understand that to set things in order is a peculiar work
   of intelligence, which cannot be done by chance, least of all when the
   things ordered are complex and manifold, as are the endless details of
   nature. Chance events, as Aristotle observes, are rareties and
   exceptions: the course of nature, so uniform, or so seldom varied,
   cannot be the work of chance. Thus that very uniformity of nature now
   taken to militate against religion, is taken by St Thomas for an
   argument of divine contrivance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXV--In what sense some things are said to be Impossible to the
   Almighty

   IN God there is active power, but no potentiality. Now possibility is
   spoken of both as involving active power and as involving potentiality.
   Those things then are impossible to God, the possibility of which would
   mean in Him potentiality. Examples: God cannot be any material thing:
   He cannot suffer change, nor defect, nor fatigue, nor forgetfulness,
   nor defeat, nor violence, nor repentance, anger, or sadness.

   Again, since the object and effect of active power is some produced
   reality, it must be said to be impossible for God to make or produce
   anything inconsistent with the notion of reality,' or being,' as such,
   or inconsistent with the notion of a reality that is made,' or
   produced,' inasmuch as it is made,' or produced.' Examples: God cannot
   make one and the same thing together to be and not to be. He cannot
   make opposite attributes to be in the same subject in the same respect.
   He cannot make a thing wanting in any of its essential constituents,
   while the thing itself remains: for instance, a man without a soul.
   [232] Since the principles of some sciences, as logic, geometry, and
   arithmetic, rest on the formal, or abstract, constituents on which the
   essence of a thing depends, it follows that God cannot effect anything
   contrary to these principles, as that genus should not be predicable of
   species, or that lines drawn from the centre of a circle to the
   circumference should not be equal. God cannot make the past not to have
   been. Some things also God cannot make, because they would be
   inconsistent with the notion of a creature, as such: thus He cannot
   create a God, or make anything equal to Himself, or anything that shall
   maintain itself in being, independently of Him. He cannot do what He
   cannot will: He cannot make Himself cease to be, or cease to be good or
   happy; nor can He will anything evil, or sin. Nor can His will be
   changeable: He cannot therefore cause what He has once willed not to be
   fulfilled. [233] There is however this difference between this last
   impossibility on God's part and all others that have been enumerated.
   The others are absolute impossibilities for God either to will or do:
   but the things now spoken of God might will and do if His will or power
   be considered absolutely, but not if it be considered under the
   presupposition of His will to the contrary. And therefore all such
   phrases as, God cannot act contrary to what He has arranged to do,' are
   to be understood in sensu composito; but, understood in sensu diviso,
   they are false, for in that sense they regard the power and will of God
   considered absolutely. [234]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [232] God taketh away the spirit of princes (Ps. lxxv), but then they
   cease to be princes.

   [233] God would do certain things, apart from penance or prayer, which
   He foresees will be interposed, as the destruction of Ninive (Jon. iii,
   10), or of the Israelites in the desert (Exod. xxxii, 10). He does not
   will such things absolutely; and St Thomas here speaks of absolute
   will, e.g., of God's promises to Messiah and His Church, temporary
   appearances notwithstanding (Ps. lxxxviii, 33-38).

   [234] For this distinction and doctrine see B. I, Chap. lxxxiii, with
   notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXVI--That the Divine Understanding is not limited to certain
   fixed Effects

   NOW that it has been shown (Chap. [173]XXIII) that the divine power
   does not act of physical necessity, but by understanding and will, lest
   any one should think that God's understanding or knowledge extend only
   to certain fixed effects, and that thus God acts under stress of
   ignorance, though not under stress of physical constraint, it remains
   to show that His knowledge or understanding is bounded by no limits in
   its view of effects.

   2. We have shown above (B. I, Chap. [174]XLIII) the infinity of the
   divine essence. Now the plane of the infinite can never be reached by
   any piling up of finite quantities, because the infinite infinitely
   transcends any finite quantities however many, even though they were
   infinite in number. [235] But no other being than God is infinite in
   essence: all others are essentially included under limited genera and
   species. [236] Howsoever then and to whatsoever extent the effects of
   divine production are comprehended, it is ever within the compass of
   the divine essence to reach beyond them and to be the foundation of
   more. The divine understanding then, in perfectly knowing the divine
   essence (B. I, Chap. [175]XLVII), transcends any infinity of actual
   effects of divine power and therefore is not necessarily limited to
   these or those effects.

   4. If the causality of the divine understanding were limited, as a
   necessary agent, to any effects, it would be to those effects which God
   actually brings into being. But it has been shown above (B. I, Chap.
   [176]LXVI) that God understands even things that neither are nor shall
   be nor have been.

   5. The divine knowledge stands to the things produced by God as the
   knowledge of an artist to the knowledge of his art. But every art
   extends to all that can possibly be contained under the kind of things
   subject to that art, as the art of building to all houses. But the kind
   of thing subject to the divine art is being' (genus subjectum divinae
   artis est ens), since God by His understanding is the universal
   principal of being (Chapp. [177]XXI, [178]XXIV). Therefore the divine
   understanding extends its causality to all things that are not
   inconsistent with the notion of being,' and is not limited to certain
   fixed effects.

   Hence it is said: Great is our Lord, and great his power, and of his
   wisdom; there is no reckoning by number (Ps. cxlvi, 5).

   Hereby is excluded the position of some philosophers who said that from
   God's understanding of Himself there emanates a certain arrangement of
   things in the universe, as though He did not deal with creatures at His
   discretion fixing the limits of each creature and arranging the whole
   universe, as the Catholic faith professes. It is to be observed however
   that, though the divine understanding is not limited to certain
   effects, God nevertheless has determined to Himself fixed effects to be
   produced in due order by His wisdom, as it is said: Thou hast disposed
   all things in measure, number and weight (Wisd. xi, 21). [237]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [235] Any quantitative infinite, -- allowing its possibility, -- still
   is infinite only in a certain category. But God transcends all the
   categories. An infinite number would not be intelligent, or just, or
   beautiful. Therefore it would fall infinitely short of God.

   [236] It is said, I think, by Aristotle, that only natural objects fall
   into genera and species, not artificial beings. It is no concern of St
   Thomas here to deny that artificial things may anyhow be classified,
   though it be not by generic and specific differences. To classify is to
   limit. God is above all classification.

   [237] This common Hegelian position is that the world is necessary to
   God, and the whole arrangement of the universe likewise an a priori
   necessity, nothing else being possible: in fact that the term actual
   being' includes at once all that is and all that ever could be, while
   the terms possible,' necessary,' contingent,' express nothing whatever
   but certain limitations of our field of view. Neither Hegel, nor any
   sane man who believes in a God at all, could ever suppose that there
   were things, producible in themselves, which could not be produced
   because God did not know of them. One wonders what opponents St Thomas
   could have met guilty of this absurdity. Ex hypothesi God is a Being
   whose mental vision extends everywhere; so that what God has no idea
   of, must be blank nonsense, and impossible as nonsensical. To
   Hegelians, however, God is exhausted in the production, or evolution of
   the universe: He gives being, and that of necessity, to all things
   whatsoever to which He possibly can give being: nothing realisable, or
   actualisable, remains behind, nothing potential. St Thomas meets this
   by insisting that God is infinite, and therefore inexhaustible; ten
   thousand such worlds as this would not exhaust His capacity of
   production; and over them all He would still remain, immeasurably
   exalted, distinct, independent, supreme. There is however something, --
   we cannot call it a limitation, but we may call it a condition of
   divine intelligence and creative power, -- a condition less regarded by
   St Thomas, but forcibly commending itself to us, upon six centuries
   longer experience of the prevalence of evil on earth. Fewer
   combinations, far fewer perhaps, than St Thomas thought possible, and
   our short-sighted impatience might crave for as remedial, may be really
   possible at all. The range of intrinsic impossibilities may extend
   considerably, beyond the abstract regions of logic and mathematics,
   into the land of concrete physical realities, one reality, if existent,
   necessarily involving, or necessarily barring, the existence of some
   other reality. Such necessity, such there be, is no limitation of
   divine power or divine intelligence. God still discerns endless
   possibilities, and can do whatever He discerns as possible; but much
   that men take for possibility is rendered on this hypothesis sheer
   absurdity, -- as impossible, let us say, as a spiritual elephant.' We
   wonder why God does not mend matters, as we would mend them, had we His
   power. Had we His power, we should also have His intelligence, and
   discern that there is no riding out of our troubles on the backs of
   spiritual elephants. There is some hint of the matter of this note in
   Chapp. [179]XXIX, [180]XXX following.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXVIII--That God has not brought things into being in discharge
   of any Debt of Justice

   JUSTICE is to another, rendering him his due. But, antecedently to the
   universal production of all things, nothing can be presupposed to which
   anything is due.

   2. An act of justice must be preceded by some act, whereby something is
   made another's own; and that act, whereby first something is made
   another's own, cannot be an act of justice. [238] But by creation a
   created thing first begins to have anything of its own. Creation then
   cannot proceed from any debt of justice.

   3. No man owes anything to another, except inasmuch as he in some way
   depends on him, receiving something from him. Thus every man is in his
   neighbour's debt on God's account; from whom we have received all
   things. But God depends on none, and needs nothing of any.

   5. Though nothing created precedes the universal production of all
   things, something uncreated does precede it: for the divine goodness
   precedes as the end and prime motive of creation, according to
   Augustine, who says: "Because God is good, we exist" (De Verb. Apost.
   Serm. 13). But the divine goodness needs nothing external for its
   perfection. Nor is it necessary, for all that God wills His own
   goodness, that He should will the production of things other than
   Himself. God wills His own goodness necessarily, but He does not
   necessarily will other things. Therefore the production of creatures is
   not a debt of necessity to the divine goodness. But, taking justice in
   the wider sense of the term, there may be said to be justice in the
   creation of the world, inasmuch as it befits the divine goodness.

   7. But if we consider the divine plan, according as God has planned it
   in His understanding and will to bring things into being, from that
   point of view the production of things does proceed from the necessity
   of the divine plan (B. I, Chap. [181]LXXXIII): for it is impossible for
   God to have planned the doing of anything, and afterwards not to do it.
   Thus fulfilment is necessarily due to His every plan. But this debt is
   not sufficient to constitute a claim of justice, properly so called, in
   the action of God creating the world: for justice, properly so called,
   is not of self to self.

   Hence it is said: Who hath first given to Him, and recompense shall be
   made him? (Rom. xi, 35.) Who hath first given to me, that I may repay
   him? (Job xli, 2.)

   Hereby is shut out the error of some who have tried to prove that God
   can do no otherwise than as He does, because He can do no otherwise
   than as He owes, or ought.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [238] Justice does not provide the first occupation but is Conversant
   with the maintenance or transference of titles already existent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXIX--How in the Production of a Creature there may be found a
   debt of Justice in respect of the necessary Sequence of something
   posterior upon something prior

   I SPEAK here of what is prior, not in order of time merely, but by
   nature. The debt is not absolute, but conditional, of the form: If this
   is to be, this must go before.' According to this necessity a triple
   debt is found in the production of creatures. First, when the
   conditional proceeds from the whole universe of things to some
   particular part requisite for the perfection of the universe. Thus, if
   God willed the universe to be such as it is, it was due that He should
   make the sun and water and the like, without which the universe cannot
   be. [239] Second, when the conditional proceeds from one creature to
   another. Thus, if God willed man to be, He was obliged to make plants
   and animals and such like, which man needs to his perfect being: though
   God has made both the one and the other out of His mere will. Third,
   when the conditional proceeds from the existence of the individual
   creature to its parts and properties and accidents, on which the
   creature depends for its being or perfection. Thus, supposing that God
   wished to make man, it was due, on this supposition, that He should
   unite in him soul and body, senses, and other appurtenances, intrinsic
   and extrinsic. In all these matters, rightly considered, God is not
   said to be a debtor to the creature, but a debtor to the fulfilment of
   His own plan.

   On these explanations of the meaning of the term debt' and due,'
   natural justice is found in the universe both in respect of the
   creation of things and in respect of their propagation; and therefore
   God is said to have established and to govern all things justly and
   reasonably. Thus then is shut out a two-fold error: on the one hand of
   those who would limit the divine power, saying that God can do only as
   He does, because so He is bound to do; on the other, of those who say
   that all things follow on His sheer will, and that no other reason is
   to be sought or assigned in creation than that God wills it so.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [239] True, but how differently one thinks and speaks when one has come
   to regard the sun as a small star in the Milky Way! The stellar
   universe would not miss it. Still, counting the sun a cosmically little
   thing, "these little things are great to little man."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXX--How Absolute Necessity may have place in Creation

   ALTHOUGH all things depend on the will of God as their first cause, and
   this first cause is not necessitated in its operation except on the
   supposition of its own purpose, not for that however is absolute
   necessity excluded from creation, need we aver that all things are
   contingent.

   1. There are things in creation which simply and absolutely must be.
   Those things simply and absolutely must be, in which there is no
   possibility of their not being. Some things are so brought into being
   by God that there is in their nature a potentiality of not being: which
   happens from this, that the matter in them is in potentiality to
   receive another form. Those things then in which either there is no
   matter, or, if there is any, it is not open to receive another form,
   have no potentiality of not being: such things then simply and
   absolutely must be. If it be said that things which are of nothing, of
   themselves tend to nothingness, and thus there is in all creatures a
   potentiality of not being, -- it is manifest that such a conclusion
   does not follow. For things created by God are said to tend to
   nothingness only in the way in which they are from nothing; and that is
   only in respect of the power of the agent who has created them. Thus
   then creatures have no potentiality of not being: but there is in the
   Creator a power of giving them being or of stopping the influx of being
   to them. [240]

   4. The further a thing is distant from the self-existent, that is, from
   God, the nigher it is to not being; and the nigher it is to God, the
   further it is withdrawn from not being. Those things therefore which
   are nighest to God, and therefore furthest removed from not being, --
   in order that the hierarchy of being (ordo rerum) may be complete, --
   must be such as to have in themselves no potentiality of not being, or
   in other words, their being must be absolutely necessary.

   We observe therefore that, considering the universe of creatures as
   they depend on the first principles of all things, we find that they
   depend on the will (of God), -- not as necessarily arising therefrom,
   except by an hypothetical, or consequent necessity, as has been
   explained (Chap. [182]XXVIII). But, compared with proximate and created
   principles, [241] we find some things having an absolute necessity.
   There is no absurdity in causes being originally brought into being
   without any necessity, and yet, once they are posited in being, having
   such and such an effect necessarily following from them. That such
   natures were produced by God, was voluntary on His part: but that, once
   established, a certain effect proceeds from them, is a matter of
   absolute necessity. [242] What belongs to a thing by reason of its
   essential principles, must obtain by absolute necessity in all things.
   [243]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [240] By "beings in which there is no matter," St Thomas meant pure
   spirits. By "beings in which the matter is not open to receive another
   form," he meant the heavenly bodies: if he had written in our time, he
   might be well taken to mean those primitive atoms or molecules, which
   have been termed "the building stones of the universe." He has in his
   eye the whole class of natural objects, animate and inanimate, that can
   neither destroy themselves nor ever be destroyed and broken up by any
   of the ordinary processes of nature, but are permanent from age to age,
   whether existing apart or in composition. In the physical order, of
   which St Thomas here speaks, the existence of these beings is
   "absolutely necessary"; no physical force can destroy them. One might
   say the same of the total store of energy in the universe, according to
   the principle of the conservation of energy.' St Thomas's acquaintance
   with Plato was through the Neo-Platonists; and their favourite Dialogue
   was the Timaeus, the following passage of which (Tim. 41) well
   illustrates his meaning. The Platonic Demiurge is addressing the minor
   deities whom he has compounded, them and their offspring: "Ye gods, god
   born, works of my fatherhood and constructive power, what has been made
   by me is indissoluble, so long as it has my consent to its being.
   Whatever is bound and put together may indeed be loosened: but it were
   ill done to undo a work fairly compacted and well made. Therefore, made
   as ye are, ye are not absolutely beyond death and dissolution: still ye
   shall never be dissolved nor meet the doom of death, finding in my will
   a tie greater even and more potent than the ties wherewith your being
   was originally bound together."

   [241] That is, with physical causes.

   [242] Unless the effect be neutralised by some further effect, which
   God may produce either by direction of some natural agency or by
   special interposition (or perhaps abstention) of His own.

   [243] Or the thing must cease to be. Sint ut sunt, aut non sint, as was
   said in another connexion. The interest of this chapter lies in the
   spectacle of a thirteenth century writer cautiously and tentatively
   dealing with principles so familiar to us as the permanence of matter
   and the uniformity of nature. I have omitted much that brings in
   mediaeval physics to little profit for our time.

   CHAPTER XXXI--That it is not necessary for Creatures to have existed
   from Eternity [244]

   IF either the entire universe or any single creature necessarily
   exists, this necessity must arise either from the being itself or from
   some other being. From the being itself it cannot arise: for every
   being must be from the first being; and what has not being of itself,
   cannot necessarily exist of itself. But if this supposed necessity
   arises from another being, that is, from some extrinsic cause, then, we
   observe, an extrinsic cause is either efficient or final. Now an effect
   necessarily arising from an efficient cause means that the agent acts
   of necessity: when the agent does not act of necessity, neither is it
   absolutely necessary for the effect to arise. But God does not act
   under any necessity in the production of creatures (Chap. [183]XXIII).
   So far therefore as the efficient cause is concerned, there is not any
   absolute necessity for any creature to be. Neither is there any such
   necessity in connexion with the final cause. For means to an end
   receive necessity from their end only in so far as without them the end
   either cannot be at all, or cannot well be. Now the end proposed to the
   divine will in the production of things can be no other than God's own
   goodness, as has been shown (B. I, Chap. [184]LXXV): which goodness
   depends on creatures neither for its being nor for its well-being (B.
   I, Chapp. [185]XIII, [186]XXVIII). There is then no absolute necessity
   for the being of any creature: nor is it necessary to suppose creation
   always to have existed. [245]

   3. It is not necessary for God to will creation to be at all (B. I,
   Chap. [187]LXXXI): therefore it is not necessary for God to will
   creation always to have been. [246]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [244] St Thomas's position in these eight chapters, XXXI-XXXVIII, is
   that the existence of creatures from eternity can neither be proved nor
   disproved by philosophy. He considers it certain from revelation, and
   from revelation only, that creation has not been from eternity. This
   excited the surprise and indignation of some, who were confident that
   their a priori arguments, which see in Chap. [188]XXXVIII, proved to a
   demonstration the impossibility of any creation from eternity. Against
   them St Thomas directed one of his Opuscula, n. xxiii, De Æternitate
   Mundi, contra Murmurantes. The eternity of creation was a leading
   principle with that master of thought in St Thomas's day, and for many
   succeeding centuries, Averroes the Commentator, of whom we shall have
   much to say presently.

   [245] It is now generally recognised that the stellar universe,
   inconceivably vast as are its dimensions, nevertheless is limited in
   space: whence it may plausibly be argued to be limited in duration
   also, in the sense of not having existed from eternity. Where there is
   no matter, neither is there any place, nor any marked out extension:
   but there is an unfulfilled extensibility, or absolute space, which is
   founded upon the immensity of God. In like manner, when as yet
   creatures were not, there was no time, as there was no motion, nor any
   body to move. There was only a potentiality of time, founded upon the
   eternity of God. Creatures have been from the beginning of time, as
   Plato saw (Timaeus 37, 38), but they cannot be argued to have been from
   eternity, eternally coexistent with God, unless they be argued to be
   necessary to God, in which case they cease to be creatures.

   [246] This argument, which is indeed the whole argument of the chapter,
   does not bar the possibility of a consequent,' or hypothetical,
   necessity, that God wills creatures to be at all, He must will then
   always to have been.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXII, XXXV--Reasons alleged for the Eternity of the World on
   the part of God, with Answers to the same

   ARG. 1. Every agent that is not always in action, suffers some change
   when it comes to act. But God suffers no change, but is ever in act in
   the same way; and from His action created things come to be: therefore
   they always have been.

   Reply (Chap. [189]XXXV). There is no need of God suffering any change
   for fresh effects of His power coming to be. Novelty of effect can only
   indicate change in the agent in so far as it shows novelty of action.
   Any new action in the agent implies some change in the same, at least a
   change from rest to activity. But a fresh effect of God's power does
   not indicate any new action in God, since His action is His essence (B.
   I, Chap. [190]XLV).

   Arg. 2. The action of God is eternal: therefore the things created by
   God have been from eternity.

   Reply. That does not follow. For, as shown above (Chap. [191]XXIII),
   though God acts voluntarily in creation, yet it does not follow that
   there need be any action on His part intermediate between the act of
   His will and the effect of the same, as in us the action of our motor
   activities is so intermediate. With God to understand and will is to
   produce; and the effect produced follows upon the understanding and
   will according to the determination of the understanding and the
   command of the will. But as by the understanding there is determined
   the production of the thing, and its every other condition, so there is
   also prescribed for it the time at which it is to be; just as any art
   determines not only that a thing be of this or that character, but also
   that it be at this or that time, as the physician fixes the time for
   giving the medicine. Thus, assuming God's will to be of itself
   effectual for the production of an effect, the effect would follow
   fresh from the ancient will, without any fresh action coming to be put
   forth on the part of God.

   Arg. 3. Given a sufficient cause, the effect will ensue: otherwise it
   would be possible, when the cause was posited, for the effect either to
   be or not to be. At that rate, the sequence of effect upon cause would
   be possible and no more. But what is possible requires something to
   reduce it to act: we should have therefore to suppose a cause whereby
   the effect was reduced to act, and thus the first cause would not be
   sufficient. But God is the sufficient cause of the production of
   creatures: otherwise He must be in potentiality, and become a cause by
   some addition, which is clearly absurd.

   Reply. Though God is the sufficient cause of the production and
   bringing forth of creatures into being, yet the effect of His
   production need not be taken to be eternal. For, given a sufficient
   cause, there follows its effect, but not an effect alien from the
   cause. Now the proper effect of the will is that that should be which
   the will wants. If it were anything else than what the will wanted, not
   the proper effect of the cause would be secured, but a foreign effect.
   Now as the will wishes that this should be of this or that nature, so
   it also wishes that it should be at this or that time. Hence, for will
   to be a sufficient cause, it is requisite that the effect should be
   when the will wishes it to be. The case is otherwise with physical
   agencies: they cannot wait: physical action takes place according as
   nature is ready for it: there the effect must follow at once upon the
   complete being of the cause. [247] But the will does not act according
   to the mode of its being, but according to the mode of its purpose; and
   therefore, as the effect of a physical agent follows the being of the
   agent, if it is sufficient, so the effect of a voluntary agent follows
   the mode of purpose.

   Arg. 4. A voluntary agent does not delay the execution of his purpose
   except in expectation of some future condition not yet realised. And
   this unfulfilled futurity is sometimes in the agent himself, as when
   maturity of active power or the removal of some hindrance is the
   condition expected: sometimes it is without the agent, as when there is
   expected the presence of some one before whom the action is to take
   place, or the arrival of some opportune time that is not yet come. A
   complete volition is at once carried into effect by the executive
   power, except for some defect in that power. Thus at the command of the
   will a limb is at once moved, unless there be some break-down in the
   motor apparatus. Therefore, when any one wishes to do a thing and it is
   not at once done, that must be either for some defect of power, the
   removal of which has to be waited for, or because of the incompleteness
   of the volition to do the thing. I call it completeness of volition,'
   when there is a will absolutely to do the thing, anyhow. The volition I
   say is incomplete,' when there is no will absolutely to do the thing,
   but the will is conditioned on the existence of some circumstance not
   yet present, or the withdrawal of some present impediment. But
   certainly, whatever God now wills to be, He has from eternity willed to
   be. No new motion of the will can come upon Him: no defect or
   impediment can have clogged His power: there can have been nothing
   outside Himself for Him to wait for in the production of the universe,
   since there is nothing else uncreated save Him alone (Chapp. [192]VI,
   [193]XV). [248] It seems therefore necessary that God must have brought
   the creature into being from all eternity.

   Reply. The object of the divine will is not the mere being of the
   creature, but its being at a certain time. What is thus willed, namely,
   the being of the creature at that time, is not delayed: because the
   creature began to exist then exactly when God from eternity arranged
   that it should begin to exist. [249]

   Arg. 5. An intellectual agent does not prefer one alternative to
   another except for some superiority of the one over the other. But
   where there is no difference, there can be no superiority. But between
   one non-existence and another non-existence there can be no difference,
   nor is one non-existence preferable to another. [250] But, looking
   beyond the entire universe, we find nothing but the eternity of God.
   Now in nothing there can be assigned no difference of instants, that a
   thing should be done in one instant rather than in another. In like
   manner neither in eternity, which is all uniform and simple (B. I,
   Chap. [194]XV), can there be any difference of instants. It follows
   that the will of God holds itself in one unvarying attitude to the
   production of creatures throughout the whole of eternity. Either
   therefore His will is that creation never be realised at all under His
   eternity, or that it always be realised.

   Reply. It is impossible to mark any difference of parts of any duration
   antecedent to the beginning of all creation, as the fifth objection
   supposed that we could do. [251] For nothingness has neither measure
   nor duration, and the eternity of God has no parts, no before and no
   after. We cannot therefore refer the beginning of all creation to any
   severally marked points in any pre-existing measure. [252] There are no
   such points for the beginning of creation to be referred to according
   to any relation of agreement or divergence. Hence it is impossible to
   demand any reason in the mind of the agent why he should have brought
   the creature into being in this particular marked instant of duration
   rather than in that other instant preceding or following. God brought
   into being creation and time simultaneously. [253] There is no account
   to be taken therefore why He produced the creature now, and not before,
   but only why the creature has not always been. There is an analogy in
   the case of place: for particular bodies are produced in a particular
   time and also in a particular place; and, because they have about them
   a time and a place within which they are contained, there must be a
   reason assignable why they are produced in this place and this time
   rather than in any other: but in regard of the whole stellar universe
   (coelum), beyond which there is no place, and along with which the
   universal place of all things is produced, no account is to be taken
   why it is situated here and not there. In like manner in the production
   of the whole creation, beyond which there is no time, and
   simultaneously with which time is produced, no question is to be raised
   why it is now and not before, but only why it has not always been, or
   why it has come to be after not being, or why it had any beginning.

   Arg. 6. Means to the end have their necessity from the end, especially
   in voluntary actions. [254] So long then as the end is uniform, the
   means to the end must be uniform or uniformly produced, unless they
   come to stand in some new relation to the end. Now the end of creatures
   proceeding from the divine will is the divine goodness, which alone can
   be the end in view of the divine will. Since then the divine goodness
   is uniform for all eternity, alike in itself and in comparison with the
   divine will, it seems that creatures must be uniformly brought into
   being by the divine will for all eternity. It cannot be said that any
   new relation to the end supervenes upon them, so long as the position
   is clung to that they had no being at all before a certain fixed time,
   at which they are supposed to have begun to be.

   Reply. Though the end of the divine will can be none other than the
   divine goodness, still the divine will has not to work to bring this
   goodness into being, in the way that the artist works to set up the
   product of his art, since the divine goodness is eternal and
   unchangeable and incapable of addition. Nor does God work for His
   goodness as for an end to be won for Himself, as a king works to win a
   city: for God is His own goodness. He works for this end, only inasmuch
   as He produces an effect which is to share in the end. In such a
   production of things for an end, the uniform attitude of end to agent
   is not to be considered reason enough for an everlasting work. Rather
   we should consider the bearing of the end on the effect produced to
   serve it. The one evinced necessity is that of the production of the
   effect in the manner better calculated to serve the end for which it is
   produced. [255]

   Arg. 7. Since all things, so far as they have being, share in the
   goodness of God; the longer they exist, the more they share of that
   goodness: hence also the perpetual being of the species is said to be
   divine. [256] But the divine goodness is infinite. Therefore it is
   proper to it to communicate itself infinitely, and not for a fixed time
   only.

   Reply. It was proper for the creature, in such likeness as became it,
   to represent the divine goodness. Such representation cannot be by way
   of equality: it can only be in such way as the higher and greater is
   represented by the lower and less. Now the excess of the divine
   goodness above the creature is best expressed by this, that creatures
   have not always been in existence: for thereby it appears that all
   other beings but God Himself have God for the author of their being;
   and that His power is not tied to producing effects of one particular
   character, as physical nature produces physical effects, but that He is
   a voluntary and intelligent agent.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [247] The eruption takes place the instant the volcano is ready for it.

   [248] The objection may take this form: God must act at once in the
   production of the universe; because, with blank nothingness before Him,
   and infinite power at His control, He has nothing whatever to wait for,
   no conceivable motive for delay. -- But neither has He any constraining
   motive for action outside Himself; and therefore, if He acts outside
   Himself, He acts as and when He pleases: there is nothing to force His
   hand or anticipate His hour.

   [249] St Thomas could scarcely accept the whole account, given by the
   opponent, of an incomplete volition,' notably the statement that a
   volition is incomplete, "when there is expected the arrival of some
   opportune time that is not yet come": otherwise, antecedently to
   creation, God's volition of creating would be incomplete. St Thomas's
   use of at that time' (tunc), speaking of creation, has this difficulty,
   that time began only with creation. There is nothing to mark creation
   starting at one point of time rather than at another, looking at the
   eternal now of God. We can only measure the date of creation backwards,
   and say that infinite time has not elapsed since creation; and that
   doubtless is what St Thomas meant, as his next answer shows.

   [250] This is not altogether true. One non-existence may have a
   possibility at the back of it, another an absurdity. Possibilities
   differ from one another and even absurdities things being absurd in
   divers ways, as mathematics show. There is a calculus of negative
   quantities. This however does not make against the value of the
   objection.

   [251] There seems to be some mistake here. Any careful reader of the
   Contra Gentiles will find in (e.g., Chapp. LXI, 1: LXXVI, note)
   indications of the want of the author's final revision, a task much
   more difficult with a manuscript than with a printed work. Every modern
   author finds sundry small corrections necessary as he is going through
   the press. The fact that the objection is based upon the self-same
   principle which St Thomas invokes in his reply to it, namely that
   neither in nothingness nor in the eternity of God can there be assigned
   any difference of instants. From this admitted principle the opponent
   argues that God must have created from all eternity. St Thomas in reply
   allows that eternity affords us no means of fixing the date of
   creation: still, he contends, we have a measure of the date in the time
   that has elapsed since, which, even though we do not know it, is a
   knowable finite quantity.

   [252] Even so, going outside the whole universe, we cannot localise the
   universe as occupying any special place in space, as St Thomas
   presently remarks. Suppose the universe, as a whole, to be in
   rectilinear motion, there is nothing to measure the motion by.

   [253] Matter (in motion), time, and place all began together. Place
   (topos) to the schoolmen and Aristotle is the shell of space (chora)
   marking the outline of a body. If the body were suddenly annihilated,
   all but the indefinitely thin film of its outer surfaces, that film
   would mark the place which the body had occupied. In motion, bodies do
   not carry their place with them, but go from place to place. This
   conception of place is to be borne in mind in reading the words that
   follow immediately in St Thomas.

   [254] That is to say, it is necessary to take the means, if the end is
   to be gained: otherwise there is no necessity. You must eat, if you are
   to live; but there is no absolute necessity of your doing either.

   [255] The end to which creation is subservient as a means, is not the
   divine goodness absolutely, but the communication or diffusion of that
   goodness. This communication again is not exhaustive, but limited; and
   one of the limitations is the finitude of creation in point of time.

   [256] Etymologically, species (in-spicere) is what eidos (idein) is in
   Greek. Species is scholastic Latin for eidos. Now eidos meant one thing
   in Plato, and another in Aristotle. Species labours under a similar
   ambiguity. In the objection now under consideration, the words of which
   are esse perpetuum speciei dicitur divinum esse, the language is rather
   Platonic than Aristotelian. Individual men, John, Peter, Martin, pass
   away: but the species, or idea, of man' is perpetual and divine, an
   abiding type of possible creation, founded upon the divine essence and
   known in the divine understanding eternally. These archetypical ideas,
   -- intelligibilia St Thomas calls them, -- have been discussed already
   (B.I, Chapp. [195]LI-[196]LIV). The following account of them will
   commend itself to all Christian lovers of Plato. "God contains in
   Himself in exuberant fulness that delights or can give pleasure. All
   the perfection that is divided among creatures, is found united in Him;
   and He is all things, He is the uncreated being of all things, inasmuch
   as He is the archetype and exemplar of them all. He had in His eternal
   knowledge the divine plans and ideas of the things that He made; and
   whatever was created by Him was for ever known by Him, has always lived
   in His mind, and always shall live there. Hence the Gospel says: What
   was made, in Him was life (John i, 3, 4, as read by many of the
   Fathers). Hence we too from eternity have had an ideal existence in
   God: in Him I say, we have been and are uncreated, in whom, or in whose
   knowledge, all things eternally live and are life. In the essence of
   God therefore there are exemplars of all things; and the same divine
   essence is the one exemplar and the one idea of all. For all the
   multiplicity of creatures is reduced to unity in the sheer, simple, and
   superessential essence of God; and all things in God are one. There are
   therefore in God most true and perfect exemplars of things, which
   remain incorrupt for ever: whereas the things that we see in this
   sensible world are mere symbols and signs of reality, that pass away
   with time and perish" (Blosius, i.e. Louis of Blois, O.S.B., Institutio
   Spiritualis, Opera Omnia, Cologne, 1571, p. 423).

   CHAPTERS XXXIII, XXXVI--Reasons alleged for the Eternity of the World
   on the part Creatures, with answers to the same

   ARG. 1. There are creatures in which there is no potentiality of not
   being (see Chap. [197]XXX): it is impossible for them not to be, and
   therefore they always must be.

   Reply (Chap. [198]XXXVI). The necessity of such creatures being is only
   a relative necessity, as shown above (Chap. [199]XXX): it does not
   involve the creature's always having been: it does not follow upon its
   substance: but when the creature is already established in being, this
   necessity involves the impossibility of its not-being. [257]

   Arg. 3. Every change must either go on everlastingly, or have some
   other change preceding it. But change always has been: therefore also
   changeable things: therefore creatures.

   Reply. It has already been shown (Chapp. [200]XII, [201]XVII) that
   without any change in God, the agent, He may act to the production of a
   new thing, that has not always been. But if a new thing may be produced
   by Him, He may also originate a process of change. [258]

   Arg. 5. If time is perpetual, motion must be perpetual, time being the
   record of motion.' [259] But time must be perpetual: for time is
   inconceivable without a present instant, as a line is inconceivable
   without a point: now a present instant is always inconceivable without
   the ending of a past and the beginning of a future instant; and thus
   every given present instant has before it a time preceding and after it
   a time succeeding, and so there can be no first or last time. It
   follows that created substances in motion have been from eternity.

   Reply. This argument rather supposes than proves the eternity of
   motion. The reason why the same instant is the beginning of the future
   and the end of the past is because any given phase of motion is the
   beginning and end of different phases. There is no showing that every
   instant must be of this character, unless it be assumed that every
   given phase of time comes between motion going before and motion
   following after, which is tantamount to assuming the perpetuity of
   motion. Assuming on the contrary that motion is not perpetual, one may
   say that the first instant of time is the beginning of the future, and
   not the end of any past instant. Even in any particular case of motion
   we may mark a phase which is the beginning only of movement and not the
   end of any: otherwise every particular case of motion would be
   perpetual, which is impossible. [260]

   Arg. 6. If time has not always been, we may mark a non-existence of
   time prior to its being. In like manner, if it is not always to be, we
   may mark a non-existence of it subsequent to its being. But priority
   and subsequence in point of duration cannot be unless time is; and at
   that rate time must have been before it was, and shall be after it has
   ceased, which is absurd. Time then must be eternal. But time is an
   accident, and cannot be without a subject. But the subject of it is not
   God, who is above time and beyond motion (B. I, Chapp. [202]XIII,
   [203]XV). The only alternative left is that some created substance must
   be eternal.

   Reply. There is nothing in this argument to evince that the very
   supposition of time not being supposes that time is (read, Si ponitur
   tempus non esse, ponatur esse). For when we speak of something prior to
   the being of time, we do not thereby assert any real part of time, but
   only an imaginary part. When we say, Time has being after not being',
   we mean that there was no instant of time before this present marked
   instant: as when we say that there is nothing above the stellar
   universe, we do not mean that there is any place beyond the stellar
   universe, which may be spoken of as above' it, but that above it there
   is no place' at all. [261]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [257] An impossibility in the physical order, inasmuch as there is no
   agent in nature capable of breaking that substance up.

   [258] If God can create a nebula, He may also set it spinning, with no
   more change in Himself on the one account than on the other.

   [259] arithmos kineseos, Aristotle, Physics, iv, 11.

   [260] Even the motion of the whole universe may be regarded as one
   stupendous particular case of motion. Left to physical causes alone,
   the universe must run down like a clock, all positions of advantage
   being lost, all potential energy being converted into kinetic, one
   uniform temperature and one dead equilibrium of forces coming to obtain
   everywhere. This is an argument that motion and time must have had a
   beginning. Had the universe been at work from eternity, its capacity of
   work would have been exhausted ere now.

   [261] See Chap. XXXII, notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXIV, XXXVII--Reasons alleged for the Eternity of the World on
   the part of the Creative Process itself, with Answers to the same

   ARG. 1. It is the common opinion of all philosophers, and therefore it
   must be true, that nothing is made of nothing (Aristotle, Physics, B.
   I, Chapp. [204]VII, [205]VIII). Whatever is made, then, must be made of
   something; and that again, if it is made at all, must be made of
   something else. But this process cannot go on to infinity; and
   therefore we must come to something that was not made. But every being
   that has not always been must have been made. Therefore that out of
   which all things are first made must be something everlasting. That
   cannot be God, because He cannot be the material of anything. Therefore
   there must be something eternal outside God, namely, primordial matter.
   [262]

   Reply (Chap. [206]XXXVII). The common position of philosophers, that
   nothing is made of nothing, is true of the sort of making that they
   considered. For all our knowledge begins in sense, which is of singular
   objects; and human investigation has advanced from particular to
   general considerations. Hence, in studying the beginning of things, men
   gave their attention to the making of particular things in detail. The
   making of one sort of being out of another sort is the making of some
   particular being, inasmuch as it is this being,' not as it is being'
   generally: for some prior being there was that now is changed into this
   being.' But entering more deeply into the origin of things,
   philosophers came finally to consider the issuing of all created being
   from one first cause (Chapp. [207]XV, [208]XVI). In this origin of all
   created being from God, it is impossible to allow any making out of
   pre-existent material: for such making out of pre-existent material
   would not be a making of the whole being of the creature. This first
   making of the universe was not attained to in the thought of the early
   physicists, whose common opinion it was that nothing was made of
   nothing: or if any did attain to it, they considered that such a term
   as making' did not properly apply to it, since the name making' implies
   movement or change, [263] whereas in this origin of all being from one
   first being there can be no question of the transmutation of one being
   into another (Chap. [209]XVII). Therefore it is not the concern of
   physical science to study this first origin of all things: that study
   belongs to the metaphysician, who deals with being in general and
   realities apart from motion. [264] We may however by a figure of speech
   apply the name of making' to creation, and speak of things as made,'
   whatsoever they are, the essence or nature whereof has its origin from
   other being.

   Arg. 2. Everything that takes a new being is now otherwise than as it
   was before: that must come about by some movement or change: but all
   movement or change is in some subject: therefore before anything is
   made there must be some subject of motion.

   Reply. The notion of motion or change is foisted in here to no purpose:
   for what nowise is, is not anywise, and affords no hold for the
   conclusion that, when it begins to be, it is otherwise than as it was
   before.

   These then are the reasons which some hold to as demonstrative, and
   necessarily evincing that creatures have always existed, wherein they
   contradict the Catholic faith, which teaches that nothing but God has
   always existed, and that all else has had a beginning of being except
   the one eternal God. Thus then it evidently appears that there is
   nothing to traverse our assertion, that the world has not always
   existed. And this the Catholic faith teaches: In the beginning God
   created heaven and earth (Gen. i, 1): and, Before he made anything,
   from the beginning (Prov. viii, 22).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [262] Materia prima, see note, p. 86.

   [263] The position supposed is this: Nothing is made, manufactured, or
   concocted out of nothing: but something may be created out of nothing.'
   I am not aware however of any of the ancients having any idea of
   creation out of nothing. There is no word in classical Greek for
   creation' in the theological sense.

   [264] A professor of physical science, as such, does not arrive at the
   Creator. Motions, molar and molecular, -- vibrations and transferences
   chemical, biological, mechanical or cosmic -- are his subject-matter;
   but the Creator and the creative act are above motion. Atheist or
   theist, agnostic or Christian, a man may be equally proficient in
   physical science, as also he may be in cookery, engine-driving, or
   soap-boiling. Is this, the range of physical science is narrower and
   lower than that of literature. There is religious literature and divine
   poetry. When a physicist pronounces on a religious question, either for
   or against religion, he is sutor supra crepidam: he has overshot his
   subject. Of course he ought to overshoot his subject. A man should no
   more be a physicist and nothing else than he should be a
   tallow-chandler and nothing else. The misery is, when, not having been
   conversant with God in his laboratory, observatory, or dissecting.
   room, the physicist poses upon this non-experience to turn
   antitheologian. One might as well pose upon the limitations of the
   tallow vat. God is not evident in the melting of tallow, nor in the
   scientific infliction and curing of wounds. This
   liparo-physico-antitheological humour, as Aristophanes might have
   called it, is an exudation of the narrowest bigotry. Wherever physical
   science becomes the staple of education, to the setting aside of Latin
   and Greek, it will be found necessary in the interests of religion to
   insist upon a parallel course of metaphysics, psychology, and ethics. A
   popular course is all that will be possible or necessary. Otherwise,
   trained on physical science without literature or philosophy, the mind
   suffers atrophy of the religious faculties, a disease which some seem
   anxious to induce upon mankind, -- a painful disease nevertheless,
   productive of much restlessness and irritability, as the life of Thomas
   Huxley shows. To repeat St Thomas's words here: -- "It is not the
   concern of physical science to study the first origin of all things:
   that study belongs to the metaphysician who deals with being in general
   and realities apart from motion." All the more important is it for the
   physicist to imbibe some tincture of metaphysics, that he may not
   "wallow in a slough of barbarism' (Plato, Rep. vii, 533d). This note is
   suggested by Sir Oliver Lodge's article, Faith and Science, in the
   Hibbert Journal for October, 1902, a masterly exposition of the present
   conflict between the two, except for one mistake. Sir Oliver confounds
   the mysterious with the miraculous. The daily bread of the Christian is
   mystery, not miracle. Miracle is obvious to the senses; mystery lies
   beyond sense.

   CHAPTER XXXVIII--Arguments wherewith some try to show that the World is
   not Eternal, and Solutions of the same

   ARG. 1. God is the cause of all things (Chap. [210]XV). But a cause
   must be prior in duration to the effects of its action.

   Reply. That is true of things that act by motion, for the effect is not
   till the termination of the motion: but with causes that act
   instantaneously there is no such necessity.

   Arg. 2. Since the whole of being is created by God, it cannot be said
   to be made out of any being: whence the conclusion follows that it is
   made out of nothing, and consequently that it has existence after not
   existing.

   Reply. To the notion of being made out of something, if that is not
   admitted one must supply the contradictory notion: which contradictory
   notion is not being made out of anything. Observe, it is not being made
   out of nothing, except in the former sense of not being made out of
   anything. [265]

   Arg. 3. It is not possible to pass through infinity. But if the world
   always had been, infinity would have been passed through by this time,
   there being infinite days, or daily rounds of the sun, if the world
   always has been.

   Reply. An infinite quantity, though not existing in simultaneous actual
   realisation, may nevertheless be in succession, because every infinite,
   so taken, is really finite. Any given round of the sun could be passed,
   because so far the number of them was finite: but when they are all
   viewed together, on the supposition that the world had always existed,
   it would be impossible to fix upon any first day, and so to make any
   transition from that to the present day, since transition always
   requires two extreme points.

   Arg 4. It would follow that addition is made to the infinite, because
   to past days, or sun-rounds, a new round is daily added.

   Reply. There is nothing to hinder addition to the infinite on that side
   on which it is finite. Supposing time eternal, it must be infinite as
   preceding, but finite as succeeding, for the present is the limit of
   the past.

   Arg. 5. It would follow in a world always existing that we should have
   an infinite series of efficient causes, father being cause of child,
   and grandfather to father, and so to infinity.

   Reply. The impossibility of an infinite series of efficient causes,
   according to philosophers (Aristotle, Metaph. ii, 2), holds for causes
   acting together: because then the effect has to depend on an infinity
   of co-existent actions; and the infinity of causes there is essential,
   the whole infinite multitude of them being requisite for the production
   of the effect. But in the case of causes not acting together no such
   impossibility holds, in the opinion of those who suppose an endless
   series of generations. The infinity in this case is accidental to the
   causes: for to Socrates's father, as such, it is quite an accident
   whether he be the son of another man or no: whereas to a stick,
   inasmuch as it moves a stone, it is not an accident whether it be moved
   by an hand: for it only moves inasmuch as it is moved.

   Arg. 6. It would follow that an infinite multitude exists, to wit, the
   immortal souls of infinite men who have been in the past.

   Reply. This objection is more difficult: nevertheless the argument is
   not of much use, because it supposes many things. [266]

   Since these reasons, alleged by some to prove that the world has not
   always existed, are not necessarily conclusive, though they have a
   certain probability, it is sufficient to touch on them slightly,
   without insisting too much, that the Catholic faith may not seem to
   rest on empty reasonings, and not rather on the solid basis of the
   teaching of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [265] ou genomenon ex oudenos (not made out of anything) is not
   equivalent to genomenon ek tou medenos (made out of nothing). The
   former notion would be applicable to a Creature created from eternity,
   if there were such: the latter would not. The former denies
   pre-existent material, the latter affirms a previous condition of
   nothingness. The former implies creation, the latter implies the lapse
   of a finite period since creation.

   [266] Among the rest, that the earth has been eternally habitable to
   man, which no geologist would admit See Chap. LXXX, Arg. 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLI--That the Variety of Creatures does not arise from any
   Contrariety of Prime Agents [267]

   IF the diversity of things proceeds from diversity or contrariety of
   diverse agents, this would seem to hold especially of the contrariety
   of good and evil, so that all good things should proceed from a good
   principle, and evils from an evil principle. Now there is good and evil
   in all genera. But there cannot be one first principle of all evils:
   for the very essence of such a principle would be evil, and that is
   impossible. Everything that is, inasmuch as it is a being, must
   necessarily be good: for it loves and strives to preserve its own
   being, a sign whereof is this fact, that everything fights against its
   own destruction: now what all things seek is good. It is impossible
   therefore for the diversity of things to arise from two principles, one
   good and one evil. [268]

   9. What in no manner of way is, is neither good nor evil: while every
   thing that is, in so far as it is, is good. A thing can be evil
   therefore only inasmuch as it is not-being, that is, privative being;
   [269] and the evil is precisely the privation. Now privation never
   comes of the ordinary action of any cause: because every cause acts
   inasmuch as it is endowed with form'; and thus the ordinary effect of
   its action must also be endowed with form,' since every agent acts to
   the production of its own likeness, unless it be accidentally hindered.
   It follows that evil does not come of the ordinary action of any cause,
   but is accidentally incident among the effects of ordinary causation.
   [270] There is therefore no one primary and essential principle of all
   evil: but the first principle of all is one primary good, among the
   effects of which there ensues evil incidentally.

   Hence it is said: I am the Lord, and there is none other, forming light
   and creating darkness, making peace and creating evil: I am the Lord
   doing all these things (Isa. xlv, 6, 7). And, Good things and evil
   things, life and death, poverty and rank are from God (Ecclus xi, 14).
   And, Against evil is good, and against life death; so against the just
   man is the sinner. And so behold all the works of the Most High, two
   and two, and one against one (Ecclus xxxiii, 15).

   God is said to make and create evil things, inasmuch as He creates
   things that are good in themselves and yet hurtful to others: thus the
   wolf, though a good thing naturally in his kind, is evil to the sheep.
   Hence it is said: Shall there be evil in the city that the Lord hath
   not done? (Amos iii, 6.)

   Hereby is excluded the error of those who suppose two primitive
   contrary principles, good and evil. This error of the early
   philosophers some evil-minded men have presumed to introduce into
   Christian teaching, the first of whom was Marcion, and afterwards the
   Manicheans, who have done most to spread this error.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [267] St Thomas has seven chapters ([211]XXXIX-[212]XLV) discussing the
   variety of creatures, why the universe is not uniform but diversified,
   and how it has come to consist of such diverse components. As regards
   living creatures, the discussion is familiar to us from Darwin's Origin
   of Species and the theory of Evolution. St Thomas ventures on a larger
   question, the origin of all species, inanimate as well as animate. He
   states and rejects various archaic theories; but the point of supreme
   interest to the modern mind is never raised. In all the seven chapters
   there is not one word pointing to evolution. I have been driven to make
   large omissions, omissions which I feel sure the Saint would have
   sanctioned, had he been face to face with the cosmogonies of our day.
   Life is short art is long: the ground of philosophy must not be
   cumbered with obsolete machinery. It is pleaded on St Thomas's behalf
   that the question before him is a metaphysical one, independent
   altogether of the manner in which actual species have come into
   existence.

   [268] Done into syllogistic form, the argument might stand thus:

   What all things seek, even a principle of evil would seek.

   But all things seek their own self-preservation.

   Therefore even a principle of evil would seek its own
   self-preservation.
   Again,

   What all things seek, is good.

   But self-preservation is what all things seek.

   Therefore self-preservation is good.

   But a principle of evil would seek its own self-preservation.

   Therefore a principle of evil would seek some good.

   But a principle of evil ought to be averse to all good.

   Therefore a principle of evil is absurd.
   One wonders whether this is the argument that St Thomas thought of at
   the table of St Louis, when he suddenly started up and cried, Ergo
   conclusum est contra Manichaeos. But it is difficult to kill a heresy
   with a syllogism. One might perhaps distinguish between absolute and
   relative good; and upon that distinction urge that the
   self-preservation, which the evil principle sought, was good relatively
   to it only, but evil absolutely for the world. The deepest flaw in the
   Manichean notion of an Evil Principle is that which is pointed out in
   the next argument ([213]n. 9). Moreover every argument which
   establishes the unity and infinite perfection of God, is destructive of
   Manicheism. (Cf. Isaias xlv, 6, 7, quoted below.) Matter is not evil,
   as Plato supposed, but its essential capacities for good are greatly
   limited; and, where good stops short, evil readily enters in. God does
   not override essentialities.

   [269] Ens privativum. A privation as distinguished from a mere
   negation, is the lack of a perfection due to the nature, as the lack of
   sense in this or that man, not the lack of wings. Privation is in the
   individual only, never in the species. Hence all evil is in the
   individual: the specific nature is entirely good.

   [270] The usual example is that of a man limping: he walks by his
   ordinary locomotive power, but limps inasmuch as he accidentally
   happens to be lame. The race does not limp.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLIV--That the Variety of Creatures has not arisen from Variety
   of Merits and Demerits

   ORIGEN in his book peri archon says that God out of mere bounty in His
   first production of creatures made them all equal, all spiritual and
   rational, and they by free will behaved in various ways, some adhering
   to God more or less, and others receding from Him more or less; and
   thus by order of divine justice various grades ensued among spiritual
   substances, some appearing as angels of various orders, some as human
   souls also of various states and conditions, some again as demons in
   various states. He also said that it was through this variety of
   rational creatures that God instituted a variety also of material
   creatures, so that the nobler spiritual substances should be united to
   the nobler bodies, and that in divers other ways the material creation
   might serve to express the variety of spiritual substances. According
   to Origen, man, sun, and stars are composed of rational substances
   united with corresponding bodies. Now all this opinion can be shown to
   be manifestly false.

   1. The better a thing is, the higher place does it hold in the
   intention of the agent who produces it. But the best thing in creation
   is the perfection of the universe, which consists in the orderly
   variety of things: [271] for in all things the perfection of the whole
   is preferable to the perfection of parts and details. Therefore the
   diversity of creatures does not arise from diversity of merits, but was
   primarily intended by the prime agent.

   2. If all rational creatures were created equal from the beginning, we
   should have to allow that they do not depend for their activity one on
   another. What arises by the concurrence of divers causes working
   independently of one another is matter of chance; and thus the
   diversity and order of creation comes by chance, which is impossible.
   [272]

   12. Since a spiritual creature, or angel, does not deserve to be
   degraded except for sin, -- and it is degraded from its high, invisible
   estate, by being united with a visible body, -- it seems that visible
   bodies have been added to these spiritual creatures because of sin;
   which comes near to the error of the Manicheans, who laid it down that
   the visible creation proceeded from an evil principle.

   Origen seems not to have given sufficient weight to the consideration
   that, when we give, not in discharge of any debt, but out of
   liberality, it is not contrary to justice if we give in unequal
   measure: but God brought things into being under no debt, but of sheer
   liberality (Chap. [214]XXVIII): therefore the variety of creatures does
   not presuppose variety of merits.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [271] A salient thought and favourite principle with St Thomas. It
   comes out remarkably in his speculations on grace. The final end for
   which God made mankind, according to St Thomas and his school, is not
   the salvation of this and that individual soul, taken as isolated
   units: it is a social construction, an organic whole, in which each
   soul and every man has his proper place divinely allotted, -- not of
   course irrespective of the efforts of his will to secure it, -- and
   places vary in quality and honour. But of them all no place is a bad
   place as God designed it. If any man's career ends in final woe, he
   must, by some wilfulness of his own, have traversed and defeated God's
   special and particular purpose on his behalf. The axiom, De minimis non
   curat praetor, does not hold of God's dealings with His creatures (B.
   III, Chap. LXXVI), least of all with His rational creatures (B. III,
   Chap. CXIII). The humblest place that God's special providence has
   prepared for any spirit or human soul created by Him, is a good place,
   good with a twofold goodness, good for the order and beauty of the
   universe, and good in view of the particular end of that individual,
   which is happiness. Only in consequence of a man's own sin (B. III,
   Chap. CLXIII) undoing the special providence that made for his peace
   (Luke xix, 42), does the man fall under another order of providence,
   which still secures the general good, but no longer his gain.

   [272] Impossible, because the world is an organic whole, one part
   subservient to another. Such an organic body, such a cosmos, could
   never be the result of unconcerted actions, and situations assigned in
   reward commensurate with such actions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLV--The Real Prime Cause of the Variety of Creatures.

   SINCE every agent intends to induce its own likeness in the effect, so
   far as the effect can receive it, an agent will do this more perfectly
   the more perfect itself is. But God is the most perfect of agents:
   therefore it will belong to Him to induce His likeness in creation most
   perfectly, so far as befits created nature. [273] But creatures cannot
   attain to any perfect likeness of God so long as they are confined to
   one species of creature; because, since the cause exceeds the effect,
   what is in the cause simply and as one thing is found in the effect in
   a composite and manifold way, unless the effect be of the same species
   as the cause; which is impossible in the case before us, for no
   creature can be equal to God. Multiplicity therefore and variety was
   needful in creation, to the end that the perfect likeness of God might
   be found in creatures according to their measure.

   2. As the things that are made of any material are contained in the
   potentiality of the material, so the things done by any agent must be
   in the active power of the agent. But the potentiality of the material
   would not be perfectly reduced to actuality, if out of the material
   were made only one of those things to which the material is in
   potentiality. [274] Therefore if any agent whose power extends to
   various effects were to produce only one of those effects, his power
   would not be so completely reduced to actuality as by making many. But
   by the reduction of active power to actuality the effect attains to the
   likeness of the agent. Therefore the likeness of God would not be
   perfect in the universe, if there was only one grade of all beings.
   [275]

   3. A creature approaches more perfectly to the likeness of God by being
   not only good itself, but able to act for the good of others. But no
   creature could do anything for the good of another creature, unless
   there were plurality and inequality among creatures, because the agent
   must be other than the patient and in a position of advantage
   (honorabilius) over it. [276]

   5. The goodness of the species transcends the goodness of the
   individual. [277] Therefore the multiplication of species is a greater
   addition to the good of the universe than the multiplication of
   individuals of one species.

   7. To a work contrived by sovereign goodness there ought not to be
   lacking the height of perfection proper to it. But the good of order in
   variety is better than the isolated good of any one of the things that
   enter into the order: therefore the good of order ought not to be
   wanting to the work of God; which good could not be, if there were no
   diversity and inequality of creatures. There is then diversity and
   inequality between creatures, not by chance, not from diversity of
   elements, not by the intervention of any (inferior) cause, or
   consideration of merit, but by the special intention of God, wishing to
   give the creature such perfection as it was capable of having.

   Hence it is said, God saw all things that he had made, and they were
   very good (Gen. i, 31); and this after He had said of them singly, that
   they were good; because while things are good singly in their several
   natures, all taken together they are very good, because of the order of
   the universe, which is the final and noblest perfection of creation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [273] And this He does much less in the kingdom of nature than in the
   kingdom of grace, to which the former kingdom is subservient.

   [274] e.g., if out of clay were made only drain-pipes.

   [275] e.g., a society, all dukes. The fact is, differentiation is at
   the root of existence.

   [276] St Thomas may be here said to anticipate the great physical and
   social discovery, that if things or persons were all on a dead level,
   there would be no energy available and no work done.

   [277] The species of course has actual existence only in the
   individuals that represent it. The meaning then of the saying is, that
   it is better to realise good of a higher order than to multiply good of
   the same order again and again, to develop a head rather than ever so
   many toes. At the same time the head cannot be without the toes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLVI--That it was necessary for the Perfection of the Universe
   that there should be some Intellectual Natures

   THIS then being the cause of the diversity among creatures, it remains
   now to treat of the several distinct creatures themselves as we
   proposed to do in the third part of this book (Chap. [215]V). And we
   will show first that by the disposition of Divine Providence assigning
   perfection to creatures in the way best befitting them, it was
   consonant with reason that some intellectual creatures should be placed
   at the head of creation.

   5. Nothing else moves God to the production of creatures but His own
   goodness, which He has wished to communicate to other beings according
   to the manner of their assimilation to Himself (B. I, Chap.
   [216]LXXXVII). Now the likeness of one thing may be found in another in
   two ways: in one way in point of natural being, as the likeness of heat
   is found in the body heated; in another way in point of knowledge, as
   the likeness of fire (perceived) is in sight or touch. In order then
   that the likeness of God might be in creatures in such modes as were
   possible, it was necessary that the divine goodness should be
   communicated to creatures, not only by likeness in being, but also by
   likeness in knowing. But mind alone can know the divine goodness.
   Therefore there needed to be intelligent creatures.

   6. In all comely arrangements of things, the attitude of the secondary
   to the last imitates the attitude of the first to all, as well
   secondary as last, though the imitation is not always perfect. Now God
   comprehends in Himself all creatures (B. I, Chapp. [217]XXV, [218]LI,
   [219]LIV); and this is represented in material creatures, although in
   another way: for the higher body comprehends and contains the lower,
   according to quantitative extension; [278] whereas God contains all
   creatures in simple mode, and not by quantitative extension. In order
   then that an imitation of God might not be wanting to creatures even in
   this mode of containing, there were made intellectual creatures to
   contain material creatures, not by any extension of quantity, but
   simply by mode of intelligence: for what is understood is in the mind
   that understands it, and is comprehended in its intellectual activity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [278] So in the Ptolemaic system of concentric spheres making the
   heavens, the sphere of the moon would "comprehend and contain" the
   earth. Perhaps we might substitute some consideration like the
   following: that the orbit of the primary planet carries with it and in
   a manner contains the orbit of the satellite: earth and earth-way carry
   and involve moon and moon-way; while the sun carries all the planets,
   and all their ways' or orbits.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLVII--That Subsistent Intelligences are Voluntary Agents

   GOOD is what all things yearn after, and in all beings there is a
   craving (appetitus) for good. In beings unendowed with any sort of
   cognition, this craving is called physical appetite' (appetitus
   naturalis). [279] In beings that have sensitive cognition it is called
   animal appetite,' and is divided into concupiscible' and irascible.'
   [280] In intelligent beings it is called the intellectual' or rational
   appetite,' otherwise the will.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [279] Such are the tendencies to maintain themselves observable in
   chemical compounds, and in organic bodies, as such, apart from
   conscious action.

   [280] See Sum. Theol. I 2, q. 23, art. I (Aquinas Ethicus, I, 85).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLVIII--That Subsistent Intelligences have Free Will

   THEY must be free, if they have dominion over their own acts.

   2. A free agent is an agent that is cause of its own action (sui causa,
   sibi causa agendi). Agents that are determined (moventur) and act only
   inasmuch as they are determined by others, are not causes of their own
   acts. Only self-determining agents (moventia seipsa) have liberty of
   action; and these alone are guided in their action by judgement. A
   self-determining agent is made up of two elements, one determining and
   another determined. The element determined is the appetite; and that is
   determined either by intellect, or by phantasy, or by sense: for to
   these powers it belongs to judge. Of such self-determining agents,
   those alone judge freely which determine their own judgement. But no
   faculty of judging determines its own judgement unless it reflects upon
   its own act. If then it is to determine itself to judge, it must know
   its own judgement; and that knowledge belongs to intellect alone.
   Irrational animals then have a sort of free determination, or action,
   but not a free judgement (sunt quodammodo liberi quidem motus, sive
   actionis, non autem liberi judicii): [281] while inanimate things,
   being dependent for their every determination on things other than
   themselves, have not so much as free action, or determination. On the
   contrary, intelligent beings have not only free action, but also free
   judgement, which is having free will. [282]

   3. An apprehension becomes a motive according as the thing apprehended
   takes the form of something good or suitable. In agents that determine
   their own movements, [283] the outward action goes upon some judgement
   pronouncing a thing good or suitable according as it is apprehended. If
   the agent pronouncing the judgement is to determine himself to judge,
   [284] he must be guided to that judgement by some higher form or idea
   in his apprehension. [285] This idea can be no other than the universal
   idea (ipsa ratio) of goodness or fitness, by aid whereof a judgement is
   formed of any given definite good, fit, or suitable thing. Therefore
   those agents alone determine themselves to judge, which have this
   general concept of goodness or fitness, -- that is to say, only
   intelligent agents. Therefore intelligent agents alone determine
   themselves, not only to act, but also to judge. They therefore alone
   are free in judging, which is having free will. [286]

   4. No movement or action follows from a general concept except by the
   medium of some particular apprehension, as all movement and action
   deals with particulars. Now the understanding naturally apprehends the
   universal. In order then that movement or any manner of action may
   follow upon the intellectual apprehension, the universal concept of the
   understanding must be applied to particular objects. But the universal
   contains in potentiality many particular objects. Therefore the
   application of the intellectual concept may be made to many divers
   objects; and consequently the judgement of the understanding about
   things to be done is not determined to one thing only. [287]

   5. Some agents are without liberty of judgement, either because they
   have no judgement at all, as is the case with things that have no
   knowledge, as stones and plants, or because they have a judgement
   naturally determined to one effect, as irrational animals. For by
   natural reckoning [288] the sheep judges that the wolf is hurtful to
   it, and on this judgement flies from the wolf. But whatever agents have
   their judgement of things to be done not determined by nature to one
   effect, they must have free will. Such are all intelligent agents; for
   the understanding apprehends, not only this or that good, but good
   itself in general. Hence, since it is through the idea in apprehension
   that the understanding moves the will; and in all things the motive, or
   moving power, and the object moved must be proportioned to one another;
   it follows that the will of an intelligent subsistent being is not
   determined by nature except to good in general. Whatever therefore is
   presented to the will under the specific notion of good (sub ratione
   boni), the will may incline to it, without let or hindrance from any
   natural determination to the contrary. Therefore all intelligent agents
   have free will, arising out of the judgement of the understanding; and
   free will is defined a free judgement on the matter of a specific
   notion, or general concept.' [289]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [281] We should call it a spontaneous movement, analogous to what is
   called the motus primo-primus of the will in man, antecedent to
   reflection and free judgement.' The movements of dumb animals left to
   themselves are prompted by a sort of self; but not by a self-conscious,
   free-judging, or free self.

   [282] Hence the doctrine of the Thomist school, that the will is
   determined by the last practical judgement made before action is taken.
   It seems to place freedom in the intellect rather than in the will. It
   is bound up with a further doctrine, that command (imperium) is a
   function of understanding, not of will. These are grave questions,
   which I had rather not handle. Enough for me to have translated this
   important passage fully and literally, and to have called attention to
   its significance.

   [283] That is to say, in all (higher) animals (above, n. 2).

   [284] All (higher) animals determine their own movements, and judge
   that certain things are good for them: man alone determines his own
   judgement to this effect (n. 2).

   [285] Some higher form,' that is, by some intellectual presentation,
   something above the presentation in sense, or phantasy, or vis
   cogitativa, which is all that other animals have. For vis cogitativa
   see Chap. LX. Being intellectual, this higher form' will be a universal
   idea, not particular.

   [286] Action is self-determined in all animals: judgement on the
   propriety of action is self-determined in man alone among animals. That
   self-determination of judgement means free will. Free will is due to
   the power of forming universal ideas, or general concepts, of the
   suitable and the good (or to what Plato might have called the vision of
   the idea of the good -- Rep. VI, 505: cf. Phaedrus, 248, 249). Such is
   the momentous teaching of St Thomas in this chapter.

   [287] I may have habitually in my mind the universal judgement,
   Nuisances are to be abated.' From that, no action can arise. Annoyed by
   a noise in the street, I formulate a further judgement, more definite,
   but still universal: The nuisance of bawling newsboys is to be abated.'
   No action is yet possible. But when I say to myself: The nuisance of
   this bawling newsboy is to be abated, trouble and expense
   notwithstanding'; then and then only, upon this particular practical
   judgement, action becomes possible and will ensue. The argument shows
   that universal pronouncements of the understanding do not necessitate
   any particular action. It seems to me to show no more than that.

   [288] Naturali existimatione, the same as vis cogitativa.

   [289] Liberum de ratione judicium. Ratio, as often in St Thomas, is
   ratio formalis, or logos, the specific notion rather than the object of
   the specific notion, which is also the object of definition. So
   immediately above, sub ratione boni. I need hardly add that every
   specific notion is also a general concept. Not until intellect has
   universalised the object of choice and viewed it as a generality, is
   the will free.

   CHAPTER XLIX--That Subsistent Intelligence is not Corporeal

   IF the understanding were a corporeal substance, intelligible ideas of
   things would be received in it only as representing individual things.
   At that rate, the understanding would have no conception of the
   universal, but only of the particular, which is manifestly false.

   4. If the understanding were a corporeal substance, its action would
   not transcend the order of corporeal things, and therefore it would
   understand nothing but corporeal things, which is manifestly false, for
   we do understand many things that are not corporeal.

   5. There can be no infinite power in any finite body: but the power of
   the understanding is in a manner infinite in the exercise of
   intelligence: for it knows the universal, which is virtually infinite
   in its logical extension.

   7 and 8. [290] Of no bodily substance is the action turned back upon
   the agent. But the understanding in its action does reflect and turn
   round upon itself: for as it understands an object, so also it
   understands that it does understand, and so endlessly.

   Hence Holy Scripture calls intelligent subsistent beings by the name of
   spirits,' using of them the style which it is wont to use for the
   incorporeal Deity, according to the text, God is a Spirit (John iv,
   24).

   Hereby is excluded the error of the ancient natural philosophers, who
   admitted no substance but corporeal substance: which opinion some have
   endeavoured to foist into the Christian faith, saying that the soul is
   an effigy of the body, a sort of outline contour of the human body.

   CHAPTER LII--That in Created Subsistent Intelligences there is a
   Difference between Existence and Essence

   THOUGH subsistent intelligences are not corporeal, nor compounded of
   matter and form, nor existent as material [292] forms in matter, still
   it must not be thought that they come up to the simplicity of the being
   of God: for there is found in them a certain composition, inasmuch as
   existence (esse) and essence (quod est) is not in them the same. [293]

   4. Whatsoever reality subsists of and by itself, nothing attaches to
   that reality except what is proper to being as being. For what is said
   of any reality not as such, does not belong to that reality otherwise
   than accidentally by reason of the subject: [294] hence, considered
   apart from the subject in a particular case, the attribute does not
   belong to that reality at all. Now to be caused by another' does not
   belong to being, as being: otherwise every being would be caused by
   another, which is impossible (B. I, Chap. [220]XIII) Therefore that
   existence which is being of itself and by itself, must be uncaused. No
   caused being therefore is its own existence.

   5. The substance of every reality is a being of itself and not through
   another. Hence actual illumination is not of the substance of air,
   because it accrues to it through another. But to every created reality
   existence accrues through another, otherwise it would not be a
   creature. Therefore of no created substance is it true to say that its
   existence is its substance. [295]

   Hence in Exodus iii, 14, existence is assigned as the proper name of
   God, He who is: because it is proper to God alone that His substance is
   none other than His existence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [292] Read materiales from Chap. LI.

   [293] In whatever reality essence and existence are identical, that
   reality is its own existence: in other words, it exists of itself,
   which self-existence is proper to God alone. That is the whole argument
   of this chapter. All scholastic writers agree in admitting some sort of
   distinction between essence and existence in creatures: but as to the
   nature of that distinction as it obtains in existing creatures, and the
   name by which the distinction should he expressed, there has been
   fierce contention between the later Thomists and other schools. Non
   nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites.

   [294] A barber may be black, but not as a barber. His blackness has
   nothing to do with his trade. Black barber' is an accidental
   predication, inasmuch as blackness and hair-cutting happen in this case
   both to be attributes of the same subject.

   [295] The conclusion might be expressed thus: In every created reality,
   or actuality, the actualisation, or realisation, is something distinct
   and separable from the thing actualised, or realised. This is not
   saying that the actualisation might be taken away, and the thing still
   remain. The distinction between essence and existence is not physical.
   But created essence has not such a hold on existence as to be incapable
   of losing it. This loose hold upon existence is taken by the Thomist
   school to involve a real distinction between essence and existence in
   creatures.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIII--That in Created Subsistent Intelligences there is
   Actuality and Potentiality

   IN whatever being there are found two elements, the one complementary
   to the other, the proportion of the one element to the other is as the
   proportion of potential to actual: for nothing is completed except by
   its own actuality. But in a created intelligent subsistent being there
   are two elements, the substance itself and the existence thereof which
   is not the same thing as the substance. Now that existence is the
   complement of the existing substance: for everything actually exists by
   having existence. It follows that in every one of the aforesaid
   substances there is a composition of actuality and potentiality.

   2. What is in any being, and comes of the agent that produced it, must
   be the actuality of that being: for it is an agent's function to make a
   thing be in actuality. But, as shown above (Chap. [221]XV), all other
   substances have their existence of the prime agent: indeed their being
   created substances consists precisely in this, that they have their
   existence of another. Existence itself therefore is in these created
   substances as a sort of actualisation of the same. But that in which
   actuality is received is potentiality: for actuality is such in
   relation to potentiality. In every created subsistent being therefore
   there is potentiality and actuality.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LV--That Subsistent Intelligences are Imperishable

   WHAT ordinarily and of itself attaches to a thing, inheres in it
   necessarily and invariably and inseparably, as roundness ordinarily and
   of itself inheres in a circle, but in a bit of brass metal only
   incidentally. [296] It is possible for a bit of brass metal to be other
   than round: it is impossible for a circle to be other than round. Now
   existence ordinarily follows upon the form: for we call that ordinary,'
   which the thing is inasmuch as it is itself; and everything has
   existence inasmuch as it has form. Substances therefore that are not
   pure forms may be deprived of existence inasmuch as they lose their
   form, as brass is deprived of roundness inasmuch as it ceases to be
   circular. But substances that are pure forms are never deprived of
   existence: thus if the ideal circle had substantial existence, that
   substance could never be made other than round. But subsistent
   intelligences are pure subsistent forms: therefore it is impossible for
   them ever to cease to exist. [297]

   8. Everything that perishes, perishes by suffering something.
   Destruction is a sort of suffering. But no subsistent intelligence can
   suffer any impression such as to lead to its destruction. For to suffer
   is to receive something; and whatever is received in a subsistent
   intelligence must be received according to the manner of the same: that
   is to say, it must be received as an intelligible impression. But
   whatever is so received in a subsistent intelligence, goes to perfect
   that intelligence, not to destroy it: for the intelligible is the
   perfection of the intelligent. A subsistent intelligence therefore is
   indestructible. [298]

   10. The intelligible is the proper perfection of the intellect: hence
   the understanding in the act of understanding, and its term, or object
   in the act of being understood, are one. [299] What therefore belongs
   to the object as intelligible, must belong also to the mind as
   cognisant of that object; because perfection and perfectible are of the
   same genus. [300] Now the intelligible object, as such, is necessary
   and imperishable: for things necessary, or things that must be, are
   perfectly cognisable to the understanding; while things contingent,
   that are but might not be, as such, are cognisable only imperfectly:
   they are not matter of science, but of opinion. [301] Hence the
   understanding attains to science of perishable things, only in so far
   as they are imperishable, -- that is to say, in so far as they become
   to the mind universals. Intellect therefore, as such, must be
   indestructible. [302]

   13. It is impossible for a natural desire to be void of object, for
   nature does nothing in vain. But every intelligence naturally desires
   perpetuity of being, not only perpetuity of being in the species, but
   in the individual: which is thus shown. The natural desire which some
   creatures have arises from conscious apprehension: thus the wolf
   naturally desires the killing of the animals on which he feeds, and man
   naturally desires happiness. Other creatures, without any conscious
   apprehension, are led by the inclination of primitive physical
   tendencies, which is called in some physical appetite.' The natural
   desire of being is contained under both modes: the proof of which is
   that creatures devoid of any sort of cognitive faculty resist
   destructive agencies to the full strength of their natural
   constitution, while creatures possessed of any manner of cognitive
   faculty resist the same according to the mode of their cognition. Those
   creatures therefore, devoid of cognition, who have in their natural
   constitution strength enough to preserve perpetual being, so as to
   remain always the same numerically, have a natural appetite for
   perpetuity of being even in respect of sameness of number: while those
   whose natural constitution has not strength for this, but only for
   preservation of perpetuity of being in respect of sameness of species,
   also have a natural appetite for perpetuity. This difference then must
   be noted in those creatures whose desire of being is attended with
   cognition, that they who do not know being except in the present time,
   desire it for the present time, but not for ever, because they have no
   apprehension of everlasting existence: still they desire the perpetual
   being of their species, a desire unattended with cognition, because the
   generative power, which serves that end, is preliminary to and does not
   come under cognition. Those then that do know and apprehend perpetual
   being as such, desire the same with a natural desire. But this is the
   case with all subsistent intelligences. All such subsistent
   intelligences therefore have a natural desire of everlasting being.
   Therefore they cannot possibly cease to be.

   13. All things that begin to be, and afterwards cease to be, have both
   their beginning and their ceasing from the same power: for the same is
   the power to make to be and to make not to be. But subsistent
   intelligences could not begin to be except through the power of the
   prime agent. Therefore neither is there any power to make them cease to
   be except in the prime agent, inasmuch as that agent may cease to pour
   being into them. But in respect of this power alone nothing can be
   called perishable; as well because things are called necessary or
   contingent in respect of the power that is in them, not in respect of
   the power of God (Chap. [222]XXX), as also because God, the author of
   nature, does not withdraw from things that which is proper to their
   nature; and it has been shown that it is proper to intellectual natures
   to be perpetual.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [296] For this use of ordinarily' and incidentally' as a rendering of
   per se and per accidens, see my Aquinas Ethicus, I, 404. It answers to
   principal' and accessory' in English law.

   [297] The meaning of this impossibility has been explained in Chap.
   XXX, and appears again in the last argument of this chapter. For the
   doctrine that "subsistent intelligences [angels] are pure subsistent
   forms" see B. I, Chap. XLIV, n. 7, with note. The Platonic idea,'
   existing apart from things, was personified by the Neoplatonists, and
   became a daimon (spirit). But in becoming a spirit it still remained a
   self-subsistent idea,' or form,' to the Neoplatonist. The schoolmen
   held the doctrine of angels as part of the Christian revelation. But
   being much influenced by Neoplatonism through Arabian and other
   channels, they came to say of angels some things that the Neoplatonists
   had said of daimones. The angel then ipsa forma subsistens, it was
   substantia separata, it was a pure substantial form subsisting by
   itself. It stood in sharp contrast with Aristotelian forms' that were
   in matter, the most noteworthy of which was the human soul, the form of
   the body.'

   [298] Yes, if the being be nothing else but intelligence, which St
   Thomas supposes throughout, calling it a pure form' (ipsa forma).

   [299] Cf. I, Chap. XLIV, n. 4. This Aristotelian utterance means that
   the understanding forms within itself an idea expressive of the object:
   in that idea the mind expressing and the object expressed meet.

   [300] There must be some element of virtue in a mind that has any
   appreciation of virtue.

   [301] Thus Plato taught, and Aristotle cordially agreed with him. See
   the seventh book Of the Republic, and the Posterior Analytics. Plato,
   Aristotle and the schoolmen based their notions of science upon the
   exact sciences of arithmetic, geometry, and formal logic, these being
   the first sciences developed. With us, the name of science has been
   well-nigh monopolised by the study of physical nature. Physical objects
   certainly belong to the class of things contingent: they are, but might
   not be. This is true: but the physicist does not consider his science
   perfect till he has attained to the knowledge of the laws of physical
   necessity which govern the operations of those contingent things.
   Observation and experiment are preliminary steps to science. And
   physical necessities belong to the region of the eternal. A substance,
   such as chlorine, must act in this or that way under those conditions,
   if ever at any time it is to be at all. This is an eternal truth. This
   is exactly St Thomas's teaching, when he says: "The understanding
   attains to science of perishable things, only in so far as they are
   imperishable, -- that is to say, in so far as they become to the mind
   universals." Cf. I, Chap. LXVII, with notes.

   [302] The argument is, that the vehicle of the imperishable, -- that
   out of which the imperishable could not exist, -- must itself be
   imperishable. Universals are imperishable: but these universals cannot
   be anywhere in creation except in created minds: therefore created
   minds, as minds, are apt not to perish.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVI, LXIX--How a Subsistent Intelligence may be united with a
   Body, with a Solution of the Arguments alleged to prove that a
   Subsistent Intelligence cannot be united with a Body as its Form

   A SUBSISTENT intelligence cannot be united with a body by any manner of
   combination: for combined elements, when the combination is complete,
   do not remain actually, but virtually only: for if they remained
   actually, it would not be a combination, but a mere mechanical mixture.
   [303] But this combination and consequent cessation of actual existence
   cannot befall subsistent intelligences; for they are imperishable.

   It is likewise evident that a subsistent intelligence cannot be united
   with a body by any manner of contact, properly so called. For contact
   is only of bodies: those things are in contact, the extremities of
   which are together, [304] as points, or lines, or circumferences, which
   are the extremities of bodies.

   Still there is one mode of contact whereby a subsistent intelligence
   may be mingled with a body. For natural bodies in touching one another
   involve a change, and thus are united together, not only in their
   quantitative extremities, but also by likeness of one same quality or
   form, the one in pressing its form on the other. And though, if we
   regard only quantitative extremities, the contact must be mutual in all
   cases, yet, if we consider action and passion, there will be found some
   cases of touching without being touched, and some cases of being
   touched without touching. Any cases that may be found of contact
   without contact in quantitative extremities must still be ca]led
   instances of contact, inasmuch as they are instances of action: thus we
   say that he who saddens another touches' him. [305] According to this
   mode of touch it is possible for a subsistent intelligence to be united
   to a body by contact: for subsistent intelligences act upon bodies and
   move them, being more highly actualised than bodies are. [306]

   This contact is not quantitative but virtual, and differs from bodily
   contact in three respects. First, because in this contact the
   indivisible can touch the divisible, which cannot happen in bodily
   contact: for only that which is indivisible can be touched by a point,
   [307] whereas a subsistent intelligence, indivisible though it be, can
   touch a divisible quantity by acting upon it. The point and the
   subsistent intelligence are not indivisible in the same way. The point
   is indivisible as a term of quantity, and has a definite situation in a
   continuous surface, beyond which it cannot be thrown: [308] whereas a
   subsistent intelligence is indivisible by being outside of the category
   of quantity altogether: hence no indivisible element of quantity is
   marked out for contact with it. Secondly, because quantitative contact
   is only with extremities, but virtual contact is with the whole subject
   touched: for the subject is touched inasmuch as it is acted upon and
   moved; but that is inasmuch as it is in potentiality; and potentiality
   extends to the whole, not merely to the extremities of the whole: hence
   the whole is touched. From this appears a third difference: because in
   quantitative touch, which is of extremities, the touching body must be
   outside of the touched, and cannot pervade it, but is stopped by it;
   [309] whereas the virtual contact, which is proper to subsistent
   intelligences, reaching to the inmost recesses of things, makes the
   touching substance be within the touched and pervade it without let or
   hindrance. Thus then a subsistent intelligence may be united with a
   body by virtual contact. [310]

   Elements united by such contact are not absolutely one: they are one in
   action and in being acted upon, which does not involve absolute oneness
   of being. Such absolute oneness may be in three ways: in the way of
   indivisibility, in the way of continuity, and in the way of natural
   unity. Now out of a subsistent intelligence and a body there cannot be
   made an indivisible unity: it must be a compound of two things. Nor
   again a continuous unity, because the parts of a continuum are
   quantitative. It remains to be enquired whether out of a subsistent
   intelligence and a body there can result such a unity as means oneness
   of nature. [311] But out of two permanent elements there results no
   being one by nature except that which results of the union of
   substantial form with matter: for out of substance and accident there
   results no being one by nature, for the nature or essence of man' and
   whiteness' is not the same. [312] This question then remains to be
   studied, whether a subsistent intelligence can be the substantial form
   of any body. Looking at the matter argumentatively, it might seem that
   the thing is impossible.

   Arg. 1. Of two actually existent substances no one being can be made:
   for the actuality of every being is that whereby it is distinguished
   from another being. But a subsistent intelligence is an actually
   existing substance: so likewise is a body. Apparently therefore no one
   being can be made of a subsistent intelligence and a body.

   Arg. 2. Form and matter are contained under the same genus: for every
   genus is divided into actual and potential. But a subsistent
   intelligence and a body are of different genera.

   Arg. 3. All that is in matter must be material. But if subsistent
   intelligence is the form of a body, the being of such intelligence must
   be in matter: for there is no being of the form beyond the being of the
   matter. It follows that a subsistent intelligence could not be
   immaterial, as supposed.

   Arg. 4. It is impossible for anything having its being in a body to be
   apart from the body. But intelligence is shown to be apart from the
   body, as it is neither the body itself nor a bodily faculty. [313]

   Arg. 5. Whatever has being in common with the body, must also have
   activity in common with the body: for the active power of a thing
   cannot be more exalted than its essence. But if a subsistent
   intelligence is the form of a body, one being must be common to it and
   the body: for out of form and matter there results absolute unity,
   which is unity in being. At that rate the activity of a subsistent
   intelligence, united as a form to the body, will be exerted in common
   with the body, and its faculty will be a bodily (or organic) faculty:
   positions which we regard as impossible.

   (Chap. [223]LXIX). It is not difficult to solve the objections alleged
   against the aforesaid union.

   Reply 1. The first objection contains a false supposition: for body and
   soul are not two actually existing substances, but out of the two of
   them is made one substance actually existing: for a man's body is not
   the same in actuality when the soul is present as when it is absent: it
   is the soul that gives actual being. [314]

   Reply 2. As for the second objection, that form and matter are
   contained under the same genus, it is not true in the sense that both
   are species of one genus, but inasmuch as both are elements of the same
   species. Thus then a subsistent intelligence and a body, which as
   separate existences would be species of different genera, in their
   union belong to one genus as elements of the same.

   Reply 3. Nor need a subsistent intelligence be a material form,
   notwithstanding that its existence is in matter: for though in matter,
   it is not immersed in matter, or wholly comprised in matter.

   Reply 4. Nor yet does the union of a subsistent intelligence with a
   body by its being that body's form stand in the way of intelligence
   being separable from body. [315] In a soul we have to observe as well
   its essence as also its power. In point of essence it gives being to
   such and such a body, while in point of power it executes its own
   proper acts. In any activity of the soul therefore which is completed
   by a bodily organ, the power of the soul which is the principle of that
   activity must bring to act that part of the body whereby its activity
   is completed, as sight brings the eye to act. But in any activity of
   the soul that we may suppose not to be completed by any bodily organ,
   the corresponding power will not bring anything in the body to act; and
   this is the sense in which the intellect is said to be separate,' --
   not but that the substance of the soul, whereof intellect is a power,
   or the intellectual soul, brings the body to act, inasmuch as it is the
   form which gives being to such body.

   Reply 5. Nor is it necessary, as was argued in the fifth place, that if
   the soul in its substance is the form of the body, its every operation
   should be through the body, and thus its every faculty should be the
   actuation of some part of the body: for the human soul is not one of
   those forms which are entirely immersed in matter, but of all forms it
   is the most exalted above matter: hence it is capable of a certain
   activity without the body, being not dependent on the body in its
   action, as neither in its being is it dependent on the body.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [303] The old distinction (I think it is now being challenged) between
   a chemical combination' and a meehanical mixture' answers fairly well
   to that drawn here by St Thomas between mixtio (mixis) and confusio
   (krasis). Oxygen was supposed to become something other than actual
   oxygen, when it combined with hydrogen to form water. The spiritual
   soul is not lost in man in the way that oxygen is lost, or was supposed
   to be lost, in water.

   [304] Together' means indefinitely near' absolute contact would be
   coincidence.

   [305] Read contristans tangit. The sun's action of gravitation upon the
   earth, attracting it, would have furnished St Thomas with a better
   example, had he known of it, except that it is mutual, the earth
   likewise attracting the sun. St Thomas will not allow that the body
   acts upon the soul.

   [306] Is the reference to organic action or to volitional control? Or
   if to both, is the action of the soul upon the body the same in both
   cases?

   [307] That is to say, point can only touch point. Hence we speak of the
   point of contact,' which is one, not two.

   [308] The argument supposes the continuity of matter, that is to say,
   that the ultimate elements of matter are extended solids without
   interstices of vacuum. The dynamist theory on the other hand supposes
   that points, centres of attractive or repulsive force, are indissolubly
   bound up in primitive molecules, which molecules are extended, but not
   solidly continuous, there being vacuum between point and point of the
   multitudinous points which make up the molecule. In this theory, action
   takes place from each point, or centre of force, upon all points within
   the sphere of activity, accordingly to the law of the inverse square of
   the distance from the point, or centre of activity, attractive or
   repulsive. Thus every point is in immediate virtual contact with
   endless other points, but not in physical contact with any. Dynamism
   may be tenable or untenable: either way it is well worth the
   psychologist's while to consider what physical theory any argument of
   his presupposes, and what it excludes; and conversely, what physical
   theory, if established, would necessitate a modification of his
   argument.

   [309] St Thomas confines this speculation to solids. The diffusion of
   gases and the blending of liquids he would have called, not contactus,
   but perhaps confusio; and that he took to be no real union at all. As
   for the other alternative, mixtio, he has already shown that the union
   of spirit with matter is not that.

   [310] But so are sun and earth united by the virtual contact of
   gravitation. This virtual contact of mover and moved does not go far to
   explain the union of soul and body. St Thomas happily passes to a
   further explanation, identifying the union with that of form' and
   matter,' that is, of active and determinant with passive and
   determinable principle. Against which it may be urged that the body has
   a determinate existence of its own, and powers all its own, mechanical
   chemical, and many would say, vital also, if we consider the life of
   cells. This may be admitted or denied, -- it was a theme of endless
   contention in St Thomas' day, and the strife is not over yet, -- but at
   least it is to be observed that these various powers are not
   co-ordinated to the purpose of one human life except by the presence of
   the soul. Thus the body is the determinable, the soul the determining
   element, by virtue of which the whole compound becomes one human
   nature, one man. In this general popular sense, without implication of
   the details of the Thomist system of matter and form, the General
   Council of Vienna (A.D. 1312) defined "the rational or intellectual
   soul to be of itself and essentially the form of the human body."

   [311] Ratione unum. Ratio here is not opposed to res: it means first
   the definition of a thing, and then that which is specially denoted by
   definition, the essence or nature. This meaning of ratio is not
   uncommon in the Contra Gentiles. The word may often be rendered
   essential notion,' meaning the object of such notion. See note on p.
   111.

   [312] Man is not essentially white, but he is essentially body and soul

   [313] The reference is to Aristotle, De anima, III, iv; "Nor is it
   reasonable to suppose it (intelligence) to be blended with the body";
   of which separateness of intelligence from body much will be said
   presently.

   [314] This doctrine is maintained by Father Bödder, Psychologia
   Rationalis, pp. 356-362, ed. 2, who mentions other Catholics as
   opposing it. Their grounds may be something as follows: -- The doctrine
   was formulated in an age when cell-life, protoplasm, blood corpuscles,
   microbes, were undreamt of. If there is any value in the well-worn
   analogy between the constitution of man and that of a State, the State,
   it may be observed, contains many minor associations, which it does not
   absorb or transform into things political, but is content merely to
   co-ordinate, guard, and set bounds to. We now recognise both molar and
   molecular mechanics: is there not also such a thing as molecular life,
   with principles or forms' of its own, besides the molar life of the
   mass of the body as such? Otherwise how could there ever be such a
   thing as a fever or a morbid growth in the body? Are not these abnormal
   developments exaggerations, we might almost say rebellions,' of
   secondary lives with which in its ordinary state the body is replete,
   -- secondary lives which in health work in harmony with the main life,
   of which the soul is the principle?

   [315] nous choristos, the much debated Aristotelian phrase, De anima,
   III, iv, v. This reply should be carefully borne in mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVII--Plato's Theory of the Union of the Intellectual Soul with
   the Body [316]

   MOVED by these and the like objections, some have said that no
   subsistent intelligence can possibly be the form of a body. But because
   the nature of man of itself seemed to give the lie to this statement,
   inasmuch as man is seen to be composed of an intellectual soul and a
   body, they have thought out various ways to save the nature of man and
   adjust their theory to fact. Plato therefore and his followers laid it
   down that the intellectual soul is not united with the body as form
   with matter, but only as the mover is with the moved, saying that the
   soul is in the body as a sailor in his boat: [317] thus the union of
   soul and body would be virtual contact only, of which above (Chap.
   [224]LVI). But as such contact does not produce absolute oneness, this
   statement leads to the awkward consequence that man is not absolutely
   one, nor absolutely a being at all, but is a being only accidentally.
   [318] To escape this conclusion, Plato laid it down that man is not a
   compound of soul and body, but that the soul using the body is man.
   [319] This position is shown to be impossible: for things different in
   being cannot have one and the same activity. I call an activity one and
   the same, not in respect to the effect to which the activity is
   terminated, but as it comes forth from the agent. It is true that many
   men towing a boat make one action in respect of the thing done, which
   is one; but still on the part of the men towing there are many actions,
   as there are many different strains and exertions to haul the boat
   along: for as action is consequent upon form and power, it follows that
   where there are different forms and powers there must also be different
   actions. Now though the soul has a certain proper motion of its own,
   which it performs independently of the body, namely, the act of
   understanding, there are however other activities common to soul and
   body, namely, those of fear, anger, sensation, and the like; for these
   only come about by some change wrought in some definite part of the
   body; hence evidently they are conjoint activities of soul and body.
   Therefore out of soul and body there must result one being, and the two
   cannot be distinct in being.

   But this reasoning may be met by the following reply on behalf of
   Plato's view. -- There is no difficulty, it will be said, in mover and
   moved having the same act, notwithstanding their difference in being:
   for motion is at once the act of the moving force, from which it is,
   and the act of the thing moved, in which it is. Thus then, on Plato's
   theory, the aforesaid activities may be common to soul and body,
   belonging to the soul as the moving force, and to the body as the thing
   moved. But this explanation cannot hold for the following reasons.

   1. As the Philosopher proves (De Anima, II), sensation results by the
   sentient subject being moved or impressed by external sensible things:
   hence a man cannot have a sensation without some external sensible
   thing, [320] as nothing can be moved without a mover. The sensory organ
   therefore is moved and impressed in sensation, but that is by the
   external sensible object. What receives the impression is the sense, as
   is evident from this, that senseless things do not receive any such
   manner of impression from sensible objects. The sense therefore is the
   passive power of the sensory organ. The sentient soul therefore in
   sensation does not play the part of mover and agent, but is that
   principle in the subject impressed, in virtue of which the said subject
   lies open to the impression. But such a principle cannot be different
   in being from the subject impressed. Therefore the sentient soul is not
   different in being from the animated body.

   2. Though motion is the common act of moving force and object moved,
   still it is one activity to impart motion and another to receive
   motion: hence the two several categories of action and passion. If then
   in sensation the sentient soul stands for the agent, and the body for
   the patient, there will be one activity of the soul and another of the
   body. The sentient soul therefore will have an activity and proper
   motion of its own: it will have therefore its own subsistence:
   therefore, when the body perishes, it will not cease to be. [321] Thus
   sentient souls, even of irrational animals, will be immortal; which
   seems improbable, although it is not out of keeping with Plato's
   opinion. [322] But this will be matter of enquiry further on (Chap.
   [225]LXXXII).

   3. A body moved does not take its species according to the power that
   moves it. If therefore the soul is only united to the body as mover to
   moved, the body and its parts do not take their species from the soul:
   therefore, when the soul departs, the body and the parts thereof will
   remain of the same species. But this is manifestly false: for flesh and
   bone and hands and such parts, after the departure of the soul, do not
   retain their own names except by a façon de parler; [323] since none of
   these parts retains its proper activity, and activity follows species.
   Therefore the union of soul and body is not that of mover with moved,
   or of a man with his dress.

   6. If the soul is united with the body only as mover with moved, it
   will be in the power of the soul to go out of the body when it wishes,
   and, when it wishes, to reunite itself with the body. [324]

   That the soul is united with the body as the proper form of the same,
   is thus proved. That whereby a thing emerges from potential to actual
   being, is its form and actuality. But by the soul the body emerges from
   potentiality to actuality: for the being of a living thing is its life:
   moreover the seed before animation is only potentially alive, and by
   the soul it is made actually alive: [325] the soul therefore is the
   form of the animated body.

   Again: as part is to part, so is the whole sentient soul to the whole
   body. But sight is the form and actuality of the eye: [326] therefore
   the soul is the form and actuality of the body.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [316] I believe that St Thomas had no knowledge of Plato at first hand,
   not even in a Latin translation. He knew him only through the citations
   of Aristotle, and commentators, mostly Neoplatonists. For the opinion
   here ascribed to Plato, see Plato's Phaedo, pp. 80, 94; Phaedrus, 245,
   246; Laws, 896, 897. It appears not so much explicitly in any one
   passage, as implicitly in the general tenor of Plato's philosophy,
   especially in the strong opposition, and even repugnance, which he
   supposes to obtain between soul and body; in his doctrine of the
   pre-existence of soul before body, also of the transmigration of souls
   (which argues a very loose connection between the soul and the
   particular body which it inhabits): likewise in this general difference
   between Aristotelian and Platonic forms,' that while Aristotle's forms'
   inhere in sensible things, Plato's forms,' or eide, stand apart; so
   that even though Plato had allowed the soul to be the form' of the
   body, which he did not allow, still even so he would have kept this
   form' apart from and independent of the body. Plato in fact detested
   material substance, and would not have spirit bound up with matter.
   Spirit was to rule matter; and when for its punishment it got entangled
   in matter, as in man, and still more in the lower animals, it was to do
   its best to break away, and (in man) to live a life of its own, as much
   apart from the body and bodily senses as possible.

   [317] There is no such saying in the works of Plato: but Aristotle, De
   anima, lib. II, c. i, ad fin., mentions it as "a point not cleared up,
   whether the soul is the form of the body in the same sense as a sailor
   is of his boat," probably referring to a saying which he had heard from
   his master Plato, and did not agree with.

   [318] Just as the combination of sailor and boat is accidental.

   [319] This again I believe is not explicitly in Plato, though it is
   quite to his mind. It ill accords with the definition of the Council of
   Vienne.

   [320] Cannot,' understand, normally and ordinarily.

   [321] The argument holds for the intellectual soul which has an
   activity and proper motion of its own whereas the sentient soul, or the
   soul as sentient, has none. Therefore the soul is immortal, as
   intellectual though not as sentient.

   [322] Plato countenances the transmigration of soul. Republic, x,
   618-620; Timaeus, 42b, c; Phaedrus, 246.

   [323] So Aristotle, De anima, II, i, 8-10: Politica, I p. 1253, a 20.

   [324] So savages suppose the soul actually to wander abroad in dreams.
   The argument is in Aristotle, De anima, I, iii, 8.

   [325] "Seed and fruit is potentially this and that kind of body," De
   anima, II, i, 11. The seed before animation is not dead matter: we are
   probably right in ascribing to it a certain lower form of life (Bödder,
   Psychologia Rationalis, nn. 557, 558, pp. 394, 395). But inasmuch as it
   has not yet the more perfect life of the creature that is born of it,
   St Thomas calls it, in reference to this life which is to follow. "only
   potentially alive."

   [326] "Were the eye an animal, sight would be it's soul," says
   Aristotle, De anima, II, i, 9.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVIII--That Vegetative, Sentient, and Intelligent are not in
   man Three Souls

   PLATO lays it down that not one and the same soul is in us at once
   intelligent, sentient, and vegetative. [327] In this view, granted that
   the sentient soul is the form of the body, it does not follow that any
   subsistent intelligence can be the form of a body. The untenableness of
   this position is thus to be shown.

   1. Attributes of the same subject representing different forms are
   predicated of one another accidentally: thus white' is said to be
   musical' accidentally, inasmuch as whiteness and music happen both to
   be in Socrates. If then the intelligent, sentient, and vegetative soul
   are different powers or forms in us, then the attributes that we have
   according to these forms will be predicated of one another
   accidentally. But according to the intelligent soul we are called men,'
   according to the sentient animals,' according to the vegetative
   living.' This then will be an accidental predication, man is an
   animal,' or an animal is a living creature.' But on the contrary these
   are cases of essential predication: for man, as man, is an animal; and
   an animal, as an animal, is a living creature. Therefore it is from the
   same principle that one is man, animal, and alive. [328]

   2. A thing has unity from the same principle whence it has being, for
   unity is consequent upon being. Since then everything has being from
   its form, it will have unity also from its form. If therefore there are
   posited in man several souls, as so many forms, man will not be one
   being but several. Nor will the order of the forms to one another, one
   ensuing upon the other, suffice for the unity of man: for unity in
   point of orderly succession is not absolute unity: such unity of order
   in fact is the loosest of unities. [329]

   4. If man, as Plato held, is not a compound of soul and body, but is a
   soul using a body; either this is understood of the intelligent soul,
   or of the three souls, if there are three, or of two of them. If of
   three, or two, it follows that man is not one, but two, or three: for
   he is three souls, or at least two. But if this is understood of the
   intelligent soul alone, so that the sentient soul is to be taken for
   the form of the body, and the intelligent soul, using the animate and
   sentient body, is to be man, there will still ensue awkward
   consequences, to wit, that man is not an animal, but uses an animal;
   and that man does not feel, but uses a thing that does feel.

   5. Of two or three there cannot be made one without anything to unite
   them, unless one of them stands to the other as actuality to
   potentiality: for so of matter and form there is made one without any
   external bond to bind them together. But if in man there are several
   souls, they do not stand to one another as matter and form, but they
   are all supposed to be actualities and principles of action. If then
   they are to be united to make one man, or one animal, there must be
   something to unite them. This cannot be the body, since rather the body
   is made one by the soul: the proof of which fact is that, when the soul
   departs, the body breaks up. It must be some more formal principle that
   makes of those several entities one; and this will be rather the soul
   than those several entities which are united by it. If this again has
   several parts, and is not one in itself, there must further be
   something to unite those parts. As we cannot proceed to infinity, we
   must come to something which is in itself one; and this of all things
   is the soul. [330] There must therefore in one man, or one animal, be
   one only soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [327] From his references, St Thomas appears to have been more familiar
   with the Timaeus than with any other of Plato's writings. That poetic,
   mystical and obscure dialogue was a special favourite of the
   Neoplatonists, from whom St Thomas gathered his knowledge of Plato. The
   passage, Timaeus, 69c-70a describing how "the mortal kind of soul,"
   with its two divisions, was allocated in the body by inferior deities,
   after the Supreme Deity had produced the intellect, misled early
   commentators, and after them St Thomas, into the belief that Plato
   supposed three distinct souls in one human body. Plato never speaks of
   souls' except in reference to distinct bodies. He speaks of the soul'
   of man as familiarly as we do. The nous in the head, the thuoos (St
   Thomas's pars irascibilis) in the chest, and the epithumiai (pars
   concupiscibilis) in the belly, are not three souls, but three varieties
   of one soul. Cf. Timaeus, 89e, "three kinds of soul have been put to
   dwell in us in three several places: Tim. 79 d, "what the soul has of
   mortal and of divine in its being": Republic, 439e, "two kinds being in
   the soul": Rep. 441 c, "there are varieties in the soul of each
   individual." In Laws, 863b he doubts whether the thumos is to be called
   "an affection or a part of the soul." In the ultimate analysis of
   Plato's meaning nothing more will appear, I believe, than the triple
   division, accepted by Aristotle and St Thomas, of nous, thumos,
   epithumia, three phases of one soul, the first inorganic and spiritual,
   the two latter organic and involving connexion with the body.

   [328] In a paragraph here omitted occur these words, which are of
   interest in the discussion of evolution. "The order of the sentient to
   the intelligent, and of the vegetative to the sentient, is as the order
   of potentiality to actuality: for the intelligent is posterior in
   generation to the sentient, and the sentient to the vegetative: for
   animal is prior in generation to man." St Thomas is here describing the
   development of the individual, as Chap. LXXXVI shows, not of the race;
   or what is now called ontogenetic' as opposed to phylogenetic'
   development.

   [329] e.g., the unity of a dynasty of kings, or of a line of bishops,
   now called continuity.'

   [330] This argument is from Aristotle, De anima, I, v, nn. 26-28.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIX--That the Potential Intellect of Man is not a Spirit
   subsisting apart from Matter [331]

   THERE were others who used another invention in maintaining the point,
   that a subsistent intelligence cannot be united with a body as its
   form. They say that the intellect which Aristotle calls potential,' is
   a spiritual being, subsisting apart by itself, and not united with us
   as a form. And this they endeavour to prove from the words of
   Aristotle, who says, speaking of this intellect, that it is "separate,
   unmixed with body, simple and impassible," terms which could not be
   applied to it, they say, if it were the form of a body. [332] Also from
   the argument by which Aristotle proves that because the potential
   intellect receives all impressions of sensible things, and is in
   potentiality to them all, it must be devoid of all to begin with, as
   the pupil of the eye, which receives all impressions of colours, is
   devoid of all colour; because if it had of itself any colour, that
   colour would prevent other colours from being seen; nay, nothing would
   be seen except under that colour; and the like would be the case of the
   potential intellect, if it had of itself any form or nature of sensible
   things, as it would have were it the form of any body; because, since
   form and matter make one, the form must participate to some extent in
   the nature of that whereof it is the form. [333]

   These passages moved Averroes [334] to suppose the potential intellect,
   whereby the soul understands, to be separate in being from the body,
   and not to be the form of the body. But because this intellect would
   have no connexion with us, nor should we be able to understand by it
   unless it were somehow united with us, Averroes fixes upon a mode in
   which it is united with us, as he thinks, sufficiently. He says that an
   impression actually made in the understanding is a form' of the
   potential intellect, in the same way that an actually visible
   appearance, as such, is a form' of the visual faculty; hence out of the
   potential intellect, and this form or impression actually made in the
   same, there results one being. With whatever being therefore this form'
   of the understanding is conjoined, the potential intellect is also
   conjoined with that being. But this form is conjoined with us by means
   of the phantasm,' or image in the phantasy, which image is a Sort of
   subject receiving in itself that form' of understanding.

   1. It is easy to see how frivolous and impossible all this construction
   is. For what has understanding is intelligent; and that of which an
   intelligible impression is united with the understanding, is
   understood. The fact that an intelligible impression, united with a
   (foreign) understanding, comes somehow to be in man, will not render
   man intelligent; it will merely make him understood by that separately
   subsisting intelligence.

   2. Besides, the impression actually in understanding is the form of the
   potential intellect, in the same way that the actual visible appearance
   is the form of the visual power, or eye. But the impression actually in
   understanding is to the phantasms as the actual visible appearance is
   to the coloured surface, which is outside the soul. This similitude is
   used by Averroes, as also by Aristotle. Therefore the supposed union of
   the potential intellect (by means of the intelligible form) with the
   phantasm that is in us will resemble the union of the visual power with
   the colour that is in the stone. But this union does not make the stone
   see, but be seen. Therefore the aforesaid union does not make us
   understand, but be understood. But, plainly, it is properly and truly
   said that man understands: for we should not be investigating the
   nature of understanding were it not for the fact that we have
   understanding. The above mode of union then is insufficient.

   5. The intellect in the act of understanding and the object as
   represented in understanding are one, as also the sense in the act of
   sensation and the object as represented in sense. But the understanding
   as apt to understand and its object as open to representation in
   understanding are not one, as neither is sense, so far as it is apt to
   have sensation, one with its object, so far as that is open to be
   represented in sensation. [335] The impression made by the object, so
   far as it lies in images of the phantasy, is not any representation in
   the understanding. Only by undergoing a process of abstraction from
   such images does the impression became one with the intellect in the
   act of understanding. In like manner the impression of colour is
   actually felt in sense, not as it is in the stone, but as it is in the
   eye. Now, on the theory of Averroes, the intelligible form, or
   impression in the understanding, only comes to be conjoined with us by
   finding place in the images of our phantasy. Therefore it is not
   conjoined with us inasmuch as it is one with the potential intellect,
   being its form. Therefore it cannot be the medium whereby the potential
   intellect is conjoined with us: because, in so far as it is conjoined
   with the potential intellect, it is not conjoined with us; and in so
   far as it is conjoined with us, it is not conjoined with the potential
   intellect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [331] These chapters, LIX-[226]LXXVIII, are the most abtruse in the
   whole work. They are founded on the scholastic theory of the origin of
   ideas, which again is based on Aristotle, De anima, III, Chapp. IV, V.
   The theory first presupposes the doctrine of matter and form, of which
   there is a fair]y good account in Grote's Aristotle, vol. II, pp.
   181-196. Grote goes on to expose the Aristotelian doctrine of Nous
   (intellectus), as he understands it. In this exposition two points are
   noteworthy. (1) No account is taken of St Thomas's distinction between
   potential (possibilis) and passive' (passivus) intellect. (2) A view is
   ascribed to Aristotle, closely allied to the views which Averroes and
   Avicenna ascribe to him, views which St Thomas laboriously combats as
   being neither Aristotelian nor correct. If these Mohammedan
   commentators, with Grote and many moderns, are right, Aristotle cannot
   be claimed as a believer in personal immortality. Still the fact that
   Plato steadily held the individual soul to be immortal, joined to the
   fact that Aristotle, who was forward enough in contradicting his
   master, nowhere explicitly contradicts him on this head, -- as also the
   obscurity of the language of the De anima, -- "may give us pause." For
   any understanding of what follows it is necessary to distinguish the
   passive intellect' (intellectus passivus, nous pathetikos), the
   potential intellect' (intellectus possibilis, nous dunatos, or ho
   dunamei nous), and the active intellect' (intellectus agens, nous
   poietikos). 1. Passive intellect' is not intellect at all. It is found
   in the higher dumb animals; and is only called intellect' by a sort of
   brevet rank, because being the highest power of the sensitive soul, it
   comes closest to intellect and ministers to it most nearly. St Thomas
   calls it in dumb animals vis aestimativa; in man, vis cognativa and
   ratio particularis. It has no English name, but may be defined: an
   instinct whereby the sentient soul directly recognises a sensible
   object as a particular something here and now present.' See Father
   Bödder's Psychologia, pp. 71-79, who apposite]y cites Cardinal Newman's
   Grammar of Assent, pp. 107 sq. See too Silvester Maurus, Commentary on
   Aristotle, De anima, lib. III, cap. iv (ed. Lethielleux, Paris, 1886,
   tom. IV, pp. 94, 95). Aristotle tells us of this faculty that it
   perishes with the body, but that its operation is an indispensable
   preliminary to all human understanding, ho de pathetikos nous
   phthartos, ka?i aneu toutou outhen noei (De anima III, v, ult.) 2. Much
   more important is the potential intellect,' -- intellectus possibilis,
   a term occurring again and again in all the writings of the schoolmen,
   being founded on one word of Aristotle, De anima III, iv, 3, med' autou
   einai phusin oudemian all' e tauten hoti dunaton (nor has it any other
   natural property than this, that it is able, capable, potential). It is
   defined by Maurus (l.c.): "the intellect inasmuch as it is capable of
   being [representatively] made all things, by receiving intelligible
   impressions of all things." An intelligible impression' differs from a
   sensible impression' as the universal from the particular, e.g. as the
   triangle in the mind, which stands for any triangle, from the image of
   this particular triangle chalked on the board and taken up by sense and
   phantasy. 3. Of equal scholastic importance is the active intellect,'
   intellectus agens, defined by Maurus: "The intellect inasmuch as it is
   capable of [representatively] making all things, by impressing on the
   potential intellect intelligible impressions of all things." The term
   nous poietkos though not actually found, is implied in De anima, III,
   v. The active' and potential' intellect together make up the
   understanding. The exact extent of the distinction between them is
   matter of some dispute (Bödder, Psychologia, pp. 159-163). What
   ordinary mortals call intellect' or understanding,' is the potential
   intellect.' It is called potential' because it is open to all
   intellectual impressions, and, prior to experience, is void of all
   impression, and has no predisposition of itself to one impression
   rather than to another. This by the way seems to militate against the
   Kantian doctrine of intellectual categories,' or forms of mind.' But it
   does not militate against the doctrine of heredity. Heredity works in
   the body, in the domain of the sentient soul: we are here concerned
   with pure intellect. Of that, Aristotle says it is "impassible [i.e.,
   not directly acted on by matter], yet apt to receive the intelligible
   impression, or form; but has no formed impression upon it, before the
   process of understanding is set up." The active intellect' on the other
   hand is the act of spontaneous energy, whereby the intellect transforms
   the image, sent up to it by sense and phantasy, from particular to
   universal, making out of it an intelligible impression.' A further
   distinction is drawn between the intelligible impression' (species
   intelligibilis impressa) thus created and received in the mind, and the
   intelligible expression' (species intelligibilis expressa), or precise
   act whereby the mind understands. See Bödder, Psychologia, pp. 153-156.
   This distinction has been already drawn by St Thomas (B. I, Chap.
   [227]LIII). For further elucidation see Father Maher's Psychology, pp.
   304-313, ed. 4, who however speaks of intellectus patiens vel
   possibilis, and takes no account of the intellectus passivus of St
   Thomas (B. II, Chap. [228]LX), probably because it simply is not
   intellect.

   [334] Abu Walid Mohammed Ibn Roschd (Averroes), called by the schoolmen
   the Commentator,' as Aristotle was the Philosopher,' was born at
   Cordova in 1120, and died in Morocco, 1198. He practised as a physician
   and a lawyer, and had a place about court, but was above all things a
   philosopher and an uncompromising Aristotelian. Fallen into neglect
   among his own countrymen, his philosophy embroiled the schools of
   Western Europe for four centuries, 1230-1630, at Paris, at Oxford, but
   particularly at Padua. Numerous Latin editions were printed. I shall
   cite the Venice edition of 1574 in the Bodleian Library, ten volumes.
   The origin of this dispute about the intellect is to be found in a
   passage of Plato, Theatetus, 185: "Being and not-being, likeness and
   unlikeness, sameness and difference, number . . . . there is no bodily
   organ for the cognition of these entities, but the soul by herself
   regards them; so it appears that the soul regards some things by
   herself, and other things through the bodily faculties." This passage
   is the foreshadowing of the celebrated and much disputed chapters, De
   anima, III, iv, v. Two words there call for notice: (1) apathes,
   meaning unimpressed, at first hand, by matter; (2) choristos,
   separable, or separate, on which word the great contention turns. It
   may apply to the active,' or to the potential' intellect: but it
   matters not to which, for Averroes and St Thomas agree that the two go
   together. It may refer to the state after death, and signify that the
   intellectual soul is not destroyed by separation from the body: on this
   point again there is a general agreement between Averroes and St
   Thomas. The battle between them begins when the word is referred to the
   intellect as it is in this mortal life. St Thomas takes the term merely
   to mean capable of operating apart from any bodily organ,' -- according
   to the tenor of the passage above quoted from Plato. Averroes will have
   it that it means, not only that, but much more than that: the meaning
   being according to him, that even while we live on earth, our
   intellect, potential' and active,' is outside of us, and is one and the
   same numerically for all men. My reading of Averroes has not revealed
   to me where he places this one separate universal intellect. He does
   not make it to be God: thus he says in his Destructio destructionum (or
   Refutation of the Refutations of Algazel): "If man only understood
   this, then his intellect would be the intellect of the God of glory;
   and that is false" (disp. 6, p. 87b). The notion of his day, in which
   he shared, that the heavenly bodies have souls, might have tempted him
   to place nous choristos in some heavenly sphere: that doctrine however
   belongs to the disciples of Averroes, not to the master. Renan,
   Averroes et l'Averroisme, p. 138, gives this explanation: Une humanité
   vivante et permanente, tel semble donc être le sens de la théorie
   Averroistique de l'unité de l'intellect. L'immortalité de l'intellect
   actif [and of the potential intellect with it, on which Averroes
   chiefly insists] n'est ainsi autre chose que, la renaissance éternelle
   de l'humanit', et la perpetuité de la civilisation. This interpretation
   derives support from Averroes's comments on the De anima, III (pp.
   149-151). Holding as he did the eternity of the world, he tells us
   there that the human race is eternal, and that some portion of the
   human race is always civilised, --positions set aside by our astronomy
   and geology, and at variance with the received anthropology. He says:
   "There must always be some philosopher amongst mankind." I have some
   hesitation however in agreeing with Renan's explanation: because this
   position, which he attributes to Averroes, is clearly suicidal, and the
   Commentator was no fool. If no individual man had a head on his
   shoulders, the race would be headless. Averroes (see Chap. [229]LX)
   does not seem to allow to the individual man, as man, any higher
   faculty than a faculty proper to the sentient soul: how can a race of
   such sentient beings constitute an intelligence? The intelligence of
   the race can only mean the intelligence of this man and of that,
   combining to form society. But it is difficult to form any rational
   conception of nous choristos as Averroes understood it. If Renan 's
   interpretation be taken, then when Averroes speaks (De anima, III, p.
   161) of the "active and potential intellect" as being "eternal
   substances," we must understand him to call them eternal with the
   eternity of civilised mankind, an eternity which he positively asserts
   (De anima, p. 149). The main point of St Thomas's attack upon the
   Commentator is his theory of the continuatio (ittisâl is the Arabic
   name, much used by the Arabian mystics), or point of contact between
   the universal intelligence outside and the mind of the individual man.
   Averroes's words are these (De anima, II, pp. 178, 148b, 185b): "The
   potential intellect is not conjoined with us primarily and ordinarily:
   nay, it is not conjoined with us at all, except inasmuch as it is
   conjoined with the forms in our phantasy. . . . Since it has been shown
   that intellect cannot be conjoined with all men so as to be multiplied
   as they are multiplied, it remains that the said intellect is conjoined
   with us by conjunction with our intellectual impressions which are
   conceptions in the phantasy, that is to say, through that part of those
   conceptions which exists in us and serves in a manner as a form. . . .
   Since the impressions of speculative intellect are conjoined with us by
   forms of phantasy; and the active intellect is conjoined with those
   intellectual impressions; and the intellect which takes cognisance of
   those impressions, that is to say, the potential intellect, is the same
   [as the active]: the necessary conclusion is that the active intellect
   is conjoined with us by the conjunction of those intellectual
   impressions." See St Thomas, Summa Theol. I, q 76 artt. 1 and 2: where
   he explains Averroes thus: "The Commentator says that this union is by
   means of the intellectual impression, which has a twofold residence,
   one in the potential intellect [universal, eternal, independent of the
   individual], and another in the impressions of phantasy, which are in
   the bodily organs [of the individual; in his phantasy, or sensory
   memory, or in the vis cogitativa, an organic faculty allied to
   phantasy]. And thus, through this intellectual impression, the
   potential intellect is continued and conjoined with the body of the
   individual man" (art. 1). St Thomas criticises this theory as follows
   (art. 2): "So long as the intellect is one, however all other things
   are diversified which the intellect uses as instruments, in no way can
   Socrates and Plato be called other than one intelligent being. . . . I
   grant that if the phantasm, or impression in the phantasy, inasmuch as
   it is other and other in you and me, were a form (or idea) of the
   potential intellect, then your intellectual activity and mine might be
   differentiated by the diversity of phantasms . . . . but the said
   phantasm is not a form (or idea) of the potential intellect: an idea in
   the potential intellect is obtained only by abstraction from phantasms.
   If then there were but one intellect for all men, no diversities of
   phantasms in this man and that could ever cause a diversity of
   intellectual activity between one man and another, as the Commentator
   pretends." So far as the Averroistic Potential (and Active) Intellect
   can be identified with the Zeitgeist or Educated Opinion of the day,
   and adapted to Comte's theory of progress, the reader will find some
   discussion of it in my Oxford and Cambridge Conferences, First Series,
   pp. 135 sq.; also Political and Moral Essays, p. 132, note. On De
   anima, III, the Commentator (p. 149) specifies three kinds of
   intellect: "the potential intellect, the active intellect, the acquired
   or made intellect: of these three, two are eternal, the active and the
   potential: the third is partly producible and perishable, and partly
   eternal." By the acquired intellect' he appears to mean the passive
   intellect' of each individual, inasmuch as it is illumined by
   continuatio (ittisâl) with the universal potential intellect. Does that
   mean the mind of the individual in so far as it comes abreast of the
   zeitgeist? If so, but I cannot feel sure of the conclusion, then
   Arabian mysticism ends in positivism.

   [335] This aptness, openness, or potentiality, is precisely what
   idealists ignore. They will have every thing actual.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LX--That Man is not a Member the Human Species by possession of
   Passive Intellect, but by possession of Potential Intellect

   AVERROES endeavours to meet these arguments and to maintain the
   position aforesaid. He says accordingly that man differs from dumb
   animals by what Aristotle calls the passive intellect,' which is that
   cogitative power' (vis cogitativa) proper to man, in place whereof
   other animals have a certain estimative power' (aestimativa). [336] The
   function of this cogitative power' is to distinguish individual ideas
   and compare them with one another, as the intellect, which is separate
   and unmixed, compares and distinguishes between universal ideas. And
   because by this cogitative power, along with imagination and memory,
   phantasms, or impressions of phantasy, are prepared to receive the
   action of the active intellect,' whereby they are made actual terms of
   understanding, therefore the aforesaid cogitative power is called by
   the names of intellect' and reason.' [337] Doctors say that it has its
   seat in the middle cell of the brain. According to the disposition of
   this power one man differs from another in genius, and in other points
   of intelligence; and by the use and exercise of this power man acquires
   the habit of knowledge. Hence the passive intellect is the subject of
   the various habits of knowledge. And this passive intellect is in a
   child from the beginning; and by virtue of it he is a member of the
   human species before he actually understands anything. So far Averroes.
   The falsity and perverseness of his statements evidently appears. [338]

   1. Vital activities stand to the soul as second actualities to the
   first. [339] Now the first actuality is prior in time to the second in
   the same subject, as knowledge is prior in time to learned speculation.
   In whatever being therefore there is found any vital activity, there
   must be some portion of soul standing to that activity as the first
   actuality to the second. But man has one activity proper to him above
   all other animals, namely that of understanding and reasoning.
   Therefore we must posit in man some proper specific principle, which
   shall be to the act of understanding as the first actuality to the
   second. This principle cannot be the aforesaid passive intellect': for
   the principle of the aforesaid activity must be "impassible and nowise
   implicated with the body," as the Philosopher proves, [340] whereas
   evidently quite the contrary is the case with the passive intellect.
   Therefore that cognitive faculty called the passive intellect' cannot
   possibly be the speciality that differentiates the human species from
   other animals.

   2. An incident of the sensitive part cannot constitute a being in a
   higher kind of life than that of the sensitive part, as an incident of
   the vegetative soul does not place a being in a higher kind of life
   than the vegetative life. But it is certain that phantasy and the
   faculties consequent thereon, as memory and the like, are incidents of
   the sensitive part. [341] Therefore by the aforesaid faculties, or by
   any one of them, an animal cannot be placed in any higher rank of life
   than that which goes with the sentient soul. But man is in a higher
   rank of life than that. Therefore the man does not live the life that
   is proper to him by virtue of the aforesaid cogitative faculty,' or
   passive intellect.'

   4. The potential intellect' is proved not to be the actualisation of
   any corporeal organ [342] from this consideration, that the said
   intellect takes cognisance of all sensible forms under a universal
   aspect. [343] Therefore no faculty, the activity of which can reach to
   the universal aspects of all corporeal forms, can be the actualisation
   of any corporeal organ. But such a faculty is the will: for of all of
   the things that we understand we can have a will, at least of knowing
   them. [344] And we also find acts of the will in the general: thus, as
   Aristotle says (Rhet. II, 4), we hate in general the whole race of
   robbers. The will then cannot be the actualisation of any bodily organ.
   But every portion of the soul is the actualisation of some bodily
   organ, except only the intellect properly so called. The will therefore
   belongs to the intellectual part, as Aristotle says. [345] Now the will
   of man is not extrinsic to man, planted as it were in some separately
   subsisting intelligence, but is in the man himself: otherwise he would
   not be master of his own acts, but would be worked by the will of a
   spirit other than himself: those appetitive, or conative, faculties
   alone would remain in him, the activity whereof is conjoined with
   passion, to wit the irascible and concupiscible [346] in the sentient
   part of his being, as in other animals, which are rather acted upon
   than act. But this is impossible: it would be the undoing of all moral
   philosophy and all social and political science. [347] Therefore there
   must be in us a potential intellect to differentiate us from dumb
   animals: the passive intellect is not enough.

   6. A habit and the act proper to that habit both reside in the same
   faculty. But to view a thing intellectually, which is the act proper to
   the habit of knowledge, cannot be an exercise of the faculty called
   passive intellect,' but must properly belong to the potential
   intellect: for the condition of any faculty exercising intelligence is
   that it should not be an actualisation of any corporeal organ.
   Therefore the habit of knowledge is not in the passive intellect, but
   in the potential intellect.

   8. Habitual understanding, as our opponent acknowledges, is an effect
   of the active intellect.' But the effects of the active intellect are
   actual representations in understanding, the proper recipient of which
   is the potential intellect, to which the active intellect stands
   related, as Aristotle says, "as art to material." [348] Therefore the
   habitual understanding, which is the habit of knowledge, must be in the
   potential intellect, not in the passive.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [336] The text reads vis cognoscitiva. But as it is called hujus
   cogitativae virtutis in the very next line, I opine that vis cogitativa
   should be the reading. The estimative power' is that by which a dog
   knows its master as a particular object.

   [337] It is called, as we have seen, passive intellect' and particular
   reason.'

   [338] Upon careful study of this chapter, it appears that there is
   little in the above statement which St Thomas really disagrees with. He
   makes his own all the description of the passive intellect.' Only the
   conclusion he finds fault with; and to mark what he holds
   objectionable, I have printed it in italics. Habits of knowledge he
   would place in the potential intellect.' The passive intellect is and
   must be exercised in the acquirement of knowledge to prepare the
   materials: but it can do no more than prepare: the intellectual
   assimilation of those materials belongs to a higher power, to intellect
   proper.

   [339] In the Aristotelian terminology, the first actuality' is the
   being in readiness to act, the second actuality' is the being in
   action. A locomotive with steam up is in the first actuality : a
   locomotive on its way is in the second actuality.' We must secure the
   first actuality' of science and skill, before we can exercise the
   second actuality ' of a skilful scientific investigation. St Thomas
   quotes Aristotle, De anima, II, i: "This actuality is understood in two
   senses: the first is represented by habitual knowledge, the second by
   the actual use of the understanding to mark a truth. Wherefore soul is
   defined, the first actuality of living body.'"

   [340] De anima, III, iv, 2, 4.

   [341] The reference is to Aristotle, Of memory and recollection, I, 9
   "It is clear to which of the several portions of soul memory belongs,
   that it belongs where phantasy belongs; and the ordinary objects of
   memory are the objects of phantasy, while objects of intellect, which
   cannot be without phantasy, are incidental objects of memory." -- The
   vis cogitativa, or passive intellect, St Thomas refers to the same
   class as phantasy and memory.

   [342] As sight is the actualisation, entelecheia, of the eye. e.g.
   brightness' simply, and not merely this brightness.'

   [343] e.g. brightness' simply, and not merely this brightness.'

   [344] e.g. the chemical components of the fixed stars.

   [345] De anima, III, ix, 5.

   [346] Plato's thumos and epithumia. Plato, curiously enough, makes no
   provision for the will, a neglect connected with his determinism.
   "Plato, following Socrates, is from first to last a thorough
   determinist: he always assumes that to know good is to do it: he never
   contemplates the case of a man looking away from the good that he
   knows, or failing to regard it steadily" (Political and Moral Essays,
   249, 250).

   [347] Destructivum totius humanae philosophiae et politicae
   considerationis. In St Thomas, considerare, consideratio, answers to
   Aristotle's theorein, theoria. -- The next two arguments are directed
   against Averroes's saying, above quoted, that "the passive intellect is
   the subject of the various habits of knowledge."

   [348] De anima, III, v, I.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXI--That the aforesaid Tenet is contrary to the Mind of
   Aristotle

   ARISTOTLE defines soul, "the first actuality of a natural, organic
   body, potentially alive"; and adds, "this definition applies
   universally to every soul." Nor does he, as the aforesaid Averroes
   pretends, put forth this latter remark in a tentative way, as may be
   seen from the Greek copies and the translation of Boethius. Afterwards
   in the same chapter he adds that there are "certain parts of the soul
   separable," and these are none other than the intellectual parts. The
   conclusion remains that the said parts are actualisations of the body.
   [349]

   2. Nor is this explanation inconsistent with Aristotle's words
   subjoined: "About the intellect and the speculative faculty the case is
   not yet clear: but it seems to be another kind of soul." [350] He does
   not hereby mean to separate the intellect from the common definition of
   soul,' but from the peculiar natures of the other parts of soul: as one
   who says that fowls are a different sort of animal from land animals,
   does not take away from the fowl the common definition of animal.'
   Hence, to show in what respect he called it "another kind," he adds:
   "And of this alone is there possibility of separation, as of the
   everlasting from the perishable." Nor is it the intention of Aristotle,
   as the Commentator aforesaid pretends, to say that it is not yet clear
   whether intellect be soul at all, as it is clear of other and lower
   vital principles. For the old text has not, "Nothing has been
   declared," or "Nothing has been said," but "Nothing is clear," which is
   to be understood as referring to the peculiar properties of intellect,
   not to the general definition (of soul). But if, as the Commentator
   says, the word soul' is used not in the same sense of intellect and
   other varieties, Aristotle would have first distinguished the ambiguity
   and then made his definition, as his manner is: otherwise his argument
   would rest on an ambiguity, an intolerable procedure in demonstrative
   sciences.

   3. Aristotle reckons intellect' among the faculties' of the soul. [351]
   Also, in the passage last quoted, he names the speculative faculty.'
   Intellect therefore is not outside the human soul, but is a faculty
   thereof.

   4. Also, when beginning to speak of the potential intellect, he calls
   it a part of the soul, saying: "Concerning the part of the soul whereby
   the soul has knowledge and intellectual consciousness." [352]

   5. And still more clearly by what follows, declaring the nature of the
   potential intellect: "I call intellect that whereby the soul thinks and
   under stands": [353] in which it is manifestly shown that the intellect
   is something belonging to the human soul.

   The above tenet (of Averroes) therefore is contrary to the mind of
   Aristotle and contrary to the truth: hence it should be rejected as
   chimerical. [354]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [349] St Thomas may have seen Greek MSS. of Aristotle in Italy, or at
   Paris, but I doubt if he could read them for himself. He is dependent
   on Latin translations, often bad ones. See an example in my Aquinas
   Ethicus, I, p. 111. In his Opusculum de Unitate Intellectus, he
   mentions his having seen a thirteenth and fourteenth book of
   Aristotle's Metaphysics, but declines further reference to them as
   being "not yet translated into our tongue." St Thomas and the mediaeval
   architects had genius, the fruits of which we still admire: but they
   had not at hand the manifold adminicula of the modern builder and the
   modern scholar. Nor was Averroes and the Arabian school any better off
   for Greek than St Thomas (Renan, p. 48). To this particular explanation
   of Aristotle however the Commentator would have been at no loss for a
   reply. The Greek referred to is De anima, II, i, 6, 8. Aristotle adds
   (n. 12), after saying that some parts of the soul are not separable
   from the body: "There is nothing to prevent some parts of the soul
   being separable from the body, because they are actualisations of
   nothing corporeal." A conclusion seems to follow, the very opposite of
   that which St Thomas draws, and exactly what Averroes wishes, namely,
   that the intellectual part of the soul is not the actualisation, or
   form, of anything corporeal, but dwells apart from all body. In the
   above quoted Opusculum, De unitate intellectus contra Averroistas,
   which I take to be a later production, St Thomas recognises the force
   of this reply, and re-adjusts his position thus: "The intellect is a
   faculty of the soul, and the soul is the form of the body: but the
   power that is called intellect is not the actualisation of any bodily
   organ, because the activity of the body has nothing in common with the
   activity of intellect." Intellectus est potentia animae, quae est
   corporis forma, licet ipsa potentia, quae est intellectus, non est
   alicujus organi actus, quia nihil ipsius operationi communicat corporis
   operatio (De unitate intellectus, cap. iii). So also Chap. [230]LXVIII,
   last paragraph, and in Chap. [231]LXIX (already translated) the replies
   nn. 3, 4, p. 117. ln this later explanation St Thomas has the support
   of Averroes, who says (De anima, III, p. 149): "But it has not been
   shown whether the body is perfected (or actualised) in the same way by
   all the powers of the soul; or whether there be some one of those
   powers whereby the body is not perfected (actualised, or informed)." I
   am persuaded that the retention of the paragraph as it stands in the
   text was due to an oversight on the part of the author. See [232]note
   on p. 99

   intelligence to be in him, of him, and his, and not extrinsic to him, I
   think is evident from these citations. On the other hand, that
   Aristotle did not take these separate human intelligences somehow to be
   effluxes of one great Intelligence, to which they returned, and were
   re-united with it in death, is not so clear. We are at a loss to assign
   his exact meaning in such passages as De anima, II, iii, 5; III, v, 3;
   and especially De gen. animal, II, iii, 10. leipetai de ton noun monon
   thurathen epeisienai kai theion einai monon (the conclusion remains,
   that intelligence alone comes in from without and is alone divine).
   Some pre-existence of the intellectual soul seems necessary in the
   Aristotelian system, as Aristotle nowhere recognises the notion of
   creation out of nothing, any more than Plato. He differs from Plato in
   being opposed to the transmigration of souls (De anima, I, iii, 26);
   and in his reticence upon a point upon which Plato was very explicit,
   the individuality of separate souls after death.

   CHAPTER LXII--Against the Opinion of Alexander concerning the Potential
   Intellect [355]

   UPON consideration of these words of Aristotle, Alexander determined
   the potential intellect to be some power in us, that so the general
   definition of soul assigned by Aristotle might apply to it. But because
   he could not understand how any subsistent intelligence could be the
   form of a body, he supposed the aforesaid faculty of potential
   intellect not to be planted in any subsistent intelligence, but to be
   the result of some combination of elements in the human body. Thus a
   definite mode of combination of the components of the human body puts a
   man in potentiality to receive the influence of the active intellect,
   which is ever in act, and according to him, [356] is a spiritual being
   subsisting apart, under which influence man becomes actually
   intelligent. But that in man whereby he is potentially intelligent is
   the potential intellect: hence it seemed to Alexander to follow that
   the potential intellect in us arises from a definite combination of
   elements. But this statement appears on first inspection to be contrary
   to the words and argument of Aristotle. For Aristotle shows (De anima,
   III, iv, 2-4) that the potential intellect is unmingled with the body:
   but that could not be said of a faculty that was the result of a
   combination of bodily elements. To meet this difficulty Alexander says
   that the potential intellect is precisely the predisposition'
   (praeparatio, epitedeotes) which exists in human nature to receive the
   influence of the active intellect; and that this predisposition' is not
   any definite sensible nature, nor is it mingled with the body, for it
   is a relation and order between one thing and another. [357] But this
   is in manifest disagreement with the mind of Aristotle, as the
   following reasons show:

   3. Aristotle assigns these characteristics to the potential intellect:
   to be impressed by the intelligible presentation, to receive
   intelligible impressions, to be in potentiality towards them (De anima,
   III, iv, 11, 12): all which things cannot be said of any disposition,'
   but only of the subject predisposed. It is therefore contrary to the
   mind of Aristotle, that the mere predisposition' should be the
   potential intellect. [358]

   4. An effect cannot stand higher above the material order than its
   cause. But every cognitive faculty, as such, belongs to the immaterial
   order. Therefore it is impossible for any cognitive faculty to be
   caused by a combination of elements. But the potential intellect is the
   supreme cognitive faculty in us: therefore it is not caused by a
   combination of elements.

   6. No bodily organ can possibly have a share in the act of
   understanding. But that act is attributed to the soul, or to the man:
   for we say that the soul understands, or the man through the soul.
   Therefore there must be in man some principle independent of the body,
   to be the principle of such an act. But any predisposition, which is
   the result of a combination of elements, manifestly depends on the
   body. Therefore no such predisposition can be a principle like the
   potential intellect, whereby the soul judges and understands.

   But if it is said that the principle of the aforesaid operation in us
   is the intellectual impression actually made by the active intellect,
   this does not seem to suffice: because when man comes to have actual
   intellectual cognition from having had such cognition potentially, he
   needs to understand not merely by some intelligible impression
   actualising his understanding, but likewise by some intellectual
   faculty as the principle of such activity. Besides, an impression is
   not in actual understanding except so far as it is purified from
   particular and material being. But this cannot happen so long as it
   remains in any material faculty, that is to say, in any faculty either
   caused by material principles or actualising a material organ.
   Therefore there must be posited in us some immaterial intellectual
   faculty, and that is the potential intellect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [355] Alexander of Aphrodisias (there were three towns of that name,
   one in Caria, one in Cilicia, and one in Thrace) expounded Aristotle at
   Athens, A.D. 200. Among the Greek commentators on the Philosopher he
   holds the place that Averroes holds among the Mohammedans: hence his
   similar surname of ho exegetes (the commentator). Averroes, while
   continually wrangling with Alexander, especially on the nature of the
   potential intellect, speaks of him with great regard. In the fifteenth
   and sixteenth centuries the schools of Northern Italy were filled with
   eager disputants, Alexandrists and Averroists. St Thomas in his later
   Opusculum de unitate intellectus denies that Alexander held the view
   which he here ascribes to him: he says that it was falsely imputed to
   him by Averroes. Be that as it may, the opinion at present standing for
   confutation comes to this. The potential intellect,' to all intents and
   purposes, is identified with what Averroes, and St Thomas with him,
   calls the passive intellect,' described in the opening of Chap.
   [233]LX, which intellect' is admitted on all hands to be in man, not
   extrinsic to him. There is a good account of Alexander in a
   Dissertation by Augustus Elfes, published at Bonn (Straus) in 1887,
   entitled Aristotelis doctrina de mente humana, pars prima, Alexandri
   Aphrodisiensis et Joannis Philoponi commentationes. Alexander calls the
   potential intellect hulikos, as in the Latin versions of Averroes it is
   called materialis. But with Alexander the potential intellect is a
   bodily (organic) faculty: in fact it is silently confounded with the
   nous pathetikos of Aristotle; whereas in Averroes, St Thomas, and (we
   may add) in Aristotle himself, it is a spiritual faculty. This is the
   great mistake of Alexander. He says, epitedeiotes tis estin ho hulikos
   nous, eoikos pinakidi agrapho,--in this agreeing with Aristotle, De
   anima, III, iv, 12: who says the potential intellect, to begin with, is
   like "a notebook in which nothing is actually written." The word
   epitedeiotes appears in St Thomas as praeparatio (predisposition). To
   meet Aristotle's saying that the potential intellect apathes
   (unimpressed by material things), Alexander distinguishes between the
   predisposition of the tablet to be written on, and the tablet itself:
   the tablet, he says, is impressed and changed, but not the
   predisposition. This looks like quibbling. Alexander made the active
   intellect' one for all men; and even identified it with God. On the
   other hand, G. Rodier, Aristote, Traité de l'âme (Leroux, Paris, 1900),
   vol. II, pp. 457, 460, has a clear statement and able defence of
   Alexander's notion of epitedeiotes.

   [356] And also according to Avicenna, -- Chap. LXXIV.

   [357] That is to say, between the human organism and the (extrinsic)
   active intellect,' the action of which imprints the universal idea.

   [358] So argues Averroes against Alexander (Averroes in Aristot. De
   anima, p. 159, ed. Venet. 1574).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXIV--That the Soul is not a Harmony [359]

   THE maintainers of this view did not mean that the soul is a harmony of
   sounds, but a harmony of contrary elements, whereof they saw living
   bodies to be composed. The view is rejected for the following reasons:

   1. You may find such a harmony in any body, even a mere chemical
   compound (corpus mixtum). A harmony cannot move the body, or govern it,
   or resist the passions, as neither can a temperament. Also a harmony,
   and a temperament also, admits of degrees. All which considerations go
   to show that the soul is neither harmony nor temperament. [360]

   2. The notion of harmony rather befits qualities of the body than the
   soul: thus health is a harmony of humours; strength, of muscles and
   bones; beauty, of limb and colour. But it is impossible to assign any
   components, the harmony of which would make sense, or intellect, or
   other appurtenances of the soul.

   3. Harmony may mean either the composition itself or the principle of
   composition. Now the soul is not a composition, because then every part
   of the soul would be composed of certain parts of the body, an
   arrangement which cannot be made out. In like manner the soul is not
   the principle of composition, because to different parts of the body
   there are different principles of composition, or proportions of
   elements, which would require the several parts of the body to have so
   many several souls, -- one soul for bone, one for flesh, one for sinew;
   which is evidently not the case.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [359] This doctrine, the first crude form of materialism, is refuted by
   Plato, Phaedo, 88b, c, 93, 94; Aristotle, De anima, I, iv, 1-7.

   [360] In Chap. LXIII an opinion, attributed to Galen the physician, is
   rejected, that the soul is the temperament (complexio), as sanguine,'
   bilious,' or the like.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXV--That the Soul is not a Body

   LIVING beings are composed of matter and form, -- of a body, and of a
   soul which makes them actually alive. One of these components must be
   the form, and the other the matter. But a body cannot be a form,
   because a body is not in another as in its matter and subject.
   Therefore the soul must be the form: therefore it is not a body. [361]

   5. The act of understanding cannot be the act of anything corporeal.
   But it is an act of the soul. Therefore the intellectual soul at least
   is not a body.

   It is easy to solve the arguments whereby some have endeavoured to
   prove that the soul is a body. They point such facts as these, -- that
   the son resembles the father even in the accidents of his soul, being
   generated from the father by severance of bodily substance; and that
   the soul suffers with the body; and is separated from the body,
   separation supposing previous bodily contact. Against these instances
   we observe that bodily temperament is a sort of predisposing cause of
   affections of the soul: that the soul suffers with the body only
   accidentally, as being the form of the body: also that the soul is
   separated from the body, not as touching from touched, but as form from
   matter; although there is a certain contact possible between an
   incorporeal being and the body, as has been shown above (Chap.
   [234]LVI).

   Many have been moved to this position by their belief that what is not
   a material body has no existence, being unable to transcend the
   imagination, which deals only with material bodies. Hence this opinion
   is proposed in the person of the unwise: The breath of our nostrils is
   smoke, and reason a spark in the beating of the heart (Wisdom ii, 2).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [361] "We need not enquire whether soul and body are one, as we do not
   raise that question about the wax and the impression which it bears,
   nor generally about the matter of each thing and that whereof it is the
   matter" (Aristotle, De anima, II, i, 7).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVI--Against those who suppose Intellect and Sense to be the
   same

   SENSE is found in all animals, but animals other than man have no
   intellect: which is proved by this, that they do not work, like
   intellectual agents, in diverse and opposite ways, but just as nature
   moves them fixed and uniform specific activities, as every swallow
   builds its nest in the same way.

   2. Sense is cognisant only of singulars, but intellect is cognisant of
   universals.

   3. Sensory knowledge extends only to bodily things, but intellect takes
   cognisance of things incorporeal, as wisdom, truth, and the relations
   between objects.

   4. No sense has reflex knowledge of itself and its own activity: the
   sight does not see itself, nor see that it sees. But intellect is
   cognisant of itself, and knows that it understands. [362]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [362] A fifth argument is alleged from Aristotle, De anima, III, iv, 6,
   which comes to this: -- A sensory organ is damaged by meeting with its
   object in a high degree: vivid light is seen, and crashing sounds are
   heard, but to the damage of eye and ear; whereas a highly intellectual
   object, -- Aristotelian psychology, for example, -- if understood at
   all, is understood to the improvement of the understanding; the
   understanding, as such, not working through any bodily organ. St Thomas
   however is far from confining dumb animals to mere sensation. He allows
   them sense memory, phantasy, a sort of judgement called vis aestimativa
   ([235]notes pp. 122, [236]125), and a certain power of
   self-determination (Chap. [237]XLVIII, n. 2). He denies in the
   intellect, free will, the powers of forming general concepts and
   determining their own judgements, and the immortality of their souls.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVII--Against those who maintain that the Potential Intellect
   is the Phantasy [363]

   PHANTASY is found in other animals besides man, the proof of which is
   that, as objects of sense recede from sense, these animals still shun
   or pursue them. But intellect is not in them, as no work of
   intelligence appears in their conduct.

   2. Phantasy is only of things corporeal and singular; but intellect, of
   things universal and incorporeal. [364]

   4. Intelligence is not the actualisation of any bodily organ. But
   phantasy has a fixed bodily organ. [365]

   Hence it is said: Who teacheth us above the beasts of the earth, and
   above the fowls of the air instructeth us (Job xxxv, 11): whereby we
   are given to understand that there is in man a certain cognitive power,
   above the sense and fancy that are in other animals.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [363] Averroes, and after him St Thomas (II Sent. d. 17, q. 2, a. 1),
   attributes this opinion to Avempace (Ibn-Bâdja), a Moorish philosopher
   at Seville and Granada in the early twelfth century. As making the
   potential intellect a corporeal faculty, the opinion is redolent of
   Alexander, and is rejected by Averroes.

   [364] We may, nay, we always do, take a universal view of a corporeal
   thing, as camel,' steam-engine.' It is a capital error in philosophy to
   make all universals abstract ideas. All concrete things are
   universalised in the mind.

   [365] Namely, the very same bodily parts which were implicated in the
   original sensible impression, or impressions, which phantasy now
   reproduces. This is well brought out by Bain in his Senses and
   Intellect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVIII--How a Subsistent Intelligence may be the Form of a Body

   If a subsistent intelligence is not united with a body merely as its
   mover, as Plato thought ([238]Chap. LVII); nor is the intellect,
   whereby man understands, a predisposition in human nature, as Alexander
   said (Chap. [239]LXII; nor a temperament, as Galen (Chap. [240]LXIII);
   nor a harmony, as Empedocles (Chap. [241]LXIV); nor a body, nor a
   sense, nor a phantasy (Chapp. [242]LXV, [243]LXVI, [244]LXVII); it
   remains that the human soul is a subsistent intelligence, united with
   the body as its form: which may be thus made manifest.

   There are two requisites for one thing to be the substantial form of
   another. One requisite is that the form be the principle of substantial
   being to that whereof it is the form: I do not mean the effective, but
   the formal principle, whereby a thing is and is denominated being.'
   [366] The second requisite is that the form and matter should unite in
   one being'; namely, in that being wherein the substance so composed
   subsists. There is no such union of the effective principle with that
   to which it gives being. [367] A subsistent intelligence, as shown in
   Chap. [245]LVI, is not hindered by the fact that it is subsistent from
   communicating its being to matter, and becoming the formal principle of
   the said matter. There is no difficulty in the identification of the
   being, in virtue of which the compound subsists, with the form itself
   of the said compound, since the compound is only through the form, and
   neither subsist apart. [368]

   It may be objected that a subsistent intelligence cannot communicate
   its being to a material body in such a way that there shall be one
   being of the subsistent intelligence and the material body: for things
   of different kinds have different modes of being, and nobler is the
   being of the nobler substance. This objection would be in point, if
   that being were said to belong to that material thing in the same way
   in which it belongs to that subsistent intelligence. But it is not so:
   for that being belongs to that material body as to a recipient subject
   raised to a higher state; while it belongs to that subsistent
   intelligence as to its principle and by congruence of its own nature.

   In this way a wonderful chain of beings is revealed to our study. The
   lowest member of the higher genus is always found to border close upon
   the highest member of the lower genus. Thus some of the lowest members
   of the genus of animals attain to little beyond the life of plants,
   certain shellfish for instance, which are motionless, have only the
   sense of touch, and are attached to the ground like plants. Hence
   Dionysius says: "Divine wisdom has joined the ends of the higher to the
   beginnings of the lower." [369] Thus in the genus of bodies we find the
   human body, composed of elements equally tempered, attaining to the
   lowest member of the class above it, that is, to the human soul, which
   holds the lowest rank in the class of subsistent intelligences. Hence
   the human soul is said to be on the horizon and boundry line between
   things corporeal and incorporeal, inasmuch as it is an incorporeal
   substance and at the same time the form of a body.

   Above other forms there is found a form, likened to the supramundane
   substances in point of understanding, and competent to an activity
   which is accomplished without any bodily organ at all; and this is the
   intellectual soul: for the act of understanding is not done through any
   bodily organ. Hence the intellectual soul cannot be totally encompassed
   by matter, or immersed in it, as other material forms are: this is
   shown by its intellectual activity, wherein bodily matter has no share.
   The fact however that the very act of understanding in the human soul
   needs certain powers that work through bodily organs, namely, phantasy
   and sense, is a clear proof that the said soul is naturally united to
   the body to make up the human species. [370]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [366] If a man is, let us say, a Master of Arts, the formal principle,
   whereby he is such, is the degree itself; the efficient principle is
   the authority of the University which conferred the degree; while the
   man, on whom it is conferred, is the matter. This form is not
   substantial, but accidental: the man would be a man without it. But
   without his soul he would not be a man.

   [367] Jones, M.A., does not bear about him the authority of his
   University. A son has not the life of his father, but a similar life.

   [368] Let the compound be Jones graduate. The compound subsists in the
   state and condition of a graduate: that state and condition is the
   being of the compound. But the degree itself is identical with the
   state and condition of the graduate. Jones graduate exists, as such,
   only through the degree. The degree has no subsistence away from Jones
   graduate, nor Jones graduate away from the degree.

   [369] This is a static view of a series of gradations, as it were,
   crystallised, showing no indication of that virtual progress from the
   highest of the lower genus to the lowest of the higher, which is the
   idea of evolution, true or false. This static view, which is also that
   of Aristotle, has been termed "evolution in co-existence," not in
   succession.

   [370] "A man's intellectual knowledge stands to his sensory knowledge
   as a sculptor chiselling an image out of marble stands to the workmen
   who bring the marble from the quarry. As the sculptor cannot exercise
   his art on the marble unless the workmen bring it to the quarry, so a
   man's intellect can form no ideas of sensible things unless it has
   presented to it through the external and internal senses sensible
   images of the same. But as the sculptor alone impresses in the marble
   brought him the idea of something conceived in his mind, so with his
   intellect alone does man form intellectual cognitions," -- i.e.
   universal concepts (Bödder, Psychologia, pp. 94, 95, translated). The
   intellect then (which must include the rational appetite, the will) is
   a free faculty, inorganic; choristos at least in this sense, that it
   does not actualise any body organ, as sight actualises the eye; which
   led Aristotle to say that "were the eye an animal, sight would be its
   soul" (De anima, II, i, 9), as being its entelecheia, or form. But, it
   may be objected, from this it appears that the nous, or the intelligent
   soul, is not the form of the body. St Thomas would meet this grave
   objection by laying down, as he does (Sum. Theol., I, q. 77, a. 1), his
   distinction between the faculties and the essence (or substance) of the
   soul. This soul, he would say, is one substance, with faculties
   vegetative, sentient, and intelligent: it is the form of the body in
   respect of these vegetative and sentient faculties, and consequently in
   respect of the substance to which those faculties are attached,
   consequently also in respect even of the intelligent faculties, which
   are attached to the same substance of the soul. For this distinction of
   faculty and substance see Bödder, Psychologia, pp. 314, 315. The
   mediaeval mystics, as Thaulerus and Blosius, made much of this
   substance of the soul' (fundus animae, they called it), as distinct
   from the faculties: in this fundus animae, they declared, God dwells by
   grace as in His sanctuary, even when he is not actually thought of. It
   is the fashion now to rail at faculty psychology,' to scout the idea of
   substance,' to deny all potential being,' to allow of nothing but
   present actuality. Whoever is of that way of thinking, and takes up the
   Aristotelian idea of nous choristos, need not be surprised to find
   himself carried further from St Thomas than Averroes and Alexander,
   even to the setting aside of the individual man altogether.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXIX--Solution of the Arguments alleged to show that a
   Subsistent Intelligence cannot be united with a Body as the Form of
   that Body [371]

   The arguments wherewith Averroes endeavours to establish his opinion do
   not prove that the subsistent intelligence is not united with the body
   as the form of the same.

   1. The words of Aristotle about the potential intellect, that it is
   "impassible, unmixed, and separate," [372] do not necessitate the
   admission that the intellectual substance is not united with the body
   as its form, giving it being. They are sufficiently verified by saying
   that the intellectual faculty, which Aristotle calls the speculative
   faculty,' [373] is not the actualisation of any organ, as exercising
   its activity through that organ.

   2. Supposing the substance of the soul to be united in being with the
   body as the form of the body, while still the intellect is not the
   actualisation of any organ, it does not follow that intellect falls
   under the law of physical determination, as do sensible and material
   things: for we do not suppose intellect to be a harmony, or function
   (ratio, golos) of any organ, as Aristotle says that sense is. [374]

   3. That Aristotle is saying that the intellect is unmingled,' or
   separate,' does not intend to exclude it from being a part, or faculty,
   of the soul, which soul is the form of the whole body, is evident from
   this passage, where he is arguing against those who said that there
   were different parts of the soul in different parts of the body: -- "If
   the whole soul keeps together the body as a whole, it is fitting that
   each part of the soul should keep together some part of the body: but
   this looks like an impossibility: for it is difficult even to imagine
   what part of the body the intellect shall keep together, or how." [375]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [371] The first part of this chapter has been already translated along
   with Chap. LVI. What now follow are answers to the arguments of
   Averroes in Chap. LIX.

   [372] choristos kai amiges kai apathes (De Anima, III, v.2), words
   generally understood of the active intellect, but by Averroes applied
   to the potential. However in III, iv, 2, 3, the potential intellect is
   called apathes and amige.

   [373] peri de tou nou kai tes theoretikes dunameos. De anima, II, ii,
   10.

   [374] Somewhat obscurely in De anima, II, xii, 2, 3.

   [375] De anima, I, v, 29, where Aristotle seems to assume that
   intellect is a part, morion, of the soul. Averroes however might have
   replied that is a mere argumentum ad hominem against Plato, who did
   suppose so. In n. 25 however Aristotle says clearly, to ginoskein tes
   psuches esti, k.t.l., which see. But Aristotle is so careless a writer,
   so regardless of his own injunctions and definitions, that the minute
   analysis of his language, far from settling a point, may be positively
   misleading. In reading him you have often to think, not so much of what
   he says, as of what on his own showing he should say. When St Thomas
   teaches that the soul is the form of the body by its substance, but not
   by the faculty of intelligence, he supposes a real distinction between
   the soul and its faculties, a distinction not admitted by the earlier
   scholastics, sometimes called Augustinians.' In his ruling that the
   intelligence has no corporeal organ, one naturally thinks of the brain.
   But the brain, in the Aristotelian system, had quite another function;
   it acted as a refrigerator to cool down the vital heat of the body. See
   the curious chapter, De partibus animalium, II, 7. St Thomas however
   assigned to the brain some share in sensory processes: see De potentiis
   animae, cap. iv, quoted in Dr Maher's Psychology, pp. 568-9, ed. 4.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIII--That the Potential Intellect is not One and the Same in
   all Men

   HENCE it is plainly shown that there is not one and the same potential
   intellect, belonging to all men who are and who shall be and who have
   been, as Averroes pretends. [376]

   A. 1. It has been shown that the substance of the intellect is united
   with the human body and is its form (Chap. [246]LVII). But it is
   impossible for there to be one form otherwise than of one matter.
   Therefore there is not one intellect for all men.

   A. 2 and 3. [377] It is not possible for a dog's soul to enter a wolf's
   body, or a man's soul any other body than the body of a man. But the
   same proportion that holds between a man's soul and a man's body, holds
   between the soul of this man and the body of this man. It is impossible
   therefore for the soul of this man to enter any other body than the
   body of this man. But it is by the soul of this man that this man
   understands. Therefore there is not one and the same intellect of this
   man and of that.

   A. 4. A thing has being from that source from whence it has unity: for
   one and being are inseparable. But everything has being by its own
   form. Therefore the unity of the thing follows the unity of the form.
   It is impossible therefore for there to be one form of different
   individual men. But the form of any individual man is his intellectual
   soul. It is impossible therefore for there to be one intellect of all
   men.

   But if it is said that the sentient soul of this man is other than the
   sentient soul of that, and so far forth the two are not one man, though
   there be one intellect of both, such explanation cannot stand. For the
   proper activity of every being follows upon and is indicative of its
   species. But as the proper activity of an animal is to feel, so the
   proper activity of a man is to understand. As any given individual is
   an animal in that he has feeling, so is he a man by virtue of the
   faculty whereby he understands. But the faculty whereby the soul
   understands, or the man through the soul, is the potential intellect.
   This individual then is a man by the potential intellect. If then this
   man has another sentient soul than another man, but not another
   potential intellect, but one and the same, it follows that they are two
   animals, but not two men.

   B. To these arguments the Commentator replies by saying that the
   potential intellect is conjoined with us through its own form, namely,
   through an intelligible impression, one subject of which [is the said
   potential intellect, and one subject again] is the phantasm existing in
   us, which differs in different men; and thus the potential intellect is
   multiplied in different men, not by reason of its substance, but by
   reason of its form.

   The nullity of this reply appears by what has been shown above (Chap.
   [247]LIX), that it would be impossible for any man to have
   understanding, if this were the only way in which the potential
   intellect were conjoined with us. But suppose that the aforesaid
   conjunction (continuatio) were sufficient to render man intelligent,
   still the said answer does not solve the arguments already alleged.

   B. 1. According to the above exposition, nothing belonging to intellect
   will remain multiplied as men are multiplied except only the phantasm,
   or impression in phantasy; and this very phantasm will not be
   multiplied as it is actually understood, because, as so understood, it
   is in the potential intellect, and has undergone abstraction of
   material conditions under the operation of the active intellect;
   whereas the phantasm, as a potential term of intelligence, does not
   transcend the grade of the sentient soul.

   B. 2. Still the objection holds, that this man will not be
   differentiated from that except by the sentient soul; and the awkward
   consequence follows that this man and that together do not make a
   plurality of men.

   B. 3. Nothing attains its species by what it is potentially, but by
   what it is actually. [378] But the impression in phantasy, as
   multiplied in this man and that, has only a potentially intelligible
   being. Therefore that impression, as so multiplied, does not put any
   given individual in the species of intelligent animal,' which is the
   definition of man.' Thus it remains true that the specific ratio of
   man' is not multiplied in individual men.

   B. 4. It is the first and not the second perfection [379] that gives
   the species to every living thing. But the impression in phantasy is a
   second perfection; and therefore not from that multiplied impression
   has man his species.

   B. 6. That which puts a man in the species of man must be something
   abiding in the same individual as long as he remains: otherwise the
   individual would not be always of one and the same species, but now of
   one species and now of another. But the impressions of phantasy do not
   remain always the same in the same man; but new impressions come, and
   previous impressions perish. Therefore the individual man does not
   attain his species by any such impression: nor is it anything in the
   phantasy that conjoins him with the formal principle of his species,
   which is the potential intellect.

   C. But if it is said that the individual does not receive his species
   by the phantasms themselves, but by the faculties in which the
   phantasms are, namely, the phantasy, the memory, and the vis cogitativa
   which is proper to man, and which in the De anima, III, v, Aristotle
   calls the passive intellect,' [380] the same awkward consequences still
   follow.

   C. 1. Since the vis cogitativa operates only upon particulars, the
   impressions of which it puts apart and puts together; [381] and
   further, since it has a bodily organ through which it acts, [382] it
   does not transcend the rank of the sentient soul. But in virtue of his
   sentient soul, as such, man is not a man, but an animal. It still
   therefore remains true that the element, supposed to be multiplied in
   us, belongs to man only in his animal capacity.

   C. 2. The cogitative faculty, since it acts through an organ, is not
   the faculty whereby we understand. But the principle whereby we
   understand is the principle whereby man is man. Therefore no individual
   is man by virtue of the cogitative faculty: nor does man by that
   faculty essentially differ from dumb animals, as the Commentator
   pretends.

   C. 3. The cogitative faculty is united to the potential intellect, the
   principle of human intelligence, only by its action of preparing
   phantasms for the active intellect to render them actual terms of
   intelligence and perfections of the potential intellect. But this
   preliminary activity of the cogitative faculty does not always remain
   the same in us. Therefore it cannot be the means whereby man is
   conjoined with the specific principle of the human species, or made a
   member of that species.

   C. 4. If the potential intellect of this and that man were numerically
   one and the same, the act of understanding would be one and the same in
   both which is an impossibility.

   D. But if it is said that the act of understanding is multiplied
   according to the diversity of impressions in phantasy, that supposition
   cannot stand.

   D. 3. For the potential intellect understands a man, not as this
   individual man, but as man simply, according to the specific essence of
   the race. But this specific essence remains one, however much
   impressions in phantasy are multiplied, whether in the same man or in
   different men. Therefore no multiplication of phantasms can be the
   cause of multiplication of the act of understanding in the potential
   intellect, considering the same species; and thus we shall still have
   numerically one action in different men.

   D. 4. The proper subject in which the habit of knowledge resides is the
   potential intellect. But an accident, so long as it remains
   specifically one, is multiplied only by coming to reside in different
   subjects. If then the potential intellect is one in all men, any habit
   of knowledge specifically the same, say, the habit of grammar, must be
   numerically the same in all men, which is unthinkable.

   E. But to this they say that the subject of the habit of knowledge is
   not the potential intellect, but the passive intellect and the
   cogitative faculty (Chap. [248]LX): which it cannot be.

   E. 1. For, as Aristotle shows in the Ethics (II, i), like acts engender
   like habits; and like habits reproduce like acts. Now by the acts of
   the potential intellect there comes to be the habit of knowledge in us;
   and we are competent for the same acts by possession of the habit of
   knowledge. Therefore the habit of knowledge is in the potential
   intellect, not in the passive.

   E. 2. Scientific knowledge is of demonstrated conclusions; and
   demonstrated conclusions, like their premises, are universal truths.
   [383] Science therefore is in that faculty which takes cognisance of
   universals. But the passive intellect is not cognisant of universals,
   but of particular notions.

   F. The error of placing the habit of scientific knowledge in the
   passive intellect seems to have arisen from the observation that men
   are found more or less apt for the study of science according to the
   several dispositions of the cogitative faculty and the phantasy.

   F. 1. But this aptitude depends on those faculties only as remote
   conditions: so it also depends on the complexion of the body, as
   Aristotle says that men of delicate touch and soft flesh are clever.
   [384] But the proximate principle of the act of speculative
   understanding is the habit of scientific knowledge: for this habit must
   perfect the power of understanding to act readily at will, as other
   habits perfect the powers in which they are.

   F. 2. The dispositions of the cogitative faculty and the phantasy
   regard the object: they regard the phantasm, which is prepared by the
   efficiency of these faculties readily to become a term of actual
   understanding under the action of the active intellect. But habits do
   not condition objects: they condition faculties. Thus conditions that
   take the edge off terrors [385] are not the habit of fortitude:
   fortitude is a disposition of the conative part of the soul to meet
   terrors. Hence it appears that the habit of knowledge is not in the
   passive but in the potential intellect.

   F. 3. If the potential intellect of all men is one, we must suppose
   that the potential intellect has always existed, if men have always
   existed, as Averroists suppose; and much more the active intellect,
   because agent is more honourable than patient, as Aristotle says (De
   anima, III, v). [386] But if the agent is eternal, and the recipient
   eternal, the contents received must be eternal also. Therefore the
   intellectual impressions have been from eternity in the potential
   intellect: therefore it will be impossible for it to receive afresh any
   new intellectual impressions. But the only use of sense and phantasy in
   the process of understanding is that intellectual impressions may be
   gathered from them. At this rate then neither sense nor phantasy will
   be needed for understanding; and we come back to the opinion of Plato,
   that we do not acquire knowledge by the senses, but are merely roused
   by them to remember what we knew before. [387]

   G. But to this the Commentator replies that intellectual presentations
   reside in a twofold subject: in one subject, from which they have
   everlasting being, namely, the potential intellect; in another subject,
   from which they have a recurring new existence, namely, the phantasm,
   or impression in phantasy. He illustrates this by the comparison of a
   sight-presentation, which has also a twofold subject, the one subject
   being the thing outside the soul, the other the visual faculty. But
   this answer cannot stand.

   G. 1. For it is impossible that the action and perfection of the
   eternal should depend on anything temporal. But phantasms are temporal
   things, continually springing up afresh in us from the experience of
   the senses. Therefore the intellectual impressions, whereby the
   potential intellect is actuated and brought to activity, cannot
   possibly depend on phantasms in the way that visual impressions depend
   on things outside the soul. [388]

   G. 2. Nothing receives what it has already got. But before any sensory
   experience of mine or yours there were intellectual impressions in the
   potential intellect: for the generations before us could not have
   understood had not the potential intellect been reduced to act by
   intellectual impressions. Nor can it be said that those impressions,
   formerly received in the potential intellect, have ceased to be:
   because the potential intellect not only receives, but keeps what it
   receives: hence it is called the "place of ideas." [389] Therefore, on
   this showing, no impressions from our phantasms are received in the
   potential intellect.

   G. 6 and 7. If the potential intellect receives no intellectual
   impressions from the phantasms that are in us, because it has already
   received them from the phantasms of those who were before us, then for
   the like reason we must say that it receives impressions from the
   phantasms of no generation of men, whom another generation has
   preceded. But every generation has been preceded by some previous
   generation, if the world and human society is eternal, as Averroists
   suppose. Therefore the potential intellect never receives any
   impressions from phantasms; and from this it seems to follow that the
   potential intellect has no need of phantasms to understand. But we
   (nos) understand by the potential intellect. Therefore neither shall we
   need sense and phantasm for our understanding: which is manifestly
   false and contrary to the opinion of Aristotle. [390]

   For the potential intellect, like every other substance, operates
   according to the mode of its nature. Now according to its nature it is
   the form of the body. Hence it understands immaterial things, but views
   them in some material medium; as is shown by the fact that in teaching
   universal truths particular examples are alleged, in which what is said
   may be seen. Therefore the need which the potential intellect has of
   the phantasm before receiving the intellectual impression is different
   from that which it has after the impression has been received. Before
   reception, it needs the phantasm to gather from it the intellectual
   impression, so that the phantasm then stands to the potential intellect
   as an object which moves it. But after receiving the impression, of
   which the phantasm is the vehicle, it needs the phantasm as an
   instrument or basis of the impression received. Thus by command of the
   intellect there is formed in the phantasy a phantasm answering to such
   and such an intellectual impression; and in this phantasm the
   intellectual impression shines forth as an exemplar in the thing
   exemplified, or as in an image. [391]

   G. 8. If the potential intellect is one for all men and eternal, by
   this time there must have been received in it the intellectual
   impressions of all things that have been known by any men whatsoever.
   Then, as every one of us understands by the potential intellect, --
   nay, as the act of understanding in each is the act of that potential
   intellect understanding, -- every one of us must understand all that
   has been understood by any other men whatsoever.

   H. To this the Commentator replies that we do not understand by the
   potential intellect except in so far as it is conjoined with us through
   the impressions in our phantasy, and that these phantasms are not the
   same nor similar amongst all men. And this answer seems to be in
   accordance with the doctrine that has gone before: for, apart from any
   affirmation of the unity of the potential intellect, it is true that we
   do not understand those things, the impressions whereof are in the
   potential intellect, unless the appropriate phantasms are at hand. But
   that this answer does not altogether escape the difficulty, may be thus
   shown.

   When the potential intellect has been actualised by the reception of an
   intellectual impression, it is competent to act of itself: hence we see
   that, once we have got the knowledge of a thing, it is in our power to
   consider it again when we wish: nor are we at a loss for lack of
   phantasms, because it is in our power to form phantasms suitable to the
   consideration which we wish, unless there happens to be some impediment
   on the part of the organ, as in persons out of their mind or in a
   comatose state. But if in the potential intellect there are
   intellectual impressions of all branches of knowledge, -- as we must
   say, if that intellect is one and eternal, -- then the necessity of
   phantasms for the potential intellect will be the same as in his case
   who already has knowledge, and wishes to study and consider some point
   of that knowledge, for that also he could not do without phantasms.
   [392] Since then every man understands by the potential intellect so
   far as it is reduced to act by intellectual impressions, so every man
   should be able on this theory to regard, whenever he would, all the
   known points of all sciences: which is manifestly false, for at that
   rate no one would need a teacher. Therefore the potential intellect is
   not one and eternal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [376] See Chap. [249]LXXVI. Alexander, Avicenna, and Averroes, are all
   at one against St Thomas, in affirming the one universal intellect.
   Thus Averroes writes (in Aristot., De anima, III, v): "We agree with
   Alexander in his mode of explaining the active intellect; and differ
   from him as to the nature of the potential intellect." If Alexander and
   Avicenna do not expressly affirm the oneness and universality of the
   potential intellect, the reason is, because they thought it enough to
   affirm the universality of the active intellect'; and did not so
   clearly as Averroes and St Thomas (see Chap. [250]LX) mark off from the
   spiritual potential intellect' the organic and perishable passive
   intellect' (ho de pathetikos nous phthartos. De anima, III, v, 3). In
   this dispute about the one universal intellect these two questions
   should be kept distinct:-- A. Do Alexander, Avicenna, and Averroes, or
   does Aquinas, speak the true mind of Aristotle? B. In point of
   psychological fact, is the truth with St Thomas or with his three
   opponents? A. On the former question I observe that there is no
   complete and coherent account of nous in Aristotle, so that any
   commentator who will give such a complete account is obliged to
   overshoot his author. The question then comes to this: On which side is
   Aristotle's meaning eked out with least violence to what he actually
   says? My opinion is that St Thomas is the better Aristotelian in
   speaking of the human soul in this world, and Averroes in speaking of
   the soul in the next world. I think that Aristotle would have admitted
   that the intellectual soul is in the body, and is individually
   multiplied in the bodies of individual men. Averroes's theory of the
   continuatio (ittisâl), or union of the individual passive intellect
   with the universal potential intellect, is to me far fetched,
   inconsistent with the sound sense of Aristotle, a remnant of Moorish
   mysticism (although Averroes himself was no mystic) rather than a
   development of Greek philosophy. But coming to the existence of the
   intellectual soul after death, I fear that the following words of
   Averroes declare the mind of Aristotle more faithfully than St Thomas's
   doctrine of the permanence of as many separate souls as there have been
   bodies. "Of all things the soul is most like light; and as light is
   divided by the division of illuminated bodies, and then becomes one
   when the bodies are taken away, such is the state of souls in their
   relation with their bodies" Destructio destructionum, disp. 1, p. 21,
   ed. 1574). See [251]note p. 128. B. For a Catholic, the second question
   is settled by the decree of the fifth Council of Lateran under Leo X in
   1513 against the Averroists of the age: "The soul is immortal, and
   individually multipliable, and multiplied according to the multitude of
   the bodies into which it is infused." No Catholic can deny the
   immortality of the individual soul, or hold any view subversive of
   individual responsibility, as though saint and sinner alike were
   automata, administered by an intelligence and will foreign to
   themselves. The one really Universal Intellect is that of God; and the
   Divine Mind works upon our mortal minds, not formally, as a constituent
   of them, but efficiently, as guiding them, while respecting their
   native liberty. In his work, De animae beatitudine cap. iii, Averroes
   says very justly that the active intellect is so called, not merely in
   an efficient, but in a formal sense. "The active intellect is a cause
   in regard of the potential intellect not only by way of efficiency and
   movement, but also by way of final perfection, that is, by way of form
   and consummation" (p. 151). It would then be pantheism, which even
   Averroes avoids, to make God the active intellect' of the world, in the
   Aristotelian sense. But God is the efficiently illuminating intellect
   of all other intellects. The modus operandi whereby God acts upon the
   minds of mortal men, whether indirectly through sensible objects, or in
   any more direct way, is an interesting and comparatively unexplored
   region of psychology. The intellectual is allowed on all hands to be
   the universal; and the universal is our natural avenue to the divine.
   "Material forms," says Averroes, "when abstracted in the soul from
   their matters, become science and understanding; and understanding is
   nothing else than forms abstracted from matter, . . . . nothing else
   than a comprehension of things understood, . . . . nothing else than a
   comprehension of the order of the world" (Destructio destructionum,
   disp. 6, p. 86). He goes on to show how intellect is impeded and
   retarded by having to study these forms in matter. Mental experience, a
   witness too little heard in this discussion, reveals to us this fact,
   that the more absorbed we are in intellectual occupation, the more
   forgetful we are of ourselves. Aristotle places happiness in
   contemplation; and contemplation is a process of being universalised
   and de-individualised. The pathe of our animal organism, our bodily
   needs and apprehensions, drive us back upon ourselves. Happiness puts
   us out of ourselves: misery is a painful consciousness of self. Some
   such painful isolation in the next world, some state in which the soul
   is driven in upon itself, excluded from the universal truth and
   universal good, and as it were crushed within its own individuality,
   may be the penal consequence of selfishness and sin. Phantastic and
   objectionable on many points as Averroes is, there is a world of
   thought in Averroism; and his great opponent St Thomas owes not a
   little to the Commentator. Renan indeed goes the length of saying:
   Albert (Albertus Magnus) doit tout à Avicenne; Saint Thomas, comme
   philosophe, presque tout à l'Averroisme (Averroes et l'Averroisme p.
   236). The reader may consult Roger Bede Vaughan's St Thomas of Aquin
   (Longmans, 1871), vol. I, pp. 300, 301, for Averroes's doctrine of the
   passive and active intellect; and vol. II, pp. 799-809, for an analysis
   of St Thomas's Opuculum de unitate intellectus.

   [377] St Thomas argues upon this passage, De anima, I, iii. 26: "They
   try to describe to us the qualities of the soul, but add no further
   details as to the body which is to receive it, as though it were
   possible, as the Pythagorean fables have it, for any soul to array
   itself in any body: whereas it seems proper that every body should have
   its own species and form. It is as though they said that the
   carpenter's art got into the bagpipes: for as art uses its instruments,
   so the soul has to use the body."

   [378] How then is the human embryo man? The question is irrelevant for
   this reason: every species contains imperfect individuals, but they are
   not types of the species: the type is the perfection of the species,
   the standard to which various individuals variously attain. The point
   under discussion here is the proper type of the human species.

   [379] That is to say, what the thing can do, not what it does; the
   power, not the act. See note, p. 126.

   [380] This is what Averroes is represented as saying in Chap. LX, which
   see for explanations. Et intelligit Aristoteles per intellectum
   passibilem ipsam virtutem cogitativam is Averroes's comment on the
   pathetikos nous phthartos of De anima, III, v, 3. Alexander had taken
   the pathetikos nous to be the potential intellect. St Thomas is
   Averroist on this point.

   [381] The putting apart leads up to denial, and the putting together to
   affirmation: but affirmation and negation are not sentient but
   intelligent acts. Remaining in the sentient order, the vis cogitativa
   seems to associate and dissociate rather than to affirm and deny.

   [382] "The middle cell of the head," according to Averroes in Chap. LX.
   If any one will have it that the grey matter of the brain is the organ
   even of intelligence itself, the scholastic reply is: Of intelligence
   as needing the concurrence of phantasms, yes: of intelligence pure and
   simple, exactly the nous choristos, no.' The difficulty remains, that
   precisely over the most abstract thinking, where the thinker does his
   utmost to dispense with phantasms, does the grey matter of the brain
   get most exhausted. Perhaps the effort to dispense with phantasms does
   violence to the phantasy, and thereby consumes the tissue which
   ministers to that sentient faculty.

   [383] We should say, much to the same purpose, that science deals with
   uniformities of nature.

   [384] De anima, II, ix, 4, where we further read that delicacy or
   obtuseness of touch makes the difference between cleverness and
   stupidity; and that man is the cleverest of animals because he is most
   sensitive to touch.

   [385] e.g., anaesthetics.

   [386] Averroes expressly makes all and each of these suppositions.

   [387] The tentative conclusions of the Meno, 85-86, and the poetry of
   the Phaedrus, passed into aphorisms among the later Platonists. See
   Jowett's Dialogues of Plato, II, pp. 13-19, ed. 3. Later Platonists, we
   may say, were more Platonic than Plato. But it remains a leading line
   of difference between Plato and Aristotle, that Plato never gave due
   recognition, as Aristotle did, to the value of sense experience in the
   genesis of science and philosophy. St Thomas's argument here is this,
   that if the human mind is eternal and one, then human knowledge is
   eternal and one: whence it follows that, when the individual seems to
   be learning by the experience of his senses, he is really only
   recognising what is in his mind already.

   [388] It is supposed (ad hominem) that the potential intellect is
   eternal. -- Yet somehow the argument here seems to miss the point. The
   Commentator never said that the presentations in the eternal potential
   intellect depended on the phantasms of any individual. He never likened
   those presentations to the individual's fleeting visual impressions of
   things: but he likened the presentations in the eternal intellect to
   things, and the phantasms of the individual to his visual impressions
   of things. Averroes contended that forms,' or aspects of things, exist
   in two ways, in both eternally: (a) materially, in sensible things, the
   world being eternal, in which sensible things these forms are
   potentially intelligible, being abstracted thence by intellect: (b)
   intellectually, in the eternal intellect, which is at once potential
   and active. He added that the same forms had an intellectual existence
   in a third way, namely, a temporal existence in the mind of this and
   that individual, which mind is continued,' or conjoined' for a time
   with the eternal intellect: this asserted continuation' of the temporal
   with the eternal is the theme of contention between Averroes and St
   Thomas. St Thomas might refit his argument (as indeed he does
   presently) by demanding how intellectual presentations come to be in
   this supposed one eternal intellect, whether by abstraction from
   previous phantasms or not. To say that the potential intellect had
   impressions independent of previous phantasms, would put the
   Commentator in flat contradiction with Aristotle; e.g., De anima, III,
   vii, 3, 4: "To the intellectual soul phantasms are as
   sense-perceptions: wherefore the soul never understands without a
   phantasm." On the other hand, if phantasms are presupposed, there must
   have been phantasms also from eternity: how otherwise could an eternal
   mind depend on phantasms for all its content?

   [389] "And they say well who call the soul the place of ideas, except
   that not the whole soul, but only the intellectual soul is such; nor
   are the ideas in actuality, but in potentiality" (De anima, III, iv,
   5).

   [390] "Whenever the mind intellectually considers a thing, it must
   simultaneously consider some phantasm." De anima, III, viii, 5.

   [391] This latter process, in which the phantasm is called up at the
   beck of the already informed intellect, is what Wordsworth calls
   "imagination,"--and the faculty of accomplishing this process is the
   faculty of "imagination," a faculty intellectual rather than one of
   sense, because it means intellect leading and phantasy serving.
   Therefore the Aristotelian phantasia (described in De anima, III, iii,
   9 sq.), called by St Thomas imaginatio, I have chosen to render by the
   old word phantasy. It is a faculty of the sentient nature, and
   therefore not imagination in the Wordsworthian sense. The word fancy
   has other meanings, inappropriate in this connexion.

   [392] He cannot study without phantasms, but he has the command of the
   requisite phantasms, and brings them up at his will. Thus whoever knows
   the history of the reign of Elizabeth, can impress into his service
   phantasms of the Queen and her Court. Given the knowledge, the
   phantasms will come when called for.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIV--Of the Opinion of Avicenna, who supposed Intellectual
   Forms not to be preserved in the Potential Intellect [393]

   THE above arguments (against Averroes) seem to be obviated by the
   theory of Avicenna. He says that intellectual impressions do not remain
   in the potential intellect except just so long as they are being
   actually understood. [394] And this he endeavours to prove from the
   fact that forms are actually apprehended so long as they remain in the
   faculty that apprehends them: thus in the act of perception both sense
   and intellect become identified with their objects: [395] hence it
   seems that whenever sense or intellect is united with its object, as
   having taken its form, actual apprehension, sensible or intellectual,
   occurs. But the faculties which preserve forms which not actually
   apprehended, he says, are not the faculties that apprehend those forms,
   but storehouses (thesauros) attached to the said apprehensive
   faculties. Thus phantasy is the storehouse of forms apprehended by
   sense; and memory, according to him, is the storehouse of notions
   apprehended independently of sensation, as when the sheep apprehends
   the hostility of the wolf. The capacity of these faculties for storing
   up forms not actually apprehended [396] comes from their having certain
   bodily organs in which the forms are received, such reception following
   close upon the (first) apprehension; [397] and thereby the apprehensive
   faculty, turning to these storehouses, apprehends in act. But it is
   acknowledged that the potential intellect is an apprehensive faculty,
   and has no bodily organ: hence Avicenna concludes that it is impossible
   for intellectual impressions to be preserved in the potential intellect
   except so long as it is actually understanding. Therefore, one of three
   things: either (1) these intellectual impressions must be preserved in
   some bodily organ, or faculty having a bodily organ: or (2) they must
   be self-existent intelligible forms, to which our potential intellect
   stands in the relation of a mirror to the objects mirrored: or (3)
   whenever the potential intellect understands, these intellectual
   impressions must flow into it afresh from some separate agent. The
   first of these three suppositions is impossible: because forms existing
   in faculties that use bodily organs are only potentially intelligible.
   [398] The second supposition is the opinion of Plato, which Aristotle
   rejects. Hence Avicenna concludes that, whenever we actually
   understand, there flow into our potential intellect intellectual
   impressions from the active intellect, which he assumes to be an
   intelligence subsisting apart. If any one objects against him that then
   there is no difference between a man when he first learns, and when he
   wishes to review and study again something which he has learnt before,
   he replies that to learn and con over again what we know is nothing
   else than to acquire a perfect habit of uniting ourselves with the
   (extrinsic) active intelligence, so as to receive therefrom the
   intellectual form; and therefore, before we come to reflect on and use
   our knowledge, there is in man a bare potentiality of such reception,
   but reflection on our knowledge is like potentiality reduced to act.
   And this view seems consonant with what Aristotle teaches, that memory
   is not in the intellectual but in the sensitive part of the soul. [399]
   So it seems that the preservation of intellectual impressions does not
   belong to the intellectual part of the soul. [400] But on careful
   consideration this theory will be found ultimately to differ little or
   nothing from the theory of Plato. Plato supposed forms of intellect to
   be separately existing substances, whence knowledge flowed in upon our
   souls: Avicenna supposes one separate substance, the active intellect,
   to be the source when knowledge flows in upon our souls. Now it makes
   no matter for the acquirement of knowledge whether our knowledge is
   caused by one separate substance or by several. Either way it will
   follow that our knowledge is not caused by sensible things: the
   contrary of which conclusion appears from the fact that any one wanting
   in any one sense is wanting in acquaintance with the sensible objects
   of which that sense takes cognisance.

   1. It is a novelty to say that the potential intellect, viewing the
   impressions made by singular things in the phantasy, is lit up by the
   light of the active intellect to know the universal; and that the
   action of the lower faculties, phantasy, memory, and cogitative
   faculty, fit and prepare the soul to receive the emanation of the
   active intellect. This, I say, is novel and strange doctrine: for we
   see that our soul is better disposed to receive impressions from
   intelligences subsisting apart, the further it is removed from bodily
   and sensible things: the higher is attained by receding from the lower.
   It is not therefore likely that any regarding of bodily phantasms
   should dispose our soul to receive the influence of an intelligence
   subsisting apart. Plato made a better study of the basis of his
   position: for he supposed that sensible appearances do not dispose the
   soul to receive the influence of separately subsisting forms, but
   merely rouse the intellect to consider knowledge that has been already
   caused in it by an external principle: for he supposed that from the
   beginning knowledge of all things intellectually knowable was caused in
   our souls by separately existing forms, or ideas: hence learning, he
   said, was nothing else than recollecting. [401]

   3. Intellectual knowledge is more perfect than sensory. If therefore in
   sensory knowledge there is some power of preserving apprehensions, much
   more will this be the case in intellectual knowledge.

   6. This opinion is contrary to the mind of Aristotle, who says that the
   potential intellect is "the place of ideas": which is tantamount to
   saying that it is a "storehouse" of intellectual impressions, to use
   Avicenna's own phrase.

   The arguments to the contrary are easily solved. For the potential
   intellect is perfectly actuated about intellectual impressions when it
   is actually considering them: when it is not actually considering them,
   it is not perfectly actuated about them, but is in a condition
   intermediate between potentiality and actuality. [402] As for memory,
   that is located in the sentient part of the soul, because the objects
   of memory fall under a definite time for there is no memory but of the
   past; and therefore, since there is no abstraction of its object from
   individualising conditions, memory does not belong to the intellectual
   side of our nature, which deals with universals This however does not
   bar the potential intellect's preservation of intellectual impressions,
   which are abstracted from all particular conditions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [393] Which is tantamount to supposing that there is no intellectual
   memory, but a series of recurring inspirations from without. See Summa,
   I, q. 79, art. 6.

   [394] On the duration of these impressions see Father Bödder,
   Psychologia, p. 162.

   intellectual: they are formed by that faculty which Avicenna calls
   judgement,' and St Thomas vis aestimativa. See p. 125.

   [397] Receptione propinqua apprehensioni. M. l'Abbé Ecalle in his
   French translation (Vivés, Paris, 1854) has d'une manière qui est une
   disposition prochaine à l'apprehension proprement dite. He takes the
   form to be in the storehouse of phantasy or memory before is in the
   intellectual faculty. I take it to be first seized by the apprehensive
   faculty, then consigned to the storehouse, from whence it is brought
   out again and re-apprehended at will. So I understand the words that
   follow, of revival, not of first apprehension. For a loan of this
   translation, the only translation that I have seen, I am indebted to
   the kindness of the Reverend James Bredin, late Professor of Chemistry
   at Oscott College.

   [398] Understand, -- and have never yet come to be actually understood,
   and therefore are not revivable as ideas in intelligence.'

   [399] "Memory is incidentally of what is understood, but ordinarily of
   what is primarily perceived by sense. Wherefore it is found in sundry
   other animals besides men: -- whereas, if it were one of the
   intellectual parts, not many animals would have any memory, perhaps
   even no mortal would have any" (Aristotle, De memoria, I, i, 7).

   [400] Avicenna's theory tends to make the active intellect from without
   supply the potential intellect with intelligible forms: in which case
   phantasms cease to be necessary as a previous condition for the
   acquisition of intellectual ideas; and the arguments in the last
   chapter, which suppose such necessity of phantasms, fall to the ground.
   Averroes supposed one universal intellect of all men, at once potential
   and active: he left the individual, merely as such, nothing higher than
   the sentient powers. Avicenna denied to the individual the active
   intellect, and supposed one universal active intellect for all mankind.
   The potential intellect is reduced by his theory to a momentary
   impressibility. Avicenna (Abu Ali Ibn-Sina), a native of Persia, lived
   A.D. 980-1037. Like Averroes, he was physician and philosopher. I quote
   from The Psychology of Ibn-Sina translated by J. M. Macdonald, M.A.,
   Beyruth 1884. Four faculties are distinguished by Avicenna all of them
   belonging to the sentient part of the soul: none of them to the
   intelligent part. They are called "conceptual faculty," "imagination,"
   "judgement," "memory." I. Conceptual faculty. "There is nothing in the
   conceptual faculty besides the true forms derived from sense" (p. 28).
   This seems to correspond to what St Thomas calls virtus apprehensiva
   sensibilis, the faculty of sense perception. II. Imagination. "In
   animals there is a faculty which compounds whatever forms have been
   collected in the common sense, and distinguishes between them, and
   differentiates them, without the disappearance of the forms from common
   sense; and this faculty is named imagination" (p. 28). "The imaginative
   faculty performs its actions without perceiving that things are
   according to its imaginings" (p. 28). "The imaginative faculty may
   imagine things other than that which the judgement considers desirable"
   (p. 29). If we might assume that this imagination' is purely
   reproductive of sense phantasms, it would answer to the phantasy'
   (imaginatio) which St Thomas ascribes to Avicenna. III. Judgement.
   "Then in animals there is a faculty which decides decisively upon a
   thing, whether it is this or not. And by it the animal flies from that
   which is to be guarded against, and seeks that which is desirable. This
   faculty is called the judging and the supposing faculty" (pp. 28, 29).
   It is not difficult to recognise here that highest faculty of animal
   nature, called in other animals vis aestimativa, in man vis cogitativa
   (Chap. [252]LX). IV. Memory. "Then there is in animals a faculty which
   preserves the meaning of that which the faculties have conceived, e.g.,
   that the wolf is an enemy." It is a store-house of judgements rather
   than of sense perceptions: for "the senses do not perceive the enmity
   of the wolf; or the love of the child": only the vis aestimativa
   perceives that, "then it treasures them up in this faculty." It is not
   a store-house of fancies, as the "imagination" is: for "this faculty
   does not picture anything which the judgement does not approve. This
   faculty does not declare anything to be true, but preserves what
   something else declares to be true. And this faculty is called the
   preserving and remembering faculty" (p. 29). All this answers exactly
   to the account of "memory" which St Thomas attributes to Avicenna. We
   come now to the main argument of this chapter, which is Avicenna's
   belief in the active intellect' as a separate intelligence, working
   causatively upon the mind of man, and generating therein universal
   concepts, such concepts not being stored in the human mind for future
   use, but directly created afresh for every recurrence of them, by the
   action of this extrinsic intelligence. Against this doctrine of
   Avicenna, Averroes writes explicitly (De animae beatitudine, cap. iii,
   p. 151): Intellectus agens non tantum est causa in intellectu materiali
   [sc. possibili] per viam efficientis et motoris, sed per viam ultimae
   perfectionis, hoc est, per viam formae et finis. (See [253]note, p.
   135.) Averroes united the active and the potential intellect, and made
   both eternal: Avicenna and Alexander made the active intellect alone
   eternal. Avicenna's theory of the universal active intellect is thus
   given in his own quaint words. -- " The proving of the existence of an
   intellectual essence, distinct from bodies, standing in the relation of
   light to sight, and in the place of a fountain: and the proving that,
   when human souls separate from bodies, they unite with this essence"
   (Title of Section x, p. 40). Speaking of the belief in mathematical
   axioms, he says: "It must be either by the use of sense and experiment,
   or by divine continuous overflow, . . . . overflow continuous with the
   rational soul, and the rational soul continuous with it. . . . This
   overflow, which is continuous with the soul, is an intellectual
   essence, not a body, not in a body: it stands by itself, holding the
   relation to the intellectual soul of light to sight" (pp. 40, 41). "The
   soul remains after death ever immortal, joined on to this noble
   essence, which is universal intelligence" (p. 42). In Avicenna, as in
   Averroes, one recognises in the doctrine of ittisâl however
   misdirected, that craving for some connexion of man's intelligence with
   a spirit above his own, which a banal materialism or positivism labours
   to extirpate, making man highest of beings and (perforce)
   self-sufficient. That craving is the root of mysticism; and in the
   doctrine of the Incarnation, with its corollaries of grace and
   sacraments, it has become the animating principle of Christianity.

   [401]

   Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:

   The soul that rises with us, our life's star,

   Hath had elsewhere its setting

   And cometh from afar:

   But trailing clouds of glory do we come

   From God, who is our home.
   (Wordsworth's Ode, Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of
   Early Childhood.)

   [402] So St Thomas rightly explains, esti men homoios kai tote dunamei
   pos, ou men homoios kai prin mathein e eurein (De anima, III, iv, 7).
   When you know a thing, though you are not thinking of it, your mind is
   not quite so much in potentiality over that thing as when you have it
   still to learn.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXV--Confutation of the Arguments which seem to prove the
   Unity of the Potential Intellect

   ARG. 1. Apparently, every form that is specifically one and numerically
   multiplied, is individualised by its matter: for things specifically
   one and numerically many agree in form, and are distinguished according
   to matter. If then the potential intellect is multiplied according to
   number in different men, while it remains one in species, it must be
   multiplied in this and that man by matter, -- by the matter which is
   that man's body the form of which it is supposed to be. But every form,
   individualised by matter which it actuates, is a material form: for the
   being of everything must depend on that on which its individuation
   depends: for as general constituents are of the essence of the species,
   so individualising constituents are of the essence of this individual.
   It follows therefore that the potential intellect is a material form,
   and consequently that it does not receive any thing, nor do anything,
   except through a bodily organ: which is contrary to the nature of the
   potential intellect.

   Reply. We confess that the potential intellect is specifically one in
   different men, and many according to number, -- waiving the point that
   the constituents of man are not put into genus and species for what
   they are in themselves, but for what they are as constituents of the
   whole. Still it does not follow that the potential intellect is a
   material form, dependent for its being on the body. For as it is
   specifically proper to the human soul to be united to a certain species
   of body, so any individual soul differs from any other individual soul,
   in number only, inasmuch as it is referable to numerically another
   body. Thus then human souls, -- and consequently the potential
   intellect, which is a faculty of the human soul, -- are individualised
   according to bodies, not that the individuation is caused by the
   bodies. [403]

   Arg. 2. If the potential intellect were different in this man and that,
   the impression understood would have to be numerically different in
   this man, while remaining one in species: for since the proper subject
   of impressions actually understood is the potential intellect, when
   that intellect is multiplied there must be a corresponding
   multiplication of intellectual impressions according to the number of
   different individuals. But the only impressions or forms which are the
   same in species and different in number, are individual forms, which
   cannot be intellectual forms, because objects of intellect are
   universal, not particular. It is impossible therefore for the potential
   intellect to be multiplied in different individual men. [404]

   Reply. This second argument fails from neglecting to distinguish
   between that whereby (quo) we understand, and that which (quod) we
   understand. The impression received in the potential intellect is not
   to be taken for that which is understood. For as all arts and sciences
   have for their object-matter things which are understood, it would
   follow that the subject-matter of all sciences was impressions on the
   potential intellect: which is manifestly false, for no science has
   anything to say to such mental impressions except psychology and
   metaphysics: though it is true that through those mental impressions
   there is known the whole content of all the sciences. [405] Therefore,
   in the process of understanding, the intellectual impression received
   in the potential intellect is that whereby we understand, as the
   impression of colour in the eye is not that which is seen, but that
   whereby we see. On the other hand, that which is understood is the
   nature (ratio) of things existing outside the soul, as also it is
   things existing outside the soul that are seen with the bodily sight:
   for to this end were arts and sciences invented, that things might be
   known in their natures (naturis).

   Still it does not follow that, if sciences are of universal truths,
   universals should subsist by themselves outside the soul, as Plato
   supposed. For though for the truth of knowledge it is necessary that
   the knowledge should answer to the thing, still it is not necessary
   that the mode of the knowledge and the mode of the thing should be the
   same: for properties that are united in the thing are sometimes known
   separately. Thus one and the same thing is white and sweet: still sight
   takes cognisance only of the whiteness, and taste only of the
   sweetness. Thus again intellect understands a line drawn in sensible
   matter apart from that sensible matter, though it might understand it
   also along with the sensible matter. [406] This difference arises
   according to the diversity of intellectual impressions received in the
   intellect, which some times are the likeness of quantity only,
   sometimes of a sensible quantitative substance. In like manner also,
   though the nature of genus and species never exists except in concrete
   individuals, still the intellect understands the nature of genus and
   species without understanding the individualising elements; and this is
   the meaning of understanding universals. And so these two positions are
   reconciled, that universals have no subsistence outside the soul; and
   yet that the intellect, understanding universals, understands things
   which are outside the soul.

   The fact of the intellect understanding the nature of genus and species
   stripped of its individualising elements, arises from the condition of
   the intellectual impression received in understanding, which impression
   is rendered immaterial [407] by the active intellect, inasmuch as it is
   abstracted from matter and materialising conditions whereby a thing is
   individualised. And therefore the sentient faculties can take no
   cognisance of universals, since they cannot receive an immaterial form,
   seeing that they receive always in a bodily organ.

   It is not therefore necessary that the intellectual impression of this
   and that intelligence should be numerically one: for it would follow
   thereupon that the act of understanding in them both was also
   numerically one, since activity follows form, which is the principle of
   species: but it is necessary, to the end that one object should be
   understood by both minds, that there should be a like impression of one
   and the same object in them both. And this is possible enough, although
   the intellectual impressions differ in number: for there is no
   difficulty in having different images of one thing; hence the
   contingency of one than being seen by several persons. [408] There is
   nothing inconsistent then with the universalising knowledge of the
   understanding in their being different intellectual impressions in
   different minds. Nor need it ensue, because these intellectual
   impressions are many in number and the same in species, that they are
   not actual but only potential terms of understanding, as is the case
   with other individual things. Mere individuality is not inconsistent
   with intelligibility: for we must admit the potential and active
   intellects themselves, if we may suppose the two to subsist apart,
   united to no body, but subsistent by themselves, to be individual
   beings and still intelligible. What is inconsistent with
   intelligibility is materiality: as is shown by this consideration, that
   for the forms of material things to become actually intelligible,
   abstraction has to be made from the particular matter in which they are
   lodged; [409] and therefore in cases in which individuation is due to
   particular matter involving particular dimensions, [410] the things so
   individualised are not actually intelligible. But where individuation
   is not due to matter, such individual things may without difficulty be
   actually intelligible. Now intellectual impressions, like all other
   forms, are individualised by their subject, which is the potential
   intellect; and since the potential intellect is not material, it does
   not stand in the way of the actual intelligibility of the impressions
   individualised by it.

   But though we have said that the intellectual impression, received in
   the potential intellect, is not that which is understood, but that
   whereby we understand, still it remains true that by reflection the
   intellect understands itself and its own intellectual act and the
   impression whereby it understands. Its own intellectual act it
   understands in two ways, -- in one way, in particular, for it
   understands that it is now understanding; in another way, in general,
   inasmuch as it reasons about the said act. And likewise it understands
   intellect and the impression in intellect in two ways, -- by remarking
   that itself is and has an intellectual impression, which is particular
   knowledge; and by studying its own nature and the nature of the
   intellectual impression, which is knowledge of the universal. According
   to this latter way we treat of intellect and of the intelligible in
   science.

   Arg. 3. The master transfuses the knowledge which he has into the
   scholar. Either then the knowledge transfused is the same in number, or
   different in number, though the same in species. The latter alternative
   seems impossible: because it supposes the master to cause his own
   knowledge in the scholar in the same way that an agent causes its own
   form in another being, by generating a nature specifically like its
   own; which seems proper to material agents. It must be then that
   numerically the same knowledge is caused in the scholar that was in the
   master; which would be impossible, were there not one potential
   intellect of them both.

   Reply. The saying that the knowledge in master and scholar is
   numerically one, is partly true and partly not: it is numerically one
   in point of the thing known, but not in point of the intellectual
   impressions whereby the thing is known, nor in point of the habit of
   knowledge itself. It is to be observed however that, as Aristotle
   (Metaph. VII, ix) teaches, there are arts in whose subject matter there
   is not any principle active in producing the effect of the art, as is
   clear in the building art: for in wood and stones there is no active
   power moving to the erection of a house, but only a passive aptitude.
   But there is an art in whose subject matter there is an active
   principle moving in the direction of the effect of the art, as is clear
   in the healing art: for in the sick subject there is an active
   principle tending to health. And therefore the effect of the former
   kind of art is never produced by nature, but always by art, as every
   house is a work of art: [411] but the effect of the latter kind is
   produced as well by art as by nature without art: for many are healed
   by the operation of nature without the art of medicine. In these things
   that can be done both by art and nature, art imitates nature: thus if
   one is sick of a chill, nature heals him by warming him: hence the
   physician also, if he is to cure him, heals him by warming. Similar is
   the case with the art of teaching: for in the pupil there is an active
   principle making for knowledge, namely, the understanding, and those
   primary axioms which are naturally understood; and therefore knowledge
   is acquired in two ways, -- without teaching, by a man's own finding
   out, and again by teaching. The teacher therefore begins to teach in
   the same way that the discoverer begins to find out, by offering for
   the consideration of the scholar elements of knowledge already
   possessed by him: because all education and all knowledge starts from
   pre-existing knowledge, drawing conclusions from elements already in
   the mind, and proposing sensible examples whereby there may be formed
   in the scholar's soul those impressions of phantasy which are necessary
   or intelligence. [412] And because the working of the teacher from
   without would effect nothing, unless borne out by an internal principle
   of knowledge, which is within us by the gift of God, so it is said
   among theologians that man teaches by rendering the service of
   ministry, but God by working within: so too the physician is called
   nature's minister in healing.

   A final remark. Since the Commentator makes the passive intellect the
   residence of habits of knowledge (Chap. [254]LX), the unity of the
   potential intellect helps not at all to the numerical unity of
   knowledge in master and scholar: for certainly the passive intellect is
   not the same in different men, since it is an organic faculty. Hence,
   on his own showing, this argument does not serve his purpose.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [403] Cf. Bödder, Psychologia Rationalis, pp. 381-383. No two human
   bodies are perfectly alike, and no two individual men: but it remains a
   question for the curious to consider whether the individual
   peculiarities that distinguish man from man are due to bodily
   conformation merely, or whether there are soul-peculiarities also, a
   peculiar soul being from the first created and infused into a
   correspondingly peculiar body. St Thomas seems to favour the second
   alternative. See Chap. LXXXI, reply to arg. 2, with note.

   [404] The argument is this, and it has its weight in modern
   speculation: The intellect that grasps universals, should itself be
   universal.'

   [407] Immaterial' means stripped of individual particularities.' It
   does not quite mean abstract': for you might immaterialise,' or
   universalise,' let us say, the whole of Nelson's monument, so far as
   contour and structure go. It is not true, as associationists have
   taught, that the sight of a house ordinarily brings up to my
   consciousness impressions of similar buildings which I have seen: all
   that I am conscious of is the image of this house now before me: but in
   considering it as a house I consider it apart from the thisness; and so
   doing I am said to purify it of material,' i.e., particular
   conditions.' This explains what St Thomas says presently, "what is
   inconsistent with intelligibility, is materiality." You cannot
   understand house' in such a way that your intelligence is limited to
   this house now before you, so that, if you happened to encounter
   another, you would not know what it was. To understand is to take for a
   type.

   [409] Thus uneducated people, bound up in their domestic surroundings,
   often show inability to understand, because they cannot conceive of
   qualities apart from the familiar objects in which they see them: e.g.,
   weight' to them means their heaviest piece of furniture, learning' is
   their parson, etc. This is amusingly illustrated in Plato's Hippias
   Major.

   the principle of individuation is one of the most intricate in the
   scholastic system, and cannot be entered upon here. Things not actually
   intelligible' nevertheless are potentially intelligible: i.e., they
   lend themselves to a process of de- particularising under the active
   intellect; and so as universals become actual terms of intellect. This
   is explained at length in Chap. [256]LXXVII.

   manufacturing instances which is called experiment. This passage would
   make a good text for a work on paedagogy. The educator, like the
   physician, should wait upon nature, and call forth the native powers of
   subject mind and subject body; not expect to do all things by
   manipulation, like one kneading clay into an image.

   CHAPTER LXXVI--That the Active Intellect is not a separately Subsisting
   Intelligence, but a Faculty of the Soul

   WE may further conclude that neither is the active intellect one in all
   men, as Alexander and Avicenna suppose, though they do not suppose the
   potential intellect to be one in all men. [413]

   4. Plato supposed knowledge in us to be caused by Ideas, which he took
   to subsist apart by themselves. But clearly the first principle on
   which our knowledge depends is the active intellect. If therefore the
   active intellect is something subsisting apart by itself, the
   difference will be none, or but slight, between this opinion and that
   of Plato, which the Philosopher rejects.

   5. If the active intellect is an intelligence subsisting apart, its
   action upon us will either be continual and uninterrupted, or at least
   we must say that it is not continued or broken off at our pleasure. Now
   its action is to make the impressions on our phantasy actual terms of
   intelligence. Either therefore it will do this always or not always. If
   not always, still it will not do it at our discretion. Either therefore
   we must be always in the act of understanding, or it will not be in our
   power actually to understand when we wish. [414]

   But it may be said that the active intellect, so far as with it lies,
   is always in action, but that the impressions in our phantasy are not
   always becoming actual terms of intelligence, but only when they are
   disposed thereto; and they are disposed thereto by the act of the
   cogitative faculty, the use of which is in our power; and therefore
   actually to understand is in our power; and this is why not all men
   understand the things whereof they have the impressions in their
   phantasy, because not all have at command a suitable act of the
   cogitative faculty, but only those who are accustomed and trained
   thereto. [415] But this answer does not appear to be altogether
   sufficient. That the impressions in phantasy are marshalled by the
   cogitative faculty to the end that they may become actual terms of
   understanding and move the potential intellect, does not seem a
   sufficient account, if it be coupled with the supposition of the
   potential intellect being a separately subsistent intelligence. This
   seems to go with the theory of those who say that inferior agents
   supply only predispositions to final perfection, but that final
   perfection is the work of an extrinsic agency: which is contrary to the
   mind of Aristotle: [416] for the human soul does not appear to be worse
   off for understanding than inferior natures are for their own severally
   proper activities.

   9. In the nature of every cause there is contained a principle
   sufficient for the natural operation of that cause. If the operation
   consists in action, there is at hand an active principle, as we see in
   the powers of the vegetative soul in plants. If the operation consists
   in receiving impressions, there is at hand a passive principle, as we
   see in the sentient powers of animals. But man is the most perfect of
   all inferior causes; and his proper and natural operation is to
   understand, an operation which is not accomplished without a certain
   receiving of impressions, inasmuch as every understanding is determined
   by its object; nor again without action, inasmuch as the intellect
   makes potential into actual terms of understanding. There must
   therefore be in the nature of man a proper principle of both
   operations, to wit, both an active and a potential intellect, and
   neither of them must be separate in being (or physically distinct),
   from the soul of man.

   10. If the active intellect is an intelligence subsisting apart, it is
   clearly above the nature of man. But any activity which a man exercises
   by mere virtue of a supernatural cause is a supernatural activity, as
   the working of miracles, prophecy, and the like effects, which are
   wrought by men in virtue of a divine endowment. Since then man cannot
   understand except by means of the active intellect, it follows,
   supposing that intellect a separately subsistent being, that to
   understand is not an operation proper and natural to man; and thus man
   cannot be defined as intellectual or rational.

   11. No agent works except by some power which is formally in the agent
   as a constituent of its being. But the working both of potential and of
   active intellect is proper to man: for man produces ideas by
   abstraction from phantasms, and receives in his mind those ideas;
   operations which it would never occur to us to think of, did we not
   experience them in ourselves. The principles therefore to which these
   operations are attributable, namely, the potential and the active
   intellect, must be faculties formally existing in us.

   12. A being that cannot proceed to its own proper business without
   being moved thereto by an external principle, is rather driven to act
   than acts of itself. This is the case with irrational creatures. Sense,
   moved by an exterior sensible object, makes an impression on the
   phantasy; and so in order the impression proceeds through all the
   faculties till it reaches those which move the rest. Now the proper
   business of man is to understand; and the prime mover in understanding
   is the active intellect, which makes intellectual impressions whereby
   the potential intellect is impressed; which potential intellect, when
   actualised, moves the will. If then the active intellect has a separate
   subsistence outside man, the whole of man's activity depends on an
   extrinsic principle. Man then will not be his own leader, but will be
   led by another; and thus will not be master of his own acts, nor
   deserve praise nor blame; and the whole of moral science and political
   society will perish: an awkward conclusion. Therefore the active
   intellect has no subsistence apart from man.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [413] The reason being that Alexander did not recognise the potential
   intellect for a spiritual faculty at all; while to Avicenna it was like
   the fit boy' in Pickwick, always dropping off to sleep, remembering
   nothing, and needing continual excitation from without to make it
   understand. See notes pp. 122, 123, 129, 132, 135, 137, 142, 143. It
   must be remembered that Averroes also makes the active intellect one
   and the same for all men.

   [414] If Avicenna had said that the extrinsic active intellect came in
   only when there was question of our mastering difficult and subtle
   truths, this argument would not hold against him. It holds so far as he
   supposes the agency of this intellect indispensable to our
   understanding things even the simplest and most obvious. Cf. Ueberweg,
   History of Philosophy, I, p. 413: "Avicenna distinguishes a twofold
   development of our potential understanding into actuality, the one
   common, depending on instruction, the other rare, and dependent on
   immediate divine illumination."

   [415] One may recognise the hand of Averroes in this rejoinder. For the
   cogitative faculty see Chap. LX. The rest of this chapter (cf. note, p.
   99) is rather rambling and confused, giving the impression of a
   composition corrected and supplemented and pieced together, and never
   finally revised as a whole. We miss the trim neatness and dainty order
   of the Summa Theologica. I have therefore preserved only essentials,
   and omitted what seemed less relevant.

   [416] St Thomas refers to Metaph. VII, viii (now VI vii), apparently to
   such words as these: katholou de kai ex hou phusis, kai kath' ho
   phusis, to de gignomenon echei phusin, hoion phuton e zoon
   (universally, the source whence a thing proceeds is nature, and the
   process is nature, and the product is natural as a plant or an animal).
   This means that natural,' i.e. organic,' beings attain to a certain
   completeness, proper to themselves, by a development of their own
   powers they are self-contained and self-sufficient for their own
   purposes: they draw indeed their supplies from without, but they adapt
   what they receive to their own purposes by their own activity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVII--That it is not impossible for the Potential and the
   Active Intellect to be united in the one Substance of the Soul

   SOME one perhaps may think it impossible for one and the same
   substance, that of our soul, to be in potentiality to receive all
   intellectual impressions (which is the function of the potential
   intellect), and to actualise those impressions (which is the function
   of the active intellect); since nothing acts as it is in potentiality
   to receive, but only as it is in actual readiness to act. But, looking
   at the matter rightly, no inconvenience or difficulty will be found in
   this view of the union of the active and potential intellect in the one
   substance of the soul. For a thing may well be in potentiality in one
   respect and in actuality in another; and this we find to be the
   condition of the intellectual soul in its relation to phantasms, or
   impressions in phantasy. For the intellectual soul has something in
   actuality, to which the phantasm is in potentiality; [417] and on the
   other hand the intellectual soul potentiality that which is actually
   found in the phantasms. [418] For the substance of the human soul has
   the attribute of immateriality: but it is not thereby assimilated to
   this or that definite thing; and yet such assimilation is requisite for
   our soul to know this or that thing definitely, since all cognition
   takes place by some likeness of the object known being stamped on the
   knowing mind. [419] Thus then the intellectual soul remains in
   potentiality, open to the reception of definite impressions in the
   likeness of things that come within our observation and knowledge,
   which are the natures of sensible things. These definite natures of
   sensible things are represented to us by phantasms, which however have
   not yet reached the stage of being objects of intellect, seeing that
   they are likenesses of sensible things under material conditions, which
   are individualising properties, -- and besides they are in bodily
   organs. They are therefore not actual objects of understanding; and yet
   since in the case of this man [or other sensible object], whose
   likeness is represented by phantasms, it is possible to fix upon a
   universal nature stripped of all individualising conditions, these
   phantasms are potentially intelligible. Thus then they have a
   potentially intelligible being, but an actually definite likeness to
   things, whereas in the intellectual soul, as we saw, the situation was
   the other way about. There is then in the intellectual soul a power
   exercising its activity upon phantasms, making them actual objects of
   understanding; and this power of the soul is called the active
   intellect. There is also in the soul a power that is potentially open
   to definite impressions of sensible things; and this power is the
   potential intellect.

   But the intellectual soul does not lie open to receive impressions of
   the likenesses of things that are in phantasms in the way that the
   likeness exists in the phantasm, but according as those likenesses are
   raised to a higher stage, by being abstracted from individualising
   material conditions and rendered actual objects, or terms, of
   understanding. And therefore the action of the active intellect upon
   the phantasms precedes their being received into the potential
   intellect; and thus the prime agency is not attributable to the
   phantasms, but to the active intellect.

   There are some animals that see better by night than by day, because
   they have weak eyes, which are stimulated by a little light, but
   dazzled by much. And the case is similar with our understanding, which
   is "to the clearest truths as the bat's eye to the sun" (Aristotle,
   Metaph. I, Appendix): hence the little intellectual light that is
   connatural to us is sufficient for us to understand with. But that the
   intellectual light connatural to our soul is sufficient to produce the
   action of the active intellect, will be clear to any one who considers
   the necessity for positing such an intellect. Our soul is found to be
   in potentiality to intelligible objects as sense to sensible objects:
   for as we are not always having sensations, so we are not always
   understanding. [420] These intelligible objects Plato assumed to exist
   by themselves, calling them Ideas': hence it was not necessary for him
   to posit any active intellect' rendering objects intelligible. [421]
   But if this Platonic position were true, the absolutely better objects
   of intelligence should be better also relatively to us, and be better
   understood by us, which is manifestly not the case: for things are more
   intelligible to us which are nigher to sense, though in themselves they
   are less excellent objects of understanding. Hence Aristotle was moved
   to lay down the doctrine, that the things which are intelligible to us
   are not any self-existent objects of understanding, but are gathered
   from objects of sense. Hence he had to posit some faculty to do this
   work of making terms of understanding: that faculty is the active
   intellect. The active intellect therefore is posited to make terms of
   understanding proportionate to our capacity. Such work does not
   transcend the measure of intellectual light connatural to us. Hence
   there is no difficulty in attributing the action of the active
   intellect to the native light of our soul, especially as Aristotle
   compares the active intellect to light (De anima, III, v, 2).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [417] This something' is immateriality.' The intellectual soul is an
   actually immaterial being: while the phantasm is open, or in
   potentiality, to being dematerialised, or stripped of its material and
   individualising conditions by the action of the active intellect.

   [418] That which is actually found in the phantasms' is definite
   likenesses of the natures of sensible things.' The objection may be
   raised, than when these likenesses are dematerialised,' all likeness to
   sensible material things is lost. The answer, I take it, is that
   dematerialising' means only universalising'. I have a universal idea of
   a rainbow without blinding my mind's eye to its colours.

   [419] In other words, -- for subject to know object, object must make
   upon subject some impression corresponding to and indicative of what
   object really is.

   [420] Sub-consciousness is not allowed for here. Is enough allowed for
   in the scholastic philosopy generally?

   [421] This valuable remark is borrowed, without acknowledgement, from
   Averroes on De anima, III: (p. 161, ed. Venet. 1574). Whoever first
   made it, must commend itself to every Platonist and every Aristotelian.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVIII--That it was not the opinion of Aristotle that the
   Active Intellect is a separately Subsistent Intelligence, but rather
   that it is a part of the Soul [422]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [422] This chapter is a running commentary on De anima, III, v, and may
   be more profitably presented by a description of its contents than by a
   translation. 1. On ananke kai en te psuche huparchein tautas tas
   diaphoras (these differences must also be in the soul), St Thomas
   points out that the differences in question, to wit, the potential and
   the active intellect, are both said to be "in the soul," which excludes
   either of them from being a faculty extrinsic to the soul. 2. On en
   hapase te phusei, which in his translation appears as in omni natura,
   and which he takes to mean, not as the Greek means, "in all nature,"
   but in every natural substance," he argues that both the hule, or
   potential intellect, and the aition kai poietikon, or active intellect,
   must be in the natural substance of the soul. 3. Upon the words, used
   of the active intellect, that it is hos hexis tis, hoion to phos (as a
   habit, like light), he says that as a habit does not exist by itself,
   so neither can, on this showing, the active intellect. He adds that
   habit' here does not mean habitual knowledge,' as when we speak of a
   habit (i.e., habitual knowledge) of first principles,' but a positive
   endowment, actual and formal, as opposed to privation and potentiality.
   4. Of the four epithets bestowed on the active intellect, choristos,
   amiges, apathes, te ousia on energeia (separate, unmingled, impassible,
   by essence being in act), he observes that the first and second have
   already been applied to the potential intellect: see Chap. IV, n. 6, ho
   de choristos: IV, 3, amige einai . . . . oude memichthai to somati. The
   third, he says, has been applied to the potential intellect with a
   distinction (he refers to iv, 5, 6): the potential intellect is
   impassible, as not being acted on by matter, having no bodily organ to
   receive direct impressions from material things: but it receives
   impressions from the active intellect. The fourth, he says, has been
   flatly denied of the potential intellect, which is said, iv, 12, to be
   dunamei pos ta noeta, all' entelecheia ouden prin an noe (potentially
   identified with the intelligible forms, but actually nothing before it
   understands). He concludes that the word choristos is only applied to
   the active intellect in the same sense in which it has already been
   referred to the potential intellect, iv, 9, to men gar aisthetikon ouk
   aneu somatos, ho de choristos (the faculty of sense is not without
   body, but this is separate). He identifies choristos with aneu somatos,
   as meaning operative without bodily organ.' 5. On to d' auto estin he
   kat' energeian episteme to pragmati (actual knowledge is identical with
   its object), -- which means that, inasmuch as objects of knowledge
   become present by representation in the mind, the mind in knowing
   anything knows itself, -- St Thomas blames Averroes for taking this to
   be true only of the active intellect: he cites iv, 13, to auto esti to
   nooun kai to nooumenon, he gar theoretike episteme kai to houtos
   episteton to auto estin (knower and known are identical, for
   speculative science and its object are one), where he says that
   Aristotle speaks, not of the active, but of the potential intellect. In
   the words he kat' energeian episteme (scientia in acta) St Thomas
   discovers a tertium quid, which is neither potential nor active
   intellect, but a combination of the two: he calls it intellectus in
   actu, the intellect as actually understanding,' the concrete mind at
   work. 6. On he de kata dunamin chrono protera en to heni, holos oude
   chrono (potential knowledge is prior in time to actual knowledge in the
   individual, but all the world over it is not prior even in time), he is
   misled by his Latin translation, qui vero secundum potentiam, as though
   the Greek had been ho de kata dunamin nous. He takes it for a question
   of priority in time between the potential intellect and the concrete,
   actually thinking mind (intellectus in actu). The error is not serious.
   7. Coming to ouch hote men noei, hote de ou noei (it does not at one
   time think, and at another time not think), he says that this is spoken
   of the actually thinking mind, to mark it off from the potential
   intellect. His conclusion is: "The mind comes to be actually thinking
   by being identified with the objects of thought: hence it is not open
   to it at times to think and at times not to think." This may mean -- as
   undoubtedly it is Aristotle's meaning: There must be thinking so long
   as there are things: but there are always things: therefore there is
   always thinking.' Then the question comes: Yes, but whose thinking?' --
   to which St Thomas gives no answer. To interpret with Silvester Maurus,
   so long as the mind is actually thinking, it thinks unceasingly,' is to
   father no very profound truth upon the Philosopher. 8. Upon choristheis
   de esti monon touth' hoper esti (when separated, it is only that which
   it is) St. Thomas is altogether thrown out by his Latin, separatum hoc
   solum quod vere est (that alone is separate which truly is), as though
   choristheis (separatum) were the predicate. He takes the meaning to be
   that the actually thinking mind in man, inclusive at once of potential
   and active intellect, is separate' in the sense of not operating
   through a bodily organ. On touto monon athanaton kai aidion (this alone
   is mortal and everlasting), all his comment is "as being independent of
   the body, since it is separate." On the last sentence, ou mnemoneuomen
   de k.t.l., he makes no comment whatever in this place, but see Chap.
   [257]LXXX, arg. 5. No one can seriously contend that, working under
   such disadvantages, St Thomas has succeeded in adequately interpreting
   this, one of the most difficult chapters in Aristotle. I recommend the
   reader to study it in G. Rodier's masterly work, Aristote, Traité de
   l'âme, 2 vols., text, translation, and notes (Leroux, Paris, 1900). I
   offer these few final remarks. (a) From aei gar to oude chrono, is a
   parenthesis; as Philoponus says, touto en meso erripsen. The meaning
   is, as St Thomas well indicates, that though in the individual mind
   knowledge is first potential, then actual, yet somewhere in the range
   of being there is an actual knowledge prior to all potential. This is
   only carrying out the Aristotelian principle that ultimately the actual
   always precedes the potential: esti gar ex enelecheia ontos panta ta
   gignomena (De anima, III, vii, 1), a principle well put forward by
   Rodier, vol. II, p. 490. What actually thinking mind precedes all
   potentiality of thought, Aristotle does not tell us in this chapter.
   (b) The words, all' ouch hote men noei, ote de ou noei, are to be taken
   in close connexion with te ousia on energeia, the whole meaning: this
   mind, ever essentially active, thinks continually, and not merely at
   intervals.' Whether this refers to the mind of the race, Aristotle
   agreeing with Averroes that mankind have existed from eternity, or
   whether it points to some superhuman intelligence, is a question which
   will be debated as long as Aristotle continues to be read. (c)
   choristheis d'esti monon touth' hoper esti, "when separated from the
   body [in death, as Rodier rightly explains], it is its proper self, and
   nothing else," -- pure nous, apart from phantasy and sensation and
   bodily organism; and this pure nous is, in some undefined way,
   "immortal and everlasting." In esti touth' hoper esti I think we may
   further recognise some slight influence of a familiar idiom, by which a
   Greek says that a thing is what it is,' when he is either unable or
   reluctant to enter into further detail. (d) The concluding words mean:
   We have no memory [after death, of the transactions of our earthly
   existence], because though the nous is unaffected by death (apathes),
   yet the passive intellect [ho pathetikos nous, the cogitative faculty
   with the phantasy, see St Thomas, Chap. [258]LX], is perishable [and
   perishes with the body], and without this there is no understanding [of
   things learnt in life with its concurrence, -- cf. De anima, III, viii,
   5, hotan theore ananke hama phantasma ti theorein].' This sense seems
   definitely fixed as the mind of Aristotle by a previous passage, De
   anima, I, iv, 12-15: -- "The nous within us seems to be a subsistent
   being (ousia) and imperishable. If it could be impaired, it would be
   impaired most in the feebleness of old age: whereas, we may say, the
   case is the same with intellect as with sense: for if the old man got a
   young man's eye, he would see as the young man does. So old age is not
   an affection of the soul, but an affection of what contains the soul,
   as in drunken bouts and illnesses. Thus the intellectual and
   speculative faculty decays when something else in the man decays, but
   of itself it is imperishable (apathes). But the exercise of the
   cogitative faculty (to dianoeisthai), and the passions of love and
   hate, are not functions of nous, but of this individual organism that
   contains nous, as containing it. Therefore when this organism perishes
   in death, the soul neither remembers nor loves: for memory and [the
   passion of] love were not affections of the intelligent soul, but of
   the compound organism wherein soul and matter met, which has not
   perished: but nous perhaps is something more divine and imperishable
   (ho de nous isos theioteron ti kai apathes estin).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIX--That the Human Soul does not Perish with the Body

   EVERY intelligent subsisting being is imperishable (Chap. [259]LV): but
   the human soul is an intelligent subsisting being.

   2. Nothing is destroyed by that which makes its perfection. But the
   perfection of the human soul consists in a certain withdrawal from the
   body: for the soul is perfected by knowledge and virtue: now in
   knowledge there is greater perfection, the more the view is fixed on
   high generalisations, or immaterial things; while the perfection of
   virtue consists in a man's not following his bodily passions, but
   tempering and restraining them by reason. -- Nor is it of any avail to
   reply that the perfection of the soul consists in its separation from
   the body in point of activity, but to be separated from the body in
   point of being is its destruction. For the activity of a thing shows
   its substance and being, and follows upon its nature: thus the activity
   of a thing can only be perfected inasmuch as its substance is
   perfected. If then the soul is perfected in activity by relinquishing
   the body and bodily things, its substance cannot fail in being by
   separation from the body.

   4. A natural craving cannot be in vain. [423] But man naturally craves
   after permanent continuance: as is shown by this, that while existence
   is desired by all, man by his understanding apprehends existence, not
   in the present moment only, as dumb animals do, but existence
   absolutely. Therefore man attains to permanence on the part of his
   soul, whereby he apprehends existence absolute and for all time.

   6. Intelligible being is more permanent than sensible being. But the
   substratum of material bodies (materia prima) is indestructible, much
   more the potential intellect, the recipient of intelligible forms.
   Therefore the human soul, of which the potential intellect is a part,
   is indestructible. [424]

   8. No form is destroyed except either by the action of the contrary, or
   by the destruction of the subject wherein it resides, or by the failure
   of its cause. Thus heat is destroyed by the action of cold: by the
   destruction of the eye the power of sight is destroyed; and the light
   of the atmosphere fails by the failure of the sun's presence, which was
   its cause. But the human soul cannot be destroyed by the action of its
   contrary, for it has no contrary, since by the potential intellect the
   soul is cognitive and receptive of all contraries. Nor again by the
   destruction of the subject in which it resides, for it has been shown
   above that the human soul is a form not dependent on the body for its
   being. [425] Nor lastly by the failure of its cause, for it can have no
   cause but one which is eternal, as will be shown (Chap. [260]LXXXVII).
   In no way therefore can the human soul be destroyed.

   9. If the human soul is destroyed by the destruction of the body, it
   must be weakened by the weakening of the body. But the fact is that if
   any faculty of the soul is weakened by the body being weakened, that is
   only incidentally, inasmuch as that faculty of the soul stands in need
   of a bodily organ, as the sight is weakened by the weakening of the
   organ of sight, but only incidentally, as may be shown by this
   consideration: if any weakness fell essentially upon the faculty, the
   faculty would not be restored by the restoration of the organ; but now
   we see that however much the faculty of sight seems weakened, it is
   restored, if only the organ is restored. [426] Since then the soul's
   faculty of understanding needs no bodily organ, the understanding
   itself is not weakened, neither essentially nor incidentally, either by
   old age or by any other weakness of body. But if in the working of the
   understanding there happens fatigue or hindrance through bodily
   weakness, this is not due to weakness of the understanding itself, but
   to weakness of other faculties that the understanding has need of, to
   wit, the phantasy, the memory, and the cogitative faculty. [427]

   10. The same is evidenced by the very words of Aristotle: "Moving
   causes pre-exist, but formal causes are along with the things whereof
   they are causes: for when a man is well, then there is health. But
   whether anything remains afterwards, is a point to consider: in some
   cases there may well be something remaining: the soul is an instance,
   not the whole soul, but the intelligence: as for the whole soul
   remaining, that is perhaps an impossibility." [428] Clearly then, in
   speaking of forms, he wishes to speak of the intellect, which is the
   form of man, as remaining after its matter, that is, after the body. It
   is clear also that though Aristotle makes the soul a form, yet he does
   not represent it as non- subsistent and consequently perishable, as
   Gregory of Nyssa imputes to him: [429] for he excludes the intellectual
   soul from the general category of other forms, saying that it remains
   after the body and is a subsistent being (substantiam quandam). [430]

   Hereby is banished the error of the impious in whose person it is said:
   We were born out of nothingness, and hereafter we shall be as though we
   had never been (Wisd. ii, 2); in whose person again Solomon says: One
   is the perishing of man and beast, and even is the lot of both: as man
   dies, so do beasts die: all breathe alike, and man hath no advantage
   over beasts (Eccles iii, 19): that he does not say this in his own
   person, but in the person of the ungodly, is clear from what he says at
   the end, as it were drawing a conclusion: Till the dust return to the
   earth, from whence it came; and the spirit go back to the God who gave
   it (Eccles xii, 7).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [423] Understand, so as to be frustrated in the entire species. This
   argument is drawn out in my Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 14-21.

   [424] Matter is indestructible, and therefore mind.

   [425] Clearly, if this is allowed, the whole argument cf. the chapter
   is allowed. Reference is made to Chap. LXVIII, where we read: "Above
   other forms there is found a form, likened to the supramundane
   substances in point of understanding, and competent to an activity
   which is accomplished without any bodily organ at all; and this is the
   intellectua soul: for the act of understanding is not done through any
   bodily organ."

   [426] Here Aristotle is alleged, as quoted at the end of note, page
   153.

   [427] The cogitative faculty' (Chap. LX) is the to dianoeisthai of De
   anima, I, iv, 14, where it is expressly said not to be a pathos of to
   noein. The inferiority of dianoeisthai to noein in Aristotle was
   probably suggested by, though it is not identical with, that of dianoia
   to nous in Plato, Rep. vi, ad fin.

   [429] The commentators refer to a work Lives of Philosophers, which
   however is not St Gregory's, but was written by Eunapius, a
   contemporary rhetorician, hostile to Christianity.

   CHAPTER LXXX, LXXXI--Arguments of those who wish to prove that the
   Human Soul perishes with the Body, with Replies to the same

   ARG. 1. If human souls are multiplied according to the multiplication
   of bodies, as shown above (Chap. [261]LXXV), then when the bodies
   perish, the souls cannot remain in their multitude. [431] Hence one of
   two conclusions must follow: either the human soul must wholly cease to
   be; or there must remain one soul only, which seems to suit the view of
   those who make that alone incorruptible which is one in all men,
   whether that be the active intellect alone, as Alexander says, or with
   the active also the potential intellect, as Averroes says. [432]

   Reply. Whatever things are necessarily in conjunction and proportion
   with one another, are made many or one together, each by its own cause.
   If the being of the one depends on the other, its unity or
   multiplication also will depend on the same: otherwise it will depend
   on some extrinsic cause. Form then and matter must always be in
   proportion with one another, and conjoined by a certain natural tie.
   Hence matter and form must vary together in point of multiplicity and
   unity. If then the form depends on the matter for its being, the
   multiplication of the form will depend on the matter, and so will its
   unity. But if the form is in no such dependence on the matter, then, --
   though it will still be necessary for the form to be multiplied with
   the multiplication of the matter, -- the unity or multiplicity of the
   form will not depend on the matter. But it has been shown (Chap.
   [262]LXVIII, and [263]note, p. 154, that the human soul is a form not
   dependent on matter for its being. Hence it follows that, though souls
   are multiplied as the bodies which they inform are multiplied, still
   the fact of bodies being many cannot be the cause of souls being many.
   [433] And therefore there is no need for the plurality of souls to
   cease with the destruction of their bodies.

   Arg. 2. The formal nature (ratio formalis, pp. [264]111, [265]116) of
   things is the cause of their differing in species. But if souls remain
   many after the perishing of their bodies, they must differ in species,
   since in souls so remaining the only diversity possible is one of
   formal nature. But souls do not change their species by the destruction
   of the body, otherwise they would be destroyed too, for all that
   changes from species to species is destroyed in the transition. Then
   they must have been different in species even before they parted from
   their bodies. But compounds take their species according to their form.
   So then individual men must differ in species, an awkward conclusion
   consequent upon the position that souls remain a multitude after their
   bodies are gone.

   Reply. It is not any and every diversity of form that makes a
   difference of species. The fact of souls separated from their bodies
   making a multitude follows from their forms being different in
   substance, inasmuch as the substance of this soul is different from the
   substance of that. But this diversity does not arise from the souls
   differing in their several essential constitutions, but from their
   being differently commensurate with different bodies: for one soul is
   commensurate with one body and not with another. [434] These
   commensurations remain in souls even when their bodies perish, as the
   substances of the souls also remain, not being dependent on their
   bodies for their being. For it is by their substances that souls are
   forms of bodies: otherwise they would be united with their bodies only
   accidentally, and soul and body would not make up an essential but only
   an accidental unity. But inasmuch as they are forms, they must be
   commensurate with their bodies. Hence it is clear that their several
   different commensuratenesses remain in the departed souls, and
   consequently plurality.

   Arg. 3. It seems quite impossible, on the theory of those who suppose
   the eternity of the world, for human souls to remain in their multitude
   after the death of the body. For if the world is from eternity,
   infinite men have died before our time. If then the souls of the dead
   remain after death in their multitude, we must say that there is now an
   actual infinity of souls of men previously dead. But actual infinity is
   impossible in nature. [435]

   Reply. Of supporters of the eternity of the world, some have simply
   allowed the impossibility, saying that human souls perish altogether
   with their bodies. Others have said that of all souls there remains one
   spiritual existence which is common to all, -- the active intellect
   according to some, [436] or with the active also the potential
   intellect according to others. [437] Others have supposed souls to
   remain in their multitude after their bodies; but, not to be obliged to
   suppose an infinity of souls, they have said that the same souls are
   united to different bodies after a fixed period; [438] and this was the
   opinion of the Platonists, of which hereafter (Chap. [266]LXXXIII).
   Others, avoiding all the aforesaid answers, have maintained that there
   was no difficulty in the existence of an actual infinity of departed
   souls: for an actual infinity of things, not related to one another,
   was only an accidental infinity, in which they saw no difficulty; and
   this is the position of Avicenna and Algazel. [439] Which of these was
   the opinion of Aristotle is not expressly set down in his writings,
   although he does expressly hold the eternity of the world. But the last
   mentioned opinion is not inconsistent with his principles: for in the
   Physics, III, v, his argument against an actual infinity is confined to
   natural bodies, and is not extended to immaterial substances. Clearly
   however the professors of the Catholic faith can feel no difficulty on
   this point, as they do not allow the eternity of the world. [440]

   Arg. 5. It is impossible for any substance to exist destitute of all
   activity. But all activity of the soul ends with the body, as may be
   shown by simple enumeration. For the faculties of the vegetative soul
   work through bodily qualities and a bodily instrument; and the term of
   their activity is the body itself, which is perfected by the soul, is
   thereby nourished and developed, and comes to furnish the generative
   products. Also all the activities of the faculties of the sensitive
   soul are accomplished through bodily organs; and some of them are
   accompanied by (sensible) bodily change, as in the case of the
   passions. As for the act of understanding, although it is not an
   activity exercised through any bodily organ, nevertheless its objects
   are phantasms, which stand to it as colours to sight: hence as sight
   cannot see without colours, so the intellectual soul cannot understand
   without phantasms. The soul also needs, for purposes of understanding,
   the faculties which prepare the phantasms to become actual terms of
   intellect, namely, the cogitative faculty and the memory, of which it
   is certain that they cannot endure without the body, seeing that they
   work through organs of the body. Hence Aristotle says that "the soul by
   no means understands without a phantasm," and that "nothing understands
   without the passive intellect," by which name he designates the
   cogitative faculty, "which is perishable"; and that "we remember
   nothing" after death of the things that we knew in life. [441] Thus
   then it is clear that no activity of the soul can continue after death,
   and therefore neither can its substance continue.

   Reply. The assertion that no activity can remain in the soul after its
   separation from the body, we say, is incorrect: for those activities
   remain which are not exercised through organs, and such are
   understanding and will. As for activities exercised through bodily
   organs, as are the activities of the vegetative and sentient soul, they
   do not remain. But we must observe that the soul separated from the
   body does not understand in the same way as when united with the body:
   for everything acts according as it is. Now though the being of the
   human soul, while united with the body, is perfect (absolutum), not
   depending on the body, still the body is a sort of housing (stramentum
   [442] ) to it and subject receptive of it. Hence the proper activity of
   the soul, which is understanding, while independent of the body in this
   that it is not exercised through any bodily organ, nevertheless finds
   in the body its object, which is the phantasm. [443] Hence, so long as
   the soul is in the body, it cannot understand without a phantasm, [444]
   nor remember except by the cogitative and reminiscent faculty whereby
   phantasms are shaped and made available (Chap. [267]LXXIII); and
   therefore this method of understanding and remembering has to be laid
   aside when the body is laid aside. But the being of the departed soul
   belongs to it alone without the body: [445] hence its intellectual
   activity will not be accomplished by regard to such objects as
   phantasms existing in bodily organs, but it will understand by itself
   after the manner of those intelligences that subsist totally apart from
   bodies (Chapp. XCI-CI), from which superior beings it will be able to
   receive more abundant influence in order to more perfect understanding.

   We may see some indication of this even in living men. When the soul is
   hampered by preoccupations about its body, it is less disposed to
   understand higher things. Hence the virtue of temperance, withdrawing
   the soul from bodily delights, helps especially to make men apt to
   understand. [446] In sleep again, when men are not using their bodily
   senses, they have some perception of things to come, impressed upon
   them by superior beings, and attain to facts that transcend the measure
   of human reasonings. [447] This is much more the case in states of
   syncope and ecstasy, as the withdrawal from the bodily senses is there
   greater. And that is what one might expect, because, as has been
   pointed out above (Chap. [268]LXVIII), the human soul being on the
   boundary line between corporeal and incorporeal substances, and
   dwelling as it were on the horizon of eternity and time, it approaches
   the highest by receding from the lowest. Therefore, when it shall be
   totally severed from the body, it will be perfectly assimilated to the
   intelligences that subsist apart, and will receive their influence in
   more copious streams. Thus then, though the mode of our understanding
   according to the conditions of the present life is wrecked with the
   wreck of the body, it will be replaced by another and higher mode of
   understanding.

   But memory, being an act exercised through a bodily organ, as Aristotle
   shows, [448] cannot remain in the soul after the body is gone; unless
   memory be taken in another sense for the intellectual hold upon things
   known before: this intellectual memory of things known in life must
   remain in the departed soul, since the intellectual impressions are
   indelibly received in the potential intellect (Chap. [269]LXXIV). As
   regards other activities of the soul, such as love, joy, and the like,
   we must beware of a double meaning of the terms: sometimes they mean
   passions, or emotions, which are activities of the sensitive appetite,
   concupiscible or irascible, [449] and as such they cannot remain in the
   soul after death, as Aristotle shows: [450] sometimes they mean a
   simple act of will without passion, as Aristotle says that "The joy of
   God is one, everlasting, and absolute," and that "In the contemplation
   of wisdom there is admirable delight"; and again he distinguishes the
   love of friendship from the love of passion. [451] But as the will is a
   power that uses no bodily organ, as neither does the understanding, it
   is evident that such acts, inasmuch as they are acts of will, may
   remain in the departed soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [431] The body being the principle of individuation, when that
   principle is taken away, it would seem that nothing is left to
   differentiate one soul from another. St Thomas would reply that the
   soul is individualised, not by the body, but by adaptation to one
   particular body which it animates and informs, which adaptation
   continues after that body is dead and gone. See Chap. LXXV, arg. 1,
   with reply and note; and in this chapter the reply to the second
   argument.

   [432] See note, p. 135.

   [433] A soul is created for each human body; and in that way the
   animation of many human fetuses involves the creating of as many human
   souls. But once existent, the soul is a substance, not an accident: and
   therefore, whether in the body or out of the body, it is in its own
   right distinct from other similar substances.

   [434] With the body in health or with the body in sickness? with the
   infantine or with the full-grown body? St Thomas probably would reply,
   with the full-grown and healthy body,' -- else we should have millions
   of souls maimed, not through any fault of their own. But how can a soul
   be commensurate with a body such as it has not informed for years
   before its final departure, and in many cases has never informed at
   all? This view of the souls of the departed is very difficult: but so
   is every view on the subject. It would make some difference between a
   woman's and a man's soul. Cf. Chap. LXXIII, A. 2 and 3, with note, p.
   136.

   orthodox Mohammedan school, wrote a work Destructions of Philosophers,
   to which Averroes replied with Destruction of Destructions. Algazali
   denied the eternity of the world.

   [440] As neither do the modern Sciences of astronomy and geology, at

   [444] Phantasm' here cannot be taken to mean a consciously portrayed
   picture in the imagination. Reading a book, or writing a letter, would
   be very low work, if every act of understanding had to be thus sensibly
   illustrated. The use of what may be called the algebra of language' is
   to deliver us from the necessity of all this actual delineation. And
   this raises the question: Do departed souls carry their knowledge of
   language with them?' It is hard to determine such questions a priori.

   [445] The opponent had contended: It acts not, therefore it is not.' St
   Thomas seems to reply: It is, therefore it acts.' He must be supposed
   to fall back upon the proofs of Chap. LXXIX, and to be here only
   concerned to argue that activity on the part of a departed soul is not
   inconceivable.

   [446] Good and well-digested meals also help to make men apt to

   raised him to a higher state, such as St Thomas speaks of, above the
   usual inanities of dreamland.

   CHAPTER LXXXII--That the Souls of Dumb Animals are not Immortal

   NO activity of the sentient part can have place without a body. But in
   the souls of dumb animals we find no activity higher than the
   activities of the sentient part. That animals neither understand nor
   reason is apparent from this, that all animals of the same species
   behave alike, as being moved by nature, and not acting on any principle
   of art: for every swallow makes its nest alike, and every spider its
   web alike. Therefore there is no activity in the soul of dumb animals
   that can possibly go on without a body. [452]

   2. Every form separated from matter is actually understood. Thus the
   active intellect makes impressions actually understood, inasmuch as it
   abstracts them. But if the soul of a dumb animal remains after the body
   is gone, it will be a form separated from matter. Therefore it will be
   form actually understood. But "in things separated from matter
   understanding and understood are the same" (De Anima, III, iv, 13).
   Therefore the soul of a dumb animal will have understanding, which is
   impossible. [453]

   3. In everything that is apt to arrive at any perfection, there is
   found a natural craving after that perfection: for good is what all
   crave after, everything its own good. But in dumb animals there is no
   craving after perpetuity of being except in the form of perpetuity of
   the species, inasmuch as they have an instinct of generation, whereby
   the species is perpetuated, -- and the same is found in plants. [454]
   But they have not that craving consequent upon apprehension: for since
   the sentient soul apprehends only what is here and now, it cannot
   possibly apprehend perpetuity of being, and therefore has no physical
   craving after such perpetuity. [455] Therefore the soul of a dumb
   animal is incapable of perpetuity of being.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [452] The irrationality of dumb animals is apparent from this, first,
   that they are dumb (alogoi), or devoid of rational speech; secondly,
   that they are uncivilised, and uncivilisable, except in so far as they
   partake of the civilisation of man; thirdly that, apart from man, they
   are racially unprogressive; fourthly, that they are devoid of all idea
   of morality and religion; fifthly, that there is no inter-breeding
   between them and even the lowest types of the one incontestably
   rational animal, man. The indefeasible coexistence of human shape and
   animal rationality is as well established as any coexistence in
   physical science. But, setting aside spiders and swallows, it is not
   true that monkeys, elephants, horses, dogs, and other educable animals,
   in their respective species, "all behave alike." St Thomas however may
   claim to speak only of animals in a state of nature, wholly
   uninfluenced by man.

   [453] Is not the term separated from matter' here used in two senses --
   (a) of a logical separation by abstraction, logo; (b) of a real
   separation in nature, phusei? A tendency of Scholasticism, inherited
   from Neo-Platonism, was to think of Spirit as personified Idea or Form.
   The eidos took life and became daimon. Aristotle's saying means that
   the universal, as such, exists only in mind. But the departed soul of a
   bear, if it be at all, is not a universal.

   [454] St Thomas adds, "and in inaminate things."

   [455] The technical terms physical' and psychical' craving (appetitus
   naturalis et animalis) are expained in Ethics and Natural Law, I, pp.
   49-53.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXIII, LXXXIV--Apparent Arguments to show that the Human Soul
   does not begin with the Body, but has been from Eternity, with Replies
   to the same

   ARG. 1. (A.) What will never cease to be, has a power of being always.
   But of that which has a power of being always it is never true to say
   that it is not: for a thing continues in being so far as its power of
   being extends. What therefore will never cease to be, will never either
   begin to be.

   Reply. The power of a thing does not extend to the past, but to the
   present or future: hence with regard to past events possibility has no
   place. Therefore from the fact of the soul having a power of being
   always it does not follow that the soul always has been, but that it
   always will be. -- Besides, that to which power extends does not follow
   until the power is presupposed. It cannot therefore be concluded that
   the soul is always except for the time that comes after it has received
   the power.

   Arg. 2. Truth of the intellectual order is imperishable, eternal,
   necessary. Now from the imperishableness of intellectual truth the
   being of the soul is shown to be imperishable. In like manner from the
   eternity of that truth there may be proved the eternity of the soul.

   Reply. The eternity of understood truth may be regarded in two ways, --
   in point of the object which is understood, and in point of the mind
   whereby it is understood. From the eternity of understood truth in
   point of the object, there will follow the eternity of the thing, but
   not the eternity of the thinker. From the eternity of understood truth
   in point of the understanding mind, the eternity of that thinking soul
   will follow. But understood truth is eternal, not in the latter but in
   the former way. As we have seen, the intellectual impressions, whereby
   our soul understands truth, come to us fresh from the phantasms through
   the medium of the active intellect. Hence the conclusion is, not that
   our soul is eternal, but that those understood truths are founded upon
   something which is eternal. In fact they are founded upon the First
   Truth, the universal Cause comprehensive of all truth. To this truth
   our soul stands related, not as the recipient subject to the form which
   it receives, but as a thing to its proper end: for truth is the good of
   the understanding and the end thereof. Now we can gather an argument of
   the duration of a thing from its end, as we can argue the beginning of
   a thing from its efficient cause: for what is ordained to an
   everlasting end must be capable of perpetual duration. Hence the
   immortality of the soul may be argued from the eternity of intellectual
   truth, but not the eternity of the soul.

   Arg. 3. That is not perfect, to which many of its principal parts are
   wanting. If therefore there daily begin to be as many human souls as
   there are men born, it is clear that many of its principal parts are
   daily being added to the universe, and consequently that very many are
   still wanting to it. It follows that the universe is imperfect, which
   is impossible. [456]

   Reply. The perfection of the universe goes by species, not by
   individuals; and human souls do not differ in species, but only in
   number (Chap. [270]LXXV).

   (B.) Some professing the Catholic faith, but imbued with Platonic
   doctrines, have taken a middle course [between Platonists, who held
   that individual souls were from eternity, now united with bodies, now
   released by turns; and Alexander, Averroes, -- and possibly Aristotle
   himself, -- deniers of personal immortality]. These men, seeing that
   according to the Catholic faith nothing is eternal but God, have
   supposed human souls not to be eternal, but to have been created with
   the world, or rather before the visible world, and to be united with
   bodies recurrently as required. Origen was the first professor of the
   Christian faith to take up this position, and he has since had many
   followers. The position seems assailable on these grounds.

   1. The soul is united with the body as the form and actualising
   principle thereof. Now though actuality is naturally prior to
   potentiality, yet, in the same subject, it is posterior to it in time:
   [457] for a thing moves from potentiality to actuality. Therefore the
   seed, which is potentially alive, was before the soul, which is the
   actuality of life.

   2. It is natural to every form to be united to its own proper matter:
   otherwise the compound of matter and form would be something unnatural.
   Now that which belongs to a thing according to its nature is assigned
   to it before that which belongs to it against its nature: for what
   belongs to a thing against its nature attaches to it incidentally, but
   what belongs to it according to its nature attaches to it ordinarily;
   and the incidental is always posterior to the ordinary. It belongs to
   the soul therefore to be united to the body before being apart from the
   body.

   3. Every part, separated from its whole, is imperfect. But the soul,
   being the form (Chap. [271]XLVII), is a part of the human species.
   Therefore, existing by itself, apart from the body, it is imperfect.
   But the perfect is before the imperfect in the order of natural things.
   [458]

   (C.) If souls were created without bodies, the question arises how they
   came to be united with bodies. It must have been either violently or
   naturally. If violently, the union of the soul with the body is
   unnatural, and man is an unnatural compound of soul and body, which
   cannot be true. But if souls are naturally united with bodies, then
   they were created with a physical tendency (appetitus naturalis) to
   such union. Now a physical tendency works itself out at once, unless
   something comes in the way. Souls then should have been united with
   bodies from the instant of their creation except for some intervening
   obstacle. But any obstacle intervening to arrest a physical tendency,
   or natural craving, does violence to the same. Therefore it would have
   been by violence that souls were for a period separated from their
   bodies, which is an awkward conclusion. [459]

   (D.) But if it be said that both states alike are natural to the soul,
   as well the state of union with the body as the state of separation,
   according to difference of times, this appears to be impossible, --
   because points of natural variation are accidents to the subject in
   which they occur, as age and youth: if then union with body and
   separation from a body are natural variations to the soul, the union of
   the soul with the body will be an accident; and man, the result of that
   union, will not be an ordinary, regular entity (ens per se), but a
   casual, incidental being (ens per accidens).

   (E.) But if it is said that souls are united with bodies neither
   violently nor naturally, but of their own spontaneous will, that cannot
   be. For none is willing to come to a worse state except under
   deception. But the soul is in a higher state away from the body,
   especially according to the Platonists, who say that by union with the
   body the soul suffers forgetfulness of what it knew before, and is
   hindered from the contemplation of pure truth. At that rate it has no
   willingness to be united with a body except for some deceit practised
   upon it. Threfore, supposing it to have pre-existed before the body, it
   would not be united therewith of its own accord.

   (F.) But if as an alternative it is said that the soul is united with
   the body neither by nature, nor by its own will, but by a divine
   ordinance, this again does not appear a suitable arrangement, on the
   supposition that souls were created before bodies. For God has
   established everything according to the proper mode of its nature:
   hence it is said: God saw all things that he had made, and they were
   very good (Gen. i, 31). If then He created souls apart from bodies, we
   must say that this mode of being is better suited to their nature. But
   it is not proper for an ordinance of divine goodness to reduce things
   to a lower state, but rather to rise them to a higher. At that rate the
   union of soul with body could not be the result of a divine ordinance.

   (G.) This consideration moved Origen to suppose that when souls,
   created from the beginning of time, came by divine ordinance to be
   united with bodies, it was for their punishment. He supposed that they
   had sinned before they came into bodies, and that according to the
   amount of their guilt they were united with bodies of various degrees
   of nobility, shut up in them as in prisons. But this supposition cannot
   stand for reasons alleged above (Chap. [272]XLIV).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [456] That the universe is not yet perfect, which is generally
   admitted,' would be more of modern conclusion. In the notion of the
   perfection of the universe we seem to have a judgment of fact, the
   universe is the perfect sum of all that is,' slipping into judgment of
   value, the universe is the perfect sum of all that ought to be.'

   [457] De anima, III, v, 3.

   [458] Evolutionists say just the contrary, one great difference between
   them and the scholastics. The position is saved by the consideration
   that any evolution must be the ordinance of an all-perfect Mind. The
   Platonists and Origenists, St Thomas's opponents in this now effete
   controversy about the pre-existence of souls, would not have allowed
   that the soul was the form of the body, or was imperect without the
   body, or better for union with it. Rather they held that for spirit to
   be united with flesh was to the spirit encumbrance and punishment. Even
   Catholics, who confess the soul to be the form of the body, may still
   linger over Plato's words: "Union between soul and body is nowise
   better than separation" (Laws, VIII, 821), such union, that is, as
   obtains in this mortal life (1 Cor. xv, 42-50). We do not suppose
   pre-existence of souls, a theory which, as St Thomas justly argues,
   would make humanity begin in the degradation of its nobler component:
   but we may suppose death to be naturally a deliverance, an elevation
   rather than an impairing of the disembodied spirit. Such a conception
   of course affects the value of any a priori natural argument for
   resurrection (B. IV, Chap [273]LXXIX).

   [459] The second of the Newtonian laws of motion warns us that all
   physical tendencies to motion work themselves out concurrently and
   instantaneously as tendencies. St Thomas's reasoning however is beset
   with this difficulty, that, parted from the body, the soul, on his
   showing, still retains a physical tendency to union with the body: is
   there any more difficulty, anything of greater violence, in a soul
   having to wait for its first union with the body than in its having to
   wait, as it certainly does wait for centuries, for its reunion in the
   resurrection? The two telling arguments against the pre-existence of
   souls are, first, that pace Platonis et Origenis it is wholly unproved;
   secondly, that a spirit, that had once existed free, would suffer
   violence by becoming the form' of a body under conditions of mortality.
   There are those who venture to think, although St Thomas does not think
   so, that while the soul in the body is properly called an incomplete
   substance,' -- for otherwise it would not be the form of the body,' --
   yet, parted from the body, it expands into the completeness of pure
   intelligence, and has no natural craving' for union with the body any
   more. Resurrection then is not within the purview of philosophy, as it
   is not the fulfilment of any natural exigence; and, at least in the
   resurrection of the just, the soul shall be in the body on quite other
   conditions than those under which she now dwells in this prison-house
   of flesh. But of this in the fourth Book.

   CHAPTER LXXXV--That the Soul is not of the substance of God

   The divine substance is eternal, and nothing appertaining to it begins
   anew to be (B. I, Chap. [274]XV). But the souls of men were not before
   their bodies (Chap. [275]LXXXIII).

   3. Everything out of which anything is made is in potentiality to that
   which is made out of it. But the substance of God, being pure
   actuality, is not in potentiality to anything (B. I, Chap. [276]XVI).

   4 and 5. That out of which anything is made is in some way changed.
   Moveover the soul of man is manifestly variable in point of knowledge,
   virtue, and their opposites. But God is absolutely unchangeable (B. I,
   Chap. [277]XII): therefore nothing can be made out of Him, nor can the
   soul be of His substance.

   7. Since the divine substance is absolutely indivisible, the soul
   cannot be of that substance unless it be the whole substance. But the
   divine substance cannot but be one (B. I, Chap. [278]XLII). It would
   follow that all men have but one intellectual soul, a conclusion
   already rejected (Chap. [279]LXXV). [460]

   This opinion seems to have had three sources. Some assumed that there
   was no incorporeal being, and made the chiefest of corporeal substances
   God. Hence sprang the theory of the Manichean, that God is a sort of
   corporeal light, pervading all the infinities of space, and that the
   human soul is a small glimmer of this light. Others have posited the
   intellect of all men to be one, either active intellect alone, or
   active and potential combined. And because the ancients called every
   self-subsistent intelligence a deity, it followed that our soul, or the
   intellect whereby we understand, had a divine nature. Hence sundry
   professors of the Christian faith in our time, who assert the separate
   existence of the active intellect, have said expressly that the active
   intellect is God. This opinion might also have arisen from the likeness
   of our soul to God: for intelligence, which is taken to be the chief
   characteristic of Deity, is found to belong to no substance in the
   sublunary world except to man alone, on account of his soul.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [460] Monism is the only debatable pantheism. Admit a manifold,' and
   you may be a materialist, or a Manichean, but cannot logically be a
   pantheist.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXVI--That the Human Soul is not transmitted by Generation
   [461]

   Where the activities of active principles suppose the concurrence of a
   body, the origination also of such principles supposed bodily
   concurrence: for a thing has existence according as it has activity:
   everything is active according to its being. But when active principles
   have their activities independent of bodily concurrence, the reverse is
   the case: the genesis of such principles is not by any bodily
   generation. Now the activity of the vegitative and sentient soul cannot
   be without bodily concurrence (Chapp. [280]LVII, [281]LXVIII): but the
   activity of the intellectual soul has place through no bodily organ
   (Chap. [282]LXIX). Therefore the vegitative and sentient souls are
   generated by the generation of the body, and date their existence from
   the transmission of the male semen, but not the intellectual soul.
   [462]

   2. If the human soul owed its origin to the transmission of the male
   semen, that could be only in one of two ways. Either we must suppose
   that the soul is actually in the male semen, being as it were
   accidentally separated from the soul of the generator as the semen is
   separated from the body: -- we see something of this sort in Annelid
   animals, [463] that live when cut in pieces: these creatures have one
   soul actually and many potentially; and when the body is divided, a
   soul comes to be actually in every living part: -- or in another way it
   may be supposed that there is in the male semen a power productive of
   an intellectual soul, so that the intellectual soul may be taken to be
   in the said semen virtually, not actually. The first of these
   suppositions is impossible for two reasons. First, because the
   intelligent soul being the most perfect of souls and the most potent,
   the proper subject for it to perfect is a body having a great diversity
   of organs apt to respond to its manifold activities: hence the
   intellectual soul cannot be in the male semen cut off from the body (in
   semine deciso), because neither are the souls of the lower animals of
   the more perfect sort multiplied by cutting them in pieces (per
   decisionem), as is the case with Annelid animals. Secondly, because the
   proper and principal faculty of the intelligent soul, the intellect,
   not being the actualisation of any part of the body, [464] cannot be
   accidentally divided with the division of the body: therefore neither
   can the intelligent soul. The second supposition (that the intelligent
   soul is virtually contained in the male semen) is also impossible. For
   the active power in the semen is effectual to the generation of an
   animal by effecting a bodily transmutation: there is no other way for a
   material power to take effect. But every form, which owes its being to
   a transmutation of matter, has being in dependence on matter: for (n.
   3) every form, educed into existence by a transmutation of matter, is a
   form educed out of the potentiality of matter: for this is the meaning
   of a transmutation of matter, that something is educed into actuality
   out of potentiality. But an intelligent soul cannot be educed out of
   the potentiality of matter: for it has been shown above (Chap.
   [283]LXVIII) that the intelligent soul transcends the whole power of
   matter, as it has an immaterial activity (Chap. [284]LXIX). Therefore
   the intelligent soul is not induced into being by any transmutation of
   matter, and therefore not by the action of any power that is in the
   male semen.

   5. It is ridiculous to say that any subsistent intelligence is either
   divided by division of the body or produced by any corporeal power. But
   the soul is a subsistent intelligence (Chap. [285]LXVIII). Therefore it
   can neither be divided by the separation of the semen from the body,
   nor produced by any active power in the same.

   6. If the generation of this is the cause of that coming to be, the
   destruction of this will be the cause of that ceasing to be. But the
   destruction of the body is not the cause of the human soul ceasing to
   be (Chap. [286]LXXIX). Neither then is the generation of the body the
   cause of the soul commencing to be.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [461] This doctrine, called traducianism, that the soul is transmitted
   (traducitur) from parent to offspring in the act of generation, is
   ascribed to Tertullian.

   [462] The force of this admission will appear in the next two chapters.
   Two propositions must be kept apart:-- (a) The origin of the
   intellectual soul of man is synchronous with the moment of conception.
   (b) The intellectual soul of man is, as the body of man, simply a
   product of conception. St Thomas denies both these propositions. Modern
   Catholic theologians usually are content with denying the second only.

   [463] Annulosa, St Thomas calls them: they are now known as Annelidae,
   worms, centipedes, and the like. The cutting of an Annelid in two is
   not a case of reproduction. But in the lowest animal life, that of
   Amoebae, there is a true reproduction by fissure'; as also in the
   propagation of plants by cuttings. The kindness of a medical friend
   suplies me with the following statement: "When the body of an Annelid,
   say an earthworm, is divided, as by the stroke of a spade, the animal
   does not necessarily die, does not necessarily live. The principal
   nerve gangia are situated in the head, and though the severed part,
   remote from this, so-called, central nervous system, will have no
   restorative power and will die, the segment containing the nerve masses
   -- brain' -- may restore or reproduce the missing opposite extremity,
   or a semblance of it. But, if the injury were very near the head, so
   that almost all the vital organs, viscera, etc., were included in the
   segment remote from the nerve ganglia, death would occur, not even the
   nerve ganglia in the head having the power to restore or reproduce an
   almost entirely new body, viscera, blood vessels, etc. So, while one
   part may live, both parts may die. It depends upon the amount and
   importance of the part or parts to be reproduced, or restored."

   [464] As sight, for example, is the actuality (entelecheia,
   realisation, or full perfection) of the eye.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXVII--That the Human Soul is brought into Being by a
   Creative Act of God

   Everything that is brought into being is either generated or created.
   But the human soul is not generated, either by way of composition of
   parts or by the generation of the body (Chap. [287]LXXXVI); and yet it
   comes new into existence, being neither eternal nor pre-existent
   (Chapp. [288]LXXXIII, [289]LXXXIV): therefore it comes into being by
   creation. Now, as has been shown above, God alone can create (Chap.
   [290]XXI).

   2. Whatever has existence as subsistent being, is also made in the way
   that a subsistent being is made: while whatever has no existence as a
   subsistent being, but is attached to something else, is not made
   separately, but only under condition of that having been made to which
   it is attached. But the soul has this peculiarity to distinguish it
   from other forms, that it is a subsistent being; and the existence
   which is proper to it communicates to the body. The soul then is made
   as a subsistent being is made: it is the subject of a making-process
   all its own, unlike other forms, which are made incidentally in the
   making of the compounds to which hey belong. But as the soul has no
   material part, it cannot be made out of any subject-matter:
   consequently it must be made out of nothing, and so created.

   5. The end of a thing answers to its beginning. Now the end of the
   human soul and its final perfection is, by knowledge and love to
   transcend the whole order of created things, and attain to its first
   principle and beginning, which is God. Therefore from God it has
   properly its first origin.

   Holy Scripture seems to insinuate this conclusion: for whereas,
   speaking of the origin of other animals, it scribes their souls to
   other causes, as when it says: Let the waters produce the creeping
   thing of living soul (Gen. i, 20): coming to man, it shows that his
   soul is created by God, saying: God formed man from the slime of the
   earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life (Gen. ii, 7).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXVIII, LXXXIX--Arguments against the Truth of the Conclusion
   last drawn, with their Solution [465]

   For the better understanding of the solutions given, we must prefix
   some exposition of the order and process of human generation, and of
   animal generation generally. First then we must know that that is a
   false opinion of certain persons who say that the vital acts which
   appear in the embryo before its final development (ante ultimum
   complementum), come not from any soul or power of soul existing in it,
   but from the soul of the mother. [466] If that were true, we could no
   longer call the embryo an animal, as every animal consists of soul and
   body. The activities of life do not proceed from an active principle
   from without, but from a power within; a fact which seems to mark the
   distinction between inanimate and living things, it being proper to the
   latter to move themselves. Whatever is nourished, assimilates
   nourishment to itself: hence there must be in the creature that is
   nourished an active power of nutrition, since an agent acts to the
   likeness of itself. This is still more manifest in the operations of
   sense: for sight and hearing are attributable to a power existing in
   the sentient subject, not in another. Hence, as the embryo is evidently
   nourished before its final development, and even feels, this cannot be
   attributed to the soul of another.

   It has been alleged that the soul in its complete essence is in the
   male semen from the first, its activities not appearing merely for want
   of organs. But that cannot be. For since the soul is united with the
   body as a form, it is only united with that body of which it is
   properly the actualisation. Now the soul is the actualisation of an
   organised body. Therefore before the organisation of the body the soul
   is in the male semen, not actually, but virtually. Hence Aristotle says
   that seed and fruit have life potentially in such a way that they "cast
   away," i.e. are destitute of soul; whereas that (body) whereof the soul
   is the actualisation has life potentially, and does not "cast away"
   soul. [467]

   It would follow, if the soul were in the male semen from the first,
   that the generation of an animal was only by fissure (per decisionem),
   as is the case with Annelid animals, that are made two out of one. For
   if the male semen has a soul the instant it was cut off from the body,
   [468] it would then have a substantial form. But every substantial
   generation precedes and does not follow the substantial form. Any
   transmutations that follow the substantial form are not directed to the
   being of the thing generated, but to its well-being. At that rate the
   generation of the animal would be complete in the mere cutting off of
   the male semen from the body of the parent; and all subsequent
   transmutations would be irrelevant to generation. The supposition is
   still more ridiculous when applied to the rational soul, as well
   because it is impossible for that to be divided according to the
   division of the body, so as even to be in the semen cut off therefrom;
   as also because it would follow that in all cases of the semen being
   wasted, without conception ensuing, souls were still multiplied.

   Nor again can it be said, as some say, that though there is not in the
   male semen at its first cutting off [469] any soul actually, but only
   virtually, for want of organs, nevertheless, as the said semen is a
   bodily substance, organisable although not organised, so the active
   power of that semen is itself a soul, potential but not actual,
   proportional to the condition of the semen. The theory goes on to say
   that, as the life of a plant requires fewer organs than the life of an
   animal, the aforesaid active power turns into a vegetative soul as soon
   as the semen is sufficiently organised for the life of a plant; and
   further that, when the organs are more perfected and multiplied, the
   same power is advanced to be a sentient soul; and further still that,
   when the form of the organs is perfect, the same becomes a rational
   soul, not indeed by the action of the power of the semen itself, but
   only by the influence of some exterior agent: and this the advocates of
   this theory take to be the reason why Aristotle said (De gen. animal.,
   II, iii) that the intellect is from without.

   Upon this view it would follow that numerically the same active power
   was now a vegetative soul only, and afterwards a sentient soul; and so
   the substantial form itself was continually more and more perfected: it
   would further follow that a substantial form was educed from
   potentiality to actuality, not instantaneously, but successively; and
   further than generation was a continuous change, as is alteration, --
   all so many physical impossibilities. There would ensue even a still
   more awkward consequence, that the rational soul was mortal. For no
   formal constituent added to a perishable thing makes it naturally
   imperishable: otherwise the perishable would be changed into the
   imperishable, which is impossible, as the two differ in kind. But the
   substance of the sentient soul, which is supposed to be incidentally
   generated when the body is generated in the process above described, is
   necessarily perishable with the perishing of the body. If therefore
   this soul becomes rational by the bringing in of some manner of light
   from without [470] to be a formal constituent of the soul, it
   necessarily follows that the rational soul perishes when the body
   perishes, contrary to which has been shown (Chap. [291]LXXIX) and to
   the teaching of Catholic faith.

   Therefore the active power which is cut off, or emitted, with the male
   semen from the body, and is called formative,' [471] is not itself the
   soul, nor ever becomes the soul in the process of generation. But the
   frothy substance of the male semen contains gas (spiritus), and this
   gas is the subject on which the formative power rests, and in which it
   is inherent. [472] So the formative power works out the formation of
   the body, acting in virtue of the soul of the father, the prime author
   of generation, not in virtue of the soul of the offspring, even after
   the offspring comes to have a soul: for the offspring does not generate
   itself, but is generated by the father. [473] This is clear by
   enumeration of the several powers of the soul. The formation is not
   attributable to the soul of the embryo itself on the score of that
   soul's generative power: for that power puts forth no activity till the
   work of nutrition and growth is complete; and besides, its work is not
   directed to the perfection of the individual, but to the preservation
   of the species. Nor can it be assigned to the embryo's nutritive power,
   the work of which is to assimilate nourishment to the body nourished;
   for in this case there is no room for such a work; since nourishment
   taken while the body is in formation is not applied to assume the
   likeness of a pre-existent body, but goes to the production of a more
   perfect form and a nearer approach to the likeness of the father. Nor
   is the development of the embro attributable to its own power of
   growth: for to power of growth there does not belong change of form,
   but only change in bulk. And as for the sensitive and intellectual
   powers, it is clear that theirs is no office bearing on such a
   development. It follows that the formation of the body, particularly of
   its earliest and principal parts, does not proceed from the engendered
   soul, nor from any formative power acting in virtue thereof, but from a
   formative power acting in virtue of the generative soul of the father,
   the work of which is to make another like in species to the progenitor.
   This formative power therefore remains the same in the subject
   aforesaid [474] from the beginning of the formation even to the end.
   But the appearance of the being under formation does not remain the
   same: for first it has the appearance of semen, afterwards of blood,
   and so on until it arrives at its final completeness.

   Nor need we be uneasy in admitting the generation of an intermediate
   product, the existence of which is presently after broken off, because
   such transitional links are not complete in their species, but are on
   the way to a perfect species; and therefore they are not engendered to
   endure, but as stages of being, leading up to finality in the order of
   generation. The higher a form is in the scale of being, and the further
   it is removed from a mere material form, the more intermediate forms
   and intermediate generation must be passed through before the finally
   perfect form is reached. [475] Therefore in the generation of animal
   and man, -- these having the most perfect form, -- there occur many
   intermediate forms and generations, and consequently destructions,
   because the generation of one being is the destruction of another. The
   vegetative soul therefore, which is first in the embryo, while it lives
   the life of a plant, is destroyed, and there succeeds a more perfect
   soul, which is at one nutrient and sentient, and for that time the
   embryo lives the life of an animal: upon the destruction of this, there
   succeeds the rational soul, infused from without, whereas the preceding
   two owed their existence to the virtue of the male semen. [476]

   With these principles recognised, it is easy to answer the objections.

   Arg. 1. Man being an animal by the possession of a sentient soul, and
   the notion of animal' befitting man in the same sense as it befits
   other animals, it appears that the sentient soul of man is of the same
   kind as the souls of other animals. But things of the same kind have
   the same manner of coming to be. Therefore the sentient soul of man, as
   of other animals, comes to be by the active power that is in the male
   semen. But the sentient and the intelligent soul in man is one in
   substance (Chap. [292]LVIII). It appears then that even the intelligent
   soul is produced by the active power of the semen.

   Reply. Though sensitive soul in man and brute agree generically, yet
   they differ specifically. As the animal, man, differs specifically from
   other animals by being rational, so the sentient soul of a man differs
   specifically from the sentient soul of a brute by being also
   intelligent. The soul therefore of a brute has sentient attributes
   only, and consequently neither its being nor its activity rises above
   the order of the body: hence it must be generated with the generation
   of the body, and perish with its destruction. But the sentient soul in
   man, over and above its sentient nature, has intellectual power: hence
   the very substance of this soul must be raised above the bodily order
   both in being and in activity; and therefore it is neither generated by
   the generation of the body, nor perishes by its destruction.

   Arg. 2. As Aristotle teaches, in point of time the foetus is an animal
   before it is a man. [477] But while it is an animal and not yet a man,
   it has a sentient and not an intelligent soul, which sentient soul
   beyond doubt is produced by the active power of the male semen. Now
   that self-same sentient soul is potentially intelligent, even as that
   animal is potentially a rational animal: unless one chooses to say that
   the intelligent soul which supervenes is another substance altogether,
   a conclusion rejected above (Chap. [293]LVIII). It appears then that
   the substance of the intelligent soul comes of the active power that is
   in the semen. [478]

   Reply. The sentient soul, whereby the human foetus was an animal, does
   not last, but its place is taken by a soul that is at once sentient and
   intelligent.

   Arg. 3. The soul, as it is the form of the body, is one being with the
   body. But unity of thing produced, unity of productive action, and
   unity of producing agent, all go together. Therefore the one being of
   soul and body must be the result of one productive action of one
   productive agent. But confessedly the body is produced by the
   productive action of the power that is in the male semen. Therefore the
   soul also, as it is the form of the body, is produced by the same
   productive action, and not by any separate agency.

   Reply. The principle of corresponding unity of produced, production,
   and producer, holds good to the exclusion of a plurality of productive
   agents not acting in co-ordination with one another. Where they are
   co-ordinate, several agents have but one effect. Thus the prime
   efficient cause acts to the production of the effect of the secondary
   efficient cause even more vigorously than the secondary cause itself;
   and we see that the effect produced by a principal agent through the
   agency of an instrument is more properly attributed to the principal
   agent than to the instrument. Sometimes too the action of the principal
   agent reaches to some part of the thing done, to which the action of
   the instrument does not reach. Since then the whole active power of
   nature stands to God as an instrument to the prime and principal agent,
   we find no difficulty in the productive action of nature being
   terminated to a part only of that one term of generation, man, and not
   to the whole of what is produced by the action of God. The body then of
   man is formed at once by the power of God, the principal and prime
   agent, and by the power of the semen, the secondary agent. But the
   action of God produces the human soul, which the power of the male
   semen cannot produce, but only dispose thereto. [479]

   Arg. 4. Man generates his own specific likeness by the power that is in
   the detached semen, which generation means causing the specific form of
   the generated. The human soul therefore, the specific form of man, is
   caused by the power in the semen.

   Reply. Man generates his specific likeness, inasmuch as the power of
   his semen operates to prepare for the coming of the final form which
   gives the species to man.

   Arg. 5. If souls are created by God, He puts the last hand to the
   engendering of children born sometimes of adultery.

   Reply. There is no difficulty in that. Not the nature of adulterers is
   evil, but their will: now the effect which their semen produces is
   natural, not voluntary: hence there is no difficulty in God's
   co-operating to that effect and giving it completeness.

   In a book ascribed to Gregory of Nyssa [480] there are found further
   arguments, as follows:

   Arg. 6. Soul and body make one whole, that is, one man. If then the
   soul is made before the body, or the body before the soul, the same
   thing will be prior and posterior to itself. Therefore body and soul
   are made together. But the body begins in the cutting off, or emission,
   of the semen. Therefore the soul also is brought into being by the
   same.

   Reply. Allowing that the human body is formed before the soul is
   created, or conversely, still it does not follow that the same man is
   prior to himself: for man is not his body or his soul. It only follows
   that one part of him is prior to another part; and in that there is no
   difficulty: for matter is prior in time to form, -- matter, I mean,
   inasmuch as it is in potentiality to form, not inasmuch as it is
   actually perfected by form, for so it is together with form. The human
   body then, inasmuch as it is in potentiality to soul, as not yet having
   the soul, is prior in time to the soul: but, for that time, it is not
   actually human, only potentially so: but when it is actually human, as
   being perfected by a human soul, it is neither prior nor posterior to
   the soul, but together with it.

   Arg. 7. An agent's activity seems to be imperfect, when he does not
   produce and bring the whole thing into being, but only half makes it.
   If then God brought the soul into being, while the body was formed by
   the power of the male semen, body and soul being the two parts of man,
   the activities of God and of the seminal power would be both imperfect.
   Therefore the body and soul of man are both produced by the same cause.
   But certainly the body of man is produced by the power of the semen:
   therefore also the soul.

   Reply. Body and soul are both produced by the power of God, though the
   formation of the body is of God through the intermediate
   instrumentality of the power of the natural semen, while the soul He
   produces immediately. Neither does it follow that the action of the
   power of the semen is imperfect, since it fulfils the purpose of its
   existence.

   Arg. 8. In all things that are engendered of seed, the parts of the
   thing engendered are all contained together in the seed, though they do
   not actually appear: as we see that in wheat or in any other send the
   green blade and stalk and knots and grains and ears are virtually
   contained in the original seed; and afterwards the seed gathers bulk
   and expansion by a process of natural consequence leading to its
   perfection, without taking up any new feature from without. But the
   soul is part of man. Therefore in the male semen of man the human soul
   is virtually contained, and it does not take its origin from any
   exterior cause.

   Reply. In seed are virtually contained all things that do not transcend
   corporeal power, as grass, stalk, knots, and the like: from which there
   is no concluding that the special element in man which transcends the
   whole range of corporeal power is virtually contained in the seed.

   Arg. 9. Things that have the same development and the same consummation
   must have the same first origin. But in the generation of man we find
   the same development and the same consummation: for as the
   configuration and growth of the limbs advances, the activities of the
   soul show themselves more and more: for first appears the activity of
   the sentient soul, and last of all, when the body is complete, the
   activity of the intelligent soul. Therefore body and soul have the same
   origin. But the first origin of the body is in the emission of the male
   semen: such therefore also is the origin of the soul.

   Reply. All that this shows is that a certain arrangement of the parts
   of the body is necessary for the activity of the soul.

   Arg. 10. What is conformed to a thing, is set up according to the plan
   of that to which it is conformed, as wax takes the impress of a seal.
   But the body of man and of every animal is conformed to its own soul,
   having such disposition of organs as suits the activities of the power
   to be exercised through those organs. The body then is formed by the
   action of the soul: hence also Aristotle says that the soul is the
   efficient cause of the body. [481] This could not be, if the soul were
   not in the male semen: for the body is formed by the power that is in
   that semen: therefore the soul has its origin in that emission of it.

   Reply. That the body is conformed and fashioned according to the soul,
   and that therefore the soul prepares a body like unto itself, is a
   statement partly true and partly false. Understood of the soul of the
   generator, it is true: understood of the soul of the generated, it is
   false. The formation of the body in its prime and principal parts is
   not due to the soul of the generated, but to the soul of the generator,
   as has been shown.

   Arg. 11. Nothing lives except by a soul. But the male semen is alive,
   of which fact there are three indications. In the first place, the
   semen is cut off and detached from a living being: secondly, there
   appears in it vital heat and activity: thirdly, the seeds of plants,
   committed to earth, could never warm to life from the lifeless earth,
   had they not life in themselves.

   Reply. The semen is not alive actually, but potentially, and has a
   soul, not actually, but virtually. [482] In the process of generation
   the embryo comes to have a vegetative and a sentient soul by the virtue
   of the semen, which souls do not endure, but pass away and are
   succeeded by a rational soul.

   Arg. 12. If the soul is not before the body (Chap. [294]LXXXIII), nor
   begins with the liberation of the semen, it follows that the body is
   first formed, and afterwards there is infused into it a soul newly
   created. But if this is true, it follows further that the soul is for
   the body: for what is for another appears after it, as clothes are for
   men and are made after them. But that is false: rather the body is for
   he soul, as the end is ever the more noble. We must say then that the
   origin of the soul is simultaneous with the emission of the semen.
   [483]

   Reply. There are two ways of one thing being for another.' A thing may
   be to serve the activity, or secure the preservation, or otherwise
   promote the good of another, presupposing its being; and such things
   are posterior to that for which they are, as clothes for the person, or
   tools for the mechanic. Or a thing may be for another' in view of that
   other's being: what is thus for another' is prior to it in time and
   posterior to it in nature. In this latter way the body is for the soul,
   as all matter is for its form. The case would be otherwise, if soul and
   body did not make one being, as they say who take the soul not to be
   the form of the body. [484]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [465] Contra determinatam veritatem. Determinare in scholastic Latin
   means to draw a conclusion. A bachelor in a mediaeval University was a
   determinator, one who set up theses and defended them. -- In fusing
   these two chapters together I have commenced with the introduction
   prefixed to Chap. LXXXIX.

   [466] In calling this opinion false,' St Thomas can never have meant to
   deny the intimate connexion of the vital acts of the embryo with those
   of the mother, so that separation from the mother at an early stage by
   abortion or miscarriage is death. He means only that the mother is not
   everything, -- that the embryo has vital acts of its own, though not
   independent acts; that the embryo lives and developes, which it could
   not do without a distinct vegetative soul to animate it. But when he
   presently goes on to attribute operations of sense to the embryo, and
   says that it feels, -- speaking of the embryo ante ultimum
   complementum, -- he outruns all probability. Feeling supposes an
   advanced development of the nervous system. It is impossible to believe
   that the merely cellular embryo, with only a potential nervous system,
   can feel.

   [467] "What is in potentiality to life is not the [dead body], which
   has parted with its soul (to apobeblekos ten psuchen), but that [living
   body] which retains it: as for the seed and fruit, it is potentially
   the particular body [into which it will develope]," De anima, II, i. St
   Thomas's explanation of to apobeblekos is ingenious but mistaken.

   [468] No one now supposes this, but what is supposed is that the
   infusion even of the rational soul takes place the moment the female
   ovum is fertilised.

   [469] In the phrase which he constantly repeats, decisio seminis, St
   Thomas interprets decisio as any scholar would interpret it, to be a
   derivative of decido (I cut off). Still, I suspect, whoever first used
   the phrase meant decisio to come from decido (I fall down), which would
   yield a more natural sense. To decisio, as meaning a cutting off,' is
   due to the false analogy of the divided earthworm.

   [470] Read fit rationalis for sit; and for intrinsecus read
   extrinsecus, answering to the celebrated thurathen of the passage just
   quoted from De gen. animal., II, iii.

   [471] According to Aristotle, De gen. animal., and therefore according
   to St Thomas, no bodily matter of the male semen ever becomes a
   constituent of the body of the embryo: that is entirely taken from the
   mother. What the male semen furnishes is a certain motive power,
   dunamis kai kinesis, which causes conception and carries the embryo
   through the stages of its development. This is the formative power'
   here spoken of. Offspring is said to be of father and mother, "as a
   couch is of a carpenter and timber" (De gen. animal., I, xxi), the male
   semen being as the tool, which, wielded by the carpenter, makes the
   couch, but is not the material of which the couch is made. So (I,
   xxii): "The male semen is no part of the embryo: . . . . but nature
   uses it as an instrument and actually efficient cause, as is the
   efficiency of tools in products of art." Pursuant to this doctrine,
   Aristotle expresses himself in a way not unfavourable to traducianism
   in regard of the sentient soul: -- "The body is from the female, but
   the soul is from the male, for the soul gives formal being to a certain
   body"; esti de to men soma ek tou theleos, he de psuche ektou arrenos;
   he gar psuche ousia somatos tinos esti (II, iv): which is explained
   (II, v), "the female supplies the material, but the male the principle
   of motion": hulen men oun parechei to thelu, ten de archen tes kineseos
   ho arren. In the same De gen. animal., II, v, Aristotle goes on to say
   that the soul which the male parent imparts is not the vegetative soul,
   -- for that is already in the material supplied by the female, -- but
   the sentient soul: empoiei gar touto (to arren) ten aisthetiken psuchen
   e di hautou e dia tes gones. A sentient soul, he adds, is necessary
   from the first, for the formation of what is to be not a mere
   vegetative but a sentient body.

   [472] This crude morphology takes up a chapter in Aristotle, De gen.
   animal., II, ii, e.g., esti men oun to sperma koinon pneumatos kai
   hudatos, to de pneuma estin thermos aer . . . . dio hugron ten phusin
   hoti ex hudatos pachu de kai leukon dia to memichthai pneuma . . . .
   aition de tes leukotetos tou spermatos hoti estin he gone aphros, ho de
   aphros leukon. In the following chapter (chap. iii) we read that the
   heat of this gas' (pneuma), or hot air' (thermos aer), contained in the
   frothy mass of the semen (emperilambanomenon en to aphrodei) is the
   generative element, -- poiei gonima ta spermata. The heat "is not fire,
   nor any such elemental power, but is analogous to the element of which
   the stars are made." It is otherwise described as "the quality of the
   gas," he en to pneumati phusis: it is once more the vis formativa, or
   virtus seminis of St Thomas. Whether this seminal power, supplied by
   the male, is (or becomes) the sentient soul, according to the opinion
   just refuted, or rather leads to the sentient soul being produced, as
   St Thomas proceeds to argue, makes the question discussed in the text.
   Aristotle comes not far short of saying that it is the sentient soul.

   [473] How if the father happen to be dead? Answer that the reference is
   not to the soul as it is in the father's body, but as the virtue of it
   is somehow carried by the genetic element that has come from him and
   has been taken up by the embryo.

   [474] In spiritu praedicto, which I render in the aforesaid subject':
   because the spiritus, pneuma, or gas' that made according to Aristotle
   to en to spermati aphrodes te kai leukon, has been declared by St
   Thomas to be the proper subject' in which the formative power' inheres.
   Spiritus was a vague word to a mediaeval writer: it was fraught with
   suggestions high and divine. St Thomas would have shrunk from reducing
   spiritus, to the mysterious vehicle of the vis formativa seminis, to
   the banality of gas. But the pneuma of De gen. animal., II, ii, the
   authority on which he relied, is gas pure and simple. As a piece of
   morphology, all this speculation about pneuma, aphros, spiritus, spuma,
   gas and foam, must be swept away. It is false, as we have seen the
   analogy of a bisected Annelid to be false. The cutting of a worm in two
   is no example of the generative process; and there is no such thing in
   any semen as this genetic gas. Chemical and microscopic examination of
   the mammalian semen reveal quite another structure and composition. So
   far as biology sees it, what actually happens in conception is this: --
   "Wherever they meet the female ovum, the male spermatozoa surround it,
   often in dense masses. Only one spermatozoon however effects an
   entrance into the ovum, after the following fashion. The tail is left
   behind, and the nucleated head with the centrosome passes into the
   ovum, generally as a place called the micropyle.' Certain changes have
   been going on in the ovum to anticipate this event, and the renewed
   nucleus of the ovum is awaiting developments. This is known as the
   female pronucleus.' Certain changes prepare the nucleated head of the
   spermatozoon for action, and what is known as the male pronucleus'
   results. The male pronucleus proceeds to fuse with the female
   pronucleus, and a new nucleus, the result of the combination, the
   segmntation nucleus' results. Thus the male element and the female
   element seem to take an equal part in the formation of the embryo: for
   immediately after the combined nucleus is formed, the work of
   segmentation and formation of the tissues goes on. Though fertilisation
   is effected by quite a microscopic quantity, one single spermatozoon
   entering the ovum, we must observe that an equally microscopic part of
   the ovum is fertilised: for the great bulk of what we call the ovum is
   made up of nutritive material, food-yolk, etc." So far, so clear, much
   in advance of St Thomas. But concerning any vis formativa, directrix of
   this wonderful process of conception and development; and about the
   origin and function of soul, vegetative, sentient, and intelligent; we
   remain shrouded in the darkness of the thirteenth century. We want a
   new treatise De anima, to be written by some Aquinas modernus, who
   shall be at once a profound Aristotelian and an expert biologist, and
   shall consecrate his life to this one study of soul. He should not
   neglect the mistaken biology of the original Aquinas and Aristotle. The
   mistakes of great minds are suggestive: they are far-reaching in the
   history of thought. Thus, as one reads Aristotle, De gen. animal., II,
   ii, the memory is carried to St John's Gospel, iii, 5; vi, 63; and his
   first Epistle, v, 8: ean me tis gennethe ex hudatos kai` pneumatos--to
   pneu?ma estin to zoopoioun--to pneuma kai to hudor kai to haima.

   [475] A suggestion of evolution.

   [476] It will be remembered (p. 167) that Aristotle, De gen. animal.,
   II, v, ascribes the vegetative soul to the female, and the sentient to
   the male. I am apt to think that St Thomas knew the work De generatione
   animalium only through some Mahommedan commentator, -- not Averroes,
   for the Commentator always gives the full Aristotelian text. This
   doctrine of three successive souls in man, two perishable and one
   permanent, is noteworthy; and though not now generally accepted, there
   is still something to say for it.

   [477] "A creature is not man as soon as it is animal, nor horse as soon
   as it is animal: it comes to be afterwards that which it is finally to
   be (De gen. animal. II, 3).

   [478] It will be seen that the body of this argument, though not the
   conclusion, is the doctrine combated by St Thomas above, "Nor again can
   it be said," etc., p. 175. St Thomas would not allow that the first
   sentient soul, which he supposes to be infused into man, the human
   foetus, and afterwards to perish, is "potentially intelligent." He
   holds that it does not turn into a rational soul, but simply ceases to
   be, when the rational soul comes in. "The intelligent soul which
   supervenes is another substance altogether" from the sentient soul in
   the mature and intelligent man (Chap. LVIII).

   [479] The human soul' means the rational soul. This reply avails also
   for the modern theory, that the rational soul is infused at conception.
   On the theory which St Thomas adopts, he might have been contented with
   the reply, that the soul which first informs the body is produced by
   virtue of the semen.

   [480] Really, Eunapius. [See p. 154.

   [481] Reference is made to De anima, II, iv. But the statement is not
   there, nothing nearer to it than this, that the soul is the principle
   of local motion, and that the primary soul nourishes the body, i.e.
   presides over and directs the process of nourishment.

   [482] Query, whose soul? Apparently, that of the father: for, according
   to St Thomas, the formative virtue' of the semen is the father's, and
   as his it remains all throughout the process of formation of the body
   of the embryo.

   [483] Why not say, simultaneous conception'? Perhaps that is what the
   objicient meant. The suggestion in the text is evidently absurd, where
   there is no conception.

   [484] My best thanks are due to Reginald Horsley, M.D., formerly
   resident physician at Stonyhurst College, for his trouble in reading
   through these chapters LXXXVI-LXXXIX, and supplying me with such
   biological details as appear in the notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCI--That there are Subsistent Intelligences not united with
   Bodies [485]

   WHEN human bodies perish in death, the substance of the intelligence
   remains in perpetuity (Chap. [295]LXXIX). Now if the substance of the
   intelligence that remains is one for all, as some say, it follows
   necessarily that it has being apart from body; and thus our thesis is
   proved, that some subsistent intelligence exists apart from a body. But
   if a multitude of intelligent souls remain after the destruction of
   their bodies, then some subsistent intelligences will have the property
   of subsisting without bodies, all the more inasmuch as it has been
   shown that souls do not pass from one body to another (Chap
   [296]LXXXIII). But the property of subsisting apart from bodies is an
   incidental property in souls, since naturally they are the forms of
   bodies. But what is ordinary must be prior to what is incidental. There
   must then be some subsistent intelligences naturally prior to souls;
   and to these intelligences the ordinary property must attach of
   subsisting without bodies.

   3. The higher nature in its lowest manifestation touches the next lower
   nature in its highest. But intelligent nature is higher than corporeal,
   and at the same time touches it in some part, which is the intelligent
   soul. As then the body perfected by the intelligent soul is highest in
   the genus of bodies, so the intelligent soul united to the body must be
   lowest in the genus of subsistent intelligences. There are then
   subsistent intelligences not united with bodies, superior in the order
   of nature to the soul. [486]

   7. The substance of a thing must be proportionate to its activity,
   because activity is the actualisation and perfection of an active
   substance. But understanding is the proper activity of an intelligent
   substance. Therefore an intelligent substance must be competent for
   such activity. But understanding is an activity not exercised through
   any bodily organ, and not needing the body except in so far as objects
   of understanding are borrowed from objects of sense. But that is an
   imperfect mode of understanding: the perfect mode of understanding is
   the understanding of those objects which are in themselves
   intelligible: whereas it is an imperfect mode of understanding when
   those things only are understood, which are not of themselves
   intelligible, but are rendered intelligible by intellect. [487] If then
   before everything imperfect there must be something perfect in that
   kind, [488] there must be antecedently to human souls, which understand
   what they gather from phantasms, sundry subsistent intelligences which
   understand things in themselves intelligible, not gathering their
   knowledge from sensible objects, and therefore in their nature separate
   from anything corporeal.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [485] In other words, there are angels.

   [486] There is a vast lacuna in nature, if nothing in the scale of
   being intermediates between man and God. It may be said that
   disembodied spirits so intermediate, especially if we allow, what St
   Thomas does not, that, once parted from the body, the soul expands into
   a perfect spiritual substance, with no remaining natural exigency of
   reunion with the body. Yet even so, if spirits exist which have been in
   bodies, why not other spirits which never have been in bodies?
   Throughout this argument we cannot travel beyond congruity. For the
   fact of the existence of angels we require either experience, which we
   have not, or divine revelation, which we have.

   [487] He means material and sensible things, which become intelligible
   only by the understanding forming universal concepts to view them with.
   See p. 146.

   [488] Another expression of the Aristotelian and scholastic principle,
   that the actual precedes the potential.

   CHAPTER XCIII--That Intelligences subsisting apart are not more than
   one in the same Species [489]

   INTELLIGENCES subsisting apart are subsistent essences. Now the
   definition of a thing being the mark of its essence, is the mark of its
   species. Subsistent essences therefore are subsistent species.

   2. Difference in point of form begets difference of species, while
   difference in point of matter begets difference in number. But
   intelligences subsisting apart have nothing whatever of matter about
   them. Therefore it is impossible for them to be several in one species.

   4. The multiplication of species adds more nobility and perfection to
   the universe than the multiplication of individuals in the same
   species. But the perfection of the universe consists principally in
   intelligences subsisting apart. Therefore it makes more for the
   perfection of the universe that there should be many intelligences
   different in species than many different in number in the same species.
   [490]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [489] In other words, that every angel is a species by himself, and is
   definable, being the one possible object answering the definition

   [490] A sort of canon of cosmic architecture. And in the architecture
   of human hands it makes more for the beauty of a frieze to have a
   procession of various figures, like the procession of Athenian knights
   in the frieze of the Parthenon, than to have one cast reproduced all
   round, suggestive of so much a foot. It makes for the beauty, and adds
   to the expense, but with the Creator there is no question of expense.
   But is not every human character the presentation of a distinct
   history, and every human face and form expressive of an individuality
   all its own?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCIV--That an Intelligence subsisting apart and a Soul are not
   of one Species

   A DIFFERENT type of being makes a different species. But the being of
   the human soul and of an intelligence subsisting apart is not of one
   type: the body can have no share in the being of a separately
   subsisting intelligence, as it can have in the being of the human soul,
   united with the body as form with matter.

   3. What makes a species by itself cannot be of the same species with
   that which does not make a species by itself, but is part of a species.
   Now a separately subsisting intelligence makes a species by itself, but
   a soul not, it is part of the human species.

   4. The species of a thing may be gathered from the activity proper to
   it: for activity shows power, and that is an indication of essence. Now
   the proper activity of a separately subsisting intelligence and of an
   intelligent soul is understanding. But the mode of understanding of a
   separately subsisting intelligence is quite different from that of the
   soul. The soul understands by taking from phantasms: not so the
   separately subsisting intelligence, that has no bodily organs in which
   phantasms should be. [491]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [491] Throughout this chapter St Thomas confines himself to the human
   soul still informing the body.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCVI--That Intelligences subsisting apart do not gather their
   Knowledge from Objects of Sense

   A HIGHER power must have a higher object. But the intellectual power of
   a separately subsisting intelligence is higher than the intellectual
   power of the human soul, the latter being lowest in the order of
   intelligences (Chap. [297]LXXVII). Now the object of the intelligence
   of the human soul is a phantasm (Chap. [298]LX), which is higher in the
   order of objects than the sensible thing existing outside and apart
   from the soul. [492] The object therefore of a separately subsisting
   intelligence cannot be an objective reality (res) existing outside the
   soul, as though it could get knowledge immediately from that; nor can
   it be a phantasm: it must then be something higher than a phantasm. But
   nothing is higher than a phantasm in the order of knowable objects
   except that which is an actual term of intelligence. Intelligences
   subsisting apart therefore do not gather their intellectual knowledge
   from objects of sense, but understand objects which are of themselves
   terms of intelligence. [493]

   3. According to the order of intelligences is the order of terms of
   intelligence. But objects that are of themselves terms of intelligence
   are higher in order than objects that are terms of intelligence only
   because we make them so. Of this latter sort are all terms of
   intelligence borrowed from sensible things: for sensible things are not
   of themselves intelligible: yet these sensible things are the sort of
   intelligible things that our intellect understands. A separately
   subsisting intelligence therefore, being superior to our intelligence,
   does not understand the intellectual aspects of things by gathering
   them from objects of sense: it seizes upon those aspects as they are in
   themselves.

   4. The manner of activity proper to a thing corresponds to the manner
   and nature of its substance. But an intelligence subsisting apart is by
   itself, away from any body. Therefore its intellectual activity will be
   conversant with objects not based upon anything corporeal.

   From these considerations it appears that in intelligences subsisting
   apart there is no such thing as active and potential intellect, except
   perchance by an improper use of those terms. The reason why potential
   and active intellect are found in our intelligent soul is because it
   has to gather intellectual knowledge from sensible things: for the
   active intellect it is that turns the impressions, gathered from
   sensible things, into terms of intellect: while the potential intellect
   is in potentiality to the knowledge of all forms of sensible things.
   Since then separately subsisting intellects do not gather their
   knowledge from sensible things, there is in them no active and
   potential intellect.

   Nor again can distance in place hinder the knowledge of a disembodied
   soul (animae separatae). Distance in place ordinarily affects sense,
   not intellect, except incidentally, where intellect has to gather its
   data from sense. For while there is a definite law of distance
   according to which sensible objects affect sense, terms of intellect,
   as they impress the intellect, are not in place, but are separate from
   bodily matter. Since then separately subsistent intelligences do not
   gather their intellectual knowledge from sensible things, distance in
   place has no effect upon their knowledge. [494]

   Plainly too neither is time mingled with the intellectual activity of
   such beings. Terms of intellect are as independent of time as they are
   of place. Time follows upon local motion, and measures such things only
   as are in some manner placed in space; and therefore the understanding
   of a separately subsisting intelligence is above time. On the other
   hand, time is a condition of our intellectual activity, since we
   receive knowledge from phantasms that regard a fixed time. Hence to its
   judgements affirmative and negative our intelligence always appends a
   fixed time, except when it understands the essence of a thing. It
   understands essence by abstracting terms of understanding from the
   conditions of sensible things: hence in that operation it understands
   irrespectively of time and other conditions of sensible things. But it
   judges affirmatively and negatively by applying forms of understanding,
   the results of previous abstraction, to things, and in this application
   time is necessarily understood as entering into the combination. [495]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [492] "Higher in the order of objects" in this, that the phantasm has a
   quasi-spiritual existence in the human mind: on the other hand, lower
   in this, that the sensible thing is a substance, the phantasm an
   accident. It will be remembered that the phantasm is objectum quo, not
   objectum quod (p. 145).

   [493] A term of intelligence' (intelligibile) is what answers to a
   universal concept: it is the scientific aspect of a thing (ratio, p.
   111), what we call the principle' of a thing, as of youth,' manhood,'
   tree,' steam-engine,' as distinguished from the embodiment of that
   principle in these and those particular materials. It is the logos, not
   the pathe. It is what some think Plato to have meant by an idea.'

   [494] St Thomas does not deny the cognition of space to angels and
   disembodied spirits: but he says that distance does not limit their
   knowledge, as it limits our sense-perception, and our knowledge in
   consequence. Even the human mind, having once compassed the idea of a
   thing, thinks of the thing irrespective of distance, e.g., the depths
   of stellar space.

   [495] Mathematical calculations are irrespective of time: they deal
   with the essences of things,' which are timeless, as Aristotle says of
   the relation of the diagonal to the side of the square: time makes no
   difference in that relation. But when an engineer comes to apply such
   calculations to practical work, he re-enters upon considerations of
   time and place. The affirmative and negative judgements spoken of in
   the text make accidental propositions: now accidental propositions
   involve time, e.g., there stood a lion in the way': essential
   propositions do not, e.g., a lion is an animal of the cat tribe.'

   CHAPTER XCVII--That the Mind of an Intelligence subsisting apart is
   ever in the act of understanding

   What is sometimes in actuality, sometimes in potentiality, is measured
   by time. But the mind of an intelligence subsisting apart is above time
   (Chap. [299]XCVI). Therefore it is not at times in the act of
   understanding and at times not.

   2. Every living substance has by its nature some actual vital activity
   always going on in it, although other activities are potential: thus
   animals are always repairing waste by assimilation of nourishment,
   though they do not always feel. But separately subsisting intelligences
   are living substances, and have no other vital activity but that of
   understanding. Therefore by their nature they must be always actually
   understanding.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCVIII--How one separately subsisting Intelligence knows
   another

   AS separately subsisting intelligences understand proper terms of
   intellect; and the said intelligences are themselves such terms, -- for
   it is independence of matter that makes a thing be a proper term of
   intellect; it follows that separately subsisting intelligences
   understand other such intelligences, finding in them their proper
   objects. Every such intelligence therefore will know both itself and
   its fellows. [496] It will know itself, but in a different way from
   that in which the human potential intellect knows itself. For the
   potential intellect is only potentially intelligible, and becomes
   actually such by being impressed with an intellectual impression. Only
   by such an impression does it become cognisant of itself. But
   separately subsisting intelligences by their nature are actually
   intelligible [497] : hence every one of them knows himself by his own
   essence, not by any impression representative of another thing.

   A difficulty: Since all knowledge, as it is the knowing mind, is a
   likeness of the thing known, and one separately subsistent intelligence
   is like another generically, but differs from it in species (Chap.
   [300]XCIII), it appears that one does not know another in species, but
   only so far as the two meet in one common ratio, that of the genus.

   Reply. With subsistent beings of a higher order than we are, the
   knowledge contained in higher generalities is not incomplete, as it is
   with us. The likeness in the mind of animal,' whereby we know a thing
   generically only, yields us a less complete knowledge than the likeness
   of man,' whereby we know an entire species. To know a thing by its
   genus is to know it imperfectly and, as it were, potentially; to know
   it by its species is to know it perfectly and actually. Holding as it
   does the lowest rank among subsistent intelligences, our intellect
   stands in such pressing need of particular detailed likenesses, that
   for every distinct object of its knowledge it requires a distinct
   likeness in itself: hence the likeness of animal' does not enable it to
   know rational,' consequently not man' either, except imperfectly. But
   the intellectual presentation in an intelligence subsisting apart is of
   a higher power, apt to represent more, and leads to a knowledge, not
   less perfect, but more perfect. By one presentation such an
   intelligence knows both animal' and the several specific differentias
   which make the several species of animals: this knowledge is more or
   less comprehensive according to the hierarchical rank of the
   intelligence. [498] We may illustrate this truth by contrasting the two
   extremes, the divine and human intellect. God knows all things by the
   one medium of His essence; man requires so many several likenesses,
   images or presentations in the mind, to know so many several things.
   Yet even in man the higher understanding gathers more from fewer
   presentations: slow minds on the other hand need many particular
   examples to lead them to knowledge. Since a separately subsistent
   intelligence, considered in its nature, is potentially open to the
   presentations whereby being' in its entirety (totum ens) is known, we
   cannot suppose that such an intelligence is denuded of all such
   presentations, as is the case with the potential intellect in use ere
   it comes to understand. [499] Nor again can we suppose that this
   separately subsistent intelligence has some of these presentations
   actually, and others, potentially only. For separate intelligences do
   not change (Chap. [301]XCVII); but every potentiality in them must be
   actualised. Thus then the intellect of the separately subsistent
   intelligence is perfected to the full extent of its capacity by
   intelligible forms, so far as natural knowledge goes. [500]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [496] A proper term of intellect' is a form apart from matter, as
   brightness,' clearness,' lucidity,' apart from this bright button,'
   this clear sky.' The separation of the form apart from matter is either
   physical or logical. Where the separation is logical only, the form
   cannot really exist except in matter; and from matter the human
   intellect gathers it by abstraction and generalisation. The angel
   somehow gathers the same form without having to study the matter in
   which it resides. But when the form is physically distinct from matter,
   - when it subsists by itself, -- such an immaterial, subsisting form
   lives and understands: it is an angel. An angel, according to St
   Thomas, is a personified form, quality, or attribute: what attribute
   exactly, it is not for us to say. We men cannot "count the host of
   heaven, and call them by their names."

   [497] A separately subsisting intelligence, or angel, is an empsuchon
   eidos, or living idea, more or less in the Platonic sense. Now an idea
   is nothing, if it be not a term of intellect. The human mind then comes
   to know itself by getting an idea of something else: the angel knows
   himself always and essentially, because he is an idea.

   [498] According as the angel belongs to a higher or lower choir'.

   [499] "We cannot suppose that such an intelligence is denuded of such
   presentations," because such supposition would involve that
   intelligence in total darkness as to the facts of its environment,
   which darkness would be a stultifying of the whole nature of
   intelligence. The only question can be, how the angelic intelligence
   becomes possessed of these presentations. As we shall see in Chap. C,
   St Thomas takes them to be innate ideas.

   [500] Man is what he becomes by development (phusis): angelic being, as
   such, is a perfect consummation (telos) from the first
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCIX--That Intelligences subsisting apart know Material Things,
   that is to say, the Species of Things Corporeal

   SINCE the mind of these intelligences is perfect with all natural
   endowments, [501] as being wholly actualised, it must comprehend its
   object, which is intelligible being, under all its aspects. Now under
   intelligible being are included the species also of things corporeal.

   2. Since the species of things are distinguished like the species of
   numbers, [502] whatever is in the lower species must be contained
   somehow in the higher, as the larger number contains the smaller. Since
   then separately subsistent intelligences rank higher than corporeal
   substances, all properties that in a material way are in corporeal
   substances must be in these separately subsistent intelligences in an
   intelligible and spiritual way: for what is in a thing is in it
   according to the mode of the thing in which it is. [503]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [501] There are evil angels, "clever devils" (Wellington), the type of
   heathenish intellectualism, as the great Duke saw.

   [502] Every whole number is taken to be a separate species. The maxim
   affords an insight into the scholastic view of the ideal immutability
   and distinct and necessary order of species.

   [503] There must be, for instance, a spiritual fragrance and an
   intellectual velocity. As the parables of the Gospel show -- and indeed
   the whole scheme of bible exegesis supposes it -- the things and the
   doings of this visible material world are types of invisible realities.
   Nature is constructed on hierarchical lines. Our mortal minds ascend
   feebly where the angels descend in their strength, by a sort of Jacob's
   ladder, we by type from earth to heaven, they by antitype from heaven
   to earth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER C--That Intelligences subsisting apart know Individual Things

   INASMUCH as the likenesses representative of things in the mind of a
   separately subsistent intelligence are more universal than in our mind,
   and more effectual means of knowledge, such intelligences are
   instructed by such likenesses of material things not only to the
   knowledge of material things generically or specifically, as would be
   the case with our mind, but also to the knowledge of individual
   existences.

   1. The likeness or presentation of a thing in the mind of a separately
   subsistent intelligence is of far-reaching and universal power, so
   that, one as that presentation is and immaterial, it can lead to the
   knowledge of specific principles, and further to the knowledge of
   individualising or material principles. Thereby the intelligence can
   become cognisant, not only of the matter of genus and species, but also
   of that of the individual.

   2. What a lower power can do, a higher power can do, but in a more
   excellent way. Hence where the lower power operates through many
   agencies, the higher power operates through one only: for the higher a
   power is, the more it is gathered together and unified, whereas the
   lower is scattered and multiplied. But the human soul, being of lower
   rank than the separately subsistent intelligence, takes cognisance of
   the universal and of the singular by two principles, sense and
   intellect. The higher and self-subsistent intelligence therefore is
   cognisant of both in a higher way by one principle, the intellect.

   3. Intelligible impressions of things come to our understanding in the
   opposite order to that in which they come to the understanding of the
   separately subsisting intelligence. To our understanding they come by
   way of analysis (resolutio), that is, by abstraction from material and
   individualising conditions: hence we cannot know individual things by
   aid of such intelligible or universal presentations. But to the
   understanding of the separately subsisting intelligence intelligible
   impressions arrive by way of synthesis (compositio). Such an
   intelligence has its intelligible impressions by virtue of its
   assimilation to the original intelligible presentation of the divine
   understanding, which is not abstracted from things but productive of
   things, -- productive not only of the form, but also of the matter,
   which is the principle of individuation. Therefore the impressions in
   the understanding of a separately subsisting intelligence regard the
   whole object, not only the specific but also the individualising
   principles. The knowledge of singular and individual things therefore
   is not to be withheld from separately subsistent intelligences, for all
   that our intellect cannot take cognisance of the singular and
   individual. [504]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [504] In the days of the schoolmen, as in those of Aristotle, exclusive
   of philosophy and theology, one speculative science alone had attained
   any real development, mathematics. Philosophers therefore drew their
   illustrations from mathematics. Now it is true in mathematics that a
   perfect comprehension of the universal carries a knowledge of all
   subordinate particulars. Whoever comprehended a hexagon completely,
   would know all things that ever could be affirmed of any hexagon, as
   such. And it is only with the hexagon as such, that is to say with the
   hexagon as a form, that the mathematician is concerned: he cares
   nothing about its material. But in the world of natural history, while
   still only the lion, as such, or the fig, as such, is the strict matter
   of science: nevertheless this scientific knowledge is only obtainable
   by observation and experiment upon actual lions, or figs; and
   scientific men busy themselves accordingly about the vicissitudes that
   do actually overtake such existing things. The most thorough
   comprehension of the specific essence of a fig could not instruct a
   man, -- no, nor an angel either, -- on the fact whether there will be a
   plentiful or a poor crop of figs in Palestine in the year 1910. This
   fact, and indeed the whole course of natural history, -- apart from the
   free acts of God and man, and the effect of those acts upon material
   things, is absolutely deducible from a knowledge of the universal
   nature' of physical agents, joined to a knowledge (not contained in the
   universal') of the primitive collocation of materials. But could even
   angelic intellect make this stupendous deduction of the whole history
   of the physical universe from its primary data? We judge of angels from
   the analogy of the human mind. The human mind knows what is called at
   Oxford the manifold' of individual material things through the senses.
   To the intellect of man, away from sensation, this manifold' of
   individuals is unintelligible, as St Thomas also says it is
   unintelligible, because intellect always universalises. How then shall
   pure intelligence, apart from all faculty of sensation, know the
   individual? The analogy, which has been our guide, here breaks down. We
   cannot deny to the angel the cognition of individual things: not, I
   think, even with St Thomas for our guide, can we give a satisfactory
   account of how he has that cognition. If the schoolmen had a fault, it
   was that of explaining too much: though, I dare say, they considered
   many of their explanations merely hypothetical and tentative. See B. I,
   Chapp. [302]VIII, [303]IX. In the Summa Theologica, I, q. 55, art. 2,
   St Thomas more clearly faces the difficulty of attributing to angels
   any knowledge of the actual facts of creation. He acknowledges (art. 1)
   that the mere consciousness of themselves in their own essential nature
   would be insufficient to afford them such knowledge. Therefore he
   supposes that, over and above their essential nature, there was stamped
   upon them at their creation a multitude of intelligible impressions,
   innate ideas in fact, corresponding to the facts of creation; and that
   by knowing themselves, as thus impressed, they know the world. Scotus
   disagrees with St Thomas on this point: indeed it remains a very open
   question. St Thomas's words are (l.c.): "The impressions whereby angels
   understand are not gathered from things but are connatural to the said
   angels. . . . Angels are wholly free from bodies, subsisting
   immaterially in intellectual being: and therefore they gain their
   intellectual perfection by an intellectual efflux, whereby they
   received from God presentations of known things along with their
   intellectual nature. . . . In the mind of an angel there are likenesses
   of creatures, not from the creatures themselves, but from God, who is
   the cause of creatures." But from this it would seem that angels ought
   to know all future events, a corollary rejected by St Thomas, q. 57,
   art. 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CI--Whether to Separately Subsisting Intelligences all Points
   of their Natural Knowledge are Simultaneously Present

   Not everything is actually understood, of which there is an
   intellectual impression actually in the understanding. For since a
   subsistent intelligence has also a will, and is thereby master of his
   own acts, it is in his power, when he has got an intellectual
   impression, to use it by actually understanding it; or, if he has
   several, to use one of them. Hence also we do not actually consider all
   things whereof we have knowledge. A subsistent intelligence therefore,
   knowing by a plurality of impressions, uses the one impression which he
   wishes, and thereby actually knows at once all things which by one
   impression he does know. For all things make one intelligible object
   inasmuch as they are known by one presentation, -- as also our
   understanding knows many things together, when thy are as one by
   composition or relation with one another. But things that an
   intelligence knows by different impressions, it does not take
   cognisance of together. Thus, for one understanding, there is one thing
   at a time actually understood. There is therefore in the mind of a
   separately subsisting intelligence a certain succession of acts of
   understanding; not however movement, properly so called: since it is
   not a case of actuality succeeding potentiality, but of actuality
   following upon actuality. But the Divine Mind, knowing all things by
   the one medium of its essence, and having its act for its essence,
   understands all things simultaneously: hence in its understanding there
   is incident no succession, but its act of understanding is entire,
   simultaneous, perfect, abiding, world without end. Amen.

                                    BOOK III

GOD THE END OF CREATURES
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER I.--Preface to the Book that Follows

   The Lord is a great God, and a great king above all gods. For the Lord
   will not reject his people, because in his hands are all the ends of
   the earth, and the heights of the mountains he beholdeth. For the sea
   is his, and he made it, and his hands have formed the dry land. (Ps.
   xciv).

   IT has been shown above (B. I, Chap. [304]XIII) that there is one first
   of beings, possessing the full perfection of all being, whom we call
   God. Out of the abundance of His perfection He bestows being on all
   things that exist; and thus He proves to be not only the first of
   beings, but also the first principle of all. He bestows being on other
   things, not out of any necessity of his nature, but by the free choice
   of His will, as has been shown (B. II, Chap. [305]XXIII). Consequently
   He is master of the things that He has made: for we have dominion over
   the things that are subject to our will. This His dominion over the
   things that He has brought into being is a perfect dominion, since in
   producing them He needs the aid of no exterior agent, nor any subject
   matter to work upon, seeing that He is the universal efficient cause of
   all being. Of the things produced by the will of an agent every one is
   directed by that agent to some end: for some good and some end is the
   proper object of the will: hence the things that proceed from will must
   be directed to some end. Everything attains its last end by its own
   action, which is directed by Him who has given to things the principles
   whereby they act. It needs must be then that God, who is by nature
   perfect in Himself and by His power bestows being on all things that
   are, should be the ruler of all beings, Himself ruled by none: nor is
   there anything exempt from His government, as there is nothing that
   does not derive being from Him. He is then perfect in government, as He
   is perfect in being and causation.

   The effect of this government appears variously in various natures
   according to the difference between them. Some creatures are brought
   into being by God to possess understanding, to bear his likeness and
   present His image. They not only are directed, but also direct
   themselves by proper actions of their own to their due end. If in the
   direction of themselves they remain subject to the divine guidance,
   they are admitted in course of that guidance to the attainment of their
   last end. Other beings, devoid of understanding, do not direct
   themselves to their own end, but are directed by another. Some of those
   are imperishable; and as they can suffer no defect in their natural
   being, so in their proper actions they never deflect one whit from the
   path that leads to the end prefixed to them, but are indefectibly
   subject to the rule of the prime ruler. [505] Other creatures are
   perishable, and liable to the failure of their natural being, which
   however is compensated by the gain of another: for the perishing of one
   is the engendering of another. In like manner in their proper actions
   they swerve from the natural order from which swerving however there
   accrues some compensatory good. Hence it appears that even apparent
   irregularities and departures from the order of the first rule escape
   not the power of the first ruler. These perishable bodies, created as
   they are by God, are perfectly subject to His power.

   The Psalmist, filled with God's spirit, considering this truth , and
   wishing to point out to us the divine government of things, first
   describes to us the perfection of the first ruler, -- of His nature,
   when he says God; of His power, when he says, is a great Lord, [506]
   needing no co-operation to work the effect of His power; of His
   authority, when he says a great king above all gods, because, though
   there be many rulers, all are subject to His rule. Secondly he
   describes to us the manner of government, -- as well in respect of
   intelligent beings, which follow His rule and gain from Him their last
   end, which is Himself, and therefore he says, for the Lord will not
   reject his people, -- as also in respect of perishable beings, which,
   however they sometimes depart from their proper modes of action, still
   are never let go beyond the control of the prime ruler: hence it is
   said, in his hands are all the ends of the earth, -- likewise in
   respect of the heavenly bodies, which exceed all the height of the
   earth and of perishable bodies, and always observe the right order of
   divine rule: hence he says, and the heights of the mountains he
   beholdeth. Thirdly he assigns the reason of this universal control,
   which is, because things created by God needs must be ruled by Him:
   hence he says, For the sea is his, etc.

   Since then in the first Book we have treated of the perfection of the
   divine nature, and in the second of the perfection of God's power, it
   remains for us in this third Book to treat of His perfect authority, or
   dignity, in as much as He is the last end and ruler of all things. This
   therefore will be our order of procedure, to treat first of God, as the
   final end of all things; secondly of His universal control, whereby He
   governs every creature; thirdly of the special control which He
   exercises in the government of creatures endowed with understanding.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [505] St Thomas instances "the heavenly bodies, the movements of which
   ever proceed uniformly." So men from Plato's time to Newton's
   contrasted the vicissitudes of the sublunary world with the uniformity
   of the heavens above. Newton showed that the same forces are at work in
   the starry heavens as on this earth. In our day the spectroscope has
   shown that the materials of our earth, or sundry of them, enter into
   the composition of the stars. The same instrument reveals stars still
   in process of formation, stars even colliding and exploding. There is
   uniformity in the heavens above and on the earth beneath: not more in
   one than in the other. The ancients under-estimated the regularity and
   uniformity of nature on earth. Their gaze was fixed on catastrophes
   befalling living creatures and man in particular. Yet even in
   catastrophes nature is still uniform, although working to an effect
   which we had not expected. What crosses our expectations, that we call
   evil. But what right have we to expect? Man is not the measure of all
   things, nor is human expectation a law to nature. The heavenly body,'
   corpus coeleste, built of matter fully actuated by its form, and
   therefore imperishable and unchangeable (B. II, Chap. [306]XXX, n.1,
   with note: Sum. Theol. 2-2, q. 24, art. 11, corp.), played a great part
   in the metaphysics and psychology of the Middle Ages. See Chapp.
   LXXXII-LXXXVII of this Book. Little did St Thomas think that if he
   could have altered the point of view of his eye by some millions of
   miles, he would have beheld our planet Earth, the native region of
   generation and corruption, turned into a corpus coeleste, serenely
   resplendent as Venus and Mars, sweeping out in its orbit with the same
   accuracy, neither morning star nor evening star more wonderful. Yet the
   reader of St Thomas will find him not altogether credulous of the
   popular astronomy of his time. He attributes less to the corpus
   coeleste than many of his contemporaries.

   [506] theos megas kurios (LXX), where kurios represents Adonai, and
   Adonai is for Yahweh, clearly the subject, not the predicate. Deus
   magnus Dominus then means Yahweh is a great God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER II.--That every Agent acts to some End

   IN the case of agents that manifestly act to some end, we call that the
   end to which the effort of the agent tends. Gaining that, he is said to
   gain his end; and missing that, he is said to miss his intended end.
   Nor on this point does it make any difference whether the end be tended
   to with knowledge or not: for as the target is the end of the archer,
   so is it also the end of the path of the arrow. [507] The effort of
   every agent tends to some certain end. Not any and every action can
   proceed from any and every power. Action is sometimes terminated to
   some product, sometimes not. When action is terminated to some product,
   the effort of the agent tends to the same. When action is not
   terminated to any product, the effort of the agent tends to the action
   itself. Every agent therefore must intend some end in his action,
   sometimes the action itself, sometimes something produced by the
   action.

   3. It is impossible for the chain of actions to extend to infinity:
   there must then be something, in the getting of which the effort of the
   agent comes to rest. Therefore every agent acts to some end.

   6. Actions are open to criticism only so far as they are taken to be
   done as means to some end. It is not imputed as a fault to any one, if
   he fails in effecting that for which his work is not intended. A
   physician is found fault with if he fails in healing, but not a builder
   or a grammarian. We find fault in points of art, as when a grammarian
   does not speak correctly; and also in points of nature, as in monstrous
   births. Therefore both the natural agent, and the agent who acts
   according to art and with a conscious purpose, acts for an end.

   7. To an agent that did not tend to any definite effect, all effects
   would be indifferent. But what is indifferent to many things, does not
   do one of them rather than another: hence from an agent open to both
   sides of an alternative (a contingente ad utrumque) there does not
   follow any effect, unless by some means it comes to be determined to
   one above the rest: otherwise it could not act at all. Every agent
   therefore tends to some definite effect, and that is called its end.

   Still there are actions that do not seem to be for any end, as things
   done for sport, and acts of contemplation, and things done without
   advertence, as the stroking of the beard and the like: from which
   instances one may suppose that there is such a thing as an agent acting
   not for any end. But we must observe that though acts of contempation
   are not for any other end, they are an end in themselves: as for things
   done in sport, sometimes they are their own end, as when one plays
   solely for the amusement that he finds in play; sometimes they are for
   an end, as when we play that afterwards we may resume work more
   vigorously: while things done without advertence may proceed not from
   the understanding, but from some phantasy or physical principle; yet
   even these acts tend to certain ends, though beyond the scope of the
   intellect of the agent.

   Hereby is banished the error of certain ancient natural philosophers
   (Empedocles and Democritus, mentioned in Aristotle, Physics II, ii, 6)
   who supposed all things to happen by necessity of matter, and
   eliminated final causes from the universe.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [507] What is the end of the path of a snow-flake? St Thomas would
   probably have said that its end was to find the proper place of water,
   which is below air and above earth. But in this chapter he returns a
   more scientific answer: "Every agent tends to some definite effect, and
   that is called its end." Speaking then of physical agencies, and
   remaining in the mere physical order, all that the statement at the
   head of this chapter comes to is this, that physical agents work
   definitely and uniformly: or as Aristotle puts it (De part. animal. I,
   I, 34, 37, 38): "Nature does all things for something: . . . .
   everywhere we say, this for that, wherever there appears an end in
   which the motion terminates, provided nothing comes in the way:
   wherefore it is evident that there is such a thing as what we call
   nature: for it is not anything and everything that comes out of every
   germ, but this out of that."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER III--That every Agent acts to some Good

   THAT to which an agent definitely tends must be suited to it: for it
   would not tend to the thing except for some suitability to itself. But
   what is suitable to a thing is good for it. Therefore every agent acts
   to some good.

   6. An intellectual agent acts for an end by determining its own end. A
   physical agent, though acting for an end, does not determine its own
   end, having no idea of an end, but moves in the direction of an end
   determined for it by another. Now an intellectual agent does not fix
   for itself an end except under some aspect of good: for a term of
   intellect is a motive only under an aspect of good, which is the object
   of will. Therefore a physical agent also does not move or act to any
   end except inasmuch as it is good. Such an agent has its end determined
   by some natural appetite or tendency. [508]

   7. It is part of the same plan of action to shun evil and to seek good.
   But all things are found to shun evil. Intellectual agents shun a thing
   for this reason, that they apprehend its evil: while all physical
   agents, to the full extent of the power that is in them, resist
   destruction, because that is the evil of everything. All things
   therefore act to some good.

   CHAPTER IV--That Evil in things is beside the Intention of the Agent

   WHAT follows from an action different from what was intended by the
   agent, manifestly happens beside his intention. But evil is different
   from good, which every agent intends. Therefore evil happens beside the
   intention.

   2. Failure in effect and action follows upon some defect in the
   principles of action, as a halting gait follows upon crookedness of
   legs. Now an agent acts by whatever of active power he has, not by what
   defect of active power he suffers; and according as he acts, so does he
   intend his end. He intends therefore an end answering to his power.
   Anything therefore that ensues answering to defect of power will be
   beside the intention of the agent. But such is evil.

   4. In agents that act by intellect, or by any sort of judgement, [509]
   intention follows apprehension: for intention tends to that which is
   apprehended as an end. If then experience lights upon something not of
   the species apprehended, the event will be beside the intention: thus
   if one intends to eat honey, and eats gall, taking it for honey, that
   will be beside the intention. But every intellectual agent intends a
   thing according as he takes it for something good: if then it turns out
   not to be good but evil, that will be beside the intention.

   CHAPTERS V, VI--Arguments against the Truth of the Conclusion last
   drawn, with Solutions of the Same

Chapter VI

   FOR the clearer solution of the arguments alleged we must observe that
   evil may be considered either in a substance or in some action of a
   substance. Evil in a substance consists in its lack of something which
   it is naturally apt to have and ought to have. It is no evil to a man
   not to have wings, because he is not by nature apt to have them; nor
   not to have yellow hair, because, though his nature is apt to have such
   hair, still that colour of hair is not due to his nature. But it is an
   evil to him not to have hands, because he is apt by nature to have
   them, and ought to have them, if he is to be perfect; and yet the same
   is no evil to a bird. Every privation, properly and strictly speaking,
   is of something which one is naturally apt to have and ought to have.
   The essence of evil consists in privation, thus understood. Primordial
   matter, being in potentiality to all forms, is naturally in actuality
   without any one particular form that you like to mention. [510] But
   some particular form is due to each of the things that are constituted
   out of such matter. The privation therefore of such a form, in regard
   of primordial matter, is no evil to the nature of primordial matter;
   but in regard of the compound whereof it is the form, it is an evil to
   that compound thing: thus it is evil to incandescent gas (ignis) to be
   deprived of the form of incandescent gas. And since privations are not
   said to be' except so far as they are in a subject, a privation will be
   'simply evil,' when it is evil in regard of the subject in which it is:
   otherwise, it will be evil relatively to something' (malum alicujus),
   but not 'simply evil.'

   Arg. 1 (Chap. V). What happens beside the intention of the agent is
   said to be matter of luck and chance and rare occurrence.' [511] But
   evil is not said to be matter of luck and chance, or rare occurrence,
   but to happen continually, or for the most part: thus in the physical
   order the unmaking of one thing is always attached to the making of
   another; and in the moral order sin is of usual occurrence. [512] This
   does not look like evil arising contrary to intention.

   Reply (Chap. VI). Not everything that is beside the intention of the
   doer need be the result of luck or chance. For if what is beside the
   intention follows upon what is intended either always or frequently, it
   cannot be said to happen by luck or chance. Thus in him who intends to
   enjoy the pleasantness of wine, if from his drinking wind drunkenness
   follows always or frequently, it will be no matter of bad luck or
   chance: but it would be by chance, if it were quite the exception.
   Although then the evil of one thing perishing in course of nature
   follows beside the intention of him who brings the other thing into
   being, such evil nevertheless follows invariably: for invariably to the
   positing of one form there is annexed the privation of another: [513]
   hence this perishing does not happen by chance, nor as the exception,
   though the privation is sometimes not evil simply, but only a relative
   evil, as has been said. But if it be such a privation as to deprive the
   new being produced of what is due to it, it will be matter of chance
   and simply evil, as is the case of monstrous births: for such a mishap
   does not follow of necessity upon what is intended, but is contrary to
   it, since the agent intends the perfection of the being that he
   engenders. -- Evil affecting action happens in physical agents for want
   of active power: hence, if the agent's power is defective, this evil
   happens contrary to intention, yet not by chance, because it
   necessarily follows upon such an agent, when such agent suffers this
   failure of power either always or frequently: but it will be by chance,
   if the failure rarely accompanies such an agent. -- Coming to voluntary
   agents, intention in them must be of some particular good, if action is
   to follow: for universal considerations of themselves do not move the
   will, unless there be added the consideration of the particular
   circumstances under which the action is to take place. If then the good
   that is intended has conjoined with it the privation of rational good
   either always or frequently, there follows moral evil, and that not by
   chance, as is clear in his case who wishes to cohabit with a woman for
   pleasure, while the inordination of adultery is annexed to that
   pleasure: in that case the evil of adultery does not ensue by chance:
   but it would be an evil happening by chance, if upon the thing intended
   there followed some exceptional misadventure, as when one aiming at a
   bird kills a man. That goods of this sort, upon which privations of
   rational good follow, are so generally intended, arises from the
   practice of most men living according to sense, which they do because
   sensible things are more manifest to us, [514] and make more effectual
   motives in the particular circumstances in which our action is cast;
   and many such goods are attended with privation of rational good.

   Arg. 2. Aristotle (Eth. Nic., III, vii) expressly says that wickedness
   is voluntary, and proves it from the fact that men do unjust acts
   voluntarily: but, he adds, it is irrational to pretend that a man
   voluntarily acting unjustly does not wish to be unjust, or voluntarily
   committing rape does not wish to be incontinent; and that is why
   legislators punish wicked men as voluntary evil-doers. It seems then
   that evil is not irrespective of will or intention.

   Reply. Though evil be beside the intention, it is still voluntary, not
   as it is in itself, but incidentally. The object of intention is the
   final end, willed for its own sake: but the object of volition is also
   that which is willed for the sake of something else, though absolutely
   it would not be willed, [515] -- as one throws cargo into the sea to
   save the ship, not intending the casting away of the cargo, but the
   safety of the vessel; and yet willing the casting away of the cargo,
   not simply and absolutely, but for the sake of safety. In like manner,
   for the gaining of some sensible good, one wills to do an inordinate
   action, not intending the inordinateness, nor willing it simply, but
   for that purpose. And therefore in this way wickedness and sin are said
   to be voluntary, like the casting away of cargo at sea.

   Arg. 3. Every process of nature serves as an end intended by nature.
   But destruction is as much a natural change as production: therefore
   its end, which is a privation and counts as evil, is intended by nature
   as much as form and goodness, which are the end of production.

   Reply. From what has been said it appears that what is simply evil is
   altogether contrary to intention in the works of nature, as are
   monstrous births: but what is not simply evil, but only evil in a
   particular relation, is not intended by nature in itself, but
   incidentally.

   [510] In the scholastic theory, materia prima, or primordial matter, is
   never found, as the chemistry books speak, free,' but always in
   composition with some form or another: it cannot be isolated.' Still no
   one form can be mentioned with which it must be compounded, if it is to
   be at all. If I must eat fruit, I need not eat peaches.

   [511] These are three technical terms of Aristotelian philosophy. They
   refer to the category of coexistence, or coincidence, not to sequence.
   They are explained by Aristotle, Physics, II, iv, v, vi: Matter of
   luck, fortuitum, to apo tuches. Matter of chance, casuale, to apo tou
   automatou. Matter or rare occurrence, ut in paucioribus accidens, to me
   hos epi to polu. He tells us (l.c., vi): "Matter of luck is all matter
   of chance, but not all the latter is matter of luck. . . . No inanimate
   thing, nor beast, nor child, ever does anything by luck, because it is
   incapable of deliberate choice. . . . In things done for an end, when
   the action of some external cause was not done to bring about what
   actually happened, we may say that the thing happened by chance: but
   those things happen by luck, which happen by chance, and at the same
   time rank as objects of choice to persons having the faculty of
   choice."

   [512] Aristotle somewhere makes the cynical remark, that things
   generally go wrong, and that most men do evil where they get a chance.

   [515] The presence of a dear friend as a guest at my table is to me an

   is to me an object of will, but not of intention. I should not have
   invited that gentleman by himself. Volition then extends to three acts.
   -- (a) Intention, boulesis (Eth. Nic. III, iv, 7-9), of the end willed
   for its own sake: observe, this use is quite apart from the distinction
   made in English philosophy between intention and motive. (b) Choice,
   proairesis (Eth. Nic. III, iv, 9) of means to the end. (c) Acceptance
   of circumstances attached to the end, or more usually to the means, but
   not in themselves regarded either as good, as in the end, or useful, as
   in the means. I have endeavoured to bring out the practical importance
   of these distinction in my Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 31-35, 203-208,
   222-224.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER VII--That Evil is not a Nature or Essence [516]

   EVIL is nothing else than a privation of that which a thing is
   naturally apt to have and ought to have. But a privation is not an
   essence, but a negation in a substance.

   5. Every essence is natural to some thing. If the essence ranks as a
   substance, it is the very nature of the thing. If it ranks as an
   accident, it must be caused by the principles of some substance, and
   thus will be natural to that substance, though perhaps not natural to
   some other substance. But what is in itself evil cannot be natural to
   anything: for the essence of evil is privation of that which is
   naturally apt to be in a thing and is due to it. Evil then, being a
   privation of what is natural, cannot be natural to anything. Hence
   whatever is naturally in a thing is good, and the want of it an evil.
   No essence then is in itself evil. [517]

   6. Whatever has any essence is either itself a form or has a form,
   [518] for by form everything is assorted in some genus or species. But
   form, as such, has a character of goodness, being the principle of
   action and the end which every maker intends, and the actuality whereby
   every subject of form is perfected. Whatever therefore has any essence,
   as such, is good.

   7. Being is divided into actuality and potentiality. Actuality, as
   such, is good, because everything is perfected by that whereby it
   actually is. Potentiality too is something good: for potentiality tends
   to actuality, and is proportionate to actuality, not contrary to it;
   and is of the same genus with actuality; and privation does not attach
   to it except accidentally. [519] Everything therefore that is, in
   whatsoever way it is, in so far as it is a being, is good.

   8. All being, howsoever it be, is from God (B. II, Chap. [307]VI). But
   God is perfect goodness (B. I, Chap. [308]XLI). Since then evil cannot
   be the effect of goodness, it is impossible for any being, as being, to
   be evil. [520]

   Hence it is said: God saw all things that he had made, and they were
   very good (Gen. i, 31): He made all things good in his own time
   (Eccles. iii, 11): Every creature of God is good (1 Tim. iv, 4).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [516] St Thomas in this and the next two chapters is not arguing that
   there is no evil in the world, but that evil has no substantial being,
   no, nor positive accidental being either: there is no evil substance,
   there is no positive attribute essentially evil: there is good at the
   bottom of everything, even of things evil: there is a right use of
   everything, and a place for all positive being in the scheme of
   creation. He allows that there may be a substance much out of place, as
   a bull in a china shop, a bad man in power, an "embossed carbuncle on
   my flesh." He allows that there are evil attributes, or vices, as the
   next chapter will explain. But a vice is a good quality overstrained,
   or perverted. Pride is an inordinate reaching out to high things: but
   to reach out to high things in itself is a good point in a man.
   Cowardice is an inordinate care of one's own safety, a thing that one
   is bound to have some care of.

   [517] St Thomas here speaks, as philosophers always speak, in the
   universal, not of this individual and that. No natural kind or class,
   as such, either is evil or is the subject of evil qualities, i.e., of
   privations of what is due to nature. The kind, as such, has all things
   that it is proper for its members to have, though sundry members of the
   kind are wanting in some of these things. There are one-eyed men, but
   mankind has two eyes: there are invalids, but the race is healthy.

   [518] Or, as we might say, is either an attribute or a substance.'

   [519] When a thing is in potentiality to some further perfection, it is
   only by accident that it does not attain it. If it were incapacitated
   for that perfection essentially, it would not be in potentiality at
   all. An undergraduate, radically and essentially debarred from taking
   his degrees, would not be an undergraduate. If he is too stupid to take
   it, that is an accident. Stupidity is not of the essence of his
   condition.

   [520] The great contradictor of this fundamental doctrine, -- not to
   mention Schopenhauer, -- is Buddha and Buddhism, which makes all
   conscious thought as such, an evil, and the grand aim of life to be rid
   of it. Manicheism and Platonism complete the circle, by making matter
   evil. Between evil mind and evil matter, we may close our philosophy
   books.

   CHAPTERS VIII, IX--Arguments against the aforsesaid Conclusion, with
   Answers to the same

   ARG. 1. Evil is a specific difference in certain kinds of things,
   namely, in moral habits and acts: for as every virtue in its species is
   a good habit, so the contrary vice in its species is an evil habit; and
   similarly of acts. Evil therefore is something that gives species to
   certain things: it is therefore an essence, and natural to some things.

   Reply. The reason why good and evil are reckoned specific differences
   in moral matters, is because moral matters depend on the will: for a
   thing enters into the sphere of morality inasmuch as it is voluntary.
   But the object of the will is the end in view and good: hence moral
   actions are specified by the end for which they are done, as physical
   actions are from the form of their active principle. Since then good
   and evil are designated according to due bearing on the end, or the
   lack of such due bearing, good and evil must be the first differentias
   marking species in moral matters. But the measure of morality is
   reason. Therefore things must be called morally good or evil according
   as they bear on the end which reason determines. Whatever therefore in
   moral matters derives its species from an end, which is according to
   reason, is said to be good in its species: while what derives its
   species from an end contrary to reason, is said to be evil in its
   species. But that end, though inconsistent with the end which reason
   assigns, is nevertheless some sort of good, as being pleasurable
   according to sense, or the like: hence such ends are good in some
   animals, and even in man when they are moderated by reason; and what is
   evil for one may very well be good for another. And therefore evil,
   inasmuch as it is a specific differentia in the genus of moral matters,
   does not involve anything that is essentially evil, but something that
   is in itself good, but evil to man inasmuch as it sets aside the order
   of reason, which is man's good.

   Arg. 4. All that acts is something. But evil acts inasmuch as it is
   evil: for it understands good and spoils it. Evil therefore, inasmuch
   as it is evil, is some thing.

   Reply. A privation, as such, is no principle of action. Hence it is
   well said that evil does not fight against good except in the power of
   good: but in itself it is impotent and weak and originative of no
   action. Evil is said however to spoil good also formally in itself, as
   blindness is said to spoil sight, or whiteness to colour a wall.

   Arg. 5. Where there is found more and less, there must be an order of
   things, for negations and privations are not susceptible of more and
   less. But we find among evils one worse than another. Therefore evil
   must be some thing.

   Reply. Conditions that imply privation are intensified or relaxed as
   are inequality and unlikeness: for a thing is more unequal according as
   it is further removed from inequality, and more unlike according as it
   is more removed from likeness: hence a thing is more evil according as
   it is a greater privation of good, or at a greater distance from good.
   [521]

   Arg. 6. Thing and being are convertible terms. But evil is in the
   world. Therefore it is some thing and nature.

   Reply. Evil is said to be' in the world, not as having any essence, or
   existing as a thing, but in the way in which a thing is' evil precisely
   by evil, as blindness, an in the way in which any privation is said to
   be,' inasmuch as an animal is' blind by blindness. For there are two
   senses of being': in one sense it means the essence of a thing, and is
   divided into the ten predicaments; [522] and in this sense no privation
   can be called a being: in another sense, it signifies the truth of an
   affirmative proposition (veritatem compositionis); and thus evil and
   privation is said to be a being, inasmuch as a thing is said to be'
   thereby under a privation.

   CHAPTER X--That the Cause of Evil is good

   WHAT is not, is cause of nothing: every cause must be some being. But
   evil is not any being (Chapp. [309]VII, [310]IX): therefore evil cannot
   be the cause of anything. If then evil is caused by anything, what
   causes it must be good.

   4. Every cause is either material, formal, efficient, or final. But
   evil can be neither matter nor form: for it has been shown (Chapp.
   [311]VII, [312]IX) that both actual being and potential being is good.
   In like manner evil cannot be an efficient cause, since everything acts
   according as it is actually and has a form. Nor can it be a final
   cause, since it is beside the intention (Chap. [313]IV). Evil therefore
   cannot be the cause of anything; and therefore, if there be any cause
   of evil, it must be caused by good.

   But since good and evil are opposites, and one opposite cannot be cause
   of another except accidentally, it follows that good cannot be the
   active cause of evil except accidentally. In physics, this accident may
   happen either on the part of the agent or on the part of the effect. On
   the part of the agent, when the agent suffers from a lack of power,
   whence it follows that the action is defective and the effect
   deficient. But to an agent, as such, it is quite an accident to suffer
   from a lack of power: for an agent does not act inasmuch as power is
   lacking to him, but according as he has anything of power. Thus then
   evil is caused accidentally on the part of the agent, inasmuch as the
   agent runs short of power: therefore it is said that evil has not got
   an efficient cause, but a deficient cause, because evil does not follow
   from an efficient cause except in so far as it is deficient in power,
   and in this respect is is not efficient. It comes to the same thing if
   the defect of the action and effect arises from some defect of the
   instrument, or of any other thing requisite for the agent's action, as
   when motive power produces halting through crookedness of the
   shin-bone: for the agent acts by both the power and the instrument. On
   the part of the effect evil is caused accidentally as well in respect
   of the matter of the effect as also in respect of its form. For if the
   matter is indisposed to receive the impression of the agent, some
   defect must follow in the effect. Nor is it imputable to any defect of
   the agent, that it does not transmute an indisposed matter to a perfect
   act: for the power of every natural agent is determined according to
   the limit of its nature; and its failure to transcend that cannot be
   brought in against it as a defect in power: such defect can then only
   be argued when it falls short of the measure of power due to it by
   nature. On the part of the form of the effect evil is accidentally
   incident, inasmuch as one form necessarily involves the privation of
   another form, and with the production of one thing there must needs
   ensue the destruction of another. But this evil does not belong to the
   effect intended by the agent, but attaches to something else. In the
   processes of nature therefore evil is caused by good only accidentally.
   The same is the case also in the processes of art: for art in its
   operation imitates nature, and is at fault in the same way as nature.

   But in moral matters the case seems to be different. For a flaw in
   morals does not follow from any lack of power, seeing that weakness
   either entirely removes, or at least diminishes, moral
   reprehensibleness: for weakness does not deserve the punishment which
   is due to fault, but rather compassion and indulgence: to be
   blameworthy, a point of conduct must be a voluntary act, not an
   inevitable necessity. On careful consideration we find that the case of
   morals is in some respects like, in some respects unlike the case of
   physics. The unlikeness consists in this, that a moral fault is viewed
   as consisting in the action alone, not in any effect produced: for
   moral virtues are not effective, but active, while arts are effective;
   and therefore it has been said that art is at fault in the same way as
   nature. Moral evil therefore is not estimated according to the matter
   and form of the effect, but follows simply from the agent. Now in moral
   actions there are found in orderly enumeration four active principles.
   One principle is the executive power, namely, the motor power which
   moves the limbs to execute the command of the will. This power is moved
   by the will, and so the will is another principle. The will is moved by
   the judgement of the apprehensive faculty, which judges the particular
   thing proposed to be good or bad. -- good and bad being the (formal)
   objects of the will, the one object of seeking, the other of avoidance.
   Lastly, the apprehensive faculty is moved by the thing apprehended. The
   first active principle then in moral actions is the thing apprehended;
   the second is the apprehensive faculty; the third is the will; the
   fourth is motor power which executes the command of reason. But the act
   of the executive power already presupposes moral good or evil; [523]
   for these exterior acts bear a moral character only in so far as they
   are voluntary. Hence if the act of the will is good, the exterior act
   will also be called good; and evil, if the volition is evil. It would
   be no point of moral badness for the exterior act to fail by some
   defect unconnected with the will: thus lameness is not a moral but a
   natural blemish. Such a lack of executive power diminishes, if it does
   not totally excuse from, moral blemish. Again, the act whereby the
   object moves the apprehensive faculty is exempt from moral blemish: for
   it is according to the order of nature that what is visible affects the
   sight, and every object affects the corresponding passive potentiality.
   Even the act of the apprehensive faculty, considered in itself, is
   nowise morally blameworthy, as we see that any defect in it excuses
   from or diminishes moral blame, like the lack of executive power: for
   infirmity and ignorance alike excuse from sin, or diminish it. It
   remains then that moral blameworthiness is found first and foremost in
   the act of the will alone; and reasonably so, since an act is called
   moral' from being voluntary. In the act of the will then is to be
   sought the root and origin of what in the moral order is sin.

   But this investigation leads us into an apparent difficulty. On the
   understanding that defect in an act arises from some defect in the
   principle of action, some defect in the will must be presupposed before
   there can be any moral fault. If this defect is natural, it is ever
   inherent in the will; and the consequence is that the will must always
   do wrong in action, a consequence proved false by the fact of there
   being such things as acts of virtue. On the other hand, if the defect
   is voluntary, that is already a moral fault, the cause of which must
   stand over for further enquiry; and so we shall have a running account
   to infinity. We must therefore say that the defect pre-existing in the
   will is no natural necessity, otherwise it would follow that the will
   sinned in every act: nor again is a thing of chance and ill luck, for
   at that rate there could be in us no moral fault, since events of
   chance are unpremeditated and beyond the control of reason. The defect
   therefore is voluntary, but not a moral fault: so we must suppose to
   save the account running to infinity.

   Now we must consider how that can be. In every active principle the
   perfection of its power depends on some superior active principle: for
   a secondary agent acts by virtue of the power of the prime agent. [524]
   So long then as the secondary agent remains under the power of the
   prime agent, it will act unfailingly: but it will fail in its action
   whenever it happens to swerve from the order of the prime agent, as
   appears in an instrument when it ceases to respond to the movement of
   the agent who uses it. Now it has been said above that in the order of
   moral actions principles go before volition, the apprehensive faculty
   and the object apprehended, which is the end in view. But since to
   everything movable there corresponds a proper motive power, not any and
   every apprehensive faculty is the due motive power of any and every
   appetite, [525] but one apprehension is the proper motive of one
   appetite, another of another. As then the sensible apprehensive faculty
   is the proper motive power of the sensible appetite, so the proper
   motive power of the will is reason itself. Further, as reason can
   apprehend many sorts of good things and many ends of action; as
   moreover every power has its own proper end; the will also must have
   some object and end of action and prime motive, and that must be not
   any and every sort of good, but some definite good. Whenever then the
   will tends to act under the motive of an apprehension of reason
   representing to it its own proper good, a due action ensues. But when
   the will bursts out into action upon the apprehension of the sensible
   apprehensive faculty, or even upon the apprehension of reason itself,
   representing some other good than the proper good of the will, there
   ensues in the action of the will a moral fault. [526] Therefore any
   faulty action in the will is preceded by a lack of due regard to reason
   and to the proper end of willing. I say a lack of due regard to
   reason,' in such cases as when, upon some sudden aprehension of sense,
   the will tends to some good that is pleasant according to sense. I say
   a lack of due regard to the proper end of willing,' in cases when the
   reason arrives by reasoning at some good, which is not either now or in
   this way good, and still the will tends to it as though it were its
   proper good. Now this lack of due regard is voluntary: for it is in the
   power of the will to will and not to will: it is likewise in its power
   to direct reason actually to consider or to cease from considering, or
   to consider this or that. [527] Still this failure of due consideration
   is not a moral evil: for, consideration or no consideration, or
   whatever the consideration be on reason's part, there is not sin until
   the will comes to tend to some undue end, which then is an act of will.
   -- Thus it remains true that in moral as well as in physical actions,
   evil is not caused by good except accidentally.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [523] The hand can do neither good nor evil morally, except as the
   minister of a will already made up to either one or the other.

   [524] This axiom is redolent of the primum mobile. Taking a more modern
   view of the physical order, we may say that no agent acts to any
   orderly purpose except in concert with other agents, with which it is
   bound up in the unity of one system. Modern science tells not so much
   of subordination as of co-ordination, -- of a polity, but not of a
   monarchy among material forces.

   [525] The word appetitus in scholastic terminology includes the will;
   and apprehensive faculty' belongs to intellect and also to sense.

   [526] A man acts upon sensible apprehension to the neglect of rational,
   when he suffers himself to be overcome by wine and women. A man acts
   under the prompting of reason, suggesting a rational good other than
   the proper object of his will, when he asserts his independence against
   lawful authority. Independence is a rational good in itself, but this
   independence is not the proper good of this man. Pride was not made for
   man (Ecclus. x, 18), any more than excess in drinking. See Ethics and
   Natural Law, p. 112, 113.

   [527] Is the power to consider this or that' anything more than an
   application of the power actually to consider or to cease from
   considering'? I merely move the question, which is one of some
   subtlety. -- The latter half of this chapter contains the one
   thorough-going refutation, perhaps, ever given of the determinism of
   Socrates and Plato, who reduced moral to intellectual error, and put it
   beyond the control of the will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XI--That Evil is founded in some Good

   EVIL cannot exist by itself, having no essence (Chap. [314]VII): it
   must therefore be in some subject: but every subject, being a
   substance, is some good.

   3. A thing is called evil because it does harm: that can only be
   because it does harm to good: for to do harm to evil is a good thing,
   since the undoing of evil is good. But it would not do harm to good,
   formally speaking, unless it were in good: [528] thus blindness does
   harm to a man inasmuch as it is within him.

   But since good and evil are opposites, and one opposite cannot be the
   subject of another, but expels it, it seems at first sight strange if
   good is said to be the subject of evil. But if the truth is sought out,
   we shall find nothing strange or awkward in this conclusion. Good is
   commonly predicated as being is predicated, since every being, as such,
   is good. It is not strange that not-being should be in being as its
   subject: for every privation is some not-being, and still its subject
   is a substance, which is a being. Still not-being has not for its
   subject the being that is its opposite: thus sight is not the subject
   in which blindness is, but the animal. So the subject in which evil is,
   is not the good opposed to it, for that is taken away by the evil, but
   some other good. Thus the subject of moral evil is natural good: while
   natural evil, which is a privation of form, is in matter, and matter is
   good, as also is potential being.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [528] Formally speaking,' i.e., as a constituent element from within,
   as distinguished from an efficient cause without.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XII--That Evil does not entirely swallow up Good

   THE subject of evil must always remain, if evil is to remain. But the
   subject of evil is good: therefore good always remains.

   But on the contingency of evil being infinitely intensified, and good
   being continually diminished by that intensification of evil, it
   appears that good may be diminished by evil even to infinity. And the
   good so diminished must be finite, for infinite good is not capable of
   evil. It seems then that in time good may be entirely taken away by
   evil.

   This then is the reply. Evil, as we have seen, entirely takes away the
   good to which it is opposed, as blindness takes away sight: but there
   must remain that good which is the subject of evil, which subject, as
   such, bears a character of goodness, inasmuch as it is in potentiality
   to the actuality of good, whereof it is deprived by evil. [529] The
   less then it is in potentiality to that good, the less good it will be.
   But a subject comes to be less in potentiality, or openness to a form,
   not only by the subtraction of some part of its potentiality, which is
   tantamount to subtraction of part of the subject itself, but also by
   the said potentiality being impeded by some contrary act from issuing
   in the actuality of the form. [530] Good therefore is diminished by
   evil rather by the planting of evil, its contrary, than by the taking
   off of any portion of good. And this agrees with what has been already
   said about evil: for we said that evil happens beside the intention of
   the doer, who always intends some good, and upon the good intended
   there follows the exclusion of some other good opposite to that good.
   The greater then the multiplication of that good, upon which, contrary
   to the intention of the agent, evil follows, the greater the diminution
   of potentiality in respect of the opposite good; and so all the more
   may good be said to be diminished by evil. This diminution however of
   good by evil in the physical world cannot go on indefinitely: for all
   the physical forms and powers are limited, and come to some term beyond
   which they cannot go. [531] But in moral matters this diminution of
   good by evil may proceed to infinity: for the understanding and the
   will have no limits to their acts: thus he who wills to commit a theft
   may will it again and commit another, and so to infinity. The further
   then the will tends towards undue ends, the more difficult it becomes
   for it to return to its proper and due end, as may be seen in persons
   in whom the habit of vice has been induced by a custom of sinning. Thus
   then by moral evil the good of natural aptitude may be diminished
   without limit: yet it can never be totally taken away, but always waits
   on nature while that remains.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [529] A potentiality often remote and vain, as the potentiality of
   sight when the eye is gouged out, or the potentiality of truth and
   justice in the devil. But the fact remains that all positive physical
   being, as such, is of itself good; and however it be beset with evil,
   that circumstance is strictly accidental. Cf. Heb. xii, 1, besetting
   sin. Sin besets, but never quite absorbs, the work of God. -- Besides,
   the philosopher considers the universal, the species, the normal thing,
   rather than the individual and accidental: and the normal state of
   things is good, not evil.

   [530] Thus friendship may be diminished not only by cessation of
   intercourse, but by downright quarrels.

   [531] Thus the virulence of a fever is limited by the strength of the
   patient, a limited quantity: when that is exhausted, the patient dies,
   and the fever with him, -- or anyhow after him, when the microbes have
   devoured the whole man and then one another. But, St Thomas adds, there
   is no limit to the possible wickedness of a man, -- a question which
   may be debated. The reader may remember Sir James Mackintosh's
   celebrated epigram on Henry VIII: "He approached as near to the ideal
   standard of perfect wickedness as the finitudes of human nature will
   allow." St Thomas, always Aristotelian, seems to have had here in view
   Aristotle's saying in the Politics, II, vii: "The wickedness of mankind
   is insatiable: people will bargain for a certain allowance, but no
   sooner is this accorded than they ask for more, and so ad infinitum."
   Or was he haply thinking of the will set in evil, which is
   characteristic of the lost soul for all eternity (B. IV, Chap. XCIII)?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XIV--That Evil is an Accidental Cause

   RUNNING through all the species of causes, we find that evil is a cause
   accidentally. In the species of efficient cause, since through the
   deficiency of power in the active cause there follows defect in the
   effect and action. In the species of material cause, since through the
   indisposition of the matter there follows a defect in the product. In
   the species of formal cause, since to one form there is always annexed
   the privation of another form. In the species of final cause, since the
   evil annexed to an undue end means the hindering of the end that is
   due. [532]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [532] This reasoning evinces, not only that evil is an accidental
   cause, but also that it is caused accidentally, which is the argument
   of Chap. XIII. We have an illustration of this in ordinary language,
   where accident,' mischance,' misfortune,' mistake,' miscarriage,' etc.,
   all stand for things evil.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XV--That there is not any Sovereign Evil, acting as the
   Principle of All Evils

   A SOVEREIGN evil should be without participation in any good, as that
   is the sovereign good which is wholly removed from evil. But there
   cannot be any evil wholly removed from good, since evil is founded on
   good (Chap. [315]XI).

   2. If anything is sovereignly evil, it must be evil by its very
   essence, as that is sovereignly good which is good by its essence. But
   evil has no essence (Chap. [316]VII).

   3. That which is a first principle is not caused by anything. But all
   evil is caused by good (Chap. [317]X). There is therefore no evil first
   principle.

   5. The incidental must be posterior to the ordinary. But evil happens
   only incidentally and beside the intention (Chap. [318]IV). Therefore
   it is impossible for evil to be a first principle.

   Hereby is excluded the error of the Manicheans.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVI--That the End in View of everything is some Good

   THAT to which a thing tends when in absence from it, and in which it
   rests when in possession of it, is the scope and aim and end in view.
   But everything, so long as it lacks the perfection proper to it, moves
   towards gaining that perfection, so far as it depends upon itself so to
   do; and when it has gained that perfection, therein it rests. [533] The
   end then of everything is its perfection. [534] But the perfection of
   everything is its own good. Everything therefore is ordained to good as
   to its end.

   4. Things that are aware of an end and things that are unaware of an
   end are alike ordained to an end, with this difference, that things
   that are aware of an end tend to an end of themselves, while things
   that are unaware of an end tend to an end under the direction of
   another, as appears in the case of archer and arrow. But things that
   are aware of an end are always ordained to good for their end: for the
   will, which is the appetite of a fore-known end, never tends to
   anything except under the aspect of good, which is its object.
   Therefore things also which are unaware of an end are ordained to good
   for their end, and so good is the end of all things. [535]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [533] It will be said, -- An animal moves towards maturity and full
   strength: but therein it does not rest: it moves just as rapidly out of
   its perfection as it moved into it. Not quite so: there is what is
   called helikia kathestosa, 'settled age,' like settled summer weather;
   and the more perfect the animal, the longer this settled age endures.

   [534] One Greek word telos, means both end' and perfection.'

   [535] Recent speculations on the 'subconscious' have shown that
   conscious and unconscious action do not stand so widely apart as a
   superficial observation would conclude. St Thomas here, and often
   elsewhere, with Aristotle (see Physics, II, v, 2), bridges over the
   difference between them, arguing the operations of conscious and of
   unconscious nature to be both teleological. But is there an agent whose
   intention or contrivance extends throughout all nature? That is the
   argument of B. I, Chap. XIII, where prime mover' means at once prime
   executor' and prime contriver.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVII--That all Things are ordained to one End, which is God

   THE sovereign good, which is God, is the cause of goodness in all good
   things. He is therefore also the cause of every end being an end, since
   whatever is an end is such inasmuch as it is good. But that whereby
   another thing has an attribute, has more of that attribute itself.
   [536] Therefore God above all things is the end of all.

   4. In every series of ends the last end must be the end of all the ends
   preceding. But we find all things arranged in various grades of
   goodness under our sovereign good, which is the cause of all goodness;
   and thereby, since good bears the character of an end, all things are
   ordered under God as ends preceding under their last end.

   5. Private good is subordinated to the end of the common good: for the
   being of a part is for the sake of the being of the whole: hence the
   good of the race is more godlike than the good of the individual man.
   But the sovereign good, which is God, is the common good, since the
   good of the whole community depends on Him: while the goodness which
   marks any given thing is its own private good, and also the good of
   other things which depend upon it. All things therefore are subordinate
   to the end of one good, which is God.

   7. The last end of every producer, in so far as he is a producer, is
   himself: for the things produced by us we use for ourselves; and if
   ever a man makes anything for another man, that is referred to his own
   good, -- his utility, his pleasure, or his honour. But God is the
   productive cause of all things, either immediately or mediately. And
   therefore He is the end of all.

   Hence it is said: God hath wrought all things for himself (Prov. xvi,
   4): and, I am alpha and omega, the first and the last (Apoc. xxii, 13).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [536] Propter quod est unumquodque, et illud magis, a favourite saying
   of the schoolmen, answering to some such Aristotelian Greek as di hou
   hekaston, kakeino mallon. To defend the saying, we must have at hand
   distinctions between cause' (causa per se) and occasion' (causa per
   accidens); also between having an attribute virtually and in a better
   way' (eminenter) and having it precisely in this form' (formaliter).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVIII--How God is the End of all Things

   GOD is at once the last end of all things, and is nevertheless before
   all things in being. There is an end which, while holding the first
   place in causation according as it is in intention, is nevertheless
   posterior in being; and this is the case with every end that an agent
   establishes by his action, as the physician establishes health by his
   action in the sick man, which health nevertheless is his end. There is
   again an end which is prior in causation, and also is prior in being:
   such an end one aims at winning by one's actions or movement, as a king
   hopes to win a city by fighting. God then is the end of things, as
   being something which everything has to gain in its own way.

   2. God is the last end of things and the prime agent of all (Chap.
   [319]XVII). But an end established by the action of an agent cannot be
   the prime agent: rather it is the effect produced by the agent. God
   therefore cannot be the end of things as though He were anything
   established in being thereby, but only as some pre-existent object for
   them to attain.

   4. An effect tends to an end in the same way that the producer of the
   effect acts for that end. But God, the first producer of all things,
   does not act in view of acquiring anything by His action, but in view
   of bestowing something by His action: for He is not in potentiality to
   acquire anything, but only in perfect actuality, whereby He can give
   and bestow. Things then are not directed to God as though God were an
   end unto which any accretion or acquisition were to be made: they are
   directed to Him so that in their own way they may gain from God God
   Himself, since He Himself is their end.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XIX--That all Things aim at Likeness to God

   ALL things evidently have a natural appetite for being, and resist
   destructive agencies wherever they are threatened with them. But all
   things have being inasmuch as they are likened to God, who is the
   essential subsistent Being, all other things having being only by
   participation. All things therefore have an appetite for likeness to
   God, making that their last end.

   4. All created things are some sort of image of the prime agent, God:
   for every agent acts to the production of its own likeness: [537] now
   the perfection of an image consists in representing its original by
   likeness thereto: the image in fact is made on purpose. All things then
   exist for the attainment of the divine likeness; and that is their last
   end. [538]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [537] That is, to the production of something proportionate to and in
   keeping with itself.

   [538] Some attribute or other of the Creator is relucent in every
   creature, according to the being which it has and the energy it
   displays, not however that attribute which serves best the immediate
   purposes of man, and ministers most to his security and comfort. This
   world is not exactly built for an hotel.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XX--How Things copy the Divine Goodness

   NOT all creatures are established in one and the same degree of
   goodness. The substance of some is form and actuality, -- that is to
   say, something which, in point of essence, has the attribute of actual
   being and goodness. [539] The substance of other beings is composed of
   matter and form: this substance has the attribute of actual being and
   goodness, but only in respect of part of itself, namely, the form.
   While then the divine substance is its own goodness, a simple substance
   (or pure spirit) partakes of this goodness to the extent of its
   essence, but a composite substance to the extent of some part of its
   essence. In this third grade of substance again there is found a
   difference in being. For, composed as they are of matter and form, the
   form of some of them fills the whole potentiality of the matter, so
   that there remains not in the matter any potentiality to any other
   form, and consequently not in any other matter any potentiality to this
   form: such are the heavenly bodies, into the essential constitution of
   which their whole matter enters. [540] In other bodies the form does
   not fill the whole potentiality of the matter: hence there still
   remains in the matter a potentiality to another form, and in some
   portion of matter there remains a potentiality to this form, as appears
   in the (four) elements and bodies composed thereof. Now because a
   privation is a negation in a substance of that which may well be in the
   substance, it is clear that with this form, which does not fill the
   whole potentiality of the matter, there is compatible the privation of
   some form due to that substance. No such privation can attach to a
   substance, the form of which fills the whole potentiality of its
   matter; nor to a substance which is essentially a form; still less to
   that Substance, whose very being is His essence. Further it is clear
   that, since evil is the privation of good, there is in this lowest
   order of substances changeable good with admixture of evil, a
   changeableness to which the higher orders are not liable. [541] The
   substance therefore that ranks lowest in being is lowest also in rank
   of goodness.

   We likewise find an order of goodness among the parts of a substance
   composed of matter and form. For since matter, considered in itself, is
   potential being, [542] while form is the actualisation of that being,
   and the substance composed of the two is actually existent through the
   form, the form will be good in itself; the composed substance will be
   good as it actually has the form; and the matter will be good inasmuch
   as it is in potentiality to the form. But though everything is good in
   so far as it is being, it need not be supposed that matter, as it is
   only potential being, is only potentially good. For being' is an
   absolute term, while there is goodness even in relation: for not only
   is a thing called good' because it is an end, or is in possession of an
   end, but also, though it has not yet arrived at any end, provided only
   it be ordained to some end, a thing is called good' even on that
   account. Though then matter cannot absolutely be called being' on the
   title of its potentiality involving some relation to being, yet it may
   absolutely be called good' on account of this very relation. Herein it
   appears that good' is a term of wider extension than being.'

   Yet in another way does the goodness of the creature fall short of the
   divine goodness. As has been said, God possesses the highest perfection
   of goodness in his mere being: but a created thing does not possess its
   perfection in point of one attribute only, but in point of many: for
   what is united in the highest is multiple and manifold in the lowest.
   [543] Hence God is said to be fraught with virtue and wisdom and
   activity in one and the same respect, but a creature in different
   respects. The greater the distance at which a creature stands removed
   from the first and highest goodness, the greater the multiplication of
   points requisite for it to be perfectly good. But if it cannot attain
   to perfect goodness, it will hold on to an imperfect goodness in a few
   points. Hence it is that, though the first and highest goodness is
   absolutely simple, and the substances nearest to it approach it alike
   in goodness and in simplicity, still the lowest substances are found to
   be more simple than other substances higher than they are, as the
   elements are more simple than animals and men, because they cannot
   attain to the perfection of knowledge and understanding to which
   animals and men attain. [544] It appears therefore from what has been
   said that, though God has His goodness perfect and entire in the
   simplicity of His being, creatures nevertheless do not attain to the
   perfection of their goodness by their mere being, but only by many
   details of being. Hence, though every one of these creatures is good in
   so far as it has being, still it cannot absolutely be called good if it
   is destitute of other qualities requisite for its goodness; as a man
   devoid of virtues and subject to vices is good in a certain way,
   inasmuch as he is a being and inasmuch as he is a man, but on the whole
   he is not good, but rather evil. For no creature then is it the same
   thing to be and to be good, absolutely speaking, although every
   creature is good in so far as it has being: but for God it is quite the
   same thing to be and to be good, absolutely speaking. Now, as it has
   been shown, everything tends finally to some likeness of the divine
   goodness; and a thing is likened to the divine goodness in respect of
   all the points which appertain to its own proper goodness; and the
   goodness of a thing consists not only in its being but in all other
   qualities requisite for its perfection: from which considerations the
   consequence is clear, that a thing is finally ordained to God, not only
   in its substantial being, but likewise in those accidental qualities
   that appertain to its perfection, and also in respect of its proper
   activity, which likewise belongs to the perfection of a thing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [539] Still the essence is limited, and the actual being accordingly
   finite and created. He refers of course to the angels, who are pure
   forms' (B. II, Chap. L).

   [540] Quae ex tota materia sua constant, and are consequently
   incorruptible. Cf. II, Chap. LXVIII. In B. III, Chap. LXXXII (not here
   translated) the heavenly bodies are said to be magis formalia omnibus
   aliis, more thoroughly informed, or possessed by their form. -- Wholly
   devoid of truth as this theory has proved to be, still it has its
   importance in the history of scholastic thought, and is continually
   assumed in the writings of the schoolmen. False in astronomy, the
   theory may yet come true of the bodies of the Saints in the
   resurrection: see IV, Chap. LXXXVI.

   [541] An angel may sin, and may be punished by God: but apparently no
   physical mishap can befall him in the way of accident or disease. May
   not however the state of an angel in sin be described as a guilty
   frenzy?

   [542] It must ever be borne in mind that matter' in this phraseology
   does not mean material substance' (corpus), but the potentiality
   underlying that substance.

   [543] We are told elsewhere that in the highest being there is found
   the unity of differences.

   [544] The greatest minds are simple, -- and deep: little minds may also
   be simple, -- and shallow. Well thought out, this remark of St Thomas
   will explain the riddle how it comes to pass that, while the highest
   being is simple and one, nevertheless in biological and political
   science differentiation of organs marks the higher animal and the more
   highly developed state. There is a poverty-stricken simplicity: there
   is a clumsy multiplicity, a sort of boorish wealth: there is also an
   artistic multiplicity, where every detail is subordinate to one design.
   A cosmos is a matter of unity: a chaos is a manifold.' The grandest and
   highest of beings is a formal unity, actually one, virtually many and
   all.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXI--That Things aim at Likeness to God in being Causes of
   other Things

   A THING must be first perfect in itself before it can cause another
   thing. The last perfection to supervene upon a thing is its becoming
   the cause of other things. While then a creature tends by many ways to
   the likeness of God, the last way left open to it is to seek the divine
   likeness by being the cause of other things, according to what the
   Apostle says, We are God's coadjutors (1 Cor. iii, 9). [545]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [545] In chapter XXII it is argued that the movement of the heavenly
   spheres goes to engender things on earth (motio ipsius coeli ordinatur
   ad generationem). In chapter XXIII it is argued that the movements of
   the heavenly spheres are not done mechanically, but are set up and kept
   going by intelligence, the star-bearing spheres being either all moved
   by God, or all by angels at His bidding, or all by the primum mobile,
   the primum mobile itself being either moved by God, or by an angel, or
   having a soul of its own, but in any case obeying God. "It makes no
   difference," says St Thomas, "to our present purpose, whether the
   heavenly sphere is moved by a subsistent intelligence united with it as
   a soul, or by an intelligence subsisting apart; and whether each of the
   heavenly spheres is moved by God, or whether none of them is moved by
   Him immediately, but they are moved mediately through created spirits;
   or whether the first alone is moved immediately by God, and the others
   through the medium of created spirits; provided it be held that the
   movement of the heavens is the work of spirit."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXIV--That all Things seek good, even Things devoid of
   Consciousness

   AS the heavenly sphere is moved by a subsistent intelligence (Chap.
   XXIII), and the movement of the heavenly sphere is directed to
   generation in sublunary creatures, the generations and and movements of
   these sublunary creatures must originate in the thought of that
   subsistent intelligence. Now the intention of the prime agent and of
   the instrument is bent upon the same end. The heavenly spheres then
   (coelum) are the cause of sublunary motions by virtue of their own
   motion, which is impressed upon them by a spirit. It follows that the
   heavenly spheres are the instrument of spirit. Spirit then is the prime
   agent, causing and intending the forms and motions of sublunary bodies;
   while the heavenly spheres are the instruments of the same. But the
   intellectual outlines of all that is caused and intended by an
   intelligent agent must pre-exist in his mind, as the forms of works of
   art pre-exist in the mind of the artificer, and from that mind (et ex
   eo) those forms must pass into the things made. All the forms then that
   are in sublunary creatures, and all their motions, are determined by
   the forms that are in the mind of some subsistent intelligence, or
   intelligences. Therefore Boethius says that the forms which are in
   matter have come from forms apart from matter. In this respect the
   saying of Plato is verified, that forms existing apart are the
   originating principles of the forms that are in matter: only, Plato
   supposed these forms to subsist by themselves, and to be immediate
   causes of the forms of sensible things; we suppose them to exist in a
   mind, and to cause sublunary forms through the instrumentality of the
   motion of the heavenly spheres.

   Thus it is not difficult to see how natural bodies, devoid of
   intelligence, move and act for an end. For they tend to their end,
   being directed thereto by a subsistent intelligence, in the way that an
   arrow tends to its end, directed by the archer: as the arrow from the
   impulse of the archer, so do natural bodies receive their inclination
   to their natural ends from natural moving causes, whence they derive
   their forms and virtues and motions. Hence it is plain that every work
   of nature is the work of a subsistent intelligence. [546] The credit of
   an effect rests by preference with the prime mover, who guides
   instruments to their purpose, rather than with the instruments which he
   guides. Thus we find the operations of nature proceeding in due course
   and order to an end, like the the operations of a wise man. It is
   evident therefore that even agents devoid of consciousness can work for
   an end, and strive after good with a natural appetite, and seek the
   divine likeness and their own perfection. It is further evident that,
   the more perfect the power and the more eminent the degree of goodness,
   the more general is the appetite for good, and the more distant from
   self are the objects for which good is sought and unto which good is
   done. For imperfect beings tend solely to the good of the individual;
   perfect beings to the good of the species; more perfect beings to the
   good of the genus; and God, who is the most perfect in goodness, to the
   good of all being. Hence some say, not without reason, that goodness as
   such is diffusive of itself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [546] Incidentally and indirectly, Sir Isaac Newton may be said to have
   done as much for theology and psychology as he has done directly for
   astronomy. He has banished from the speculations of the psychologist
   and the theologian all concern about the stars, all interest in corpus
   coeleste and primum mobile. He and his successors have wiped out for
   ever star-worship and astrology; and astronomy thus remaining on their
   hands, they have assorted it among the sciences to which it is nearest
   akin, namely, dynamics and chemistry, to trouble the metaphysician no
   more. -- Of old, men worshipped the stars, as the Hebrew prophets
   reproached the people with adoring all the host of heaven (2 Kings xxi,
   3, 5: Ezech. viii, 16: Jer xix, 13: Amos v, 26: Acts vii, 42). When
   they had ceased to worship, men still believed in the stars, and
   star-carrying crystal spheres, affecting the origin and development of
   planets and animals on earth, and even human thoughts and elections.
   From these fancies Plato is fairly free: he speaks with scant respect
   for the stars in Rep. vii, 529. Nor do they go for much in the genuine
   writings of Aristotle. It was the Oriental genius of the
   Neo-Platonists, and after them the Arabians, that brought in the
   heavenly bodies to the perturbation of mental philosophy. Albertus
   Magnus and St Thomas followed this lead. I may refer to the original
   Latin of the Contra Gentiles, B. III, Chapp. XXII, XXIII,
   LXXXII-LXXXVIII, CIV, CV. St Thomas speaks of the heavenly bodies'
   meaning thereby, not the stars, but the star-bearing crystal spheres.
   The corpus coeleste, the heavenly body' par excellence with him, is the
   tenth and outermost crystalline sphere, which by its diurnal motion
   from east to west controls the motion of all inferior material things,
   and is called the primum mobile. St Thomas argues that this outermost
   sphere itself is moved by some intelligence, either by a soul animating
   it, or by an angel, or immediately by God. Through this primum mobile,
   St Thomas thinks, God governs the universe and fixes the qualities of
   the whole material universe. So the St Thomas of the thirteenth
   century, but no Aquinas Modernus. We must not build our theology on a
   mistaken astronomy. On the whole we may do well, following Newman's
   lead, to seek God certainly in the starry heavens, which are ever
   telling his glory (Ps. xviii), but to seek Him still more in the hearts
   and consciences of men, in the realm of mind rather than in the realm
   of matter. This, according to St Thomas, is the mode of natural
   cognition by which the angels know God, "through study of their own
   substances" (Chap. XLIX). And our soul is a spiritual substance also.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXV--That the End of every Subsistent Intelligence is to
   understand God

   THE proper act of everything is its end, as being its second
   perfection: [547] hence what is well disposed to its own proper act is
   said to be virtuous and good. But to understand is the proper act of a
   subsistent intelligence: that then is its end. And the most perfect
   instance of this act is its final end and perfection: this is
   particularly true of acts which are not directed to production, acts
   such as understanding and feeling. But since such acts take their
   species from their objects, and are known through their objects, any
   given one of these acts will be the more perfect, the more perfect its
   object is. Consequently, to understand the most perfect intelligible
   object, which is God, will be the most perfect instance of the activity
   of understanding. To know God then by understanding is the final end of
   every subsistent intelligence.

   But one may say: It is true that the last end of a subsistent
   intelligence consists in understanding the best intelligible object,
   still the best intelligible object, absolutely speaking, is not the
   best object for this or that subsistent intelligence; but the higher
   any subsistent intelligence is, the higher is its best intelligible
   object; and therefore the highest subsistent intelligence created has
   for its best intelligible object that which is best absolutely; hence
   its happiness will be in understanding God; but the happiness of a
   lower subsistent intelligence will be to understand some lower
   intelligible object, which is at the same time the highest of the
   objects that can be understood by it. And particularly it seems to be
   the lot of the human understanding, on account of its weakness, not to
   understand the absolutely best intelligible object: for in respect of
   the knowledge of that truth of which there is most to be known the
   human intellect is as the bat's eye to the sun.

   Nevertheless it may be manifestly shown that the end of every
   subsistent intelligence, even the lowest, is to understand God. For (a)
   the final end of all beings, to which they tend, is God (Chap.
   [320]XVIII. But the human understanding, however it be lowest in the
   order of subsistent intelligences, is nevertheless superior to all
   beings devoid of understanding. Since then the nobler substance has not
   the ignobler end, God Himself will be the end also of the human
   understanding. But every intelligent being gains its last end by
   understanding it. Therefore it is by understanding that the human
   intellect attains God as its end.

   (c). Everything most of all desires its own last end. But the human
   mind is moved to more desire and love and delight over the knowledge of
   divine things, little as it can discern about them, than over the
   perfect knowledge that it has of the lowest things. [548]

   (e). All sciences and arts and practical faculties are attractive only
   for the sake of something else: for in them the end is not knowledge
   but production of a work. But speculative sciences are attractive for
   their own sake, for their end is sheer knowledge. Nor is there found
   any action in human life, with the exception of speculative study,
   which is not directed to some other and further end. Even actions done
   in sport, which seem to be done in view of no end, have a due end,
   which is refreshment of mind, to enable us thereby to return stronger
   to serious occupations: otherwise we should play always, if play was
   sought for its own sake, which would be unbefitting. [549] Therefore
   the practical arts are ordained to the speculative, and all human
   activity has intellectual speculation for its end. In all due
   ordination of sciences and arts, the character of final end attaches to
   that science or art which issues precepts as master-builder to the
   rest: thus the art of navigation, to which belongs the management of a
   ship, lays down precepts for ship-building. In this relation
   Metaphysics (philosophia prima) stand to all speculative sciences. On
   metaphysics they all depend, and from that science they receive their
   principles and directions how to proceed against deniers of principles.
   [550] This first philosophy is wholly directed to the final end of the
   knowledge of God: hence it is called a divine science. The knowledge of
   God therefore is the final end of all human study and activity.

   (f). In all series of agents and causes of change the end of the prime
   agent and mover must be the ultimate end of all, as the end of a
   general is the end of all the soldiers who serve under him. But among
   all the component parts of man we find the intellect to be the superior
   moving power: for the intellect moves the appetite, putting its object
   before it; and the intellectual appetite, or will, moves the sensible
   appetites, the irascible and concupiscible: hence we do not obey
   concupiscence except under the command of the will. [551] The sensitive
   appetite, crowned by the consent of the will, proceeds to move the
   body. The end therefore of the intellect is the end of all human
   actions. But the end and good of the intellect is truth; and
   consequently its last end is the first truth. The last end then of the
   whole man and of all his activities and desires is to know the first
   truth, which is God.

   (g). There is a natural desire in all men of knowing the causes of the
   things that they see. It was through wonder at seeing things, the
   causes of which were unseen, that men first began to philosophise. Nor
   does enquiry cease until we arrive at the first cause: then we consider
   our knowledge perfect, when we know the first cause. Man then naturally
   desires so to know the first cause as his last end. [552] But the first
   cause is God; and the last end of man and of every subsistent
   intelligence, is called blessedness or happiness. To know God then is
   the blessedness and happiness of every subsistent intelligence. [553]

   Hence it is said: This is eternal life, that they know thee, the only
   true God (John xvii, 3).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [547] To be able to act is the first perfection': actually to be in
   action is the 'second.'

   [548] St Thomas speaks of the good man, who is the normal man, as the
   zoologist describes the healthy and normal animal of each species.
   Moreover, religious questions have been and are of predominant interest
   to civilised mankind.

   [549] Why play always' rather than study always? Our bodily
   constitution unfits us to do either one or the other. But what St
   Thomas means is that, if play were an end in itself, we should play all
   we can, which sundry men do, -- and boys, if you let them. The passage
   is suggested by Aristotle, Eth. Nic. X, vi, 6. St Thomas does not
   observe the delight of the artist in the work of his hands, nor
   consider how few scholars study for study's sake, nor generally how
   much of pure speculative interest is blended with practice, and how
   much thinking is done for material gains. As Aristotle might have said,
   to de kai theorountes demourgoumen kai pros lemmata theoroumen..

   [550] There is a Scholastic maxim, contra negantem principia fustibus
   est argumentandum;but that can scarcely have been the direction' which
   St Thomas had in mind. Philosophia prima here means metaphysics and
   psychology, culminating in natural theology. There is no better
   specimen of it than these first three books Contra Gentiles.
   Accordingly it is defined in book I, chap. I as wisdom.

   [551] Cf. Romans VI, 12. We do not obey to the doing of a human act,'
   an act, that is, of which we are masters and for which we are
   responsible: it is of human acts' alone that St Thomas speaks here

   [552] But how if the first cause be unknowable? Says Aristotle, Eth.
   Nic. III, iv, 7: "Wish extends to impossibilities, such as
   immortality." St Thomas would reply that nature never fixes desire on
   an object that is absolutely and under every respect unattainable.

   [553] God is the objective last end (finis qui); and happiness, which
   is the contemplation of God, is the subjective last end (finis quo).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXVI--That Happiness does not consist in any Act of the Will
   [554]

   SINCE a subsistent intelligence in its activity arrives at God, not by
   understanding alone, but also by an act of the will desiring and loving
   Him and taking delight in Him, some one may think that the last end and
   final felicity of man is not in knowing God, but rather in loving Him,
   or exercising some other act of the will upon Him; especially seeing
   that the object of the will is good, which bears the character of an
   end, whereas truth, which is the object of the intellect, does not bear
   the character of an end except in so far as it (ipsum) too is good.
   Hence it seems that man does not attain his last end by an act of
   intellect, but rather by an act of will. But this position is
   manifestly proved to be untenable.

   1. Happiness, being the peculiar good of an intelligent nature, must
   attach to the intelligent nature on the side of something that is
   peculiar to it. But appetite is not peculiar to intelligent nature, but
   is found in all things, though diversely in diverse beings: which
   diversity however arises from the different ways in which they stand to
   consciousness. Things wholly devoid of consciousness have only natural
   appetite, or physical tendency. Things that have sensitive
   consciousness have sensible appetite, under which the irascible and
   concupiscible are included. Things that have intellectual consciousness
   have an appetite proportionate to that consciousness, namely, the will.
   The will therefore, as being an appetite, is not a peculiar
   appurtenance of an intelligent nature, except so far as it is dependent
   on the intelligence: but intelligence in itself is peculiar to an
   intelligent nature. Happiness therefore consists in an act of the
   intellect substantially and principally rather than in an act of the
   will.

   2. In all powers that are moved by their objects the objects are
   naturally prior to the acts of those powers. But such a power is the
   will, for the desirable object moves desire. The object therefore of
   the will is naturally prior to the act. The prime object of will then
   precedes every act of will. No act of will therefore can be the prime
   object of volition. But the prime object of will is the last end, which
   is happiness. Happiness therefore cannot possibly be itself an act of
   will.

   3. In all powers that can reflect on their own acts, the act of that
   power must first fix on some object, and then fix on its own act. For
   if the intellect understands that it understands, we must suppose that
   it first understands some thing, and afterwards understands its own
   understanding of that thing: for the act of understanding, which the
   intellect understands, means the understanding of some object. Hence we
   must either proceed to infinity; or, coming to some first object of
   understanding, this object, we must say, will not be a sheer act of
   understanding, but some intelligible thing. Similarly the first object
   of will cannot be any sheer act of willing, but some other good. But
   the first object of will to an intelligent nature is happiness: for it
   is for the sake of happiness that we will whatever we do will.
   Happiness therefore cannot possibly consist essentially in any act of
   will.

   4. Everything has the truth of its nature by having the constituents of
   its substance: for a real man differs from a painted one by the
   constituents of the substance of man. But true happiness does not
   differ from false happiness in respect of the act of will: for the will
   is in the same attitude of desire, or love, or delight, whatever the
   object proposed to it for its sovereign good, true or false: but
   whether the object so proposed be the true sovereign good or a
   counterfeit, that difference is decided by intellect. Happiness
   therefore consists essentially in intellect rather than in any act of
   will.

   5. If any act of will were happiness itself, that act would be either
   desire or love or delight. Now it is impossible for desire to be the
   last end: for desire obtains inasmuch as the will tends to something
   which it has not yet got: but such straining after the absent is
   inconsistent with the idea of an achieved last end. Love again cannot
   be the last end: for good is loved not only in its presence but also in
   its absence: for it is from love that good not possessed is sought for
   by desire. And though the love of good already attained is more
   perfect, that access of perfection is to be ascribed to the attainment
   and established possession of the good loved. The attainment of good
   then, which is the end, is a different thing from the love of good,
   which love is imperfect before attainment, and perfect after
   attainment. In like manner neither is delight the last end: for the
   very possession of good is the cause of delight, while we either feel
   the good now possessed, or remember the good possessed before, or hope
   for the good to be possessed in future: delight therefore is not the
   last end. No act of will therefore can be the substance of happiness.

   6. If delight were the last end, it would be desirable of itself. But
   that is false: for it makes a difference what delight is desired,
   considering the object from which delight ensues: for the delight which
   follows upon good and desirable activities is good and desirable: but
   that which follows upon evil activities is evil and to be shunned.
   Delight therefore has its goodness and desirability from something
   beyond itself. Therefore it is not itself the final end, happiness.

   7. The right order of things coincides with the order of nature, for
   natural things are ordained to their end without mistakes. But in
   natural things delight is for activity, and not the other way about:
   for we see that nature has attached delight to those activities of
   animals which are manifestly ordained to necessary ends, as in the use
   of food, which is ordained to the preservation of the individual, and
   in the intercourse of the sexes, which is ordained to the preservation
   of the species: for if delight were not in attendance, animals would
   abstain from the aforesaid necessary acts. It is impossible therefore
   for delight to be the final end.

   8. Delight seems to be nothing else than a rest of the will in some
   befitting good, as desire is an inclination of the will to the gaining
   of some good. Now it is ridiculous to say that the end of movement is
   not the coming to be in one's proper place, but the satisfaction of the
   inclination whereby one tended to go there. If the principle aim of
   nature were the satisfaction of the inclination, it would never give
   the inclination. It gives the inclination, that thereby one may tend to
   one's proper place: when that end is gained, there follows the
   satisfaction of the inclination: thus the satisfaction of the
   inclination is not the end, but a concomitant of the end.

   9. If any exterior thing is to be any one's end, we must assign the
   title of last end to that activity whereby the thing is first gained:
   thus to people who make money their end, the getting of the money is
   the end, not the love or desire of it. But the last end of a subsistent
   intelligence is God. That activity then in man makes the substance of
   his happiness, whereby he first attains to God. But that is the
   activity of understanding: for we cannot will what we do not
   understand. The final happiness of man then substantially consists in
   knowing God by the understanding, and not in any act of the will.

   From what has been said we may solve the objections to the contrary.
   The fact of the sovereign good being the object of the will does not
   necessitate sovereign good being substantially the act of the will
   itself, as was the tenor of the argument first proposed: nay, from the
   fact of its being the first object, it follows that it is not the act.

   Arg. 2. The last perfection of activity is delight, which perfects
   activity as beauty does youth. [555] If then any perfect activity is
   the last end, it seems that the last end is rather in the activity of
   the will than of the intellect.

   Reply. There are two ways of being a perfection to a thing. In one way
   there is a perfection to a thing already complete in its species: in
   another way there is a perfection going to make up the species. Thus
   the perfection of a house, considered as complete in its species, is
   that use for which the house is intended, namely, being inhabited:
   hence this should be put in the definition of a house, if the
   definition is to be adequate. A perfection going to make up the species
   of a house may be one of the constituents and substantial principles of
   the species: or it may be something that goes to the preservation of
   the species, as the buttresses made to prop the house up: lastly, under
   this head we must count whatever makes the house more comely for use,
   as its beauty. That therefore which is the perfection of a thing,
   considered as already complete in its species, is the end of a thing,
   as being inhabited is the end of a house. And in like manner the proper
   activity of each thing, which is a sort of use of it, is the end of the
   thing. But the perfections which go to make up the species are not the
   end of the thing: rather the thing is their end. Thus matter and form
   are for the species. In like manner the perfections that preserve a
   thing in its species, as health and nutrition, though they perfect the
   animal, are not the end of its existence, but rather the other way
   about. Those perfections also whereby a thing is fitted to discharge
   the proper activities of its species and gain its due end more
   becomingly, are not the end of the thing, but rather the other way
   about, e.g., a man's beauty and bodily strength, and other
   accomplishments, of which the philosopher says that they minister to
   happiness instrumentally. [556] Now when we say that delight is the
   perfection of activity, we do not mean that activity specifically
   considered is directed to the purpose of delight, -- the fact is, it is
   ordained to other ends, as eating is ordained to the preservation of
   the individual, -- we mean that delight ranks among the perfections
   which go to make up the species of a thing: for through the delight
   that we take in any action we apply ourselves to it more attentively
   and becomingly.

   Arg. 3. Delight seems to be so desired for its own sake as never to be
   desired for the sake of anything else: for it is foolish to ask of any
   one why [he] wishes to be delighted. [557] But this is the condition of
   the last end, to be desired for its own sake. Therefore the last end is
   rather in an act of the will than of the understanding, so it seems.

   Reply. Delight, though it is not the last end, is still a concomitant
   of the last end, since from the attainment of the last end delight
   supervenes.

   Arg. 4. In the desire of the last end there is the greatest agreement
   amongst all men, because it is natural. But more seek delight than
   knowledge. Therefore it seems that delight is the end rather than
   knowledge.

   Reply. There are not more seekers of the delight that there is in
   knowing than there are seekers of knowledge: but there are more seekers
   after sensible delights than there are seekers of intellectual
   knowledge and the delight thence ensuing; and the reason is because
   external things are more known to the majority of men, as human
   knowledge starts from objects of sense.

   Arg. 5. The will seems to be a higher power than the understanding: for
   the will moves the understanding to its end: for when there is the will
   so to do, then it is that the understanding actually considers the
   knowledge which it habitually possesses. The action therefore of the
   will seems to be nobler than the action of the understanding; and
   therefore the final end of happiness seems in the act of will rather
   than in the act of understanding.

   Reply. It is manifestly false to say that the will is higher than the
   understanding as moving it; for primarily and ordinarily the
   understanding moves the will. The will, as such, is moved by its
   object, which is the good apprehended: but the will moves the
   understanding, we may say, incidentally, inasmuch as the act of
   understanding itself is apprehended as good and so is desired by the
   will. Hence it follows that the understanding actually understands, and
   in this has the start of the will; for never would the will desire to
   understand, unless first the understanding apprehended the act of
   understanding itself as good. And again the will moves the
   understanding to actual activity in the way in which an efficient cause
   is said to move: but the understanding moves the will in the way in
   which a final cause moves, for good understood is the end of the will.
   Now the efficient cause is posterior in motion to the final cause, for
   the efficient cause moves only for the sake of the final cause. Hence
   it appears that, absolutely speaking, the understanding is higher than
   the will, but the will is higher than the understanding accidentally
   and in a qualified sense.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [554] In this conclusion St Thomas stands by Aristotle, and is
   contradicted by Scotus and all his school. It has ever been the
   translator's intimate conviction that St Thomas and Aristotle are
   right, and the Scotists wrong, and all compromise or blending of these
   two opposite opinions impossible. Be this said to stimulate inquiry. A
   reader ought to be told when he is brought face to face with a great
   issue.

   [555] The reference is to the celebrated Eth. Nic. X, iv, 8: "Pleasure
   makes activity perfect, not as a habit of skill perfects the skilful
   act, but as a sort of efflorescence marking completeness, as bloom
   perfects maturity," or as we might say, like the bloom on ripe grapes
   or peaches. So Professor Stewart (Notes on Nicomachean Ethics, ii, 418)
   speaks of "the law of our nature, that function is primary and pleasure
   only attendant," -- which is the real refutation of this objection and
   of hedonism in all its forms.

   [556] "It is impossible, or not easy to do nobly without supplies: for
   many things require to be done through instruments" (Eth. Nic. I, ix,
   15).

   [557] So Aristole, Eth. Nic. X, ii, 2.

   CHAPTER XXVII--That the Happiness of Man does not consist in Bodily
   Pleasures

   ACCORDING to the order of nature, pleasure is for the sake of activity,
   and not the other way about. If therefore certain activities are not
   the final end, the pleasures ensuing upon these activities are neither
   the final end nor accessories of the final end. But certainly the
   activities on which bodily pleasures follow are not the final end: for
   they are directed to other obvious ends, the preservation of the body
   and the begetting of offspring. Therefore the aforesaid pleasures are
   not the final end, nor accessories of the final end, and happiness is
   not to be placed in them.

   3. Happiness is a good proper to man: dumb animals cannot be called
   happy except by an abuse of language. [558] But bodily pleasures are
   common to man and brute: happiness therefore cannot consist in them.
   [559]

   4. The final end of a thing is noblest and best of all that appertains
   to the thing. [560] But bodily delights do not appertain to a man in
   respect of what is noblest in him.

   5. The highest perfection of man cannot consist in his being conjoined
   with things lower than himself, but in his conjunction with something
   above him.

   7. In all things that are said to be ordinarily' (per se), more'
   follows upon more,' if absolutely' goes with absolutely.' If then
   bodily pleasures were good in themselves, [561] to take them to the
   utmost would be the best way of taking them. But this is manifestly
   false: for excessive use of such things is accounted a vice, injures
   the body, and bars further enjoyments of the same sort. [562]

   8. If human happiness consisted in bodily pleasures, it would be a more
   praiseworthy act of virtue to take such pleasures than to abstain from
   them. [563] But this is manifestly false, for it is the special praise
   of the act of temperance to abstain from such pleasures. [564]

   9. The last end of everything is God (Chap. [321]XVIII). That then must
   be laid down to be the last end of man, whereby he most closely
   approaches to God. But bodily pleasures injure a man from any close
   approach to God: for God is approached by contemplation, and the
   aforesaid pleasures are a hindrance to contemplation.

   Hereby is excluded the error of the Epicureans, who placed the
   happiness of man in these pleasures: in whose person Solomon says: This
   seemed to me good, that man should eat and drink and make merry on the
   fruit of his toil (Eccles. V, 17). Everywhere let us leave behind us
   signs of mirth, for this is our portion and this our lot (Wisd. ii, 9).
   Also the error of the followers of Cerinthus is excluded, who spread
   the fable of a thousand years of the pleasures of the belly as an
   element in the kingdom of Christ after the resurrection, hence they are
   called Chiliasts, or Millennarians. Also the fables of the Saracens,
   who place the rewards of the just in the aforesaid pleasures.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [558] "With reason we refuse to pronounce either ox or horse or any
   other animal happy: for none of them is able to take part in such
   activity as makes happiness" (Eth. Nic. I, ix, 9).

   [559] It is to be considered however that bodily pleasures in man
   commonly are not merely bodily, they are coloured by imagination, art,
   sentiment, poetry.

   [560] e.g., the final end of oxen, to be eaten by man. Oxen however do
   not exist for themselves. Sic vos non vobis fertis aratra, boves. In
   man at least his final end ought to be the realisation of his noblest
   attribute.

   [561] That is to say, if they were good absolutely,' irrespectively of
   limiting conditions. If pleasure were absolutely' and ordinarily' one
   thing with goodness, the more pleasure one got, the better would he be
   for it; and the most pleasant pleasure would be the best pleasure.
   Pressed by this argument, some utilitarians, e.g., J. S. Mill, have
   admitted a difference of kind, or quality, in pleasures, a concession
   fatal to hedonism, and thereby ultimately to utilitarianism.

   [562] So does excessive contemplation and study injure the body, but
   not so fearfully: it does not make such a wreck of the whole man. But,
   it must be owned, in this world contemplation is not absolutely the end
   of man.

   [563] The rule of the golden mean does not apply to the last end.
   "Every art seeks the end to infinity, wishing to secure it to the
   utmost; but the means not to infinity, for the end in view limits all
   arts" (Aristotle, Politics, I, x, 13).

   [564] In Ethics and Natural Law, p. 91, it is shown why the whole
   business of temperance is to restrain. There is however an Epicurean
   temperance, which, taking pleasure to be happiness and the last end of
   man, at the same time recognises it to be attainable only under
   limitations, and so economises what it takes to to be the good wine of
   life, that it may not run out too fast. Temperance is quite
   intelligible even in the enjoyment of the last end, on the assumption
   that the last end is attainable only in small amounts, and may be
   exhausted by greediness. This view allows that the last end is in
   itself and in the abstract desirable eis apeiron, but only in the
   abstract; there being limits to its practical attainability. It is a
   point not to be taken for granted, that happiness, adequate to desire,
   is attainable at all. The attainability of perfect happiness is a
   theorem requiring proof; and proof of it is impossible, if the life of
   the world to come is not to enter into the discussion. See Chap.
   XLVIII: also Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 13-20. Waiving that
   discussion, however, the previous arguments, nn. 1, 3, 4, 5, avail to
   show that bodily pleasures are not the chief ingredient of the limited
   happiness possible to man on earth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXVIII, XXIX--That Happiness does not consist in Honours nor in
   Human Glory

   THE last end and happiness of man is his most perfect activity (Chap.
   [322]XXVI). But the honour paid to a man does not consist in any act of
   his own, but in the act of another towards him. [565]

   2. That is not the last end, which is good and desirable on account of
   something else. But such is honour: for a man is not rightly honoured
   except for some other good thing existing in him.

   4. Even bad men may be honoured. It is better then to become worthy of
   honour than to be honoured. Therefore honour is not the highest good of
   man.

   Hence it appears that neither does man's chief good consist in glory,
   or celebrity of fame. For glory, according to Cicero, is "a frequent
   mention of a man with praise"; or according to St Augustine, "brilliant
   notoriety with praise" (clara notitia cum laude). So then men wish for
   notoriety, attended with praise and a certain brilliance, that they may
   be honoured by those to whom they become known. Glory then is sought
   for the sake of honour. If then honour is not the highest good, much
   less is glory.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [565] It may be pleaded that happiness consists, not in the payment,
   but in the reception of honours, such reception involving an act of the
   individual's own consciousness. This would come near to the doctrine
   that happiness consists in self-satisfaction, a Stoic position.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXX--That Man's Happiness does not consist in Riches

   RICHES are not desired except for the sake of something else: for of
   themselves they do no good, but only as we use them. But the highest
   good is desired for its own sake, and not for the sake of something
   else.

   2. The possession or preservation of those things cannot be the highest
   good, which benefit man most in being parted with. But such is the use
   of riches, to spend.

   3. The act of liberality and munificence, the virtues that deal with
   money, is more praiseworthy, in that money is parted with, than that
   money is got. Man's happiness therefore does not consist in the
   possession of riches. [566]

   4. That in the gaining of which man's chief good lies must be some
   thing better than man. But man is better than his riches, which are
   things ordained to his use.

   5. The highest good of man is not subject to fortune: for fortuitous
   events happen without effort of reason, whereas man must gain his
   proper end by reason. But fortune has great place in the gaining of
   riches. [567]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [566] But perhaps in the spending of them, which presupposes
   possession. Not in the spending of them for the mere sake of spending,
   which is called throwing money away.' And if they are spent for a
   purpose, in that purpose rather than in the spending must happiness
   lie.

   [567] Especially in persons born to fortune.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXI--That Happiness does not consist in Worldly Power

   A MAN is called good inasmuch as he attains to the sovereign good. But
   inasmuch as he has power he is not called either good or evil: for he
   is not good who can do good things, nor is a man evil of being able to
   do evil things. Therefore the highest good does not consist in being
   powerful. [568]

   3. All power is over another (ad alterum). But the highest good is not
   over another.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [568] And therefore not in riches, for to a thinking mind the chief
   good of riches is the power that they give.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXII--That Happiness does not consist in the Goods of the Body

   THE soul is better than the body. Therefore the good of the soul, as
   understanding and the like, is better than the good of the body. The
   good of the body therefore is not the highest good of man.

   3. These goods are common to man and other animals: but happiness is
   the proper good of man alone.

   4. For goods of the body, many animals are better off than man: some
   are swifter, some are stronger, and so of the rest. If in these things
   the highest good consisted, man would not be the most excellent of
   animals.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXIV--That the Final Happiness Man does not consist in Acts of
   the Moral Virtues

   HUMAN happiness, if it is final, is not referable to any further end.
   But all moral acts are referable to something further: thus acts of
   fortitude in war are directed to securing victory and peace: acts of
   justice to the preservation of peace amongst men by every one remaining
   in quiet possession of his own.

   2. Moral virtues aim at the observance of the golden mean in passions
   and in the disposal of external things. But the moderation of the
   passions or of external things cannot possibly be the final end of
   human life, since these very passions and external things are referable
   to something else.

   3. Man is man by the possession of reason; and therefore happiness, his
   proper good, must regard what is proper to reason. But that is more
   proper to reason which reason has in itself than what it does in
   another. Since then the good of moral virtue is something which reason
   establishes in things other than itself, moral virtue cannot be the
   best thing in man, which is happiness. [569]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [569] See Ethics and Natural Law, p. 8, n. 4; and p. 76, n. 4. When
   Milton says in the Comus

   Virtue alone is happiness below,
   he cannot reasonably mean that moral virtue is formally and precisely
   happiness, but only that it is indispensable to happiness, and
   presupposed, as the base of a tower is presupposed to the spire. Moral
   virtue is more indispensable, but happiness is better. But the
   privation of happiness is a less evil than the privation of moral
   virtue. So it is less evil to have the spire blown down than to have
   the tower on which it rests blown up, although the spire is higher and
   nobler than the substructure. The doctrine of this chapter is in
   Aristotle, Nic. Eth. X, viii.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXVII--That the Final Happiness of Man consists in the
   Contemplation of God

   IF then the final happiness of man does not consist in those exterior
   advantages which are called goods of fortune, nor in goods of the body,
   nor in goods of the soul in its sentient part, nor in the intellectual
   part in respect of the moral virtues, nor in the virtues of the
   practical intellect, called art and prudence, it remains that the final
   happiness of man consists in the contemplation of truth. This act alone
   in man is proper to him, and is in no way shared by any other being in
   this world. This is sought for its own sake, and is directed to no
   other end beyond itself. By this act man is united in likeness with
   pure spirits, and even comes to know them in a certain way. For this
   act also man is more self-sufficient, having less need of external
   things. [570] Likewise to this act all other human activities seem to
   be directed as to their end. For to the perfection of contemplation
   there is requisite health of body; [571] and all artificial necessaries
   of life are means to health. Another requisite is rest from the
   disturbing forces of passion: that is attained by means of the moral
   virtues and prudence. Likewise rest from exterior troubles, which is
   the whole aim of civil life and government. Thus, if we look at things
   rightly, we may see that all human occupations seem to be ministerial
   to the service of the contemplators of truth. [572]

   Now it is impossible for human happiness to consist in that
   contemplation which is by intuition of first principles, -- a very
   imperfect study of things, as being the most general, and not amounting
   to more than a potential knowledge: it is in fact not the end but the
   beginning of human study: it is supplied to us by nature, and not by
   any close investigation of truth. Nor can happiness consist in the
   sciences, the object-matter of which is the meanest things, whereas
   happiness should be an activity of intellect dealing with the noblest
   objects of intelligence. Therefore the conclusion remains that the
   final happiness of man consists in contemplation guided by wisdom to
   the study of the things of God. Thus we have reached by way of
   induction the same conclusion that was formerly established by
   deductive reasoning, [573] that the final happiness of man does not
   consist in anything short of the contemplation of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [570] Through all this reasoning we readily discern the famous chapter
   of Aristotle, Nic. Eth. X, vii.

   [571] Compare Plato's saying, that athletics have their place in
   education chiefly for the sake of the soul (Rep. III, 410 C).

   [572] I have pointed out this subordination of practice to theory in
   Practical and Moral Essays, pp. 154, 155, cf. article 10, pp. 11-13. St
   Thomas proceeds to instance three kinds of contemplation. (A) Intuition
   of first principles. This is enjoyed by every man, educated and
   uneducated, who has the ordinary use of reason. Needless to say, it is
   not happiness, or all men would be happy. (B) Scientific Knowledge, the
   property of the educated. But the objects of science are creatures; and
   man requires for his happiness to contemplate something higher and
   nobler. (C) Wisdom, which is defined (in B. I, Ch. [323]I: "The
   knowledge of things by their highest causes." In this wisdom, taken for
   the contemplation of God, the beginning and last end of all, human
   happiness will be found to consist. (A) is further suggestive of Chap.
   XXXVIII, in which it is shown that the plain man's rational knowledge
   of God is not happiness: while (B) and (C) together suggest Chap.
   XXXIX, which shows that the philosopher's knowledge of God is not
   happiness either. Chapter XL proves the same of the Christian's
   knowledge of God by faith. Chapter XLVII shows that we enjoy no vision
   of God on earth. Chapter XLVIII, that happiness is not on earth.
   Finally, Chap. L argues that nothing short of the immediate vision of
   God makes the happiness of angels and of human souls in heaven.

   [573] The deductive reasoning' (rationibus probatum) seems to be the
   arguments alleged in Chap. XXV. What St Thomas here calls induction' is
   the noted inductio per enumerationem simplicem. He has enumerated all
   other alternatives and shown that this alone remains tenable. We might
   call it the method of residues.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXVIII--That Human Happiness does not consist in such
   Knowledge of God as is common to the majority of Mankind

   THERE is a certain general and vague knowledge of God in the minds of
   practically, all men, whether it be by the fact of God's existence
   being a self-evident truth, as some think (B. I, Chap. [324]X); or, as
   seems more likely, because natural reasoning leads a man promptly to
   some sort of knowledge of God: for men seeing that natural things
   follow a certain course and order, and further considering that order
   cannot be without an ordainer, they perceive generally that there is
   some ordainer of the things which we see. But who or what manner of
   being the ordainer of nature is, and whether He be one or many, cannot
   be gathered off-hand from this slight study. Thus, seeing a man move
   and do other acts, we perceive that there is in him a cause of these
   activities, which is not in other things; and this cause we call the
   soul; and still we do not yet know what the soul is, whether it is
   anything corporeal or not, or how it performs the aforesaid acts. Now
   such knowledge as this cannot possibly suffice for happiness.

   1. For happiness must be an activity without defect. But this knowledge
   is susceptible of admixture of many errors: thus some have believed
   that the ordainer of mundane events is no other than the heavenly
   bodies: hence they have affirmed the heavenly bodies to be gods. Others
   have said the same of the elements, thinking that their natural
   movements and activities come not from any controlling power outside
   them, but that they control other things. Others, believing that human
   acts are not subject to any other than human control, have called those
   men who control other men gods. Such knowledge of God is not sufficient
   for happiness.

   3. No one is blameworthy for not possessing happiness: nay, men who
   have it not, and go on tending to it, are praised. But lack of the
   aforesaid knowledge of God renders a man particularly blameworthy. It
   is a great indication of dulness of perception in a man, when he
   perceives not such manifest signs of God; just as any one would be
   counted lacking in perception, who, seeing a man, did not understand
   that he had a soul. Hence it is said in the Psalms (xiii and lii): The
   fool said in his heart: There is no God.

   4. Knowledge of a thing in general, not descending into any details, is
   a very imperfect knowledge, as would be the knowledge of man merely as
   something that moves. By such knowledge a thing is known potentially
   only, for details are potentially contained in generalities. But
   happiness, being a perfect activity and the supreme good of man, must
   turn upon what is actual and not merely potential.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXIX--That Happiness does not consist in the Knowledge of God
   which is to be had by Demonstration

   AGAIN there is another knowledge of God, higher than the last
   mentioned: this knowledge is acquired by demonstration, by means of
   which we come nearer to a proper knowledge of Him, since demonstration
   removes from Him many attributes, by removal of which the mind discerns
   God standing apart from other beings. Thus demonstration shows God to
   be unchangeable, eternal, incorporeal, absolutely simple, one. A proper
   knowledge of an object is arrived at, not only by affirmations, but
   also by negations. Thus as it is proper to man to be a rational animal,
   so it is proper to him also not to be inanimate or irrational. But
   between these two modes of proper knowledge there is this difference,
   that when a proper knowledge of a thing is got by affirmations, we know
   both what the thing is and how it is distinct from others: but when a
   proper knowledge of a thing is got by negations, we know that the thing
   is distinct from other things, but what it is remains unknown. Such is
   the proper knowledge of God that we have by demonstrations. [574] But
   that is not sufficient for the final happiness of man.

   1. The individuals of a species arrive at the end and perfection of
   that species for the most part; and natural developments have place
   always or for the most part, though they fail in a minority of
   instances through something coming in to mar them. But happiness is the
   end and perfection of the human species, since all men naturally desire
   it. Happiness then is a common good, possible to accrue to all men,
   except in cases where an obstacle arises to deprive some of it. But few
   they are who arrive at this knowledge of God by way of demonstration,
   on account of the difficulties mentioned above (B. I, Chap. [325]IV).
   Such scientific knowledge then is not the essence of human happiness.

   3. Happiness excludes all misery. But deception and error is a great
   part of misery. Now in the knowledge of God by demonstration manifold
   error may be mingled, as is clear in the case of many who have found
   out some truths about God in that way, and further following their own
   ideas, in the failure of demonstration, have fallen into many sorts of
   error. And if any have found truth in the things of God so perfectly by
   the way of demonstration as that no error has entered their minds, such
   men certainly have been very few: a rarity of attainment which does not
   befit happiness, happiness being the common end of all. [575]

   4. Happiness consists in perfect activity. Now for the perfection of
   the activity of knowledge certainty is required: but the aforesaid
   knowledge has much of uncertainty.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [574] See B. I, Chap. XIV, note.

   [575] Patet eos fuisse paucissimos, quod non congruit felicitati, qui
   est communis finis. These words have a bearing on another question, the
   number of the elect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XL--That Happiness does not consist in the Knowledge of God by
   Faith

   HAPPINESS is the perfect activity of the human intellect (Chap.
   [326]XXVI). But in the knowledge that is of faith, though there is high
   perfection on the part of the object so apprehended, there is great
   imperfection on the side of intellect, for intellect does not
   understand that to which it assents in believing.

   2. Final happiness does not consist principally in any act of will
   (Chap. [327]XXVI). But in the knowledge of faith the will has a leading
   part: for the understanding assents by faith to the things proposed to
   it, because it wills to do so, without being necessarily drawn by the
   direct evidence of truth.

   3. He who believes, yields assent to things proposed to him by another,
   which himself he does not see: hence the knowledge of faith is more
   like hearing than seeing. Since then happiness consists in the highest
   knowledge of God, it cannot consist in the knowledge of faith.

   4. Happiness being the last end, all natural desire is thereby
   appeased. But the knowledge of faith, far from appeasing desire, rather
   excites it, since every one desires to see that which he believes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTERS XLI-XLV [576]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [576] "A separately subsistent intelligence," writes St Thomas (Chap.
   XLI), "by knowing its own essence, knows both what is above it and what
   is below it, particularly if what is above it is also its cause, since
   the likeness of the cause must be found in the effect. Hence, since God
   is the cause of all created subsistent intelligences, they, by knowing
   their own essences, know by some sort of vision (per modum visionis
   cujusdam) even God Himself: for a thing is known by intellect in a
   manner of vision, when its likeness exists in intellect: whatever
   intellect then apprehends a separately subsistent intelligence, and
   knows the same in its essential nature, sees God in a higher way than
   is possible by any of the modes of cognition already mentioned." Know
   an angel, then, or pure spirit, in his essence, and you will thereby
   have a higher knowledge of God than any that you could attain by any
   other speculation of science or philosophy. Consequently, if the
   knowledge of God be happiness, happiness, it seems, will best open to
   us men, if we can find some method of reading the innermost natures of
   angels. Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl A.D. 200), Avempace (Ibn-Badja, d.
   1138), and Averroes (Ibn-Roschd, d. 1198), each was quoted in St
   Thomas's day as the author of a method enabling men to do this, methods
   which St Thomas elaborately confutes in these chapters. Avempace's plan
   was to study the speculative sciences, and thence forming abstract
   generalisations, one higher than the other, -- or perhaps he meant
   (what is by no means the same thing) one fuller of content' than the
   other, -- to ascend to the cognition of pure intelligence. St Thomas
   describes the process in scholastic terms, thus; "to extract the
   quiddity of everything which is not its own quiddity; and if that
   quiddity has a quiddity, again to abstract the quiddity of that
   quiddity, till we come to a stand somewhere, arriving by the method of
   analysis at the knowledge of the quiddity of a being, subsisting apart,
   which has not another quiddity" (Chap. XLI): which words perhaps need
   some explanation. "The quiddity of a thing which is not its own
   quiddity" means then an essence, or essential quality, which is shared
   by many subjects, and is not all embodied in one subject, constituting
   that subject entirely. Thus prudence is in Cato, and in many others
   besides. Cato is not all prudence: he is not the embodiment of sheer
   prudence and nothing else. Prudence then in Cato is a quiddity which is
   not its own quiddity. St Thomas well observes that Avempace's method is
   Platonic Idealism revived. He adds that, starting as our abstractions
   must, from sensible objects, we can never attain to a view of the
   essential nature of a pure spirit. "If by understanding of the natures
   and quiddities of sensible things, we arrive at an understanding of
   separately subsistent intelligences, that understanding of such
   intelligences must be reached through some one of the speculative
   sciences. But we do not see how this is to be done: for there is no
   speculative science which teaches concerning any one of the separately
   subsistent intelligences what it is in essence, but only the fact of
   its existence" (Chap. XLI). -- Averroes, as might have been expected,
   proceeds upon his favourite notion of the continuatio, or conjunction
   of the individual mind with the one vast intelligence, active and
   potential, that is without (B. II, Chap. [328]LX). St Thomas's summary
   of the Commentator's views ends thus -- (it is a very free paraphrase
   of Averroes's words as they appear in the Latin of the Venice edition
   of 1574, pp. 186, 187): "This perfect progress towards conjunction with
   the supreme intelligence comes of zealous study of the speculative
   sciences, whereby true intellectual notions are acquired, and false
   opinions are excluded, such opinions lying beyond the line of this
   progress, like monstrous births outside of the line of the operation of
   nature. To this advance men help one another by helping one another in
   the speculative sciences. When then all things now potentially
   intelligible come to be in us actually understood, then the active
   intellect: will be perfectly conjoined with us as a form, and we shall
   understand by it perfectly. Hence, since it belongs to the active
   intellect to understand substances existing apart, we shall then
   understand those separately subsistent beings as we now understand the
   notions of speculative science; and this will be man's final happiness,
   in which man shall be as a god" (Chap. XLIII). If any one used such
   language in our time, we should understand him to mean by continuatio,
   or union with the supreme intelligence, as regards the individual, his
   instruction up to the level of the science of his age; and as regards
   the age itself, the maintenance of the level of science reached by the
   previous generation, and the further raising of that level. But it is
   not safe to make out an ancient author to have meant exactly what his
   words would mean, if spoken now. St Thomas gives a reference to the
   commentary of Averroes on Aristotle, De anima, III, a reference which I
   have duly followed up. I find that Averroes quotes Alexander and
   Avempace, disagreeing with them both. St Thomas, I believe, is indebted
   to Averroes for his knowledge of Alexander and Avempace. Now nowhere in
   Averroes, nor in either of the two authors whom he quotes, do I find
   any reference whatever to separate substances personified as thinking
   intelligences, or angels, -- nor, for that matter, in Aristotle either.
   The discussion had its origin in an unfulfilled promise of Aristotle
   (De Anima III, vii, 10) to enquire, ara endechetai ton kechorismenon ti
   noein onta auton me kechorismenon megethous; (is it possible for the
   mind, without being itself separate from extended body, to understand
   any of the things that are so separated?) To interpret ta kechorismena
   to mean pure spirits' seems going a long way beyond Aristotle, who
   probably meant no more than products of high abstraction': nor did
   Averroes, commenting on the third book of the De anima, or Alexander,
   or Avempace, as quoted in that commentary, mean anything more. The
   transformation of these high abstractions (kechorismena) into thinking
   beings, pure spirits, or angels, was, I conjecture, the work of the
   Neo-Averroists, whom St Thomas encountered at the University of Paris.
   It is with these Averroists, not with Averroes him self, that St Thomas
   mainly contends in these chapters. The argument is intricate, the
   theory which it impugns obsolete, nor is it worth while further to
   detain the modern reader with the discussion. No man now living expects
   to pick the brains' of angels, and so find happiness in this life by
   sharing an angel's natural knowledge of God. Nor did Averroes, so far
   as his comments on the De anima show, dream of anything so absurd. Lest
   any one should think the expression to pick the brains of angels' a
   travesty, I quote the Latin of St Thomas: Si igitur per cognitionem
   intellectivam, quae est ex phantasmatibus, possit pervenire aliquis
   nostrum ad intelligendas substantias separatas, possibile erit quod
   aliquis in hac vita intelligat ipsas substantias separatas, et per
   consequens videndo ipsas substantias separatas participabis modum
   illius cognitionis quo substantia separata intelligens se intelligit
   Deum (Chap. XLI). This is the translation: "If then by intellectual
   knowledge, got out of impressions on the phantasy, any one of us could
   arrive to understand subsistent beings existing apart [i.e., pure
   spirits], it would be possible for one in this life to understand those
   same pure spirits, and consequently by seeing [in his mind's eye] those
   pure spirits he would share in the mode of that knowledge whereby a
   pure spirit, understanding itself, understands God." I need hardly
   remind the reader that St Thomas himself rejects this notion, and is, I
   think, mistaken in attributing it to Averroes.

   CHAPTER XLVI--That the Soul in this life does not understand itself by
   itself

   AN apparent difficulty may be alleged against what has been said from
   some words of Augustine, which require careful treatment. He says (De
   Trinitate, IX, iii): "As the mind gathers knowledge of corporeal things
   by the senses of the body, so of incorporeal things by itself:
   therefore it knows itself by itself, because itself is incorporeal." By
   these words it appears that our mind understands itself by itself, and,
   understanding itself, understands separately subsistent intelligences,
   or pure spirits, which would militate against what has been shown
   above. But it is clear that such is not the mind of Augustine. For he
   says (De Trinitate, X, ix, 12) of the soul seeking knowledge of itself:
   "Let it not then seek to find (cernere) itself as though it were
   absent, but let its care be to discern (discernere) itself as it is
   present: let it not observe itself as though it did not know itself but
   let it distinguish itself from that other thing which it has mistaken
   for itself." Whence he gives us to understand that the soul of itself
   knows itself as present, but not as distinct from other things; and
   therefore he says (De Trin. X, x) that some have erred in not
   distinguishing the soul from things that are different from it. But by
   the knowledge of a thing in its essence the thing is known as distinct
   from other things: hence definition, which marks the essence of a
   thing, distinguishes the thing defined from all other things. Augustine
   then did not mean that the soul of itself knows its own essence. So
   then, according to the thought of Augustine, our mind of itself knows
   itself, inasmuch as it knows concerning itself that it exists: for by
   the very perceiving of itself to act it perceives itself to be. But it
   acts of itself. Therefore of itself it knows concerning itself that it
   exists. [577]

   1. But it cannot be said that the soul of itself knows concerning
   itself what it essentially is. For a cognitive faculty comes to be
   actually cognisant by there being in it the object which is known. If
   the object is in it potentially, it knows potentially: if the object is
   in it actually, it is actually cognisant: if in an intermediate way, it
   is habitually cognisant. But the soul is always present to itself
   actually, and never potentially or habitually only. If then the soul of
   itself knows itself by its essence, it must ever have an intellectual
   view of itself, what it essentially is, which clearly is not the case.

   2 and 3. If the soul of itself knows itself in its essence, every man,
   having a soul, knows the essence of the soul: which clearly is not the
   case, for many men have thought the soul to be this or that body, and
   some have taken it for a number or harmony.

   So then, by knowing itself, the soul is led to know concerning
   separately subsistent intelligences the fact of their existence, but
   not what they are essentially, which would mean understanding their
   substances. For whereas we know, either by demonstration or by faith,
   concerning these pure spirits that they are intelligent subsistent
   beings, in neither way could we gather this knowledge but for the fact
   that our soul knows from itself the meaning of intelligent being. Hence
   we must use our knowledge of the intelligence of our own soul as a
   starting-point for all that we can know of separately subsistent
   intelligences. But even granting that by speculative sciences we could
   arrive at a knowledge of the essence of our own soul, it does not
   follow that we could thereby arrive at a knowledge of all that is
   knowable about pure spirits; for our intelligence falls far short of
   the intelligence of a pure spirit. A knowledge of the essence of our
   own soul might lead to a knowledge of some remote higher genus of pure
   spirits: but that would not be an understanding of their substances.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [577] St Augustine here, as his manner is, says things which remain
   difficult after all explanations given. He finds some analogy to the
   Blessed Trinity in the human soul thus: "The mind itself and its love
   and knowledge of itself are three things; and these three are one; and
   when they are perfect, they are equal." This thought he pursues, De
   Trinitate IX, Chapp. iii, iv: X, Chapp. iii-x. It makes to his purpose
   to insist on the equality of the soul's knowledge of itself to the soul
   as known. "When it knows its whole self, and nothing else with itself,
   then its knowledge is equal to itself" (De Trin. IX, iv). He frequently
   repeats that the soul knows its whole self. See especially X, iv, 6. St
   Thomas would explain: The soul knows its whole self in existence (quod
   est), but not its whole self in essence (quid est): which is true, but
   what St Augustine meant is not so clear. Cf. De Trin. X, x, 16: "In no
   way is a thing rightly said to be known, while its substance is
   unknown: wherefore, when the mind knows itself, it knows its substance;
   and when it is certain of itself, it is certain of its substance."
   Perhaps we may say that every mind has some limited certain knowledge
   as well of its own existence as of its own substance, but not an
   adequate knowledge of its own substance, else there would be no bad
   psychology.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLVII--That we cannot in this life see God as He essentially is
   [578]

   If the connatural dependence of our understanding on phantasms prevents
   us in this life from understanding other pure spirits, much less can we
   in this life see the divine essence, which transcends all angels. Of
   this fact the following may also be taken as an indication: the higher
   our mind is raised to the contemplation of spiritual things, the more
   it is abstracted from sensible things: but the final terminus to which
   contemplation can possibly arrive is the divine substance: therefore
   the mind that sees the divine substance must be totally divorced from
   bodily senses, either by death or by some rapture. Hence it is said in
   the person of God: No man shall see me and live (Exod. xxxiii, 20).
   Whereas in Holy Scripture some are said to have seen God, that must be
   understood to have been inasmuch as by some vision of the phantasy or
   corporeal appearance the presence of divine power was shown.

   Certain words of Augustine raise a difficulty in this matter. Thus he
   says (De Trinitate, IX, vii) : "In the eternal truth, whence all
   corporeal creatures are, we see with our mind's eye the form according
   to which we are, and according to which we execute anything truly and
   rightly either in ourselves or in corporeal things." Also he says
   (Confess. I, xxv): "If both of us see that what you say is true, and we
   both see that what I say is true, where, I pray, do we see it? Neither
   I in you, nor you in me, but both of us in that unchangeable truth
   which is above our minds." And to the like effect (De Trin. XII, ii):
   "It belongs to the higher reason to judge of these bodily things
   according to aspects (rationes) eternal and everlasting, which
   certainly would not be unchangeable, were they not above the human
   mind." But aspects unchangeable and everlasting cannot be elsewhere
   than in God, since, according to Catholic faith, [579] God alone is
   eternal. It seems to follow that we can see God in this life, and that
   by seeing Him, and aspects of things in Him, we judge of the rest of
   things. [580]

   On the other hand it is incredible that in the above words Augustine
   should mean to assert that in this life we can understand God as He
   essentially is, seeing that in his book De videndo Deum he says the
   contrary. [581] It remains to enquire how in this life we can see that
   unchangeable truth or those everlasting aspects. That truth is in the
   soul, Augustine himself confesses: [582] hence he proves the
   immortality of the soul from the eternity of truth. But truth is not in
   the soul alone as God is said to be essentially' (per essentiam) in all
   things; nor as He is by His likeness in all things, inasmuch as
   everything is called true' so far as it approaches to the likeness of
   God: for from those points of view the soul stands in no better
   position than other beings: truth then is in the soul in a special
   manner, inasmuch as the soul knows truth. As then the soul and other
   beings are called true' in their natures, as bearing some likeness to
   the supreme nature of God, -- which is truth itself, as being its own
   fulness of actual understanding (suum intellectum esse), [583] -- so
   what is known by the soul is manifestly known, inasmuch as there exists
   in the soul a likeness of that divine truth which God knows. Hence on
   the text (Ps. xi, 2) truths are diminished from the sons of men, the
   Gloss [Augustine, Enarrationes in h.l.] says: "The truth is one,
   whereby holy souls are illumined: but since there are many souls, there
   may be said to be in them many truths, as from one face many images
   appear in as many mirrors." Though different things are known and
   believed to be true by different minds, yet there are some truths in
   which all men agree, for instance, the primary intuitions of intellect
   as well speculative as practical, because, so far as these go, an image
   of divine truth comes out universally in the minds of all. As then
   whatever any mind knows for certain, it knows it by virtue of these
   intuitions, which are the canons of all judgements, and into which all
   judgements may be resolved, the mind is said to see all things in the
   divine truth, or in everlasting aspects, and to judge of all things
   according to those aspects. This explanation is confirmed by the words
   of Augustine (Soliloq. I, viii, 15): "Even the truths taught in the
   schools, which every one, who understands them, unhesitatingly allows
   to be true, we must believe, could not possibly be understood, were
   they not lit up by the light of another, what I may call a sun proper
   to them (nisi ab alio quasi sole suo illustrantur)." He says then that
   the theories of science are seen in the divine truth as visible objects
   are seen in the light of the sun: but certainly such objects are not
   seen in the very body of the sun, but by the light which is a likeness
   of the solar brightness, remaining in the air and similar bodies. From
   these words then of Augustine it cannot be gathered that God is seen in
   His substance in this life, but only as in a mirror, which the Apostle
   also confesses of the knowledge of this life, saying (1 Cor. xiii, 12):
   We see now as in a glass darkly.

   Though the human mind represents the likeness of God more closely than
   lower creatures, still such knowledge of God as can be gathered from
   the human mind does not transcend that kind of knowledge which is
   borrowed from sensible objects, since the soul knows her own essential
   nature by understanding the nature of things of sense (Chap.
   [329]XLVI). [584] Hence neither by this method can God be known in any
   higher way than as the cause is known by the effect. [585]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [578] Half a century ago, this chapter was quoted against a school then
   much in vogue, known among Catholics as Ontologists.

   [579] Why St Thomas appeals to faith on this point appears by I3. II,
   Chap. XXXVIII.

   [580] In other words, Ontologism seems to follow. We are carried back
   to the discussion with Averroes (B. II, Chap. LIX sq.) as to the
   connexion (continuatio, ittisâl) of the individual with the universal
   intellect.

   [581] Exodus 33:20ad Paulinam, viii, 20: "No one can see the face of
   God and live: that is to say, no one living in this life can see Him as
   He is."

   [582] Unlike Averroes, who places it in a separate potential
   intellect,' was the thought in St Thomas' mind. The quotation referred
   to is Soliloq. II, xix, 33 "This is a convincing proof that truth is
   also in our mind. . . . Therefore the soul is immortal. Do at last
   believe your own reasons, believe the voice of truth: she cries out
   that she dwells in you and is immortal."

   [583] Plato might perhaps have said to auto kath' auto huph' hautou
   nenoesthai.

   [584] The human soul knows herself only by observing herself
   intellectually at work: and the connatural material upon which the
   human understanding goes to work is some object of sense.

   [585] The method referred to is the study of God in the soul, the
   favourite method of modern times, now known as the method of
   immanence.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLVIII--That the Final Happiness of Man is not in this Life
   [586]

   IF then human happiness does not consist in the knowledge of God
   whereby He is commonly known by all or most men according to some vague
   estimate, nor again in the knowledge of God whereby He is known
   demonstratively in speculative science, nor in the knowledge of God
   whereby He is known by faith, as has been shown above (Chapp.
   XXXVIII-XL); if again it is impossible in this life to arrive at a
   higher knowledge of God so as to know Him in His essence, or to
   understand other pure spirits, and thereby attain to a nearer knowledge
   of God (Chapp. XLI-XLVI); and still final happiness must be placed in
   some knowledge of God (Ch. [330]XXXVII); it follows that it is
   impossible for the final happiness of man to be in this life.

   2. The last end of man bounds his natural desire, so that, when that is
   reached, nothing further is sought: for if there is still a tendency to
   something else, the end of rest is not yet gained. But that cannot be
   in this life: for the more one understands, the more is the desire of
   understanding. natural to all men, increased. [587]

   3. When one gains happiness, he gains also stability and rest. All have
   this idea of happiness, that it involves stability as a necessary
   condition: hence the philosopher says that we do not take man for a
   chameleon. [588] But in this life there is no stability: for however
   happy a man be called, sicknesses and misfortunes may always happen to
   debar him from that activity, whatever it is, wherein happiness
   consists.

   4. It seems unfitting and irrational that the period of development
   should be great and the period of duration small: for it would follow
   that nature for the greater part of its time went without its final
   perfection. Hence we see that animals that live for a short time take a
   short time in arriving at maturity. But if human happiness consists in
   perfect activity according to perfect virtue, whether intellectual or
   moral, such happiness cannot accrue to man till after a long lapse of
   time; and this is especially apparent in speculative activity, in which
   the happiness of man is ultimately placed. For scarcely in extreme age
   can a man arrive [at] a perfect view of scientific truth; [589] and
   then for the most part there is little of human life left.

   5. That is the perfect good of happiness, which is absolutely free from
   admixture of evil, as that is perfect whiteness, which is absolutely
   unmingled with black. But it is impossible for man in the state of this
   life to be altogether free from evils, -- not to say bodily evils, as
   hunger, thirst, cold and heat, but even from evils of the soul. There
   is no man living who is not at times disturbed by inordinate passions,
   who does not at times overstep the mean in which virtue consists, or
   fall short of it, who is not in some things deceived, or ignorant of
   what he wishes to know, or driven to weak surmises on points where he
   would like absolute certainty.

   6. Man naturally shrinks from death, and is sad at the thought of it.
   Yet man must die, and therefore cannot be perfectly happy while here he
   lives. [590]

   7. Happiness consists, not in habit, but in activity: for habits are
   for the sake of acts. But it is impossible in this life to do any act
   continually. [591]

   8. The more a thing is desired and loved, the greater grief and sadness
   does its loss bring. But if final happiness be in this world, it will
   certainly be lost, at least by death; and it is uncertain whether it
   will last till death, since to any man there may possibly happen in
   this life diseases totally debarring him from any virtuous activity,
   such as insanity. Such happiness therefore must always have a natural
   pendent of sadness.

   But it may be replied that whereas happiness is the good of an
   intelligent nature, true and perfect happiness belongs to those in whom
   intelligent nature is found in its perfection, that is, in pure
   spirits; [592] but in man it is found imperfectly by way of a limited
   participation. And this seems to have been the mind of Aristotle:
   hence, enquiring whether misfortunes take away happiness, after showing
   that happiness lies in virtuous activities, which are the most
   permanent things in this life, he concludes that they who enjoy such
   perfection in this life are "happy for men," meaning that they do not
   absolutely attain happiness, but only in a human way. [593]

   Now it is demonstrable that the aforesaid answer is not to the undoing
   of the arguments above alleged. [594] For (a) though man is inferior in
   the order of nature to pure spirits, yet he is superior to irrational
   creatures; and therefore he must gain his final end in a more perfect
   way than they. But they gain their final end so perfectly as to seek
   nothing further. Thus the natural desire of dumb animals is at rest in
   the enjoyment of sensual delights. Much more must the natural desire of
   man be put to rest by his arrival at his last end. But that is
   impossible in this life: therefore it must be attained after this life.
   [595]

   (b) It is impossible for a natural desire to be empty and vain: for
   nature does nothing in vain. But the desire of nature (for happiness)
   would be empty and vain, if it never possibly could be fulfilled.
   Therefore this natural desire of man is fulfillable. But not in this
   life. Therefore it must be fulfilled after this life. [596]

   Alexander and Averroes laid it down that the final happiness of man is
   not in such knowledge as is possible to man through the speculative
   sciences, but in a knowledge gained by conjunction with a separately
   subsistent intelligence, which conjunction they conceived to be
   possible to man in this life. But because Aristotle saw that there was
   no other knowledge for man in this life than that which is through the
   speculative sciences, he supposed man not to gain perfect happiness,
   but a limited measure of happiness suited to his state. In all which
   investigation it sufficiently appears how hard pressed on this side and
   on that these fine geniuses (praeclara ingenia) were. From this stress
   of difficulty we shall find escape in positing, according to the proofs
   already given, that man can arrive at true happiness after this life,
   the soul of man being immortal. [597] In this disembodied state the
   soul will understand in the way in which pure spirits understand (B.
   II, Chapp. [331]XCVI, sq.) The final happiness of man then will be in
   the knowledge of God, which the human soul has after this life
   according to the manner in which pure spirits know Him.

   Therefore the Lord promises us reward in heaven (Matt. v, 12), and says
   that the saints shall be as the angels (Matt. xxii, 30), who see the
   face of God in heaven (Matt. xviii, 10).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [586] The conclusion of this chapter marks the point where St Thomas
   deliberately and expressly leaves behind him, not only Alexander and
   Averroes, but Aristotle.

   [587] It may be urged that better than rest in the perfectly understood
   would be a perpetual progress in understanding. But God in heaven never
   is perfectly understood, or comprehended, by the Blessed. Cf Chap.
   LXXII, n. 8.

   [588] "Making a sort of chameleon of the happy man, and resting his
   happiness on an unstable foundation (Eth. Nic. I, x, 8). A well-known
   poem tells "of the chameleon's form and nature."

   [589] Perfectam speculationem scientiarum, in the thirteenth century!
   In the last age of human progress will the wisest have arrived at
   anything like a perfect view of scientific truth?' There are many
   perturbing forces to interfere with the steady progress as well of the
   race as of the individual: -- infidelity, which will not be taught of
   God, and so wastes its powers after the fashion of an untractable
   schoolboy: sloth and timidity on the part of those who hold the talent
   of faith, wrapping it in a napkin instead of trafficking with it: wars
   and convulsions of civil society. At the same time, war rouses a
   nation; and the pressure of infidel criticism may and should develop a
   counter-energy in the Church.

   [590] Because to every Here liveth there answers a Here lieth.

   [591] Understand, any human act.' No man is happy by the beating of his
   heart. The proof that happiness consists in an activity of the best in
   man may be put scholastically thus. -- Being is good. Every being,
   according to its kind and capacity, asserts itself and aims at
   maintaining itself: this we may call the self-preservative nisus. Every
   being, that is capable of development, aims, not at mere maintenance,
   but at development of self. This effort after development is the
   Aristotelian phusis. In a conscious and intelligent being, the
   successful maintenance and development of self is happiness, which
   might be defined conscia plenitudo essendi. Being (esse) carries power
   (posse), and power carries act (agere). Power is called by Aristotle
   the first actuality, and act the second actuality. Being is in its full
   development when it reaches the second actuality. Man therefore is in
   the fullness of being, and therefore man is happy, when he is in the
   best second actuality of which his nature is capable; and that, as
   Aristotle proves, and St Thomas after him (Chapp. XXVI, XXXVII), is the
   act of contemplation. -- Whether this demonstration is sufficiently
   observant of the essential sociableness of human nature, is a point to
   consider. Is self complete in the individual, and not rather in
   society? Heaven is the New Jerusalem (Apoc. xxi, 2) and Jerusalem is
   the city of the great King (Matt. v, 35).

   [592] In substantiis separatis. Include under that term disembodied
   human spirits, and this whole reply is not amiss.

   [593] Nic. Eth. I, x, 16: "We will call them happy in life who have and
   shall have the specified qualifications, -- I mean, they are happy
   men." In X, vii, 8, he bids us aim at a happiness "too good for man";
   and concludes (X, viii, 8): "For heavenly beings, all their life is
   happy: for men, life is happy so far as they have any likeness of this
   blissful activity of contemplation: of other animals, none is happy,
   since they have no part in contemplation.

   [594] As there is a difference between the work that a machine is
   theoretically capable of doing, and the work that under actual
   circumstances can be got out of it, -- one such circumstance being,
   e.g., the strength of the stoker's arm; -- so there is a difference
   between the happiness that man is absolutely capable of and the
   happiness that he can attain relatively to the conditions of this life.
   None knew better than Aristotle how far the latter grade of happiness
   falls short of the former. He would therefore fall in with all that has
   been argued about happiness in this chapter, except with the conclusion
   implied in the fourth argument. Even that argument is borrowed from
   Aristotle, who is said however to have made it matter of lamentation,
   not of hope. The Aristotelian text holds out no hope of everlasting and
   perfect happiness for the human soul after death, -- as Plato in two
   places (Phaedo, 114c: Phaedrus, 248c) does for the departed soul of the
   philosopher.

   [595] "It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a pig satisfied "
   (J. S. Mill, Utilitarianism, pp. 11-16 ed. 2). St Thomas argues that as
   there is something within the pig's reach which will satisfy the pig,
   there must be something within Socrates's reach which will satisfy
   Socrates. Though Socrates dissatisfied is better off than the pig, yet
   he is not well off -- for Socrates.

   [596] I have been at considerable pains to explain and vindicate this
   argument in my Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 13-21. The alternative to
   the acceptance of it is the view of Professor Stewart, -- and, no
   doubt, of Aristotle: -- "The theoretikos bios is an ideal: it cannot be
   realised by man, for he is concrete. But the effort to realise it, so
   far as possible, is all important in human life. The effort to realise
   it co-ordinates man's powers, it gives him élan, and carries him on to
   the attainment of many things within his reach, which he would not
   otherwise aspire to" (Stewart's Notes on Nicomachean Ethics, II, 448).
   Is man then a lusus naturae, who wins an insufficient pittance in
   repeated doles by ever asking for more? Is this what Ecclesiastes xii
   calls all man? We have then the fourth petition of the Lord's Prayer
   granted to the rejection of the second, which scarcely looks like the
   fulfilment of the third. We have daily bread, but no kingdom come. We
   have the race progressing indefinitely, but all individual progress
   ending at no long time in a plunge into nothingness. Is not the case
   the same with all other animal life and with the whole vegetable world?
   To be sure it is, but man alone knows it, and his knowledge is his
   misfortune.

   [597] To the cavil that the soul of man is not man, we may reply in the
   words of Aristotle: "Every man may be reckoned to be that, which is the
   controlling and better part of him" (Nic. Eth. X, vii, 9). The
   controlling and better part of man is his immortal soul: the soul then
   is the man.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLIX--That the Knowledge which Pure Spirits have of God through
   knowing their own Essence does not carry with it a Vision of the
   Essence of God

   WE must further enquire whether this very knowledge, whereby separately
   subsistent intelligences and souls after death know God through knowing
   their own essences, suffices for their own happiness. For the
   investigation of this truth we must first show that the divine essence
   is not known by any such mode of knowledge. In no way can the essence
   of a cause be known in its effect, unless the effect be the adequate
   expression of the whole power of the cause. [598] But pure spirits know
   God through their own substances, as a cause is known through its
   effect inasmuch as each sees God as mirrored in another, and each sees
   God as expressed in himself. [599] But none of these pure spirits is an
   effect adequate to the power of God (B. II, Chapp. [332]XXVI,
   [333]XXVII). It is impossible therefore for them to see the divine
   essence by this method of knowledge.

   2. An intelligible likeness, whereby a thing is understood in its
   substance must be of the same species as that thing, or rather it must
   be its species, -- thus the form of a house in the architect's mind is
   the same species as the form of the house which is in matter, or rather
   it is its species, -- for by the species of man you do not understand
   the essence of ass or horse. [600] But the nature of an angel is not
   the same as the divine nature in species, nay not even in genus (B. I,
   [334]Chap. XXV).

   3. Everything created is bounded within the limits of some genus or
   species. But the divine essence is infinite, comprising within itself
   every perfection of entire being (B. I, Chapp. [335]XXVIII,
   [336]XLIII). It is impossible therefore for the divine substance to be
   seen through any created medium.

   Nevertheless a pure spirit by knowing its own substance knows the
   existence of God, and that God is the cause of all, and eminent above
   all, and removed (remotus) from all, not only from all things that are,
   but from all that the created mind can conceive. To this knowledge of
   God we also may attain in some sort: for from the effects of His
   creation we know of God that He is, and that He is the cause
   (sustaining principle) of other beings, super-eminent above other
   beings, and removed from all. And this is the highest perfection of our
   knowledge in this life: hence Dionysius says (De mystica theologia c.
   2) that "we are united with God as with the unknown"; which comes about
   in this way, that we know of God what He is not, but what He is remains
   absolutely unknown. And to show the ignorance of this most sublime
   knowledge it is said of Moses that he drew nigh to the darkness in
   which God was (Exod. xx, 21). [601]

   But because an inferior nature at its height attains only to the lowest
   grade of the nature superior to it, this knowledge must be more
   excellent in pure spirits than in us. For (a) the nearer and more
   express the effect, the more evidently apparent the existence of the
   cause. But pure spirits, that know God through themselves, are nearer
   and more express likenesses of God than the effects through which we
   know God.

   (c) High dignity better appears, when we know to what other high
   dignities it stands preferred. Thus a clown, knowing the king to be the
   chief man in the kingdom, but for the rest knowing only some of the
   lowest officials of the kingdom, with whom he has to do, does not know
   the king's pre-eminence so well as another, who knows the dignity of
   all the princes of the realm. But we men know only some of the lowest
   of things that are. Though then we know that God is high above all
   beings, still we do not know the height of the Divine Majesty as the
   angels know it, who know the highest order of beings and God's
   elevation above them all.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [598] St Thomas does not view causation dynamically, but statically. I
   mean, a cause to him is not a being which by its changing propagates a
   change to some other being, -- as when one ninepin falling knocks over
   another ninepin, and so on to the end of the row: this he calls, not
   causatio, but motio, and such are the causes of causation usually
   considered by physicists, but causation in St Thomas points to
   dependence of being, and a cause is a being on which another being, its
   effect, is more or less permanently dependent for its existence: that
   is why he makes quite as much of material and formal and final as of
   efficient causation.

   [599] All that pure spirits know, they know, according to St Thomas, by
   sight, or intuition (visio intellectus): he does not admit in their
   minds any reasoned out conclusions (cognitio discursiva). Does this
   really mean more than that they reason very rapidly? What we call
   'sight' is rapid inference.

   [600] But see B. I, Ch. LIV.

   [601] See Ch. [337]XXXIX, and B. I, Ch. [338]XIV, [339]note. In later
   life, St Thomas wrote more cautiously on this subject. What he means is
   this. I call God, let us say, intelligent.' And so He is intelligent.
   He is, if I may use a vulgar expression, getting on that way' which I
   call the way of intelligence; only, He goes so on in it, that the poor
   little beginning of intelligence, which is all that I can master and
   appreciate as such, is wholly unfit to stand for His infinite
   intelligence. -- To put the same in a more learned way. God to me is
   not bounded in this, which I understand, but he is this-like, and still
   more this-like to infinity. To express the fact, I may call God, and
   truly call Him, this (e.g., intelligent'); but I may as truly (though
   not always as safely to unintelligent ears) deny the same of Him,
   merely meaning by the denial that the this, though the best and truest
   word we have, is a wholly inadequate expression to contain and
   represent Him, who "is not mere Being, but even beyond Being in dignity
   and power" (Plato, Rep. 509 b). Here we have what St Thomas (B. I, Ch.
   [340]XIV) calls via remotionis.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER L--That the desire of Pure Intelligences does not rest
   satisfied in the Natural Knowledge which they have of God

   EVERYTHING that is imperfect in any species desires to gain the
   perfection of that species. He who has an opinion about a thing,
   opinion being an imperfect knowledge of the thing, is thereby egged on
   to desire a scientific knowledge of the thing. [602] But the aforesaid
   knowledge, which pure spirits have of God without knowing His substance
   fully, is an imperfect kind of knowledge. The main point in the
   knowledge of anything is to know precisely what it essentially is.
   Therefore this knowledge which pure spirits have of God does not set
   their natural desire to rest, but rather urges it on to see the divine
   substance.

   2. The knowledge of effects kindles the desire of knowing the cause:
   this search after causes set men upon philosophising. Therefore the
   desire of knowing, naturally implanted in all intelligent beings, does
   not rest unless, after finding out the substances of things made, they
   come also [etiam, not etiamsi] to know the cause on which those
   substances depend. By the fact then of pure spirits knowing that God is
   the cause of all the substances which they see, the natural desire in
   them does not rest unless they come also to see the substance of God
   Himself.

   4. Nothing finite can set to rest the desire of intelligence. Given any
   finite thing, intelligence always sets to work to apprehend something
   beyond it. But the height and power of every created substance is
   finite. Therefore the intelligence of a created spirit rests not in the
   knowledge of any created substances, however excellent, but tends still
   further in a natural desire to understand that substance which is of
   infinite height and excellence, namely, the divine substance (Chap.
   [341]XLIII).

   6. The nearer a thing is to the goal, the greater is its desire. But
   the intelligences of pure spirits are nearer to the knowledge of God
   than is our intelligence: therefore they desire that knowledge more
   intensely than we do. But even we, however much we know that God exists
   and has the attributes above mentioned, have not our desire assuaged,
   but still further desire to know God in His essence: much more then do
   pure spirits. The conclusion is, that the final happiness of pure
   spirits is not in that knowledge of God whereby they know Him through
   knowing their own substances, but their desire leads them further to
   the substance of God.

   Hereby it sufficiently appears that final happiness is to be sought in
   no other source than in activity of intellect, since no desire carries
   so high as the desire of understanding truth. All our other desires, be
   they of pleasure or of anything else desirable by man, may rest in
   other objects; but the aforesaid desire rests not until it arrives at
   God, on whom all creation hinges and who made it all. Hence Wisdom
   aptly says: I dwell in the heights of heaven, and my throne is in the
   pillar of a cloud (Ecclus xxiv, 7); and it is said, Wisdom calls her
   handmaids to the citadel (Prov. ix, 3). Let them blush therefore who
   seek in basest things the happiness of man so highly placed. [603]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [602] Mankind would be a race of philosophers, if this were true of the
   generality of men. Men generally will not take the trouble of thinking,
   they have not the ability, they have not the time (B. I, Ch. IV). St
   Thomas is speaking of beings in a perfect state, where all solicitudes
   are removed, and all passions are under control (or wholly absent), and
   intellect has perfect sway.

   [603] A well-known difficulty arises from this chapter. If pure spirits
   and disembodied souls, for there is question of both here, have a
   natural desire of seeing the substance, essence, or what Holy Writ
   calls the face of God, which sight is called by theologians the
   beatific vision'; and this natural desire of the beatific vision points
   to a corresponding possibility of realisation; then either this vision
   can be attained by natural means, a piece of ultra-Pelagianism which St
   Thomas is the first to repudiate (Chapp. [342]LII, [343]LIII); or men
   and angels, as such, require to be raised to the supernatural state,
   and could never possibly have been left by God to the mere intrinsic
   powers of their nature, a position virtually Pelagian, as making grace
   a requisite of nature, -- a position formally condemned by the Church
   in Baius (Michael Le Bay of Louvain) and Jansenius, and rejected by all
   modern Catholic theologians, who insist on the absolute possibility of
   what they call a 'state of pure (mere) nature.' Three Popes, in 1567,
   1579, 1641, condemned this proposition of Baius: "It is an opinion
   excogitated by vain and otiose men, according to the folly of
   philosophers, that man in his first origin was the recipient of gifts
   superadded to his nature, and so was elevated by the divine bounty and
   adopted to be a son of God." Baius meant that these gifts of adoption
   and sonship were proper to human nature. Again this saying of Quesnel
   is condemned in the Bull Unigenitus of 1713: "The grace of God is a
   consequence of nature, and was due to nature sound and whole." This
   matter is lucidly explained in Father Harper's Peace through the Truth,
   First Series, pp. 293-296. I have written upon the subject, Ethics and
   Natural Law, pp. 21-25; Oxford and Cambridge Conferences, First Series,
   pp. 211--217, 253-257. But how deliver St Thomas from the dilemma? The
   usual escape is by saying that he writes, not of human souls and angels
   as they are from the pure view of philosophy, in puris naturalibus, but
   as they actually are in the historical order of Providence, elevated to
   the supernatural state, destined and fitted by God's gratuitous bounty
   to see Him ultimately face to face. But the Saint's arguments in this
   chapter are purely rational and philosophical, containing not the
   slightest reference to any fact presupposed from revelation. &gt;Or
   shall we say that he deals only in eikota, arguments of congruity, but
   not of necessity, or as he says (B. I, Ch. [344]IX), rationes
   verisimiles ad fidelium exercitium et consolationem? Against this
   interpretation it is to be considered that the chapter is an essential
   link in a long chain of arguments (Chapp. XXVI-LIV) evidently meant for
   a demonstrated theory of happiness. I think we should consider what St
   Thomas would have said to the following reply to the argumentation of
   this chapter. There is no natural desire of that which created nature,
   as such, is not capable of attaining in any shape or form. But created
   nature, as such, is not capable of attaining, in any shape or form to
   the vision of God face to face: therefore. This difficulty I doubt if
   St Thomas ever raised to himself, or had brought before him. It came
   into prominence three or four centuries later in the disputes with
   Baius and Jansenius. Had St Thomas been confronted with it, I am
   confident that he would have met it as Catholic theologians now do. He
   would have acknowledged that angels and human spirits, in their mere
   natural condition, would find satisfaction and perfect natural
   happiness in a vision of God mediate and indirect. He might possibly
   still argue a certain congruity in such intelligent creatures being
   raised to the supernatural state and made capable of seeing God. He
   might and he might not, for such elevation is a stupendous advance upon
   nature; and the vision of God, but for its being a revealed fact, would
   be beyond any creature's dream. It hath not entered into the heart of
   man to conceive (1 Cor. ii, 9). But once raised to the supernatural
   order and endowed with grace, St Thomas would argue invincibly that
   there is no proper happiness for created spirits except face to face
   with the beauty and glory of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LI--How God is seen as He essentially is

   AS shown above (Chap. [345]XLIX), the divine substance cannot be seen
   by the intellect in any created presentation. Hence, if God's essence
   is to be seen, the intelligence must see it in the divine essence
   itself, so that in such vision the divine essence shall be at once the
   object which is seen and that whereby it is seen. [604]

   This is the immediate vision of God that is promised us in Scripture:
   We see now in a glass darkly, but then face to face (i Cor. xiii, 2): a
   text absurd to take in a corporeal sense, as though we could imagine a
   bodily face in Deity itself, whereas it has been shown that God is
   incorporeal (B. I, Chap. [346]XX). Nor again is it possible for us with
   our bodily face to see God, since the bodily sense of sight, implanted
   in our face, can be only of bodily things. Thus then shalt we see God
   face to face, in that we shall have an immediate vision of Him, as of a
   man whom we see face to face. By this vision we are singularly
   assimilated to God, and are partakers in His happiness: for this is His
   happiness, that He essentially understands His own substance. Hence it
   is said: When He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see
   Him as He is (1 John iii, 2). And the Lord said: I prepare for you as
   my Father hath prepared for me a kingdom, that ye may eat and drink at
   my table in my kingdom (Luke xxii, 29). This cannot be understood of
   bodily meat and drink, but of that food which is taken at the table of
   Wisdom, whereof it is said by Wisdom: Eat ye my bread and drink the
   wine that I have mingled for you (Prov. ix, 5). They therefore eat and
   drink at the table of God, who enjoy the same happiness wherewith God
   is happy, seeing Him in the way which He sees Himself.

   CHAPTER LII--That no Created Substance can of its natural power arrive
   to see God as He essentially is

   THE property of a higher nature cannot be attained by a lower nature
   except by the action of that higher nature to which it properly
   belongs. But to see God by the divine essence is the property of the
   divine nature: for it is proper to every agent to act by its own proper
   form. Therefore no subsistent intelligence can see God by the divine
   essence except through the action of God bringing it about.

   5. To see the substance of God transcends the limits of every created
   nature: for it is proper to every intelligent created nature to
   understand according to the mode of its substance: but the divine
   substance is not intelligible according to the mode of any created
   substance (Chap. [347]XLIX).

   Hence it is said: The grace of God is life everlasting (Rom. vi, 23).
   For we have shown that the happiness of man consists in the vision of
   God, which is called life everlasting, whereunto we are led solely by
   the grace of God, because such vision exceeds the faculty of every
   creature, and it is impossible to attain it except by an endowment from
   God. And the Lord says: I will manifest myself to him (John xiv, 21).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIII--That a Created Intelligence needs some influx of Divine
   Light to see God in His Essence

   IT is impossible for that which is the proper form of one thing to
   become the form of another thing, unless that latter thing comes to
   partake of some likeness to the former. But the divine essence is the
   proper intelligible form of the divine intelligence, and is
   proportioned to it: for in God these three are one, that which
   understands, that whereby it understands, and that which is understood.
   It is impossible therefore for the very essence of God to become an
   intelligible form to any created intellect otherwise than by the said
   intellect coming to be partaker in some likeness to God.

   3. If two things, not previously united, come afterwards to be united,
   this must be either by a change in both or by a change in one of them.
   If therefore any created intellect begins anew to see the essence of
   God, the divine essence must be conjoined anew with that intellect by
   way of intelligible presentation. But it is impossible for the divine
   essence to change; and therefore such union must begin by some change
   in the created intellect, that is to say, by its making some new
   acquisition.

   But because we arrive at the knowledge of things intelligible through
   things sensible, we also transfer the names of sensible cognition to
   intelligible cognition, and particularly the properties of sight, which
   among senses is the nobler and more spiritual and more akin to
   intellect: hence intellectual knowledge itself is called sight, or
   vision. And because bodily vision is not accomplished except through
   light, the means whereby intellectual vision is fulfilled borrow the
   name of light. That disposition therefore whereby a created
   intelligence is raised to the intellectual vision of the divine
   substance is called the light of glory.'

   This is the light of which it is said: In thy light we shall see light
   (Ps. xxxv, 10), to wit, of the divine substance; and, The city needeth
   not sun nor moon, for the brightness of God illuminateth it (Apoc. xxi,
   23); and, No more shall there be sun to shine on thee by day, nor
   brightness of moon to enlighten thee, but the Lord shall be to thee an
   everlasting light, and thy God shall be thy glory Isaias lx, 19). And
   because in God being and understanding are the same and He is to all
   the cause of understanding, He is on that account called light': He was
   the true light, that enlighteneth every man coming into this world John
   i, 8) [605] : God is light (1 John i, 5): Clad in light as in a garment
   (Ps. ciii, 2). And therefore also as well God as the angels in Holy
   Scripture are described in figures of fire, because of the brightness
   of fire.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [605] Is the light, spoken of in this context, natural or supernatural?
   Is it intelligence or faith?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIV--Arguments against the aforesaid statements, and their
   Solutions

   ARG. 1. No access of light to the eye can elevate the sight to see
   things that transcend the natural faculty of bodily vision. But the
   divine substance transcends the entire capacity of created
   intelligence, even more than intellect transcends the capacity of
   sense. Therefore no light can supervene upon any created intelligence,
   to elevate it to the capacity of seeing the divine substance.

   Reply. The divine substance is not beyond the capacity of created
   intelligence as though it were something altogether alien from it, as
   sound is alien from sight, or an immaterial substance from sense, --
   for the divine substance is the prime object of intelligence, and the
   beginning of all intellectual knowledge, -- but it is beyond the
   capacity of created intelligence as exceeding its power, as the more
   excellent sensible objects are beyond the capacity of sense. [606]

   Arg. 2. That light which is received in the created intelligence is
   itself created, and therefore falling infinitely short of God.
   Therefore no such light can raise the creature to the vision of the
   divine substance.

   Reply. This light raises the creature to the vision of God, not that
   there is no interval between it and the divine substance, but it does
   so in virtue of the power which it receives from God to such effect,
   although in its own being it falls infinitely short of God. For this
   created light does not conjoin the intelligence with God in point of
   being, but only in point of understanding. [607]

   Arg. 4. What is created, may very well be connatural with some created
   thing. If then that light is created, there may be some created
   intelligence, which by its own connatural light will see the divine
   substance, contrary to what has been shown (Chap. [348]XLII).

   Reply. The vision of the divine substance exceeds all natural faculty:
   hence the light whereby a created intelligence is perfected to the
   vision of the divine substance must be supernatural.

   Arg. 6. There must be proportion between the intelligence and the thing
   understood. But there is no proportion between a created intelligence,
   perfected in the aforesaid light, and the divine substance, since the
   distance between them still remains infinite.

   Reply. So there is a proportion between a created intelligence and God
   as an object of understanding, not a proportion implying any
   commensurateness of being, but a proportion implying a reference of one
   to the other, as matter is referred to form, or cause to effect. Thus
   there may well be a proportion between the creature and God, as the
   understanding is referred to the understood, or the effect to the
   cause. [608]

   Some have been moved by these and the like arguments to lay down the
   statement that God is never to be seen by any created intelligence. But
   this position, besides taking away the true happiness of the rational
   creature, which cannot be except in the vision of the divine substance,
   as has been shown (Chap. [349]LI), is also in contradiction with the
   authority of Holy Scripture, and is to be rejected as false and
   heretical. [609]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [606] But not so entirely beyond the capacity of telescopes,
   spectroscopes and photographic plates. -- Can we then say that the
   difference between a created intelligence and the divine is more like a
   difference of degree than of kind? Can we say that created and divine
   differ only as finite and infinite in the same kind? We cannot say
   that: for God is not in any kind (B. I, Chap. XXV), and the same name
   is predicable of God and His creature only in an analogous sense (B. I,
   Chapp. XXXII, XXXIV). The difference between Creator and creature is
   not a difference of degree, and is deeper than any difference of kind.
   I do not venture to dissent from St Thomas's solution, and I have no
   other. But to me the difficulty remains, still outstanding, and
   apparently insoluble.

   [607] Non propter ejus indistantiam a divino intellectu, sed propter
   virtutem, etc. The light then does not reach the object, and still has
   the power of carrying the mind's eye to the object. To say so is to
   confess that the metaphor of light has broken down.

   [608] This is called in the schools proportio habitudinis (St Thomas's
   phrase here), sed non existentiae. I have written elsewhere: "There is
   an analog between the paper plan of the building and the building as it
   exists. . . . It is obvious that plan and building do not receive the
   same name in the same sense: yet there is some connexion and relation
   between the two, a relation of the less to the incomparably greater
   which it somehow exhibits and represents" (Oxford and Cambridge
   Conferences, second series, pp. 132, 133). Another, and possibly a more
   apt illustration, might be supplied by modern graphs,' I mean one of
   those curves of temperature,' or the like, which correspond to, but do
   not (except a very indirect or highly generic fashion) resemble the
   facts which they truly represent.

   [609] In this chapter St Thomas labours to dispel the difficulties of
   ittisâl,--that conjunction of the human mind with a superior
   intelligence, which Averroes and the Arabian school dreamt of; and
   thought to see fulfilled in this life (B. II, Chapp. LIX sq.) which is
   fulfilled, although in a different manner, by Christian faith and
   charity, sanctifying grace and sacraments; which has its perfect
   fulfilment in the beatific vision. It is a white counter, inscribed
   with a new name, which none knoweth but him who receiveth (Apoc. ii,
   17). I mean, there are difficulties in the explanation of it, beyond
   the power of mortal faculties to solve.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LV--That the Created Intelligence does not comprehend the
   Divine Substance

   THE aforesaid light is a principle of divine knowledge, since by it the
   created intelligence is elevated to see the divine substance. Therefore
   the mode of divine vision must be commensurate with the intensity of
   the aforesaid light. But the aforesaid light falls far short in
   intensity of the brightness of the divine understanding. It is
   impossible therefore for the divine substance to be seen by such light
   so perfectly as the divine understanding sees it. The divine
   understanding sees that substance as perfectly as it is perfectly
   visible: for the truth of the divine substance and the clearness of the
   divine understanding are equal, nay are one. It is impossible therefore
   for created intelligence through the aforesaid light to see the divine
   substance as perfectly as it is perfectly visible. But everything that
   is comprehended by any knowing mind is known by it as perfectly as it
   is knowable. Thus he who knows that a triangle has three angles equal
   to two right angles, taking it as a matter of opinion on probable
   grounds because wise men say so, does not yet comprehend that truth: he
   alone comprehends it, who knows it as matter of science, through the
   medium of a demonstration showing cause. It is impossible therefore for
   any created intelligence to comprehend the divine substance.

   2. Finite power cannot compass in its activity an infinite object. But
   the divine substance is infinite in comparison with every created
   intellect, since every created intellect is bounded within the limits
   of a certain species.

   When it is said that the divine substance is seen but not comprehended
   by created intelligence, the meaning is not that something of it is
   seen and something not seen, since the divine substance is absolutely
   simple: what is meant is that it is not seen perfectly so far as it is
   visible. In the same way he who holds a demonstrable conclusion as a
   matter of opinion, is said to know it but not to comprehend it, because
   he does not know it perfectly, that is, scientifically, though there is
   no part of it that he does not know. [610]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [610] This is commonly expressed by saying that the Blessed in heaven
   vident Deum totum, sed non totaliter. A further illustration, suggested
   by Cardinal Newman's Grammar of Assent, is the case of two men both
   knowing the same proposition, the one with a notional,' the other with
   a real' assent: only the latter can be said fully to grasp or
   comprehend the truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVI--That no Created Intelligence in seeing God sees all things
   that can be seen in Him

   THEN only does the knowledge of a principle necessitate the knowledge
   of all its effects, when the principle is thoroughly comprehended by
   the understanding: for so a principle is known to the whole extent of
   its power, all its effects being known as caused by it. But through the
   divine essence other things are known as effects from their cause.
   Since then created intelligence cannot know the divine substance so as
   to comprehend it, there is no necessity for it in seeing the divine
   substance to see all things that can be known thereby.

   3. The extent of any power is measured by the objects to which it
   reaches. To know then all the objects to which any power reaches is to
   comprehend the power itself. But the divine power, being infinite, can
   be comprehended by no created intelligence, as neither can the divine
   essence (Chap. [350]LV). Neither then can any created intelligence know
   all the objects to which the divine power extends.

   5. No cognitive faculty knows anything except under the aspect of its
   proper object: thus by sight we know things only as coloured. Now the
   proper object of intelligence is whatever is in the substance of a
   thing. [611] Therefore whatever the intelligence knows of a thing, it
   knows by a knowledge of the substance of the thing. If ever we know the
   substance of a thing by its accidents, that happens accidentally,
   inasmuch as our intellectual knowledge arises from sense, and thus we
   need to arrive at an intellectual view of substance through a knowledge
   of accidents: wherefore this does not take place in mathematics, but in
   the natural sciences only. Whatever therefore in a thing cannot be
   known by a knowledge of its substance, must remain unknown to the
   knowing mind. But what a voluntary agent wishes cannot be known by a
   knowledge of his substance: for the will does not tend to its objects
   altogether by natural necessity: hence will' and nature' are counted
   two distinct active principles. [612] What therefore a voluntary agent
   wills is not knowable except haply through certain effects, as, when we
   see one acting voluntarily, we know what he has willed: or it may be
   known in its cause, as God knows our wills, as He knows other effects
   of His production, by the fact of His being to us the cause of willing
   (B. I, Chap. [351]LXVIII ad fin.): or it may be known by one intimating
   his will to another, as when one expresses his desire by speech. Since
   then many things depend on the absolute will of God, as has been partly
   shown already, and will hereafter appear, a created intelligence, even
   though seeing the substance of God, does not for all that see all that
   God sees by his substance. [613]

   It may be objected that God's substance is something greater than all
   that He can make, or understand, or will beyond Himself; and that
   therefore, if a created intelligence can see the substance of God, much
   more can it know all that God through Himself either understands or
   wills or can do. But on careful study we see that it is not one and the
   same thing for an object to be known in itself and known in its cause.
   There are things easy enough to know in themselves, but not easily
   known in their causes. Though it is true that it is a grander thing to
   have understanding of the divine substance than to understand anything
   else, knowable in itself, away from that substance, still it is more
   perfect knowledge to know the divine substance, and in it to see its
   effects, than to know the divine substance without seeing its effects.
   Now the seeing of the divine substance may be without comprehension of
   it: but to have all things rendered intelligible through that substance
   and actually known, that cannot come about without comprehension.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [611] Thus I have an ocular presentation of a large head, fierce eyes,
   wide, whiskered mouth, and gleaming teeth: these phenomena, or
   accidents, are reported by sense: any intelligence asks, What is that?,
   (thus raising the question of quiddity, or substance), and answers
   itself, It is a lion.

   [612] The distinction is that which we draw between moral' and
   physical.'

   [613] To apply to Almighty God the principle that what a voluntary
   agent wishes, cannot be known by a knowledge of his substance," lays
   one open to the objection that, at that rate, the divine volitions are
   something over and above the divine substance, contrary to B. I, Chapp.
   LXXV - LXXVII. I suppose St Thomas would reply that a perfect
   comprehension of God's substance would reveal His volitions.

   CHAPTER LVII--That every Intelligence of every grade can be partaker of
   the vision of God

   SINCE it is by supernatural light that a created intelligence is raised
   to the vision of the divine substance, there is no created intelligence
   so low in its nature as to be incapable of being raised to this vision.
   For that light cannot be connatural to any creature (Chap. [352]LIV),
   but transcends the faculty of every created nature. But what is done by
   supernatural power is not hindered by diversity of nature, since divine
   power is infinite. [614] Hence in the miraculous healing of the sick it
   makes no difference whether one be very ill or slightly indisposed.
   Therefore diversity of grade in intelligent nature is no hindrance to
   the lowest subject of such a nature being raised by that light to that
   vision.

   2. The distance from God of the intelligence highest in order of nature
   is infinite in respect of perfection and goodness: whereas the distance
   of that intelligence from the very lowest intelligence is finite, for
   between finite and finite there cannot be infinite distance. The
   distance therefore between the lowest created intelligence and the
   highest is as nothing in comparison with the distance between the
   highest created intelligence and God. But what is as nothing can make
   no sensible variation, as the distance between the centre of the earth
   and our point of vision is as nothing in comparison with the distance
   between our point of vision and the eighth sphere, compared with which
   the whole earth counts as a point; [615] and therefore no sensible
   error follows from our astronomers in their calculations taking their
   point of observation for the centre of the earth. [616] Whatever
   intellect then is raised to the vision of God by the above mentioned
   light, -- be it highest, or lowest, or middlemost, -- it makes no
   difference.

   3. Every intelligence naturally desires the vision of the divine
   substance (Chapp. [353]XXV, [354]L ). But a natural desire cannot be in
   vain. Any and every created intelligence then can arrive at the vision
   of the divine substance; and inferiority of nature is no impediment.

   Hence the Lord promises to man the glory of the angels: They shall be
   as the angels of God in Heaven (Matt. xxii, 30); and in the Apocalypse
   the same measure is said to be of man and angel: the measure of a man,
   that is, of an angel (Apoc. xxi, 17). Therefore often in Holy Scripture
   the angels are described in the form of men, either entirely so, as
   with the angels who appeared to Abraham (Gen. xviii), or partially, as
   with the living creatures of whom it is said that the hand of a man was
   under their wings (Ezech. i, 8).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [614] There is some limit to the application of this principle. A dumb
   animal could not be raised to the supernatural order. Short of
   intellectual soul, there can be no sanctifying grace. Unless the mind's
   eye be naturally open to intellectual truth, there is no means of
   opening it to the vision of God.

   [615] The eighth sphere of solid crystal carried all the fixed stars,
   set in it like stones in a ring. Beyond that was a ninth: and the tenth
   and outermost sphere was the primum mobile, the daily rotation of which
   from east to west carried round the inferior spheres. This is called
   the Ptolemaic system, but the eight spheres already figure in Plato,
   Rep. x, 616d, 617.

   [616] Disregarding parallax, -- but the reckoning is with the eighth
   sphere,' ad quam tota terra comparata obtinet locum puncti. St Thomas
   had some inkling of the magnitude of the heavens. But what he calls
   tota terra in this relation is a vaster quantity, the orbit of the
   earth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVIII--That one may see God more perfectly than another

   THE light of glory raises to the vision of God in this, that it is a
   certain likeness to the divine understanding (Chap. [355]LIII). But a
   thing may be likened to God with more or less of closeness. Therefore
   one may see the divine substance with more or less of perfection.

   4. The end must correspond to the means taken to gain it. But not all
   subsistent intelligences are equally prepared for their end, which is
   the vision of the divine substance: for some are of greater virtue,
   some of less, virtue being the way to happiness. Therefore there must
   be a diversity in their vision of God.

   Hence it is said: in my Father's House there are many mansions (John
   xiv, 2). In the mode of vision then there appear diverse grades of
   glory among the Blessed, but in respect of the object of vision their
   glory is the same. Hence to all the labourers in the vineyard, though
   they have not laboured equally, the Lord tells us that the same reward,
   or penny, is to be given, because the same object is given to all to
   see and enjoy, namely, God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIX--How they who see the Divine Substance see all things

   SINCE the vision of the divine substance is the final end of every
   subsistent intelligence, and the natural desire of every being is at
   rest when it has attained to its final end, the natural desire of every
   intelligence that sees the divine substance must be perfectly set at
   rest. But it is the mind's natural desire to know the genera and
   species and capabilities of all things and the whole order of the
   universe, as is shown by the zeal of mankind in trying to find out all
   these things. [617] Every one therefore of those who see the divine
   substance will know all the above-mentioned objects.

   2. In this is the difference between sense and intellect, as shown in
   De anima, III, iv, that sense is spoilt or impaired by brilliant or
   intense sensible objects, so that afterwards it is unable to appreciate
   similar objects of lower degree: but intellect, not being spoilt or
   checked by its object, but simply perfected, after understanding an
   object in which there is more to understand, is not less but better
   able to understand other objects which afford less scope for
   understanding. But the highest in the category of intelligible beings
   is the divine substance. When then an understanding is raised by divine
   light to see the substance of God, much more is it perfected by the
   same light to understand all other objects in nature.

   4. Though of those who see God one sees Him more perfectly than an
   other, every one nevertheless sees Him with such perfection as to fill
   all his natural capacity, nay, the vision transcends all natural
   capacity (Chap. [356]LII). Every one therefore, seeing the divine
   substance, must know in that substance all things to which his natural
   capacity extends. But the natural capacity of every intelligence
   extends to the knowledge of all genera and species and the order of
   creation. These things therefore every one of those who see God will
   know in the divine substance.

   Hence to Moses asking for a sight of the divine substance the Lord
   replied: I will show thee all good (Exod. xxxiii, 19); and Gregory says
   (Dialogues iv, 33): "What is it that they do not know, who know Him who
   knows all things?"

   But on careful reflection upon what has been said it appears that they
   who see the divine substance in one way know all things, and in one way
   they do not. If by all things' is meant whatever belongs to the
   perfection of the universe, the arguments alleged prove that they do
   see all things. [618] To the perfection of natural being belong
   specific natures, with their properties and powers: for the intention
   of nature fixes on specific natures: as for individuals, they are for
   the species. [619] It belongs then to the perfection of a subsistent
   intelligence, that it should know the natures and capabilities and
   proper accidents of all species. And by the knowledge of natural
   species individuals also existing under these species are known by the
   intelligence that sees God. [620]

   But if by all things' is meant all things that God knows by seeing His
   essence, no created intelligence sees all things in the substance of
   God, as has been shown above (Chap. [357]LVI). [621] This may be
   verified in various respects. First, as regards things that God can do,
   but neither does nor ever means to do. All such things cannot be known
   without a thorough comprehension of His power, which is not possible to
   any created intelligence (Chap. [358]LV). Hence it is said: Perchance
   thou wilt seize upon the footprints of God and perfectly discover the
   Almighty. He is higher than heaven, and what wilt thou do? He is deeper
   than hell, and whence shalt thou know? Longer than the earth is his
   measure, and broader than the sea (Job xi, 7-9). Secondly, as regards
   the plans of things made, no intelligence can know them all without
   comprehending the divine goodness. For the plan of every thing made is
   taken from the end which the maker intends; and the end of all things
   made by God is the divine goodness: the plan therefore of things made
   is the diffusion of the divine goodness in creation. To know then all
   the plans of things made, one would have to know all the good things
   that can come about in creation according to the order of the divine
   wisdom: which would mean comprehending the divine goodness and wisdom,
   a thing that no created intelligence can do. Hence it is said: I
   understood that of all the works of God man cannot find out the plan
   (Eccles. viii, 17). Thirdly, as regards things that depend on the mere
   will of God, as predestination, election, justification, and the like,
   which belong to the sanctification of the creature, it is said: The
   things that are in man none knoweth but the spirit of man that is in
   him: in like manner the things that are of God none knoweth but the
   Spirit of God (1 Cor. ii, 11).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [617] By the keen pursuit of physical science.

   [618] By 'seeing all things that belong to the perfection of the
   universe,' St Thomas would mean, in modern terminology, having a
   comprehensive scientific view of the universe as a whole': this would
   include knowledge of the constitution of matter, and of its working
   arrangements, molar and molecular; and understanding of electricity, of
   gravitation, of vegetable and animal life, of the genesis of nebulae
   and stars, of the origin of species, animal and vegetable, of the
   workings of the mind, such as free will. A very wonderful knowledge,
   but much less wonderful than the vision of God.

   [619] The intention of nature' is for corn to grow, but not for every
   grain to germinate. The waste of nature,' noticed by Bishop Butler, is
   a waste of individuals, but not usually of species.

   [620] Yes, if the intelligence sees in the substance of God His decree
   for the creation of these and those individuals. But St Thomas makes a
   difficulty about the vision of the divine substance extending to a
   vision of the divine decrees: see Chap. LVI, n. 4, and the last words
   of this chapter. One of the Blessed can see me in God, if he can read
   in God the divine volition to create and conserve me in being. He
   cannot see me in the species man,' for I am not adequately there: my
   individualising accidents are not contained in the species. Even if
   they were, I should not be known as an existing, but only as a possible
   being. No knowledge of the specific type of Julius Caesar could tell
   you that a Julius Caesar ever actually lived and died. This cannot be
   denied except by one who is prepared to break down all distinction
   between the a priori scientific order and the a posteriori historical
   order of things, and to make all beings and events ultimately a priori,
   as part of the inevitable evolution of the Absolute. He who will go
   this length may march with Hegel, or, if he will, with Hobbes: but St
   Thomas, with Aristotle, distinguishes the contingent from the
   necessary. You cannot, no one possibly can, read the contingent in the
   necessary. But all individual existence, except that of God, is
   ultimately contingent; while the specific ratio is necessary. Cf. B.
   II, Chap. C.

   [621] It is important to attend to these explanations, since the
   headings of Chapp. LVI, LIX, seem at first sight contradictory. The
   power, goodness and will of God remain beyond the full comprehension of
   the Blessed, and consequently many of their possible effects in
   creation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LX--That they who see God see all things in Him at once

   SINCE it has been shown that a created intelligence in seeing the
   divine substance understands therein all the species of things; since
   moreover all things that are seen by one presentation must be seen
   together by one vision; it necessarily follows that the intelligence
   which sees the divine substance views all things, not successively, but
   simultaneously. Hence Augustine says (De Trinitate XV, xvi): "Our
   thoughts will not then be unstable, coming and going from one thing to
   another, but we shall see all our knowledge together at one glance."
   [622]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [622] This is not in contradiction with B. II, Chap. CI, because in
   that chapter there is question of the natural knowledge of an angel,
   here of what is known by the vision of God, which is supernatural.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXI--That by the Sight of God one is Partaker of Life
   Everlasting

   ETERNITY differs from time in this, that time has being in succession,
   but the being of eternity is all present together. But in the sight of
   God there is no succession: all things that are seen in that vision are
   seen at one glance. That vision therefore is accomplished in a certain
   participation of eternity. That vision also is a certain life: for
   activity of intellect is a life. Therefore by that sight the created
   intelligence is partaker of life everlasting.

   4. The intellectual soul is created on the confines of eternity and
   time: because it is last in order of intelligences, and yet its
   substance is raised above corporeal matter, being independent of the
   same. But its action, inasmuch as it touches inferior things that are
   in time, is temporal. Therefore, inasmuch as it touches superior things
   that are above time, its action partakes of eternity. Such is
   especially the vision whereby it sees the divine substance. Therefore
   by such vision it enters into participation of eternity, and sees God
   in the same way as any other created intelligence.

   Hence the Lord says: This is life everlasting, to know thee the only
   true God (John xvii, 3).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXII--That they who see God will see Him for ever

   WHATEVER now is, and now is not, is measured by time. But the vision
   that makes the happiness of intellectual creatures is not in time, but
   in eternity (Chap. [359]LXI). It is impossible therefore that from the
   moment one becomes partaker of it he should ever lose it.

   2. An intelligent creature does not arrive at its last end except when
   its natural desire is set at rest. But as it naturally desires
   happiness, so it naturally desires perpetuity of happiness: for, being
   perpetual in its substance, whatever thing it desires for the thing's
   own sake, and not for the sake of something else, it desires as a thing
   to be had for ever. [623] Happiness therefore would not be the last
   end, if it did not endure perpetually.

   3. Everything that is loved in the having of it brings sadness, if we
   know that at some time we must part with it. But the beatific vision,
   being of all things most delightful and most desired, is of all things
   most loved by them who have it. They could not therefore be otherwise
   than saddened, if they knew that at some time they were to lose it. But
   if it were not meant to last for ever, they would be aware of the fact:
   for in seeing the divine substance, they also see other things that
   naturally are (Chap. [360]LIX). [624]

   6. It is impossible for one to wish to resign a good thing that he
   enjoys, except for some evil that he discerns in the enjoyment of that
   good, or because he reckons it a hindrance to greater good. But in the
   enjoyment of the beatific vision there can be no evil, since it is the
   best thing to which an intelligent creature can attain: nor can he who
   enjoys that vision possibly think that there is any evil in it, or
   anything better than it, since the vision of that sovereign truth
   excludes all false judgement. [625]

   5. Nothing that is viewed with wonder can grow tedious: as long as it
   is an object of wonder, the desire of seeing it remains. But the divine
   substance is always viewed with wonder by any created intelligence,
   since no created intelligence can comprehend it. Therefore such
   intelligence can never find that vision tedious.

   9. The nearer a thing comes to God, who is wholly unchangeable, the
   less changeable it is and the more enduring. But no creature can draw
   nearer to God than that which beholds His substance. The intelligent
   creature then gains in the vision of God a certain immutability, and
   cannot fall from that vision.

   Hence it is said: Blessed are they who dwell in thy house, O Lord: they
   shall praise thee for ever and ever (Ps. lxxxiii, 5): He shall never be
   moved from his place, that dwelleth in Jerusalem (Ps. cxxiv, 1):
   Whoever shall overcome, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my
   God, and he shall not go out any more (Apoc. iii, 12).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [623] If I desire hunting for its own sake, not as an interlude between
   duties, I must desire to hunt incessantly, could I do so without
   fatigue.

   [624] Not however the divine decrees (Chapp. LVI, n. 4: LIX ad fin). A
   better argument perhaps is this, that if they thought that the vision
   was to last for ever, whereas it was not, there would be a delusion
   built into their happiness: they would be living in a fool's paradise,
   which is contrary to the idea of a perfect state.

   [625] And therefore all sin (Chap. X).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXIII--How in that Final Happiness every Desire of Man is
   fulfilled

   FROM what has been said it evidently appears that in that final
   happiness which comes of the vision of God every human desire is
   fulfilled, according to the text: Who filleth thy desire with good
   things (Ps. cii, 5). And every human endeavour there finds its final
   good: as may be seen by discussing the several heads. -- I. As man is
   an intelligent being, there is in him a desire of investigating truth,
   which desire men follow out in the pursuit of a contemplative life. And
   this will manifestly be fulfilled in that vision, since by the sight of
   the first and highest truth all things that man naturally desires to
   know will become known to him (Chap. [361]L).

   2. There is also a desire which a man has in keeping with his rational
   faculty of managing and disposing of inferior things: which desire men
   prosecute in the pursuit of an active and civil life. And the chief
   scope and purpose of this desire is the laying out of man's whole life
   according to reason, which means living virtuously. [626] This desire
   will then be altogether fulfilled when reason shall be in the height of
   its vigour, being enlightened by divine light that it may not fall away
   from what is right.

   3. Upon civil life there follow certain goods which a man needs for his
   social and political activities. Thus there is honour and high estate,
   the inordinate desire of which makes men intriguing [627] and
   ambitious. But that vision elevates men to the supreme height of
   honour, uniting them with God; and therefore, as God is the king of
   ages (1 Tim. i, 17), so the Blessed united with Him are said to reign:
   They shall reign with Christ (Apoc. xx, 6).

   4. Another object of desire following upon civil life is celebrity of
   fame, by inordinate desire of which men are said to be covetous of vain
   glory. By that divine vision the blessed become celebrated, not before
   men, who may deceive and be deceived, but in the most true knowledge of
   God and of all their companions in bliss. And therefore that happiness
   is very frequently termed glory' in Holy Scripture, as in Ps. cxliv, 5:
   The saints shall exult in glory.

   5. There is also another thing desirable in civil society, namely,
   riches, by inordinate craving and love for which men become illiberal
   and unjust. But in that blissful state there is sufficiency of all good
   things, inasmuch as the Blessed enjoy Him who comprises the perfection
   of them: wherefore it is said: All good things came to me with her
   (Wisdom vii, 11); and, Glory and wealth is in this house (Ps. cxi, 3).

   6. There is also a third desire in man, common to him with other
   animals, the desire of pleasurable enjoyments, which men pursue in the
   life of pleasure, and thereby become intemperate and incontinent. [628]
   But in the happiness of the sight of God there is perfect delight, all
   the more perfect than the pleasure of sense, which brute animals also
   can enjoy, as intellect is higher than sense; all the more perfect as
   (quanto) the good in which we shall take delight is greater than any
   sensible good, and comes more home to us, and is more continually
   delightful; all the more perfect again as the delight is more pure and
   free from all admixture of sadness or harassing solicitude; and of this
   it is said: They shall be inebriated by the plenty of thy house, and
   thou wilt make them drink of the torrent of thy pleasure (Ps. xxxv, 9).

   7. There is also a natural desire common to all things, in that they
   all desire self-preservation, so far as possible; by the immoderation
   of which desire men are rendered timid and spare themselves too much
   from labours. This desire also shall be perfectly fulfilled when the
   Blessed attain to perfect everlasting duration, secure from all hurt,
   according to the text: They shall not hunger nor thirst any more,
   neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor any heat (Isa. xlix, 10;
   Apoc. vii, 16).

   Thus it appears that by the vision of God subsistent intelligences gain
   true happiness, in which every desire is wholly laid to rest, and in
   which there is abundant sufficiency of all good things, which Aristotle
   considers a requisite of happiness. [629] Nothing in this life is so
   like this final and perfect happiness as the life of them who
   contemplate truth so far as possible. For the contemplation of truth
   begins in this life, but will be consummated in the life to come,
   whereas the life of action and the political life do not transcend the
   bounds of this present.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [626] Hence the Aristotelian maxim, that the end of government is to
   make the citizens virtuous, up to a certain measure of human and social
   virtue. Or we may say it is to rationalise' the community, that is, to
   form them into a whole regulated by reason. The civil ruler, as such,
   is a living public reasonableness.

   [627] Superflui which seems to be some translation of perittoi,
   periergoi.

   [628] Intemperati et incontinentes, the Aristotelian akolastoi kai
   akrateis. "In the intemperate man the will is inclined to sin by its
   own choice, that proceeds from a habit acquired by custom: whereas in
   the incontinent man the will is inclined to sin by some passion. And
   because passion quickly passes off; whereas a habit is a quality
   difficult to change, it follows that the incontinent man repents at
   once, when the fit of passion is over, which happens not with the
   intemperate man: nay, the latter is even glad to have sinned, because
   the act of sin by habit has become connatural to him" (Sum. Theol. 2a
   2ae, q. 156, art. 3: Aquinas Ethicus, II, 339: I, 170, 171).

   [629] "There will be need too of external prosperity, while man is man:
   for his nature is not self-sufficient for contemplation, but needs a
   healthy body, food and other comforts" (Nic. Eth., X, ix, 1). The
   laying to rest of all desire reminds us rather of Asiatic conceptions
   of happiness, involving the removal of work and worry and of the
   consequences of sin, the most accessible side of the concept of
   felicity, mortalibus aegris. But to the Thomist and the Christian,
   desire is appeased by full intensity of life (contemplatio, theoria):
   to the Asiatic by an intellectual stillness verging on anaesthesia
   (nirvâna). We pray for requiem aeternam, likewise for lux perpetua; but
   to the perfect Buddhist nirvâna is simply extinction. Buddhism is the
   antithesis of the scholastic thesis, ens est bonum.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXIV--That God governs things by His Providence

   THE foregoing conclusions sufficiently show that God is the end of all
   things. Hence it may be further gathered that by His providence He
   governs and rules all things. For whatever things are referred to an
   end, are all subject to His management to whom principally that end
   belongs, as appears in an army: for all the components of the army and
   all their works are referred to one last end, the good of the general,
   which is victory, and therefore it belongs to the general to govern the
   whole army. In like manner the art which is concerned with the end
   gives commands and laws to the art which is concerned with the means,
   as politics to the art of war, the art of war to the management of
   cavalry, navigation to shipbuilding. Since therefore all things are
   referred to an end, which is the divine goodness (Chapp. [362]XVII,
   [363]XVIII), God, to whom that goodness principally belongs, -- as
   being His own substance, possessed, understood, and loved, -- must have
   the chief control of all things.

   5. Things that are distinct in their natures do not combine into one
   system, unless they be bound up in one by one directing control (ab uno
   ordinante). But in the universe there are things, having distinct and
   contrary natures, which nevertheless all combine in one system, some
   things taking up the activities of other things, some things being
   aided or even wrought by others. There must then be one ordainer and
   governor of the universe.

   8. Every agent that intends an end cares more for that which is nearer
   to the last end. But the last end of the divine will is the divine
   goodness, and the nearest thing to that in creation is the goodness of
   the order of the entire universe, that being the end to which every
   particular good of this or that thing is referred, as the less perfect
   is referred to the more perfect, and every part is for its whole. What
   therefore God most cares for in creation is the order of the universe:
   [630] He is therefore its controller.

   Hence Holy Scripture ascribes the course of events to the divine
   command: Who giveth command to the sun, and it riseth not, and
   encloseth the stars as under a seal (Job ix, 7): He hath given a
   command, and it shall not pass away (Ps. cxlviii, 6).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [630] This is St Thomas's way of saying that God governs according to
   general laws of nature and thought. -- The following argument may be
   added from Sum. Theol., 1a, q. 22, art. 2: "Since every agent acts for
   an end, the direction of effects to an end on the part of the prime
   agent extends wide as His causality extends. Whenever in the workings
   of an active cause anything occurs that is not directed to an end, it
   is because that effect ensues upon the working of some other cause
   beside the intention of the original agent. But the causality of God,
   the prime agent, extends to all beings: . . . hence all things,
   whatsoever in any way have being, are ordained by God to an end."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXV--That God preserves things in being

   FROM God's governing all things by His providence it follows that He
   preserves them in being. [631] For everything whereby things gain their
   end is part of the governing of them. But to the last end which God
   intends, namely, the divine goodness, things are directed not only by
   their activities, but also by the fact of their existence, because by
   that mere fact they bear some likeness to the divine goodness.
   Therefore it is proper to divine providence to keep things in being.

   5. As a work of art presupposes a work of nature, so a work of nature
   presupposes a work of God creating: for the material of artificial
   things is from nature, and the material of natural things is through
   creation of God. But artificial things are preserved in being by virtue
   of natural things, as a house by the solidity of its stones. Therefore
   natural things are not preserved in being otherwise than through the
   power of God. [632]

   6. The impression made by an agent does not remain in the effect when
   the action of the agent ceases, unless that impression turns into and
   becomes part of the nature of the effect. Thus the forms and properties
   of things generated remain in them to the end, after the generation is
   done, because they are made natural to the things: in like manner
   habits are difficult to change, because they turn into nature. But
   dispositions, bodily impressions, and emotions, though they remain for
   some little while after the action of the agent, do not remain
   permanently: they find place in the subject as being on the way to
   become part of its nature. [633] But what belongs to the nature of a
   superior genus in no way remains after the action of the agent is over,
   as light does not remain in a transparent medium after the source of
   light is taken away. [634] But being is not the nature or essence of
   anything created, but of God alone (B. I, Chapp. [364]XXI, [365]XXII).
   Nothing then can remain in being when the divine activity ceases. [635]

   7. Concerning the origin of things there are two theories, one of
   faith, that things had a first commencement, and were then brought into
   being by God; the other the theory of sundry philosophers, that things
   have emanated (fluxerint) from God from all eternity. On either theory
   we must say that things are preserved in being by God. For if things
   are brought into being by God after not being, the being of things must
   be consequent upon the divine will; and similarly their not being,
   because He has permitted things not to be when He willed and made
   things to be when He willed. Things therefore are, so long as He wills
   them to be. His will then is the upholder of creation. On the other
   hand, if things have emanated from God from all eternity, it is
   impossible to assign any time or instant in which first they emanated
   from God. Either then they were never produced by God at all, or their
   being is continually coming forth from God so long as they exist.

   Hence it is said: Bearing up all things by the word of his power (Heb.
   i, 3). And Augustine says (De Gen. ad lit. iv, 12): "The power of the
   Creator, and the might of the Almighty and All-containing, is the cause
   of the permanence of every creature. If this power ever ceased from
   governing creation, all the brave show of creatures would at once
   cease, and all nature would fall to nothing. It is not like the case of
   one who has built a house, and goes away, and still the structure
   remains, when his work has ceased and his presence is withdrawn. The
   world could not endure for the twinkling of an eye, if God retired from
   the government of it."

   Hereby is excluded the theory of some Doctors of the Law of the Moors,
   who, by way of sustaining the position that the world needs the
   preserving hand of God, have supposed all forms to be accidents, [636]
   and that no accident lasts for two successive instants, the consequence
   being that the formation of things is always in the making, -- as
   though a thing needed no efficient cause except while it is in the
   making. Some of them are further said to hold that the indivisible
   atoms, [637] out of which they say that all substances are composed, --
   which atoms, according to them, alone are indestructible, -- could last
   for some short time, even though God were to withdraw His guidance from
   the world. Some of them further say that things would not cease to be
   but for God causing in them an accident of ceasing.' [638] All which
   positions are manifestly absurd.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [631] It is more usual to argue the other way about, as St Thomas
   himself does as quoted in the last note, that because God has created
   this world, and keeps it all in being, He must have His own designs
   about it and be managing it to His own ends.

   [632] By way of illustrating the importance of physical science to the
   theologian, I note two propositions of St Thomas in the fourth
   argument, here omitted: (a) "No corporeal thing acts otherwise than
   through being in motion." So Aristotle, Physics, VIII, v. (b) "It is
   impossible for the motion of anything to continue, when the motor
   action of the moving cause ceases to be." The first proposition has not
   been reconciled with the laws of gravitation and of electric and
   magnetic attraction: the second is a denial of the inertia of matter.
   St Thomas took them both from Aristotle.

   [633] Insunt ut in via ad naturam, as one might say of an undergraduate
   inest ut in via ad gradum. "A habit is a quality difficult to change,
   whereby an agent, whose nature it was to work one way or another
   indeterminately, is disposed easily and readily at will to follow this
   or that particular line of action. Habit differs from disposition, as
   disposition is a quality easily changed. Thus one in a good humour is
   in a disposition to be kind. Habit is a part of character: disposition
   is a passing fit" (Ethics and Natural Law, p. 64). Unfortunately, the
   word disposition in English is used to signify natural or congenital
   character, the Latin indoles. We might perhaps say mood. But the
   plural, good dispositions, expresses St Thomas's dispositio.

   [634] Or as learning does not remain in the mind of an ignorant and
   unintellectual pupil in the absence of his teacher. When the pupil is
   becoming capable of private study, then learning is growing into
   something of a habit in him: "it is turning into nature" (vertitur in
   naturam), as St Thomas says.

   [635] This is truly a magnificent argument. -- In these idealist days,
   there is no difficulty in bringing any theist to avow that things could
   not be at all, if they dropped out of the thought of the Supreme Mind.
   But God's mere thinking of them is not enough to raise them out of the
   order of pure possibilities, and transfer them into the region of
   actual being. To give them actuality, God must will them; and to keep
   them in existence He must will them continually. Cf. B. I, Chapp. LIII,
   LIV, LXXXI.

   [636] To St Thomas, forms' were some accidental,' others 'substantial.'

   [637] Corpora indivisibilia, so the Editions. But the Bergamo
   autograph, if we may trust the printers, has corpora invisibilia. That
   a body may have accidents impervious to sense, a microscopic
   composition quite other than what appears to the eye, does not seem
   usually to have been recognised by the schoolmen. Their accidents' are
   the sensible phenomena of bodies. Here again the progress of physics
   has seriously affected metaphysics. The use of reading a mediaeval book
   about accidents' is to enable you to understand mediaeval authors and
   to interpret mediaeval formularies. But when you have caught the
   meaning, it remains for you to apply it to the ulterior conditions
   revealed by later science, -- no easy task.

   [638] Read desitionis (from desino) not decisionis. This accidens
   desitionis may after all perhaps be no other than the forma cadaverica,
   supposed by some school men to replace the soul as the form' of the
   body after death. These Moors' (Arabian commentators on Aristotle)
   evidently were in possession of the atomic theory of Leucippus and
   Democritus, a theory embraced by Epicureans, but no favourite with
   Aristotelians.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVI--That nothing gives Being except in as much as it acts in
   the Power of God

   NOTHING gives being except in so much as it is an actual being. But God
   preserves things in actuality.

   5. The order of effects is according to the order of causes. But among
   all effects the first is being: all other things, as they proceed from
   their cause, are determinations of being. Therefore being is the proper
   effect of the prime agent, and all other things act inasmuch as they
   act in the power of the prime agent. Secondary agents, which are in a
   manner particular determinants of the action of the prime agent, have
   for the proper effects of their action other perfections determinant of
   being. [639]

   6. What is essentially of a certain nature, is properly the cause of
   that which comes to have that nature only by participation. [640] But
   God alone is being by essence, all others are beings by participation.
   Therefore the being of everything that exists is an effect properly due
   to God; so that anything that brings anything else into being does so
   insomuch as it acts in the power of God.

   Hence it is said: God created all things to be (Wisd. i, 14).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [639] Thus e.g. that this painting is a portrait rather than a
   landscape is attributable, under God, to the will of the painter: but
   that this painting is at all, is the singular effect of divine action.

   [640] This is a bit of Platonism that has passed through Aristotle to
   St Thomas. St Thomas gives the example of fire being the cause of all
   things fiery. But there is no essential element of fire, any more than
   there is any essential beauty, outside of God. There is no actual
   essential nature anywhere in creation. Thus there is no actual
   essential humanity, by participation in which all men are men.
   Aristotle's doctrine of the four elements, fire being essentially hot,
   air essentially cold, earth essentially dry, and water essentially
   moist, is really a scheme of Platonic Ideas operating as physical
   causes. For all his protests against the Ideas, Aristotle never became
   quite emancipated from their control.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVII--That God is the Cause of Activity in all Active Agents

   AS God not only gave being to things when they first began to be, but
   also causes being in them so long as they exist (Chap. [366]LXV); so He
   did not once for all furnish them with active powers, but continually
   causes those powers in them, so that, if the divine influx were to
   cease, all activity would cease.

   Hence it is said: Thou hast wrought all our works in us, O Lord (Isa.
   xxvi, 12). And for this reason frequently in the Scriptures the effects
   of nature are put down to the working of God, because He it is that
   works in every agent, physical or voluntary: e.g., Hast thou not drawn
   me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese? with skin and flesh thou
   hast clothed me, with bones and sinews thou hast put me together (Job
   x, 10, 11).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVIII--That God is everywhere and in all things

   AN incorporeal thing is said to be in a thing by contact of power.
   Therefore if there be anything incorporeal fraught with infinite power,
   that must be everywhere. But it has been shown (B. I Chap. [367]XLIII)
   that God has infinite power. He is therefore everywhere.

   4. Since God is the universal cause of all being, in whatever region
   being can be found there must be the divine presence.

   6. An efficient cause must be together with its proximate and immediate
   effect. But in everything there is some effect which must be set down
   for the proximate and immediate effect of God's power: for God alone
   can create (B. II, Chap. [368]XXI); and in everything there is
   something caused by creation, -- in corporeal things, primordial
   matter; in incorporeal beings, their simple essences (B. II, Chapp.
   [369]XV, sq). God then must be in all things, especially since the
   things which He has once produced from not-being to being He
   continually and always preserves in being (Chap. [370]LXV).

   Hence it is said: I fill heaven and earth (Jer. xxiii, 24): If I ascend
   into heaven, thou art there: if I descend into hell, thou art there
   (Ps. cxxxviii, 8).

   God is indivisible, and wholly out of the category of the continuous:
   hence He is not determined to one place, great or small, by the
   necessity of His essence, seeing that He is from eternity before all
   place: but by the immensity of His power He reaches all things that are
   in place, since He is the universal cause of being. Thus then He is
   whole everywhere, reaching all things by His undivided power. [641]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [641] "God is in all things by power, inasmuch as all things are
   subject to His power. He is in all things by presence, inasmuch as all
   things are naked and open to his eyes (Heb. iv, 13). He is in all
   things by essence, because His substance is at hand to all things as
   the cause of their being" (Sum. Theol., 1, q. 8, art. 3). For the
   scholastic meaning of place' see note, p. 100]. Space' scarcely engaged
   St Thomas's attention. Nor does he discuss immensity as an attribute of
   God. He declares: "We say that there was no place or space before the
   world was" (Sum. Theol., 1, q. 46, art. 1, ad 4). This is tantamount to
   saying that God is everywhere where creatures are; but that, apart from
   creation, there is no meaning in speaking of God as being everywhere.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVIX--Of the Opinion of those who withdraw from Natural Things
   their Proper Actions

   SOME have taken an occasion of going wrong by thinking that no creature
   has any action in the production of natural effects, -- thus that fire
   does not warm, but God causes heat where fire is present. So Avicebron
   [642] in his book, The Fountain of Life, lays it down that no body is
   active, but the power of a subsistent spirit permeating bodies does the
   actions which seem to be done by bodies. But on such theories many
   awkward consequences follow.

   1. If no inferior cause, and especially no corporeal cause, does any
   work, but God works alone in all agencies, and God does not change by
   working in different agencies; no difference of effect will follow from
   the difference of agencies in which God works: but that is false by the
   testimony of sense.

   2. It is contrary to the notion of wisdom for anything to be to no
   purpose in the works of the wise. But if created things in no way work
   to the production of effects, but God alone works all effects
   immediately, to no purpose are other things employed by Him.

   3. To grant the main thing is to grant the accessories. But actually to
   do follows upon actually to be: thus God is at once pure actuality and
   the first cause. If then God has communicated to other beings His
   likeness in respect of being, it follows that He has communicated to
   them His likeness in respect of action.

   4. To detract from the perfection of creatures is to detract from the
   perfection of the divine power. But if no creature has any action in
   the production of any effect, much is detracted from the perfection of
   the creature: for it marks abundance of perfection to be able to
   communicate to another the perfection which one has oneself.

   5. God is the sovereign good (B. I, Chap. [371]XLI). Therefore it
   belongs to Him to do the best. But it is better for good conferred on
   one to be common to many than for it to be confined to that one: for
   common good always proves to be more godlike than the good of the
   individual. But the good of one comes to be common to many when it is
   derived from one to many, which cannot be except in so far as the agent
   diffuses it to others by a proper action of its own. God then has
   communicated His goodness in such a way that one creature can transmit
   to others the good which it has received.

   6. To take away order from creation is to take away the best thing that
   there is in creation: for while individual things in themselves are
   good, the conjunction of them all is best by reason of the order in the
   universe: for the whole is ever better than the parts and is the end of
   the parts. But if actions are denied to things, the order of things to
   one another is taken away: for things differing in their natures are
   not tied up in the unity of one system otherwise than by this, that
   some act and some are acted upon.

   7. If effects are not produced by the action of creatures, but only by
   the action of God, it is impossible for the power of any creature to be
   manifested by its effect: for an effect shows the power of the cause
   only by reason of the action, which proceeds from the power and is
   terminated to the effect. But the nature of a cause is not known
   through its effect except in so far as through its effect its power is
   known which follows upon its nature. [643] If then created things have
   no actions of their own productive of effects, it follows that the
   nature of a created thing can never be known by its effect; and thus
   there is withdrawn from us all investigation of natural science, in
   which demonstrations are given principally through the effect. [644]

   Some Doctors of the Moorish Law are said to bring an argument to show
   that accidents are not traceable to the action of bodies, the ground of
   the argument being this, that an accident does not pass from subject to
   subject: hence they count it an impossibility for heat to pass from a
   hot body to another body heated by it, but they say that all such
   accidents are created by God. Now this is a ridiculous proof to assign
   of a body not acting, to point to the fact that no accident passes from
   subject to subject. When it is said that one hot body heats another, it
   is not meant that numerically the same heat, which is in the heating
   body, passes to the body heated; but that by virtue of the heat, which
   is in the heating body, numerically another heat comes to be in the
   heated body actually, which was in it before potentially. For a natural
   agent does not transfer its own form to another subject, but reduces
   the subject upon which it acts from potentiality to actuality. [645]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [642] The Jew, Salomon Ibn-Gebird.

   [643] Hence they who deny all causative activity, and reduce causality
   to a particular case of sequence, further conclude, logically enough,
   that we can know nothing of natures,' 'substances,' essences,' and
   things in themselves,' but only phenomena. Logic should further lead
   them to deny all potential being and all permanent existence, and to
   take up with the Heraclitean flux.

   [644] That is to say, the proofs are a posteriori, resting on
   experience. The order of nature is an historical order, particularly in
   its coexistences. It may be objected that the physicist may prescind
   entirely from the question agitated in this chapter. So indeed he may.
   But St Thomas's natural science' includes physics and metaphysics.
   Metaphysics rest on an a posteriori basis of sensory experience. The
   enquiries in Aristotle's eight books of Physics are chiefly
   metaphysical. No doubt, physics have gained by being made a speciality,
   apart from metaphysics. The former is the lower, the latter the higher
   science. You may stop short of the higher: but you can be no great
   master of the higher if you are quite a novice in the lower. Nemo
   metaphysicus quin idem physicus.

   [645] The doctrine refuted in this chapter is known in more recent
   philosophy as Occasionalism. "Occasionalism . . . . teaches that
   created things are the mere occasions on which the Divinity takes the
   opportunity to act conformably to the requirements of the objects
   present; this theory is especially characteristic of the school of
   Descartes, and is in intimate connexion with the reduction of matter by
   that philosopher to extension, with inertia for its chief property.
   Matter, according to him, can itself do nothing: It is a mere
   receptivity and channel of communication or transference for the motion
   imparted by the Creator; it can hand about movement from particle to
   particle, but it cannot originate or destroy any; and thus it is
   opposed to mind, the very essence of which is thought or activity.
   Matter is inert extension, thought is ever operative inextension, etc."
   See General Metaphysics, Stonyhurst Series, pp. 308-313.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXX--How the Same Effect is from God and from a Natural Agent

   SOME find it difficult to understand how natural effects are
   attributable At once to God and to a natural agent. For (Arg. 1) one
   action, it seems, cannot proceed from two agents. If then the action,
   by which a natural effect is produced, proceeds from a natural body, it
   does not proceed from God.

   Arg. 2. When an action can be sufficiently done by one, it is
   superfluous to have it done by more: we see that nature does not do
   through two instruments what she can do through one. Since then the
   divine power is sufficient to produce natural effects, it is
   superfluous to employ also natural powers for the production of those
   same effects. Or if the natural power sufficiently produces its own
   effect, it is superfluous for the divine power to act to the same
   effect.

   Arg. 3. If God produces the whole natural effect, nothing of the effect
   is left for the natural agent to produce.

   Upon consideration, these arguments are not difficult. Reply 1. The
   power of the inferior agent depends upon the power of the superior
   agent, inasmuch as the superior agent gives to the inferior the power
   whereby it acts, or preserves that power, or applies it to action; as a
   workman applies a tool to its proper effect, frequently however without
   giving the tool the form whereby it acts, [646] nor preserving it, but
   merely giving it motion. The action therefore of the inferior agent
   must proceed from that agent not merely through its own power, but
   through the power of all superior agents, for it acts in virtue of them
   all. And as the ultimate and lowest agent acts immediately, so is the
   power of the prime agent immediate in the production of the effect. For
   the power of the lowest agent is not competent to produce the effect of
   itself, but in power of the agent next above it; and the power of that
   agent is competent in virtue of the agent above it; and thus the power
   of the highest agent proves to be of itself productive of the effect,
   as the immediate cause, as we see in the principles of mathematical
   demonstrations, of which the first principle is inimediate. [647] As
   then it is not absurd for the same action to be produced by an agent
   and the power of that agent, so neither is it absurd for the same
   effect to be produced by an inferior agent and by God, by both
   immediately, although in different manners.

   Reply 2. Though a natural thing produces its own effect, it is not
   superfluous for God to produce it, because the natural thing does not
   produce it except in the power of God. Nor is it superfluous, while God
   can of Himself produce all natural effects, for them to be produced by
   other causes: this is not from the insufficiency of God's power, but
   from the immensity of His goodness, whereby He has wished to
   communicate His likeness to creatures, not only in point of their
   being, but likewise in point of their being causes of other things
   (Chap. [372]XXI). Reply 3. When the same effect is attributed to a
   natural cause and to the divine power, it is not as though the effect
   were produced partly by God and partly by the natural agent: but the
   whole effect is produced by both, though in different ways, as the same
   effect is attributed wholly to the instrument, and wholly also to the
   principal agent. [648]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [646] The workman does not usually make his own tools. This example of
   the workman and his tool, a favourite with St Thomas, goes beyond the
   domain of physical nature, and therefore is in point. But, as I have
   already observed, the instances which physical nature yields are not of
   subordinate, but of co-ordinate action. That prime minister of
   creation, the corpus coeleste, or primum mobile, respected and
   constantly referred to till the end of the sixteenth century, has gone
   finally out of office, and with it the primacy and commanding influence
   of heavenly over earthly bodies. Physical forces in the heavens above
   and on the earth beneath make together a republic, not a feudal
   monarchy.

   [647] That is, immediately known, or self-evident. The feudal, or
   hierarchical, view of causation, here taken, is remarkable.

   [648] The notion of instrumentality does not enter into physical
   science. Only intelligence applies instruments, formally as such.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXI--That the Divine Providence is not wholly inconsistent
   with the presence of Evil in Creation

   PERFECT goodness could not be in creation if there were not found an
   order of goodness among creatures, some being better than others: or
   else all possible grades of goodness would not be filled up; nor would
   any creature be like God in having pre-eminence over another. [649]
   Thus a great beauty would be lost to creation in the removal of the
   order of distinct and dissimilar beings, one better than the other. A
   dead level of goodness would be a manifest derogation to the perfection
   of creation. A higher grade of goodness consists in there being
   something which cannot fall away from goodness; a lower grade, in there
   being that which can fall away. [650] The perfection of the universe
   requires both grades of goodness. But it is the care of a ruler to
   uphold perfection in the subjects of his government, not to make it
   less. Therefore it is no part of divine providence wholly to exclude
   from creation the capability of falling away from good. But upon this
   capability evil ensues: for what is capable of falling away, sometimes
   does fall away; and the mere lack of good is evil (Chap. [373]VII).

   3. The best rule in any government is to provide for everything under
   government according to the mode of its nature: just administration
   consists in this. As then it would be contrary to any rational plan of
   human administration for the civil government to debar its subjects
   from acting according to their offices and conditions of life, except
   perhaps in an occasional hour of emergency, so it would be contrary to
   the plan of divine government not to allow creatures to act according
   to the mode of their several natures. But by the very fact of creatures
   so acting there follows destruction and evil in the world, since by
   reason of mutual contrariety and inconsistency one thing is destructive
   of another. [651]

   5. There are many good things in creation which would find no place
   there, unless evils were there also. Thus there would be no patience of
   the just, if there were not the malice of persecutors: no room for
   vindictive justice, if there were no offences: and in the physical
   order one thing cannot come to be unless something else is destroyed.
   [652] If then evil were wholly excluded from the universe by divine
   providence, the number of good things would be proportionally
   diminished: which ought not to be, because good is more vigorous in
   goodness than evil in badness (virtuosius est bonum in bonitate quam in
   malitia malum), as above shown (Chap. [374]XII).

   6. The good of the whole takes precedence of the good of the part. It
   belongs then to a prudent ruler to neglect some defect of goodness in
   the part for the increase of goodness in the whole, as an architect
   buries the foundation under the earth for the strengthening of the
   whole house. But if evil were removed from certain portions of the
   universe, much perfection would be lost to the universe, the beauty of
   which consists in the orderly blending of things good and evil
   (pulcritudo ex ordinata bonorum et malorum adunatione consurgit), while
   evil things have their origin in the breaking down of good things, and
   still from them good things again take their rise by the providence of
   the ruler, as an interval of silence makes music sweet.

   7. Other things, and particularly inferior things, are ordained to the
   end of the good of man. But if there were no evils in the world, much
   good would be lost to man, as well in respect of knowledge, as also in
   respect of desire and love of good: for good is better known in
   contrast with evil; and while evil results come about, we more ardently
   deire good results: as sick men best know what a blessing health is.

   Therefore it is said: Making peace and creating evil (Isai. xlv, 7):
   Shall there be evil in the city that the Lord has not done? (Amos iii,
   6.)

   Boethius (De consolatione, Lib. I, prosa 4) introduces a philosopher
   asking the question: If there is a God, how comes evil?'. The argument
   should be turned the other way: If there is evil, there is a God.' For
   there would be no evil, if the order of goodness were taken away, the
   privation of which is evil; and this order would not be, if God were
   not.

   Hereby is taken away the occasion of the error of the Manicheans, who
   supposed two primary agents, good and evil, as though evil could not
   have place under the providence of a good God.

   We have also the solution of a doubt raised by some, whether evil
   actions are of God. Since it has been shown (Chap. [375]LXVI) that
   every agent produces its action inasmuch as it acts by divine power,
   and that thereby God is the cause of all effects and of all actions
   (Chap. [376]LXVII); and since it has been further shown (Chap. [377]X)
   that in things subject to divine providence evil and deficiency happens
   from some condition of secondary causes, in which there may be defect;
   it is clear that evil actions, inasmuch as they are defective, are not
   of God, but of defective proximate causes; but so far as the action and
   entity contained in them goes, they must be of God, -- as lameness is
   of motive power, so far as it has anything of motion, but so far as it
   has anything of defect, it comes of curvature of the leg.

   [649] In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver,
   but also of wood and earthenware, and some unto honour, some unto
   dishonour (2 Tim. ii, 20). Yes, but we should like to have every vessel
   good of its kind; sound earthenware as well as 22-carat gold. Per se it
   is so, per accidens often not. The human spirit ever finds some retort
   upon these justifications. Investigable up to a certain point, the dark
   continent of evil stretches away beyond into mystery; and there is
   nothing for it but to trust God.

   [650] An atom cannot fall away from goodness, being practically
   imperishable: a man's body easily falls away: yet there is no doubt
   which represents the higher grade of goodness.

   [651] This perhaps is the best account that we have to render of evil.
   Evil lies at the root of things creatable, limited and imperfect: it is
   imbedded in the eternal possibilities of their nature: let but things
   exist in time, and certain evils, physical evils at any rate, are bound
   to arise. And given a realm of rational creatures, subject to physical
   evils, moral evils are not far off the frontier of such a kingdom.

   [652] We only live because previous generations have died and made room
   for us. Deaths make births and marriages possible. A general
   resurrection, under the conditions of humanity that at present obtain,
   would be as bad as a general massacre.

   CHAPTER LXXII--That Divine Providence is not inconsistent with an
   element of Contingency in Creation [653]

   AS divine providence does not exclude all evil from creation, neither
   does it exclude contingency, or impose necessity upon all things. The
   operation of providence does not exclude secondary causes, but is
   fulfilled by them, inasmuch as they act in the power of God. Now
   effects are called necessary' or contingent' according to their
   proximate causes, not according to their remote causes. Since then
   among proximate causes there are many that may fail, not all effects
   subject to providence will be necessary, but many will be contingent.

   6. On the part of divine providence no hindrance will be put to the
   failure of the power of created things, or to an obstacle arising
   through the resistance of something coming in the way. But from such
   failure and such resistance the contingency occurs of a natural cause
   not always acting in the same way, but sometimes failing to do what it
   is naturally competent to do; and so natural effects do not come about
   of necessity. [654]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [653] Cf. I, Chapp. [378]LXVII (with notes), [379]LXXXV. The
   contingent, sumbebekos, is that which is, but might not be (Aristotle,
   Physics, VIII, v). The term is still of interest to the logician, and
   to the psychologist, who concerns himself with the freedom of the will,
   but has lost all interest in physical science, except in the cognate
   sense of accidental.

   [654] But a natural cause,' or physical agent, as such (res naturalis),
   as distinguished from a moral agent, does always act in the same way
   under the same circumstances. It is the circumstances that vary, not
   the behaviour of the natural cause. Compare Newton's second law of
   motion. And so natural, or physical, events come about under an
   hypothetical necessity. They always happen in the same way, if the
   antecedents, positive and negative, are the same. In this chapter St
   Thomas is concerned to obviate a difficulty unlikely to occur to modern
   minds, -- how it is consistent with divine providence for terrestrial
   events, such as the weather, the growth of the crops, the healthy
   development of animals, not to run in regular calculable cycles, like
   the ordinary celestial phenomena, sunrise and sunset, equinox and
   solstice, the waxing and waning of the moon. From Plato and Aristotle
   to Newton, celestial phenomena were necessary,' terrestrial
   contingent.' The real difference is one of simplicity and plurality of
   causes. Professor Stewart, Notes on Nicomachean Ethics, vol. II, p. 9,
   writes: "There is no contingency in things, but there is often failure
   on the part of organic beings to cope with the complexity of the
   necessary laws which thing obey": a remark which is true, so far as
   things do obey necessary laws. But there is a contingency in acts of
   free will, and in things so far as they are consequent upon such acts.
   To take another point of view. Contingency, like chance, has been
   predicated of co-existences, or coincidences, rather than of sequences;
   and necessity has been made out for sequence better than for
   co-existence. The study of co-existences carries us far back into the
   dim past, even to that primitive collocation of materials,' which, it
   is argued, must have been the work of intelligence and free will. Cf.
   B. I, Chap. [380]XIII: B. III, Chap. XCIV, with notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIII--That Divine Providence is not inconsistent with Freedom
   of the Will

   THE government of every prudent governor is ordained to the perfection
   of the things governed, to the gaining, or increasing, of maintenance
   of that perfection. An element of perfection then is more worthy of
   being preserved by providence than an element of imperfection and
   defect. But in inanimate things the contingency of causes comes of
   imperfection and defect: for by their nature they are determined to one
   effect, which they always gain, unless there be some let or hindrance
   arising either from limitation of power, or the interference of some
   external agent, or indisposition of subject-matter; and on this account
   natural causes in their action are not indifferent to either side of an
   alternative, but for the most part produce their effects uniformly,
   while they fail in a minority of instances. But that the will is a
   contingent cause comes of its very perfection, because its power is not
   tied to one effect, but it rests with it to produce this effect or
   that, wherefore it is contingent either way. [655] Therefore providence
   is more concerned to preserve the liberty of the will than to preserve
   contingency in natural causes.

   2. It belongs to divine providence to use things according to their
   several modes. But a thing's mode of action depends upon its form,
   which is the principle of action. But the form whereby a voluntary
   agent acts is not determinate: for the will acts through a form
   apprehended by the intellect; and the intellect has not one determined
   form of effect under its consideration, but essentially embraces a
   multitude of forms; [656] and therefore the will can produce multiform
   effects.

   3. The last end of every creature is to attain to a likeness to God
   (Chap. [381]XVII): therefore it would be contrary to providence to
   withdraw from a creature that whereby it attains the divine likeness.
   But a voluntary agent attains the divine likeness by acting freely, as
   it has been shown that there is free will in God (B. I, Chap.
   [382]LXXXVIII).

   4. Providence tends to multiply good things in the subjects of its
   government. But if free will were taken away, many good things would be
   withdrawn. The praise of human virtue would be taken away, which is
   nullified where good is not done freely: the justice of rewards and
   punishments would be taken away, if man did not do good and evil
   freely: wariness and circumspection in counsel would be taken away, as
   there would be no need of taking counsel about things done under
   necessity. It would be therefore contrary to the plan of providence to
   withdraw the liberty of the will. [657]

   Hence it is said: God made man from the beginning, and left him in the
   hand of his own counsel: before man is life and death, whatever he
   shall please shall be given him (Ecclus xv, 14-17).

   Hereby is excluded the error of the Stoics, who said that all things
   arose of necessity, according to an indefeasible order, which the
   Greeks called ymarmene (heimarmene).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [655] To say that the will is contingent either way' means that,
   between two ways, it so takes one way as to be able to take the other.
   The question need not be raised here whether the two ways are opposed a
   contraries, or as contradictories.

   [656] In plain English, the intellect does not think of one thing only
   to do, but of many courses of action.

   [657] I have endeavoured to lend this contested argument some support
   in Political and Moral Essays, Essay VI, Morality without free will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIV--That Divine Providence is not inconsistent with Fortune
   and Chance [658]

   THE multitude and diversity of causes proceeds from the order of divine
   providence and arrangement. Supposing an arrangement of many causes,
   one must sometimes combine with another, so as either to hinder or help
   it in producing its effect. A chance event arises from a coincidence of
   two or more causes, in that an end not intended is gained by the coming
   in of some collateral cause, as the finding of a debtor by him who went
   to market to make a purchase, when his debtor also came to market.
   [659]

   Hence it is said: I saw that the race was not to the swift . . . . but
   that occasion and chance are in all things (Eccles ix, 11) to wit, in
   all sublunary things (in inferioribus). [660]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [658] See Chap. VI, note, p. 187.

   [659] The example is from Aristotle's three chapter on chance and
   fortune (Physics, II, iv, v, vi), the concluding sentence of which is
   worth quoting: "Chance (to automaton) and fortune (he tuche) something
   posterior to intelligence and natural development: so that however much
   chance be the cause of the system of the heavens, intelligence and
   natural development must needs be a prior cause, as well of many other
   things, as also of this universe."

   [660] Aristotle is right in contending that things do happen by fortune
   and chance; and further that fortune and chance are relative terms,
   denoting the unforeseen and unpremeditated in relation to (human)
   forethought. But in relation to a perfect providence, an all-seeing
   mind, an omnipotent ruler, nothing is fortuitous: everything is
   foreseen, allowed for, willed, or at least permitted. Nor are the laws
   of nature at fault in a chance event. The same forces, working
   according to the same laws, forward man to his destination nine hundred
   and ninety-nine times, and the thousandth time they destroy him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXV--That the Providence of God is exercised over Individual
   and Contingent Things

   IF God has no care of these individual things, that is either because
   He does not know them, or because He has no power over them, or because
   He has no will to take care of them. But it has been shown above (B. I,
   Chap. [383]LXV) that God has knowledge of individual things. Nor can it
   be said that He has no power to take care of them, seeing that His
   power is infinite (B. II, Chap. [384]XXII). Nor again that God has no
   wilt to govern them, seeing that the object of His will is universally
   all good (B. I, Chap. [385]LXXVIII).

   3. This common attribute is found in productive causes, that they have
   a care of the things that they produce, as animals naturally nourish
   their young. God thereof has care of the things of which He is the
   cause. But He is the cause even of these particular things (B. II,
   Chap. [386]XV), and therefore He has care of them. [661]

   5. It would be a foolish providence not to take care of those things
   without which the objects of one's care could not exist. But certainly,
   if all particulars were to fail, universals could not remain. If then
   God has care of the universal only, and neglects the individual
   altogether, His providence must be foolish and imperfect. But if it is
   said that God has care of individuals so far as to see that they are
   maintained in being, but no further, that answer cannot stand. For all
   that befalls individuals has some bearing on their preservation or
   destruction. If therefore God has care of individuals so far as to see
   to their preservation, He must have care of all that befalls them.

   7. This is the difference between speculative and practical knowledge,
   that speculative knowledge and all that concerns such knowledge is
   wrought out in generalities, whereas the sphere of practical knowledge
   is the particular. For the end of practical knowledge is truth, which
   consists primarily and ordinarily in the immaterial and universal,
   while the end of practical knowledge is action, which deals with
   particular facts. Hence the physician does not attend man in general,
   but this man; and to the care of the individual man the whole science
   of medicine is directed. But providence, being directive of things to
   their end, must be a department of practical knowledge. Thus the
   providence of God would be very imperfect, if it stopped short at the
   universal, and did not reach individual cases.

   8. The perfection of speculative knowledge lies in the universal rather
   than in the particular: universals are better known than particulars;
   and therefore the knowledge of the most general principles is common to
   all. Still, even in speculative science, he is more perfect who has not
   a mere general but a concrete (propriam) knowledge of things. For he
   who knows in the general only, knows a thing only potentially. Thus the
   scholar is reduced from a general knowledge of principles to a concrete
   knowledge of conclusions by his master, who has both knowledges, -- as
   a being is reduced from potentiality to actuality by another being,
   already in actuality. Much more in practical science is he more
   perfect, who disposes things for actuality not merely in the universal
   but in the particular. God's most perfect providence therefore extends
   even to individuals.

   9. Since God is the cause of being, as such (B. II, Chap. [387]XV), He
   must also be the provider of being, as such. Whatever then in any way
   is, falls under His providence. But singular things are beings, and
   indeed more so than universals, because universals do not subsist by
   themselves, but are only in singulars. [662] Divine providence
   therefore has care also of singulars.

   Hence it is said: Two sparrows are sold for a farthing; and not one of
   them falls to the ground without your Father (Matt. x, 29); and,
   [Wisdom] reaches from end to end strongly (Wisd. viii, 1), that is,
   from the highest creatures to the lowest. Also their opinion is
   condemned who said: The Lord hath abandoned the earth, the Lord doth
   not see (Ezech. ix, 9): He walketh about the poles of heaven, and doth
   not consider our things (Job xxii, 14).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [661] The tree holds on to its fruit, so far as it can, and only sheds
   it spontaneously when it is ripe. Dumb animals care for their young
   till they are old enough to shift for themselves. Human love and
   solicitude for children endure as long as life lasts, -- and not only
   for children, but for artistic creations of hand and mind. But God is
   of all living things the best, according to the Aristotelian definition
   (Metaph. XII, vii). He may be expected therefore to be more careful of
   His creatures than the tree of its fruit, than the animal of its young,
   than parent of child, than artist of his work.

   [662] The universal exists in the singular, not as a universal, but as
   something selectable and universalisable by the mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVI--That the Providence of God watches immediately over all
   Individual Things

   IN matters of human administration, the higher administrator confines
   his care to the arrangement of general main issues, and leaves details
   to his subordinates, and that on account of his personal limitations,
   because, as for the state and condition of lesser things, he is either
   ignorant of them, or he cannot afford the labour and length of time
   that would be necessary to arrange for them. But such limitations are
   far from God: it is no labour for Him to understand, and it takes Him
   no time, since in understanding Himself He understands all things else
   (B. I, Chap. [388]XLIX).

   4. In human administrations, the industry and care of the lower
   officials arranges matters left to their charge by their chief. Their
   chief does not bestow upon them their faculty of industry and care, but
   merely allows it free play. If the industry and care came from their
   superior, the arrangement would be the superior's arrangement; and they
   would not be authors of the arrangement, but carriers of it into
   execution. But we have seen (B. I, Chap. [389]LI: B. III, Chap.
   [390]LXVII) that all wisdom and intelligence comes from God above; nor
   can any intellect understand anything except in the power of God, nor
   any agent do anything except in the same power. God Himself therefore
   by His providence immediately disposes all things; and whoever are
   called providers under Him, are executors of His providence. [663]

   7. If God does not by Himself take immediate care of lower
   individualities, that must be either because He despises them, or
   because He fears to sully His dignity, as some say. [664] But that is
   irrational, for there is greater dignity in devising an arrangement
   than in working one out. If then God works in all things, as has been
   shown (Chap. [391]LXVII), and that is not derogatory to His dignity,
   nay rather befits His universal and sovereign power, an immediate
   providence over individual things is no contemptible occupation for Him
   either, and throws no slur upon His dignity.

   Hence it is said: Thou hast done the things of old and hast devised one
   thing after another (Judith ix, 4).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [663] How this stands with the permission of evil government and evil
   contrivance generally, see Chap. LXXXI.

   [664] St Thomas refers to Averroes's Comments on what was then counted
   the twelfth book of Aristotle's Metaphysics. Against the same
   Commentator are directed B. I, Chapp. LXIV, LXV, LXX.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVII--That the arrangements of Divine Providence are carried
   into execution by means of Secondary Causes

   IT belongs to the dignity of a ruler to have many ministers and
   diversity of servants to carry his command into execution, the height
   and greatness of his lordship appearing by the multitude of persons of
   various ranks who are subject to him: but no dignity of any ruler is
   comparable with the dignity of the divine government: it is suitable
   therefore that the arrangements of divine providence be carried into
   execution by divers grades of agents.

   6. As the cause is superior to the effect, the order of causes is
   nobler than that of effects: in that order therefore the perfection of
   divine providence is better shown. But if there were not intermediate
   causes carrying divine providence into execution, there would be in
   creation no order of causes, but only of effects. The perfection
   therefore of divine providence requires that there should be
   intermediate causes carrying it into execution.

   Hence it is said: Bless the Lord, all his powers, ye ministers that do
   his word (Ps. cii, 21): Fire, hail, snow, stormy winds that do his word
   (Ps. cxlviii, 8).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVIII--That Intelligent Creatures are the Medium through
   which other Creatures are governed by God

   SINCE the preservation of order in creation is a concern of divine
   providence, and it is a congruous order to descend by steps of due
   proportion from highest to lowest, [665] divine providence must reach
   by a certain rule of proportion to the lowest things. The rule of
   proportion in this, that as the highest creatures are under God and are
   governed by Him, so lower creatures should be under the higher and be
   governed by them. But of all creatures intelligent creatures are the
   highest (Chap. [392]XLIX). Therefore the plan of divine providence
   requires that other creatures should be governed by rational creatures.
   [666]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [665] Such was the order of the feudal system, the order of the
   political world for centuries, not yet broken up when St Thomas wrote;
   and he made out the order of nature and of divine providence on the
   principle of feudalism. See Chap. XCI.

   [666] St Thomas has five more a priori arguments to the same effect,
   none of which, when tested by experience, evinces more than this, that
   rational creatures have some partial control over the rest of creation.
   A partial control, for, so far as we can pronounce, what rational or
   intelligent creature has anything to say to the ice at the North Pole,
   to the inner fires of the earth, to the courses of the stars?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXI--Of the Subordination of Men one to another

   SINCE man is endowed with understanding and sense and bodily power,
   these faculties are arranged in order in him by the disposition of
   divine providence according to the plan of the order that obtains in
   the universe, bodily power being put under that of sense and intellect
   as carrying out their command, and the sentient faculty itself under
   the faculty of intellect. And similar is the order between man and man.
   Men pre-eminent in understanding naturally take the command; while men
   poor in understanding, but of great bodily strength, seem by nature
   designate for servants, as Aristotle says in his Politics, [667] with
   whom Solomon is of one mind, saying: The fool shall serve the wise
   (Prov. xi, 29). But as in the works of one man disorder is born of
   intellect following sense, so in the commonwealth the like disorder
   ensues where the ruler holds his place, not by pre-eminence of
   understanding, but by usurpation of bodily strength, or is brought into
   power by some burst of passion. Nor is Solomon silent upon this
   disorder: There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, a fool set
   in high estate (Eccles x, 5, 6). But even such an anomaly does not
   carry with it the entire perversion of the natural order: for the
   dominion of fools is weak, unless strengthened by the counsel of the
   wise. Hence it is said: A wise man is strong, and a knowing man stout
   and valiant: because war is managed by due ordering, and there shall be
   safety where there are many counsels (Prov. xxiv, 5, 6). And because he
   who gives counsel rules him who takes it, and becomes in a manner his
   master, it is said: A wise servant shall be master over foolish sons
   (Prov. xvii, 2).

   CHAPTER LXXXVIII--That other Subsistent Intelligences cannot be direct
   Causes of our Elections and Volitions [668]

   NOR is it to be thought that the souls of the heavens, if any such
   souls there be, or any other separately subsisting created
   intelligences, can directly thrust a volition in upon us, or be the
   cause of our choice. For the actions of all creatures are contained in
   the order of divine providence, and cannot act contrary to the
   conditions of action which providence has laid down. [669] Now it is a
   law of providence that everything be immediately induced to action by
   its own proximate cause. But the proximate cause of volition is good
   apprehended by the understanding: that is the proper object of the
   will, and the will is moved by it as sight by colour. No subsistent
   creature therefore can move the will except through the medium of good
   grasped by the understanding. That is done by showing it that something
   is good to do, which is called persuasion. No subsistent creature
   therefore can act upon our will, or be the cause of our choice,
   otherwise than by means of persuasion.

   4. "The violent is that the origin whereof is from without, without the
   subject of violence in any way contributing thereto." [670] Were then
   the will to be moved by any exterior principle, that motion would be
   violent. I call that an exterior principle of motion, which moves as an
   efficient cause, and not as a final cause. But violence is inconsistent
   with voluntariness. It is impossible therefore for the will to be moved
   to voluntary action by an exterior principle acting as an efficient
   cause, but every motion of the will must proceed from within. Now no
   subsistent creature is in touch with the interior of an intelligent
   soul: God alone is in such close connexion with the soul, as He alone
   is cause of its being and maintains it in existence. Therefore by God
   alone can a motion of the will be efficiently caused.

   Hence it is said: The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord: he shall
   turn it whithersoever he will (Prov. xxi, 1); and, God it is worketh in
   us both to will and to accomplish according to his good pleasure (Phil.
   ii, 13).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [668] In Chapp. LXXXII-LXXXVII St Thomas argues that the heavenly
   bodies, which he says are "perfect without blending of contraries,
   being neither light nor heavy, nor hot nor cold," are the instruments
   whereby God prompts and controls all movement and change in material
   bodies on earth: that nevertheless they exercise no direct action upon
   the human understanding, which is something nobler than they, as the
   incorporeal is nobler than the incorporeal: nor are they arbiters of
   human will and conduct, except remotely and by occasion, as they affect
   the human body, under which affection the will makes its free choice:
   nor do they even determine the course of other terrestrial events
   absolutely, since much depends upon the condition and capacities of
   terrestrial physical causes. Repeatedly in this work St Thomas shows
   his grievous misgivings as to the later Platonic position, that stars
   are animals and heavenly spheres have souls. He considered that the
   stars and their containing spheres, if they were not themselves
   animate, were moved by angels, which is another thing. Cf. Plato Rep.
   X, 616 C, sq.

   [669] Thus even in sinning the will cannot but fix upon some apparent
   aspect of good (Chap. X).

   [670] Aristotle, Nic. Eth. III, i.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXIX--That the Motion of the Will is caused by God, and not
   merely by the Power of the Will

   SOME, not understanding how God can cause the movement of the will in
   us without prejudice to the freedom of the will, [671] have endeavoured
   to pervert the meaning of these texts, saying that God causes in us to
   will and to accomplish, inasmuch as He gives us the power of willing,
   but not as making us will this or that. Hence some have said that
   providence is not concerned with the subject-matter of free will, that
   is, with choices, but with extrinsic issues: for he who makes choice of
   something to gain or something to accomplish, for instance, building or
   the amassing of wealth, will not always be able to attain his end, and
   thus the issues of our actions are not subject to free will, but are
   disposed by providence. [672]

   1. But this theory runs manifestly counter to texts of Holy Scripture.
   For it is said: All our works thou hast wrought in us, O Lord (Isai.
   xxvi, 12): hence we have of God not merely the power of willing, but
   also the act. And the above quoted saying of Solomon, he shall turn it
   whithersoever he will, shows that the divine causality extends at once
   to will-power and to actual volition.

   2. Nothing can act in its own strength unless it act also in the power
   of God (Chap. [393]LXVI): therefore man cannot use the will-power given
   to him except in so far as he acts in the power of God.

   4. God is the cause of all action, and works in every agent (Chap.
   [394]LXX): therefore He is cause of the motives of the will.

   [671] This is precisely the point upon which the Thomists and
   Molinists, not understanding it, or at any rate not agreeing in one
   understanding of it, opened a controversy which has stood open for
   three centuries

   [672] This reads like an early version of the saying, Man proposes, but
   God disposes, interpreted to mean that man's proposing is not of God.
   We must remember that man is upheld by God in action as he is upheld by
   God in existence: that esse, posse, agere in man are all of God. Sin is
   a certain defect of action, a lack of proportion, of order, or
   opportuneness. But on its physical side sin is not evil, and as a
   physical thing it is wrought by God and man jointly, like any other
   action.

   CHAPTER XC--That Human Choices and Volitions are subject to Divine
   Providence

   THE government of providence proceeds from the divine love where with
   God loves His creatures. Love consists chiefly in the lover wishing
   good to the loved one. The more God loves things, then, the more they
   fall under His providence. This Holy Writ teaches, saying: God guards
   all that love him (Ps. cxliv, 20); and the Philosopher also teaches
   that God has especial care of those who love understanding, and
   considers them His friends. [673] Hence He loves especially subsistent
   intelligences, and their volitions and choices fall under His
   providence.

   6. The inward good endowments of man, which depend on his will and
   choice, are more proper to man than external endowments, as the gaining
   of riches: hence it is according to the former that man is said to be
   good, not according to the latter. If then human choices and motions of
   the will do not fall under divine providence, but only external
   advantages, it will be more true to say that human affairs are beyond
   providence than that they are under providence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [673] Aristotle, Eth. Nic. X, ix, 13: "If; as is commonly supposed, the
   gods have any care of men, we may well believe them to take delight in
   that which is best and most akin to themselves: . . . . the
   intellectual worker then will be best loved of heaven." This is not
   Christianity, but may be turned that way.

   CHAPTER XCI--How Human Things are reduced to Higher Causes [674]

   FROM what has been shown above we are able to gather how human things
   are reducible to higher causes, and do not proceed by chance. For
   choices and motives of wills are arranged immediately by God: human
   intellectual knowledge is directed by God through the intermediate
   agency of angels: corporeal events, whether interior (to the human
   body) or exterior, that serve the need of man, are adjusted by God
   through the intermediate agency of angels and of the heavenly bodies.

   All this arrangement proceeds upon one general axiom, which is this:
   Everything manifold and mutable and liable to fail may be reduced to
   some principle uniform and immutable and unfailing.' [675] But
   everything about our selves proves to be manifold, variable, and
   defectible. Our choices are evidently manifold, since different things
   are chosen by different persons in different circumstances. They are
   likewise mutable, as well on account of the fickleness of our mind,
   which is not confirmed in its last end, as also on account of changes
   of circumstance and environment. That they are defectible, the sins of
   men clearly witness. On the other hand, the will of God is uniform,
   because in willing one thing He wills all other things: it is also
   immutable and indefectible (B. I, Chapp. [395]XXIII, [396]LXXV).
   Therefore all motions of volition and choice must be reduced to the
   divine will, and not to any other cause, because God alone is the cause
   of our volitions and elections.

   In like manner our intelligence is liable to multiplicity, inasmuch as
   we gather intelligible truth from many sensible objects. It is also
   mutable, inasmuch as it proceeds by reasoning from one point to
   another, passing from known to unknown. It is also defectible from the
   admixture of phantasy and sense, as the errors of mankind show. But the
   cognitions of the angels are uniform, as they receive the knowledge of
   truth from the one fountain of truth, God (B. II, Chapp. [397]XCVIII,
   [398]C, with notes). It is also immutable, because not by any argument
   from effects to causes, nor from causes to effects, but by simple
   intuition do they gaze upon the pure truth of things. It is also
   indefectible, since they discern the very natures of things, or their
   quiddities in themselves, about which quiddities intelligence cannot
   err, as neither can sense err about the primary objects of the several
   senses. But we learn the quiddities (essences) of things from their
   accidents and effects. Our intellectual knowledge then must be
   regulated by the knowledge of the angels. [676]

   Again, about human bodies and the exterior things which men use, it is
   manifest that there is in them the multiplicity of mixture and
   contrariety; and that they do not always move in the same way, because
   their motions cannot be continuous; and that they are defectible by
   alteration and corruption. But the heavenly bodies are uniform, as
   being simple and made up without any contrariety of elements. Their
   motions also are uniform, continuous, and always executed in the same
   way: nor can there be in them corruption or alteration. Hence our
   bodies, and other things that come under our use, must necessarily be
   regulated by the motion of the heavenly bodies. [677]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [674] I translate this chapter, every word, as a specimen of the
   thought of the thirteenth century, also as a specimen of the need in
   which St Thomas's work often stands of restoration and reconstruction
   at the hands of some modern Aquinas. It will not do simply to pile up
   quotations from the Angelic Doctor, adding nothing and altering
   nothing. St Thomas himself did not go to work in that way upon his
   predecessors.

   [675] So the imperfect and fickle beauties on earth are reduced to the
   Self-Beauty. Upon this axiom Plato constructed his theory of Ideas. And
   though the Ideas were exaggerated and then discarded, the axiom held
   its ground throughout the Middle Ages, and often appears in St Thomas.
   The axiom has little vogue in modern philosophy. It may be stated thus:
   There is ever some perfect being somewhere at the back of the
   imperfect.' The axiom is enforced with reference to the Old Covenant,
   as compared with the New, in the Epistle to the Hebrews ix and x. If I
   may add a criticism, I should say that the axiom is more readily
   apparent in exemplar causes than in efficient causes, -- not that I
   deny it of the latter. See note, p. 238.

   [676] Is this true? Is there any intelligence, or group of
   intelligences, intermediate between men and God, such that man's
   understanding, insufficient in itself, is dependent on this
   intermediary for all that it knows? If so, the 'separate intellect' of
   Averroes and Avicenna, -- higher than human, yet short of divine, at
   least according to Averroes, -- is not the baseless fabric of a vision'
   after all, but the blurred and ill-apprehended outline of a profound
   truth (B. II, Chapp. LIX sq.). This would be a discovery indeed in
   psychology, if it could be established. It might empty all the virus of
   pantheism out of the doctrine of the Absolute, showing that the
   Absolute, while real, is not God. It might assign their true places in
   creation to the Arian Logos, to the Gnostic Aeons, as also to the
   Platonic Ideas. -- Modern Psychology meanwhile is serenely oblivious of
   angels. Catholics still believe in them, dread the evil ones (devils),
   and pray to the good ones, who now see the face of God. Catholics
   believe that good angels are often the vehicles through which actual
   graces,' that is, warnings and impulses in order to salvation, descend
   from God to men. But that man owes his ordinary knowledge of
   mathematics, chemistry, sanitation, railway management, or even of
   religion, to any action whatsoever of angelic intelligence upon his
   mind, -- I do not know any man living who thinks so. For all that I can
   tell, I should know all that I do know, just as I know it now, if if
   there were no angels at all. The psychological discovery of which I
   have spoken, remains to be made, for he discovers who proves. Yet St
   Thomas seems to have accepted it.

   [677] We cannot exaggerate our dependence on one heavenly body, the
   sun. As well have no earth as no sun. To the moon we owe the tides; and
   to the planets it is just possible that we stand indebted for some of
   our weather. The fixed stars are of use to us in navigation. Otherwise,
   so far as we can see, Mother Earth would go her way and carry all her
   children safe, with no other companions than sun and moon, or, for that
   matter, the sun only, though all other heavenly bodies' were wiped out
   of existence.

   CHAPTER XCII--In what sense one is said to be Fortunate, and how Man is
   aided by Higher Causes [678]

   GOOD fortune is said to befall a man, when something good happens to
   him beyond his intention, as when one digging a field finds a treasure
   that he was not looking for. Now an agent may do something beyond his
   own intention, and yet not beyond the intention of some agent whom he
   is under: as if a master were to bid a servant to go to some place, to
   which he had sent another servant without the first servant knowing of
   it, the meeting with his fellow-servant would be beyond the intention
   of the servant sent, and yet not beyond the intention of the master
   sending: in reference to the servant it will be luck and chance, but
   not in reference to the master, -- to him it is an arrangement. Since
   then man is subordinate in body to the forces of physical nature
   (corporibus coelestibus), subordinate in intellect to the angels, and
   subordinate in will to God, a thing may happen beside the intention of
   man, which is nevertheless according to the order of physical nature
   (corporum coelestium), or according to the arrangement of angels, or
   again of God. But though God alone works directly upon man's choice,
   yet the action of an angel does something for that choice by way of
   persuasion, while the action of the heavenly body (of the forces of
   physical nature) does something by way of predisposition, inasmuch as
   the bodily impressions of the heavenly bodies (physical forces) upon
   our bodies predispose us to certain choices. [679] When then under the
   impression of the physical forces of nature (coelestium corporum) one
   is swayed to certain choices that prove useful to him, though his own
   reason does not discern their utility; and simultaneously under the
   light shed on him by separately subsistent intelligences, his
   understanding is enlightened to do those acts, and his will is swayed
   by a divine act to choose that useful course, the utility whereof goes
   unperceived by him, -- then he is said to be a fortunate man.' [680]

   But here a difference is to be noted. For the action of the angel and
   of the physical force (corporis coelestis) merely predisposes the man
   to choose, but the action of God accomplishes the choice. And since the
   predisposition that comes of the bodily affection, or of the persuasion
   of the understanding, does not induce necessity of choice, man does not
   always choose that which his guardian angel intends, nor that to which
   physical nature (corpus coeleste) inclines, but man always chooses that
   which God works in his will. [681] Hence the guardianship of the angels
   sometimes comes to nought, according to the text: We have tended
   Babylon, but she is not healed (Jerem. li, 9). And much more may
   physical inclination (inclinatio coelestium corporum) come to nought:
   but divine providence always holds firm.

   It is further to be observed that good or ill fortune may befall a man
   as a matter of luck, so far as his intention goes, and so far as the
   working of the prime forces of nature (corpora coelestia) goes, and so
   far as the mind of the angels goes, but not in regard of God: for in
   reference to God nothing is by chance, nothing unforeseen, either in
   human life or anywhere else in creation.

   mainly to the action of the stars and spheres.

   CHAPTER XCIII--Of Fate, whether there be such a thing, and if so, what
   it is

   SOME when they say that all things are done by fate, mean by fate the
   destiny [682] that is in things by disposition of divine providence.
   Hence Boethius says: "Fate is a disposition inherent in changeable
   things, whereby providence assigns them each to their several orders."
   In this description of fate disposition' is put for destiny.' It is
   said to be inherent in things,' to distinguish fate from providence:
   for destiny as it is in the divine mind, not yet impressed on creation,
   is providence; but inasmuch as it is already unfolded in creatures, it
   is called fate.' He says in changeable things' to show that the order
   of providence does not take away from things their contingency and
   changeableness. In this understanding, to deny fate is to deny divine
   providence. But because with unbelievers we ought not even to have
   names in common, lest from agreement in terminology there be taken an
   occasion of error, the faithful should not use the name of fate,' not
   to appear to fall in with those who construe fate wrongly, subjecting
   all things to the necessity imposed by the stars. [683] Hence Augustine
   says: "If any man calls by the name of fate the might or power of God,
   let him keep his opinion, but mend his speech" (De civit. Dei, V, 1).
   And Gregory: "Far be it from the minds of the faithful to say that
   there is such a thing as fate" (Hom. 10 in Epiphan.)

   CHAPTER XCIV--Of the Certainty of Divine Providence [684]

   IT will be necessary now to repeat some of the things that have been
   said before, to make it evident that (a) nothing escapes divine
   providence, and the order of divine providence can nowise be changed;
   and yet (b) it does not follow that the events which happen under
   divine providence all happen of necessity.

   (a) Our first point of study is this, that as God is the cause of all
   existing things, conferring being on them all, the order of His
   providence must embrace all things: for He must grant preservation to
   those to whom He has granted existence, and bestow on them perfection
   in the attainment of their last end. In the case of every one who has
   to provide for others there are two things to observe, the
   pre-arranging of the order intended and the setting of the pre-arranged
   order on foot. The former is an exercise of intellectual ability, the
   latter of practical. The difference between the two is this, that in
   the pre-arrangement of order the providence is more perfect, the
   further the arrangement can be extended even to the least details:
   there would be not many parts of prudence in him who was competent only
   to arrange generalities: but in the carrying of the order out into
   effect the providence of the ruler is marked by greater dignity and
   completeness the more general it is, and the more numerous the
   subordinate functionaries through whom he fulfils his design, for the
   very marshalling of those functionaries makes a great part of the
   foreseen arrangement. Divine providence, therefore, being absolutely
   perfect (B. I, Chap. [399]XXVIII), arranges all things by the eternal
   forethought of its wisdom, down to the smallest details, no matter how
   trifling they appear. And all agents that do any work act as
   instruments in His hands, and minister in obedience to Him, to the
   unfolding of that order of providence in creation which He has from
   eternity devised. But if all things that act must necessarily minister
   to Him in their action, it is impossible for any agent to hinder the
   execution of divine providence by acting contrary to it. Nor is it
   possible for divine providence to be hindered by the defect of any
   agent or patient, since all active or passive power in creation is
   caused according to the divine arrangement. Again it is impossible for
   the execution of divine providence to be hindered by any change of
   providence, since God is wholly unchangeable (B. I, Chap. [400]XV). The
   conclusion remains, that the divine provision cannot be annulled.

   (b) Now to our second point of study. Every agent intends good, and
   better so far as it can (Chap. [401]III). But good and better do not
   have place in the same way in a whole and in its parts. In the whole
   the good is the entire effect arising out of the order and composition
   of the parts: hence it is better for the whole that there should be
   inequality among the parts, without which inequality the order and
   perfection of the whole cannot be, than that all the parts should be
   equal, every one of them attaining to the rank of the noblest part. And
   yet, considered by itself, every part of lower rank would be better if
   it were in the rank of some superior part. Thus in the human body the
   foot would be a more dignified part of man if it had the beauty and
   power of the eye; but the whole body would be worse off for lacking the
   office of the foot. The scope and aim therefore of the particular agent
   is not the same as that of the universal agent. The particular agent
   tends to the good of the part absolutely, and makes the best of it that
   it can; but the universal agent tends to the good of the whole: hence a
   defect may be beside the intention of the particular agent, but
   according to the intention of the universal agent. It is the intention
   of the particular agent that its effect should be perfect to the utmost
   possible in its kind: but it is the intention of the universal agent
   that this effect be carried to a certain degree of perfection and no
   further. Now between the parts of the universe the first apparent
   difference is that of contingent and necessary. Beings of a higher
   order are necessary and indestructible and unchangeable: from which
   condition beings fall away, the lower the rank in which they are
   placed; so that the lowest beings suffer destruction in their being and
   change in their constitution, and produce their effects, not
   necessarily, but contingently. Every agent therefore that is part of
   the universe endeavours, so far as it can, to abide in its being and
   natural constitution, and to establish its effect: but God, the
   governor of the universe, intends that of the effects which take place
   in it one be established as of necessity, another as of contingency;
   and with this view He applies different causes to them, necessary
   causes to these effects, contingent causes to those. It falls under
   divine providence therefore, not only that this effect be, but also
   that this effect be necessarily, that other contingently. Thus, of
   things subject to divine providence, some are necessary, and others
   contingent, not all necessary.

   Hence it is clear that this conditional proposition is true: If God has
   foreseen this thing in the future, it will be.' But it will be as God
   has provided that it shall be; and supposing that He has provided that
   it shall be contingently, it follows infallibly that it will be
   contingently, and not necessarily.

   Cicero (De divinatione ii, 8) has this argument: If all things are
   foreseen by God, the order of causes is certain; but if so, all things
   happen by fate, nothing is left in our power, and there is no such
   thing as free will.' A frivolous argument, for since not only effects
   are subject to divine providence, but also causes, and modes of being,
   it follows that though all things happen by divine providence, some
   things are so foreseen by God as that they are done freely by us.

   Nor can the defectibility of secondary causes, by means of which the
   effects of providence are produced, take away the certainty of divine
   providence: for since God works in all things, it belongs to His
   providence sometimes to allow defectible causes to fail, and sometimes
   to keep them from failing.

   The Philosopher shows [685] that if every effect has a proper cause
   (causam per se), every future event may be reduced to some present or
   past cause. Thus if the question is put concerning any one, whether he
   is to be slain by robbers, that effect proceeds from a cause, his
   meeting with robbers; and that effect again is preceded by another
   cause, his going out of his house; and that again by another, his
   wanting to find water; the preceding cause to which is thirst, and this
   is caused by eating salt meat, which he either is doing or has done. If
   then, positing the cause, the effect must be posited of necessity, he
   must necessarily be thirsty, if he eats salt meat; and he must
   necessarily will to seek water, if he is thirsty; and be must
   necessarily go out of the house, if he wills to seek water; and the
   robbers must necessarily come across him, if he goes out of the house;
   and if they come across him, he must be killed. Therefore from first to
   last it is necessary for this man eating salt meat to be killed by
   robbers. [686] The philosopher concludes that it is not true that,
   positing the cause, the effect must be posited, because there are some
   causes that may fail. [687] Nor again is it true that every effect has
   a proper cause: for any accidental effect, e.g., of this man wishing to
   look for water and falling in with robbers, has no cause. [688]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [684] In reading this chapter, which I have not translated in full, one
   feels like an observer at work with a telescope out of focus. The
   thought of the Angelic Doctor is blurred by that fatal misconception
   which it was reserved for Newton to dissipate, that, in the heavens
   above, physical nature works necessarily and uniformly, but, on the
   earth beneath, contingently (so that the effect might be otherwise) and
   with some anomaly and irregularity. We must say boldly that the case is
   not so; that throughout all time and all space physical nature works
   necessarily and uniformly. The difference between astronomy and such
   sciences as chemistry and biology comes merely to this, that the
   elementary phenomena of astronomy, the orbits of the planets, and the
   rotation of the earth, depend, at first approximation, upon an
   extremely simple combination of causes, and therefore are readily
   calculable: whereas in the rest of nature complexity of causes and
   intermingling of effects is enormous, and our reckonings are
   continually thrown out by our ignorance of coexistences. The heavens
   are seen from a distance, and to the naked eye are visible only in
   their most general outlines. The earth would be a simple body enough to
   study with the naked eye ninety million miles away. Such an effect as
   the death by lightning of a sheep in a thunderstorm, which St Thomas
   would call contingent,' is really a complex physical effect, as
   necessary a part of the pre-established order of physical causation as
   the alternation of day and night. Positis ponendis, and leaving man out
   of the case, it is as impossible for that sheep to escape death as for
   the sun not to rise tomorrow: the only difference between the two cases
   is the multitude of ponenda. Cf. Chap. LXXIII, with notes.

   [685] St Thomas refers to Aristotle, Metaphysics, V, 3, a brief and
   obscure passage which he expands.

   [686] St Thomas evidently considers this conclusion absurd. The only
   absurdity that I see in it arises from free will entering in as an
   element in some portion of the conduct of the robbers and their victim.
   Substitute a terrier and a rabbit, and the chain of physical causation,
   from eating salt vegetables to being worried by a dog, is necessary, so
   long as all the relevant antecedents in the case, positive and
   negative, remain unaltered.

   [687] Fail,' some of their conditions not being present, as when a
   pistol misses fire; or a counteracting cause being present, as medical
   skill (or miraculous power), to save a patient who must otherwise have
   died.

   [688] No cause,' when you consider the case in the abstract, but how if
   it be taken in the concrete, a man going to look for water in a region
   infested with robbers? In speaking of a necessary cause' St Thomas is
   in fact thinking of a physical cause which is not likely to be
   counteracted, or to have any of its requisite conditions fail, e.g.,
   the rotation of the earth producing sun-rise. In speaking of a
   contingent cause, -- so far as the phrase may be used without bringing
   free will into the field, -- he has in view a physical cause, the
   action of which may readily be counteracted by the interference of
   other physical causes, or may fail of effect because some one of its
   many requisite conditions is not present. A contingent physical cause,
   uninterfered with and having all its conditions present, works as a
   necessary cause.

   CHAPTERS XCV, XCVI--That the Immutability of Divine Providence does not
   bar the Utility of Prayer

   AS the immutability of divine providence does not impose necessity on
   things foreseen, so neither does it bar the utility of prayer. For
   prayer is not poured out to God that the eternal arrangement of
   providence may be changed, -- that is impossible, -- but that man may
   gain what he desires of God. It is fitting for God to assent to the
   pious desires of His rational creatures, not that our desires move the
   immutability of God, but it is an outcome of His goodness suitably to
   carry out what we desire.

   4. It is proper for friends to will the same thing. Now God loves His
   creature (B. I, Chap. [402]XCI) and every creature all the more that
   the said creature has a share in His goodness, which is the prime and
   principal object of God's love. But, of all creatures, the rational
   creature most perfectly partakes in the divine goodness. God therefore
   wills the fulfilment of the desires of the rational creature. And His
   will is effective of things.

   5. The goodness of the creature is derived in point of likeness from
   the goodness of God. But it is a point of special commendation in men,
   not to deny assent to just requests: thereupon they are called
   liberal,' clement,' merciful and kind.' This therefore is a very great
   function of divine goodness, to hear pious prayers. [689]

   Hence it is said: He will do the will of them that fear him, and hear
   their prayers and save them (Ps. cxliv, 9): Every one that asketh
   receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and the door shall be opened to
   him that knocketh (Matt. vii, 8).

   [690] From what has been said it appears that prayers and pious desires
   are causes of some things that are done by God. It has been shown above
   (Chap. [403]LXXVII) that divine providence does not bar the working of
   other causes, nay, rather it directs them in the work of imposing upon
   creation the order which providence in its own counsels has determined
   upon. Thus secondary causes are not inconsistent with providence, but
   rather carry providence into effect. Thus then prayers are efficacious
   with God, not however as breaking through the order of divine
   providence, because this very arrangement, that such a concession be
   made to such a petitioner, falls under the order of divine providence.
   Therefore to say that we should not pray to gain any thing of God,
   because the order of His providence is unchangeable, is like saying
   that we should not walk to get to a place, nor eat to support life.

   Thus a twofold error concerning prayer is excluded. Some have said that
   there is no fruit of prayer. This was said as well on the part of those
   who denied divine providence, as the Epicureans did; as also on the
   part of those who withdrew human affairs from divine providence, as
   some of the Peripatetics did; as also on the part of those who thought
   that all things happen of necessity, as the Stoics did. From all these
   tenets it would follow that prayer is fruitless, and consequently all
   divine worship in vain: [691] which error is referred to in Malachy
   iii, 14: Ye have said: he laboureth in vain who serveth God, and what
   profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked
   sad before the Lord of Hosts?

   There were others on the contrary who said that the divine arrangement
   was reversible by prayer. And the prima facie rendering of certain
   texts of scripture seems to favour this view. Thus, after Isaias by
   divine command had said to King Ezechias: Put thine house in order, for
   thou shalt die and not live; yet upon Ezechias's prayer the word of the
   Lord came to Isaias, saying: Go and tell Ezechias: I have heard thy
   prayer, lo I will add to thy days fifteen years (Isa. xxxviii, 1-5).
   Again it is said in the person of the Lord: I will suddenly speak
   against a nation and against a kingdom, to root out and pull down and
   destroy it. If that nation against which I have spoken shall repent of
   their evil, I also will repent of the evil that I have thought to do to
   them (Jer. xviii, 7, 8); Turn to the Lord your God, for he is gracious
   and merciful: who knoweth but he will turn and forgive? (Joel ii, 13,
   14.) But against construing these texts to mean that the will of God is
   changeable, or that anything happens to God in time, or that temporal
   events in creation are the cause of anything coming to exist in God,
   there are other authorities of Holy Writ, containing infallible and
   express truth. Thus it is said: God is not as man, that he should die,
   nor as the son of man, that he should change. Has he said then and
   shall not do? Has he spoken and shall not fulfil? (Num. xxiii, 19): The
   victorious one in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to
   repentance: for he is not a man that he should repent (1 Kings xv, 29):
   I am the Lord and change not (Malach. iii, 6).

   On careful consideration it will appear that all mistakes in this
   matter arise from failing to note the difference between the system of
   the universe and any particular system (universalem ordinem et
   particularem). There is nothing to hinder any particular system being
   changed, whether by prayer or by any other means; for there is that
   existing beyond the bounds of the system which is capable of changing
   it. But beyond the system that embraces all things nothing can be
   posited whereby such system could possibly be changed, depending as it
   does on the universal cause. Therefore the Stoics laid it down that the
   system established by God could nowise be changed. But they failed in a
   right appreciation of this general system in supposing that prayers
   were useless, which was taking for granted that the wills of men, and
   their desires whence their prayers proceed, are not comprehended in
   that general system. For when they say that the same effect follows
   whether prayers are put up or not, -- follows, that is, as part of the
   univeral system of things, -- they manifestly reserve and except
   prayers as not entering into that general system. Supposing prayers
   included in the system, then effects will follow from them by divine
   appointment as from other causes. One might as well exclude the effects
   of other every-day causes as exclude the effect of prayer. And if the
   immutability of the divine plan does not withdraw the effects of other
   causes, neither does it take away the efficacy of prayer.

   Prayers then avail, not as changing a system arranged from eternity,
   but as being themselves part of that system. And there is no difficulty
   in the efficacy of prayer changing the particular system of some
   inferior cause, by the doing of God, who overpasses all causes, and who
   consequently is not bound by the necessity of any system depending on
   any cause; but on the contrary every necessity of system dependent on
   any inferior cause is checked by Him, as having been instituted by Him.
   [692] Inasmuch then as pious prayers avail to alter some points of the
   system of inferior causes that was established by God, God is said to
   turn,' or repent.' Hence Gregory says that God does not change His
   counsel, though He sometimes changes His sentence, not the sentence
   which declares His eternal arrangements, but the sentence which
   declares the order of inferior causes, according to which Ezechias was
   to die, or some nation to be punished for its sins. Such change of
   sentence is called in metaphorical language repentance,' inasmuch as
   God behaves like one repentant, to whom it belongs to change what He
   has done. In the same way God is said metaphorically to be angry,'
   inasmuch as by punishing He produces the effect of anger. (B. I, Chap.
   [404]XCI ad fin.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [689] To say that in man nature attains its highest perfection, that
   there is nothing beyond nature, and consequently nothing in existence
   higher than man, is atheism. To make out a God, all intellect and no
   will, all law and no love, a being admirable indeed, but unloving and
   unlovable, is to make God less good than man, -- as though what Holy
   Writ calls lovingkindness' were a sort of bend sinister,' a shade of
   inferiority in being. The argument in the text, -- by adversaries
   dubbed anthropomorphic,' -- goes to establish what present-day
   philosophers call a personal God,' meaning a God who has in Him
   something corresponding to what in man are called feelings,' and that
   something not ineffective or impotent in this world of law; a God
   consequently whom there is some use in praying to.

   [690] What follows is the second part of Chap. XCVI. I have appended it
   to Chap. XCV, to which in subject-matter it belongs, and without which
   it is in complete as leaving the most serious difficulty unresolved.
   Indeed, seeing how the Bergamo autograph in the Vatican consists of
   loose parchments tied together, I suspect that the order of them has
   got deranged, and that what follows was meant by the Saint to belong to
   Chap. XCV.

   [691] The prayer of petition would be fruitless, certainly; and that is
   the prayer, the cry of distress, which bursts most rervently from heart
   and lips: but even the chant of praise would die away except for
   operatic purposes. Who would give thanks' to the law of gravitation, or
   bless' Maclauren's theorem, or glorify' Boyle's Law, or adore' the
   whole concatenation of the laws of thought and things?

   [692] In the above passage, inadvertently perhaps, St Thomas admirably
   hits off the real meaning of what he and Aristotle called contingent'
   events, sumbebekota. An event is contingent' in reference to a
   particular system, but (apart from the doings of free will) every event
   is necessary' in the general system,' on the hypothesis of that system
   being. The killing of a sheep by lightning (see note, p. 254)is a
   contingency unprovided for in ovine economy, but pre-arranged in the
   general system of the universe, in which general system it is an
   hypothetical necessity: it must be, if the system is to stand as it is.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCVI--That God does not hear all Prayers

   THERE is no anomaly in the prayers of petitioners being sometimes not
   granted by God. For God fulfils the desires of His rational creature
   inasmuch as that creature desires good: but sometimes it happens that
   what is asked is not true but seeming good, which is simply evil: such
   a prayer is not within the hearing of God. Hence it is said: Ye ask and
   receive not, because ye ask amiss (James iv, 3).

   2. It is suitable that God should fulfil our desires in so far as He
   moves us to desire. If therefore the movement of desire on our part is
   not kept up by earnestness in prayer, there is nothing to be surprised
   at if the prayer does not gain its due effect. Hence the Lord [St Luke]
   says: We ought always to pray and not to faint (Luke xviii, 1); and the
   Apostle, Pray without ceasing (1 Thess. v, 17).

   3. It befits God to hear the prayer of the rational creature inasmuch
   as that creature draws nigh to Him. But one draws nigh to God by
   contemplation and devout affection and humble and firm intention. That
   prayer therefore which does not so draw nigh to God is not within God's
   hearing. Hence it is said: He hath regarded the prayer of the humble
   (Ps. ci, 18); and, Let him ask in faith, debating not within himself
   (James i, 6).

   4. God hears the prayers of the pious on the ground of friendship. He
   then who turns away from the friendship of God is not worthy to have
   his prayer heard. [693] Hence it is said: Whosoever turns away his ear
   from hearing the law, his prayer shall be abominable (Prov. xxviii, 9):
   Though ye multiply prayers, I will not hear: for your hands are full of
   blood (Isai. i, 15). This is why sometimes a friend of God is not
   heard, when he prays for those who are not God's friends, as it was
   said: Do not thou pray for this people, nor take unto thee praise and
   supplication for them, and do not withstand me: for I will not hear
   thee (Jerem. vii, 16).

   It happens sometimes that for very friendship one denies his friend's
   petition, knowing it to be hurtful to him, or the contrary to be better
   for him, as a physician refuses what his patient asks for. No wonder
   then if God, who fulfils the desires put before Him by His rational
   creature for the love that He bears to that creature, fails sometimes
   to fulfil the petition of those whom He singularly loves, that He may
   fulfil it otherwise with something more helpful to the salvation of the
   petitioner, as we read in 2 Cor. xii, 7-9; and the Lord says to some:
   Ye know not what ye ask (Matt. xx, 22). Therefore Augustine says (Ep.
   ad Paulin. et Theras.): "The Lord is good in often not giving what we
   will, to give instead what we should prefer."
     __________________________________________________________________

   [693] That is, not until there is in him some first breath of desire of
   going back to God. The wicked man may pray for himself: but, praying
   for others he is less likely to be heard than the just man.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCVII--How the Arrangements of Providence follow a Plan

   GOD by His providence directs all things to the end of the divine
   goodness, not that anything accrues as an addition to His goodness by
   the things that He makes, but His aim is the impression of the likeness
   of His goodness so far as possible on creation. But inasmuch as every
   created substance must fall short of the perfection of the divine
   goodness, it was needful to have diversity in things for the more
   perfect communication of the divine goodness, that what cannot
   perfectly be represented by one created exemplar, might be represented
   by divers such exemplars in divers ways in a more perfect manner. Thus
   man multiplies his words to express by divers expressions the
   conception of his mind, which cannot all be put in one word. [694] And
   herein we may consider the excellence of the divine perfection shown in
   this, that the perfect goodness which is in God united and simple,
   cannot be in creatures except according to diversity of modes and in
   many subjects. Things are different by having different forms, whence
   they take their species. Thus then the end of creation furnishes a
   reason for the diversity of forms in things.

   From the diversity of forms follows a difference of activities, and
   further a diversity of agents and patients, properties and accidents.

   Evidently then it is not without reason that divine providence
   distributes to creatures different accidents and actions and
   impressions and allocations. Hence it is said: The Lord by wisdom hath
   founded the earth, hath established the heavens in prudence. By his
   wisdom the depths have broken out, and the clouds grow thick with dew
   (Prov. iii, 19, 20).

   As it is necessary for one wishing to build a house to look out for
   timber, but his looking out for pitch-pine (ligna abietina) depends on
   his mere will, not on his plan of building a house; so it is necessary
   for God to love His own goodness, but it does not thence necessarily
   follow that He should wish to have that goodness represented by
   creatures, since the divine goodness is perfect without that. Hence the
   bringing of creatures into being depends on the mere will of God,
   although it is done in consideration of the divine goodness. Supposing
   however that God wishes to communicate His goodness by way of
   similitude as far as possible, it logically follows thence that there
   should be creatures of different sorts: but it does not follow of
   necessity that creatures should be of this or that grade of perfection,
   or exist in this or that number. But supposing that it is in the divine
   will to wish this number in creation, and this grade of perfection in
   each creature, it thence follows logically that creation be in such and
   such form, and such and such matter; and so of further consequences.
   Manifestly then providence disposes of things according to a certain
   plan, and yet this plan presupposes the divine will.

   What has been said shuts out two errors, the error of those who believe
   that all things follow mere will without reason, which is the error of
   sundry Doctors of the Mohammedan law, as Rabbi Moses says; according to
   whose teaching, the only difference between fire warming and fire
   freezing is God's so willing the former alternative; [695] and again
   the error is shut out of those who say that the order of causes springs
   from divine providence by way of necessity.

   There are certain words of Holy Scripture which appear to put down all
   things to the mere will of God. Their meaning is not to take away all
   rational character from the dispensations of Providence, but to show
   that the will of God is the first principle of all things. Such texts
   are: All things, whatsoever he hath willed, the Lord hath done (Ps.
   cxxxiv, 6:) Who can say to him, Why doth thou so? (Job ix, 12:) Who
   resisteth his will? (Rom. ix, 19.) And Augustine ( De Trin. III:)
   "Nothing but the will of God is the prime cause of health and sickness,
   of rewards and punishments, of graces and recompenses."

   Thus in answer to the question, Why? asked of any natural effect, we
   can render a reason from some proximate cause, yet so that we reduce
   all things to the prime cause. Thus if it is asked why wood gets hot in
   presence of fire, it is answered [etc., etc., in terms of Aristotelian
   physics], and so on till we come to the will of God [who willed to
   create matter and energy, such as we know them, from the beginning].
   Hence whoever answers the question, why the wood got hot, Because God
   has willed it so, answers appropriately, if he intends to carry back
   the question to the prime cause; but inappropriately, if he intends to
   exclude all other causes. [696]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [694] Thus creatlon is a kind of divine language, vocal to them that
   understand.' There is a message of God to man in nature, a message
   unconsidered by those theologians, who will not attend to physics; and
   neglected by those physicists, who will hear of no theology.

   [695] This error represents an extreme form of Nominalism. These two
   opposite erroneous tendencies must often strike the careful reader of
   philosophy and theology. Catholic thinkers, abhorring the Charybdis of
   the latter error, sometimes run perilously near to the Scylla of the
   former. I mean, they are apt to refer too much to the arbitrary will of
   God, and too little to the nature of things.'

   [696] If asked, Why does the train start at 6.30?' I should answer,
   Because the traffic manager has so arranged it.' He might have taken
   the train off, or put it at another hour, or, with the concurrence of
   the Directors, have suspended traffic altogether. The Time Tables
   represent the Manager's will: yet by no means his arbitrary will. A
   Time Table drawn up at hap-hazard would result in a block of the whole
   line: it would not work. The Time Tables consequently are drawn up with
   much care and forethought for the natures of trains and the exigencies
   of traffic. The Manager controls actualities, but not possibilities and
   conveniences. He must make his actual appointments tally with what he
   finds possible and convenient. In like manner all actuality in
   creatures depends on the mere will of God. And God need not will to
   create anything at all. He might have acquiesced in His own existence,
   with nothing but Himself alone in any way existing. So says St Thomas,
   and so the Catholic Church, in opposition to the determinist idealism
   of Hegel, who makes the universe and its on-goings consist of the
   irreversible thoughts and thought-processes of Deity. On the other hand
   God's power of creating is not an arbitrary power to create anything
   and everything that a foolish fancy may call up. He cannot give reality
   to intrinsic absurdities. He cannot, we may venture to think, create a
   race of mortal men without stomachs, or animals whose natural food
   should be stones, or a circle having the properties of a cycloid, or a
   politician licensed to lie. If He creates, He must create according to
   the eternal exemplars, the natures of things, as He views them in order
   of possibility in Himself. These eternal exemplars, or intelligible
   essences' as the schoolmen call them, represent whatever of truth there
   was in Plato's Ideas. They are founded upon the divine nature, as
   imitable outside of God: they are discerned in the divine intellect:
   they do not depend, formally speaking, on the divine will. God's will
   and decree does not make and unmake possibilities. These
   intelligibilia, on the lines of which creation must take place, if
   creation there is to be at all, are treated of in B. I, Chapp.
   [405]XLIX-LIV. They were ignored by the ultra-Nominalists, who took all
   meaning out of the phrase the nature of things,' and, like those
   doctors of the Mohammedan law' whom St Thomas mentions, ascribed all
   events without distinction to the arbitrary will of the Creator. With
   these archetypal Ideas, according to which creation is laid out, and
   athwart of which it cannot run, we are very imperfectly acquainted.
   Consequently our predication cannot travel far, when we undertake to
   pronounce what things are intrinsically possible and what impossible,
   what things absolutely God could do, and what things He absolutely
   could not. More things probably are intrinsically impossible than we
   are aware of. Among the meshes of this necessary system of the nature
   of things (a necessity founded upon the divine nature itself) the
   divine will ranges free, electing to actualise this possibility in
   creation, and to leave that unactualised. From this chapter of St
   Thomas I have been constrained to excise much obsolete physics. To
   examine the plan of creation, in an age when men knew nothing of
   physical nature, microscopic and telescopic, molecular and sidereal,
   beyond what their unassisted senses could detect, and knew that little
   ill, -- was a laudable effort, but could lead to no more than
   provisional results. A modern Aquinas, dwelling, as St Thomas loved to
   dwell, on the variety of creation and the differences of things, cannot
   but feel himself in face of the question, how all these differences
   arose; whether they were explicit in the first creation, or whether,
   out of a creation originally homogeneous, things came to be
   differentiated by a primitive plastic power, called Evolution, which
   has turned out an oak, or a sycamore, to be head and representative of
   one line of development, and a lion, or an eagle, of another. And, if
   he chooses Evolution, he will have to consider the part of God's
   providence therein. This chapter should be read in the light of the
   teleological Psalm ciii, and of St Thomas's own declaration of his
   purpose in B. II, Chap. [406]IV. In the untranslated portion occurs
   this curious aphorism: "The first thing aimed at in creatures is their
   multiplication (prima ratio in creaturis est eorum numerositas), and to
   the gaining and securing of this end all things else seem to be
   subordinate."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCIX--God can work beyond the Order laid down for Creatures,
   and produce Effects without Proximate Causes

   SINCE accidents follow upon the substantial principles of the thing, he
   who immediately produces the substance of a thing must be able
   immediately to work in the thing whatever effects follow upon
   substantial existence. But God by creation has brought all things
   immediately into being. He can therefore immediately move anything to
   any effect without intermediate causes. [697]

   But if any one says that, once God has fixed an orderly course of
   events, He cannot change it without changing Himself; and that He would
   change Himself, if ever He worked in the world to the production of
   effects apart from their own proper causes, such a saying may be
   refuted by a study of nature. For the orderly course of events fixed by
   God, if we look at it as it obtains in creation, will be found to hold
   for the most part, but not everywhere or always: [698] for sometimes,
   although in a minority of cases, the thing turns out otherwise, either
   for lack of power in the agent, or for indisposition of the matter, or
   from some vis major supervening. Yet not on that account does the law
   of providence [699] fail or suffer change: for it comes under
   providence that the natural course of things, instituted to hold
   usually, [700] should sometimes fail. If therefore by the action of
   some created power the natural course of events may be altered from the
   usual to the unusual, and that without any alteration of divine
   providence, much more may the divine power sometimes do a thing,
   without prejudice to its own providence, beyond the course assigned to
   natural events by God. This God does at times to manifest His power:
   for there is no better way of manifesting the subjection of all nature
   to the divine will than by something being done at times beyond the
   course of nature: for thereby it appears that the course of events
   proceeds from Him, and is not of necessity of nature, but through free
   will. [701] Nor should this be accounted a frivolous reason to allege,
   that God works some effects in nature to the end of manifesting Himself
   to human minds, since it has been shown that all the material creation
   is subordinated to serve the end of intellectual nature, while the end
   of intellectual nature itself is the knowledge of God. No wonder then
   if some change is wrought in corporeal substance to afford intelligent
   nature a knowledge of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [697] He who created matter, can move it. He who created the human
   soul, can speak to that soul, without need of creatures to be His
   intermediaries and messengers.

   [698] That is to say, the subordinate laws of nature operate under such
   a complication of conditions, that it is difficult to state them as
   universal principles. So Suarez, De Legibus, II, xiii-xv, speaking of
   the application of general moral principles to exceptional cases.

   [699] No, nor the law of physical nature either. There is no law of
   physical nature that every harvest shall ripen. Corn tends' to
   ripeness, and positis ponendis, in the absence of all counteracting
   causes, must actually ripen. Mill in his Logic has the remark, that the
   laws of nature are best expressed as tendencies' only.

   [700] Or by us formulated and anticipated in view of what usually
   occurs.

   [701] It is of the free will of God, -- (a) that creatures exist at
   all: (b) that these creatures exist rather than those: (c) that these
   existent creatures were arranged, to begin with, in this rather than in
   that primitive collocation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER C--That the things which God does beyond the Order of Nature
   are not contrary to Nature [702]

   SINCE God is prime agent, all things inferior to Him are as His
   instruments. But instruments are made to serve the end of the prime
   agent, according as they are moved by Him: therefore it is not contrary
   to, but very much in accordance with, the nature of the instrument, for
   it to be moved by the prime agent. Neither is it contrary to nature for
   created things to be moved in any way whatsoever (qualitercunque) by
   God: for they were made to serve Him. [703]

   4. The first measure of every being and of every nature is God, seeing
   that He is the first being and canse of being to all. And since
   everything must be judged by its measure, that must be called natural'
   to a thing whereby it is conformed to its measure, or standard. That
   then will be natural to a thing, which has been put into it by God.
   Therefore, though something further be impressed upon a thing, making
   it otherwise than as it was before, that is not against nature. [704]

   5. All creatures stand to God as the products of art to the artist (B.
   II, Chap. [407]XXIV). Hence all nature may be called an artistic
   product of divine workmanship (artificiatum divinae artis). But it is
   not contrary to the notion of workmanship for the artist to work
   something to a different effect in his work, even after he has given it
   the first form. Neither then is it contrary to nature if God works
   something in natural things to a different effect from that which the
   ordinary course of nature involves.

   Hence Augustine says: "God, the Creator and Founder of all natures,
   does nothing contrary to nature, because to every creature that is
   natural which He makes so, of whom is all measure, number and order of
   nature. [705]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [702] Does nature' mean anything definite and fixed at all? Because, if
   it does not, nothing can be contrary to nature. Does nature' mean
   merely what God wills?' If so, nothing that God wills can be contrary
   to nature. But the question recurs in another form: What can God will?
   Any fantastic and bizarre combination that we choose to name?'
   Certainly not. There are then restraints upon God's willing, restraints
   in the eternal nature of things, which, in the last reduction means
   God's own nature. His will may be said to be conditioned by His nature.
   He is not a merum arbitrium, an absolute, arbitrary will. Then there
   must be something definite and fixed, which may be called nature,'
   against which God can have no will.

   [703] This would be a pretty argument, were all instruments alike
   capable of all things, and not limited in efficiency each by its own
   nature. As it is, the word qualitercunque seems to have crept into the
   conclusion without being in the premises. Instruments have their
   several natures and capacities, and cannot be used indifferently one
   for another. A looking-glass will not serve for a drinking-cup. Even
   God could not set an ox to govern a State, nor make a three pound
   weight in a fair balance, without interference natural or
   preternatural, outweigh five pounds. Miracles are not wrought in that
   way, which indeed, so far as words go, is the very thesis of St Thomas
   in this chapter.

   [704] Provided it be not essentially incompatible with what was put in'
   originally. But if bovine nature be the original endowment, civil
   status and capacity cannot possibly impressed' upon that. I hope I may
   insist upon this without disrespect to St Thomas, -- nay, without
   departure from his further and inner mind (Chap. [408]XCVII), here not
   so clearly expressed, bent as he was for the nonce upon explaining the
   Augustinian quotation with which he concludes. In these days, when the
   great philosophic difficulty against theism is the prevalence of evil,
   it is of the first importance to beware of any theistic statement which
   seems to represent God as mere Will, arbitrary, unconditioned, and
   untrammelled by any regard to the eternal fitnesses and possibilities
   of nature. In the presence of evils such as we daily experience, to
   ally such sheer, imperious, overruling and overwhelming Will with
   Goodness, is a task which one shrinks from contemplating. Happily, it
   is not the task of the philosopher and the Christian. No lord paramount
   thumos or boulesis can run counter to the eide. If we might put words
   into the mouth of our Creator, words suggested by our great dramatist,
   we might fancy God saying:

   I can do all that doth become a God:

   Who can do more, is none.
   That alone doth become a God,' which is consonant with the eide, or
   fixed intelligible natures of things, which are the expression of His
   nature as imitable beyond Himself God is "the first measure of every
   being and of every nature" by virtue of what He is in Himself in His
   own being and His own nature, not by mere virtue of His will.

   [705] Contra Faustum Manichaeum, XXVI, Chap. iii. St Augustine goes on
   to explain himself in apt accordance with text and notes preceding: "We
   call nature' the course of nature, that we know and are accustomed to.
   When God does anything contrary to this course, such doings are called
   extraordinary, or marvellous. But against that supreme law of nature,
   which is hidden from the knowledge as well of the wicked as of others
   who are still weak, God is as far removed from ever doing anything as
   He is removed from doing anything against Himself."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CI--Of Miracles

   CHAPTER 101--THINGS that are done occasionally by divine power outside
   of the usual established order of events are commonly called miracles
   (wonders). We wonder when we see an effect and do not know the cause.
   And because one and the same cause is sometimes known to some and
   unknown to others, it happens that of the witnesses of the effect some
   wonder and some do not wonder: thus an astronomer does not wonder at
   seeing an eclipse of the sun, at which a person that is ignorant of
   astronomy cannot help wondering. [706] An event is wonderful relatively
   to one man and not to another. The absolutely wonderful is that which
   has a cause absolutely hidden. This then is the meaning of the word
   miracle,' an event of itself full of wonder, not to this man or that
   man only. Now the cause absolutely hidden to every man is God, inasmuch
   as no man in this life can mentally grasp the essence of God (Chap.
   [409]XLVII). Those events then are properly to be styled miracles,
   which happen by divine power beyond the order commonly observed in
   nature.

   Of these miracles there are several ranks and orders. Miracles of the
   highest rank are those in which something is done by God that nature
   can never do. [707] Miracles of the second rank are those in which God
   does something that nature can do, but not in that sequence and
   connexion. Thus it is a work of nature that an animal should live, see
   and walk: but that it should live after death, see after blindness,
   walk after lameness, these things nature is powerless to effect, but
   God sometimes brings them about miraculously. A miracle of the third
   rank is something done by God, which is usually done by the operation
   of nature, but is done in this case without the working of natural
   principles, as when one is cured by divine power of a fever, in itself
   naturally curable, or when it rains without any working of the
   elements. [708]

   [706] Wondering' here is scarcely the right word: rather being
   surprised,' or puzzled.' The mind must view with awe & wonder all great
   fulfilments whether of the anticipations of science or of the promises
   of faith. One cannot fancy Newton viewing an eclipse without wonder. A
   look of wonder is sometimes the last look that comes over the face of
   the dying.

   [707] St Thomas instances "the compenetration of two bodies, the
   standing still of the sun, the making of a way through the sea by
   division of the waters." The instance usually alleged by more recent
   writers is the raising of the dead, which however would belong to St
   Thomas's second class of miracles.

   [708] Rain without any working of the elements (sine operatione
   principiorum naturae) would be a miracle of the first rank, which we do
   not venture to pray for when we pray for rain. No doubt, St Thomas
   means without any working of the elemental powers sufficient of itself
   to produce the effect.' There seems to be a certain law of parsimony
   about miracles, God using natural causes so far as they will go, and
   eking them out by divine or angelic power, when of themselves they
   would go no further to His purpose. In my Oxford and Cambridge
   Conferences, First Series, 1897-1899, there is a discussion on the
   compatibility of miracle with the invariability of the laws of nature.

   CHAPTER CII--That God alone works Miracles

   WHAT is entirely subject to established order cannot work beyond that
   order. But every creature is subject to the order which God has
   established in nature. No creature therefore can work beyond this
   order, which working beyond the order of nature is the meaning of
   working miracles.

   2. When any finite power works the proper effect to which it is
   determined, that is no miracle, though it may surprise one who does not
   understand the operation. But the power of every creature is limited to
   some definite effect, or effects. Whatever therefore is done by the
   power of any creature cannot properly be called a miracle. But what is
   done by the power of God, infinite and incomprehensible, is properly a
   miracle.

   3. Every creature in its action requires some subject to act upon: for
   it belongs to God alone to make a thing out of nothing (B. II, Chap.
   [410]XXI). But nothing that requires a subject for its action can act
   except to the production of those effects to which that subject is in
   potentiality: for the work of action upon a subject is to educe that
   subject from potentiality to actuality. As then a creature can never
   create, so it can never act upon a thing except to the production of
   that which is in the potentiality of that thing. But in many miracles
   done by divine power a thing is done, which is not in the potentiality
   of that upon which it is done, as in the raising of the dead.

   Hence it is said of God: Who doth great wonderful works alone (Ps.
   cxxxv, 4). [709]

   CHAPTER CIII--How Separately Subsisting Spirits work certain Wonders,
   which yet are not true Miracles

   IT was the theory of Avicenna that matter is far more obedient to
   spiritual agencies than to the action of contraries in nature. Hence he
   goes on to say that upon the suggestion of these spiritual agents there
   sometimes follows an effect in the lower world, such as rain, or the
   cure of some sick person, without the coming in of any intermediate
   corporeal agency. He instances the change wrought in the body by the
   mere suggestion of a strong impression of phantasy, as when one walking
   upon a plank set aloft easily falls, because his fear pictures a fall
   to him, whereas he would not fall if the same plank were laid on the
   ground, giving him no occasion to fear. Again it is notorious that upon
   the mere suggestion of the soul the body grows hot, as in desire or
   anger, or is chilled, as in fear. Sometimes too a strong suggestion
   brings on an illness, a fever, or even leprosy. Thereupon Avicenna says
   that if the soul is pure, not subject to bodily passions, and strong in
   its suggestive power, not only its own body will obey its suggestion,
   but even foreign bodies, even to the healing of the sick upon
   suggestion made by it. [710] And this he thought to be the cause of the
   evil eye (fascinationis), that any soul having a strong affection of
   malevolence is capable of making a noxious impression on another,
   particularly on a child, who for the tenderness of his constitution is
   readily susceptible of such impressions. Hence he concludes that much
   more does an effect in this lower world follow upon the suggestion of
   pure spirits, without the action of any bodily agent. And this position
   tallies well enough with his other theories: for he supposes that all
   substantial forms in this lower world are effluxes from a pure spirit,
   and that bodily agents do no more than prepare the matter to receive
   the impression of the separately subsisting spiritual agent. [711] But
   this is not true according to the doctrine of Aristotle, who proves
   that such forms as are in matter arise from other forms which are also
   in matter, for thus is maintained the likeness between maker and made.

   The fact is, a created spirit has no power of its own to induce any
   form upon corporeal matter otherwise than by setting some body into
   local motion. This much is in the power of a created spirit, to make a
   body obey it to the extent of moving locally. So by moving a body
   locally an angel can employ natural agents to the production of certain
   effects. But such action is not miraculous, properly speaking. [712]
   Hence it remains true that created spirits do not work miracles of
   their own power. But there is nothing against their working miracles
   inasmuch as they work in the power of God, as appears from the fact
   that one choir of angels is especially told off, as Gregory says, to
   work miracles. [713] Gregory further says that some saints sometimes
   work miracles by an act of power, and not merely by intercession. [714]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [710] Ad ejus apprehensionem. It is not clear whether the suggestion is
   to be communicated to the patient, as in modern faith-healing and
   hypnotism, or whether Avicenna thought it enough for the suggestion to
   be strong in the operator's own mind.

   [711] What Christian philosophers hold concerning the origin of that
   substantial form, the intelligent human soul, Avicenna maintained about
   all substantial forms, or active principles.

   [712] Were angels in the habit of using bodily instruments to bodily
   effects within the circle of our experience, we could no more call the
   felling of a tree by an angel with an axe miraculous' than the ordinary
   action of the woodman. Such angelic activities were scarcely regarded
   by St Thomas's age as extraordinary occurrences. They thought that
   spirits frequently meddled with sublunary things. We should count any
   such interference extraordinary; and if we believed it to be the
   interference of a good angel, acting within his own power by divine
   permission, we should not hesitate to call it a miracle. We have to
   consider, not merely what the angels can do physically, but what God
   allows them to do in this lower world. He seems to allow them
   frequently to influence men's minds, but seldom to play any part in the
   production of physical phenomena. It would be more true to say that
   angels make men their instruments than that they use material things
   instrumentally.

   [713] The choir called Virtues.

   [714] Such is the case in sacramental action, though that is not to be
   called miraculous, being terminated to no sensible effect.

   CHAPTER CIV--That the Works of Magicians are not due solely to the
   Influence of the Heavenly Spheres [715]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [715] It would be superfluous to translate this chapter. The one point
   of interest which it contains is the enumeration of wonders ascribed to
   magicians in the thirteenth century. Such wonders are answers given
   about the whereabouts of things stolen, about buried treasures, about
   future events, also about points of science: speaking apparitions:
   statues that move and speak: locks opening on a person's mere approach:
   people becoming invisible. St Thomas writes: "If any one says that such
   apparitions are not in the external sense but are simply imaginary,
   that explanation has its difficulties: for no one takes imaginary forms
   for true ones except in cases of alienation of the mind from exterior
   impressions: only when the natural judgement of sense is impaired can
   phantoms be attended to as though they were realities: but these
   conversations and apparitions occur to men who have the full use of
   their external senses." He mentions "statues made by the necromantic
   art," but does not explicitly refer to that evocation of the spirits of
   the departed, which is the pretence of modern spiritualism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CV--Whence the performances of Magicians derive their Efficacy
   [716]

   MAGICIANS in their performances use certain words with a meaning to the
   production of definite effects. Now a word, as meaning something, has
   no power except from some understanding, the understanding either of
   him who utters the word or of him to whom it is uttered: from the
   understanding of the utterer, in the case where a word is of such power
   that by the idea which it contains it is apt to produce real effects,
   the idea being applied to the production of those effects by the
   ministry of the voice: from the understanding of the person addressed,
   in the case when the hearer is induced to do something by the reception
   into his understanding of the idea conveyed by the word. Now it cannot
   be said that those words, uttered by magicians with a meaning, have
   their efficacy from the understanding of him who utters them. For,
   since power follows upon essence, difference of power argues a
   difference of essential principle. But we find the condition of the
   understanding of men generally to be such that it is more true to say
   that its cognition is caused by things than that any idea which it
   conceives can be the cause of things. If then there are any men who by
   words expressive of the concept of their understanding can change
   things one into another, and do that by power of their own (res possint
   transmutare propria virtute), they must be beings of another species
   from ordinary mortals, and cannot be called men in the sense in which
   others are men (dicentur aequivoce homines). [717] The alternative is
   to suppose that such effects are accomplished by the understanding of
   some person, to whom the speech of him who utters such words is
   addressed. This supposition has its confirmation in the fact that the
   expressions which magicians use consist of invocations, entreaties,
   adjurations, or even commands, as of one person talking with another.

   Besides, in the ceremonies of this art they employ certain characters
   and geometrical figures. But a figure is no principle of action,
   imparted or received: or else mathematical drawings would be active and
   passive. Matter therefore cannot be disposed by geometrical figures to
   the reception of any natural effect. It follows that these figures are
   not used as disposing causes, but as signs. Now we use signs only to
   address other intelligent beings. Magical arts therefore owe their
   efficacy to some intelligence, to whom the speech of the magician is
   addressed, -- as is also shown by the sacrifices, prostrations, and
   other rites employed, which can be nothing else but signs of reverence
   paid to some intelligent nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [716] The gist of this chapter is to show that magicians
   (spiritualists) have an understanding with some person, or persons,
   beyond the confines of humanity, and are not availing themselves of the
   ordinary forces of nature.

   [717] Aequivoce, homonumos, as in Aristotle's Categories.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CVI--That the Subsistent Intelligence, which lends Efficacy to
   Magical Performances, is not Good in both Categories of Being [718]

   IT remains to be further investigated, what that intelligent nature is,
   by whose power these operations are carried into effect. To begin with,
   it is apparent that it is no good and praiseworthy nature. For it is
   not the behaviour of an intelligence well disposed to lend countenance
   to acts contrary to virtue. But that is what is done by magical arts:
   they usually serve to bring about adulteries, thefts, killing, and the
   like evil practices. Hence they who use such arts are called evil
   practitioners' (malefici).

   3. The working of a benignant intelligence is to bring men to the
   proper good things of men, which are the good things of reason: but to
   draw men away from those good things, and allure them to trifles, is
   the conduct of an intelligence of a perverse bent. Now by these magical
   arts men make no profit in the good things of reason, which are
   sciences and virtues, but only in such trifles as the finding of things
   stolen, the catching of robbers, and the like.

   4. There seems to be a certain grimace and character of
   unreasonableness attaching to the proceedings of the aforesaid arts.
   Thus they require an agent who abstains from sexual intercourse, and
   yet they are frequently employed for the procurement of sexual
   intercourse in its illicit forms.

   6. As it belongs to the good to lead on to goodness, one might expect
   any right-minded intelligence to lead on to truth, truth being the
   proper good of the understanding. But the proceedings of magicians are
   generally of a character to mock men and deceive them.

   8. It is not the way of a rightly ordered intelligence, supposing it to
   be a superior being, to take orders from an inferior; or, supposing it
   to be an inferior, to suffer itself to be entreated as though it were a
   superior being. But magicians invoke those whose assistance they use,
   with supplication, as though they were superior beings; and then, when
   they have come, they command them as though they were inferiors.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [718] Secundum utrumque esse. The two categories of being are Nature
   (esse naturale, phusis) and Will (esse voluntarium, proairesis).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CVII--That the Subsistent Intelligence, whose aid is employed
   in Magic, is not Evil by Nature [719]

   WHATEVER is in things must be either cause or caused: otherwise it
   would not be in relation with other things. The subsistent beings in
   question then are either causes only or they are also caused. If they
   are causes only, evil cannot be cause of anything except incidentally
   (Chap. [411]XIV); and everything incidental must be reducible to that
   which is ordinary: [720] therefore there must be something in them
   prior to the evil that is there, something whereby they are causes. But
   that which is prior in everything is its nature and essence. Therefore
   these subsistent beings are not evil in their nature. The same
   conclusion follows if they are things caused. For no agent acts except
   with some intention of good: evil therefore cannot be the effect of any
   cause except incidentally. But what is caused incidentally only cannot
   be by nature, since every nature has a regular and definite mode of
   coming into being.

   4. Nothing can exist unless it has existence from the first being, and
   the first being is the sovereign good (B. II, Chap. [412]XV). But since
   every being, as such, acts to the production of its own likeness, all
   things that come of the first being must be good.

   7. Since the will tends to good grasped by the understanding, and finds
   therein its natural and proper object and end, it is impossible for any
   subsistent intelligence to have by nature a bad will, unless the
   understanding in it naturally is mistaken in its judgement of what is
   good. But no understanding can be so mistaken: for false judgements in
   acts of the understanding are like monsters in the physical universe,
   which are not according to nature, but out of the way of nature: for
   the good of the understanding and its natural end is the knowledge of
   truth.

   This is also confirmed by the authority of Holy Scripture: for it is
   said, Every creature is good (1 Tim. iv, 4): God saw all things that he
   had made, and they were very good (Gen. i, 31).

   Hereby is excluded the error of the Manicheans, who suppose that these
   subsistent intelligences, commonly called demons or devils, are
   naturally evil.

   Porphyry tells in his Letter to Anebo [721] that there is a certain
   kind of spirits who make it their business to listen to magicians, a
   kind naturally deceitful, assuming every form, personating gods
   [angels] and men and souls of the departed; and that this kind of being
   it is which makes all these appearances for better or for worse: for
   the rest, that this kind of spirit renders no assistance towards
   anything that is really good, but on the contrary is the author of evil
   counsel, and accuses and hampers and envies the earnest votaries of
   virtue, and is full of hastiness and pride, rejoices in the smell of
   burnt meats, and is captivated by flatteries. [722] The only thing to
   quarrel with in this account is his saying that such malice is in these
   spirits "naturally." [723]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [719] Understand, but is evil by will' (p. 268, note).

   [720] Because the incidental hangs on to the ordinary, and presupposes
   it; whereas the ordinary is conceivable without the incidental. A man
   is ordinarily well, and incidentally sick. Sickness presupposes health
   a the standard to which it is referred.

   [721] Eusebius, De paraparitione evangelii, B. V, Chapp. vii-x, quotes
   the Neo-Platonist Porphyry's Letter to Anebo the Egyptian. St
   Augustine, De civitate Dei, B. X, Chap. xi, also quotes him; and from
   St Augustine St Thomas borrows his quotations. The passages of Eusebius
   and Augustine are worth reading, as contributing to the literature of
   Spiritualism. Eusebius calls Anebo an Egyptian prophet. Porphyry's
   Letter to him exists only in fragments.

   [722] This remarkable quotation indicates the great danger of modern
   spiritualism, that the spirits who appear at séances may not be the
   departed souls of men as they profess to be, but lying devils, who know
   enough of the past history of our departed friends plausibly to
   personify them.

   [723] Porphyry wrote in Greek, where phusei (naturally') is often used
   in the sense of thoroughly' (cf. Eph. ii, 3). It is Shakespeare's in
   grain,' as a fault in grain' (Comedy of Errors, II, 3). In a thoroughly
   wicked man wicked habits have grown into a sort of second nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CIX--That in Spirits there may be Sin, and how

   AS there is an order in active causes, so also in final causes,
   requiring that the secondary end should be subordinate to the primary,
   as the secondary agent depends on the primary. Now every will naturally
   wishes that which is the proper good of the person willing, namely, his
   own perfect well-being; and the will cannot possibly will aught to the
   contrary of this. If we can find a voluntary agent, whose good is a
   final end, such as not to be contained under the order leading to any
   other end, but rather all other ends being contained in the order
   leading up to it, -- in such a voluntary agent there can be no fault of
   the will. Such a voluntary agent is God, whose being is sovereign
   goodness, which is the final end. In God then there can be no fault of
   the will. But in any other voluntary agent, whose proper good must
   necessarily be contained in the order leading to some other good, a sin
   of the will may occur, -- considering the agent as he is in his own
   nature. [724] In every voluntary agent there is a natural inclination
   to will and love his own perfect well-being, and that to such an extent
   that he cannot will the contrary. But a created agent has no natural
   endowment of so subordinating his own well-being to another end than
   himself as to be incapable of swerving from that end: for the higher
   end does not belong to the creature's own nature, but to a superior
   nature. [725] It is left therefore to the decision of his own will to
   subordinate his proper well-being to a higher end. Sin therefore might
   have found place in the will of a pure spirit in this way, -- that he
   did not refer his own good and well-being to the final end, but made
   that good his end and adhered to it accordingly. And because rules of
   conduct necessarily are taken from the end in view, it followed as a
   matter of course that the said spirit arranged his other elections
   according to that same object (ex re ipsa) in which he had placed his
   last end. Hence his will was not regulated by any higher will, a
   position of independence proper to God alone. In this sense we must
   understand the saying that he aimed at equality with God [cf. Isai.
   xiv, 13], not that he ever expected his goodness to equal the divine
   goodness: such a thought could never have occurred to his mind. But to
   wish to rule others, and not to have one's own will ruled by any
   superior, is to wish to be in power and cease to be a subject; and that
   is the sin of pride. Hence it is aptly said that the first sin that a
   spirit committed was pride. But because once error has been committed
   in regard to a first principle, a varied and manifold course of error
   is bound to ensue, so from the spirit's first inordination of will
   there followed manifold other sin in his will, such as hatred of God
   for withstanding his pride and justly chastising his offence, envy
   against man, and the like.

   Further we may note that when any one's proper good is subordinate to
   several higher powers, it is open to a voluntary agent to withdraw
   himself from his subordination to one superior, and not relinquish his
   subordination to another, be that other the superior or the inferior of
   the first. Thus a soldier, being subordinate at once to the king and to
   the general of the army, may direct his will to the good of the general
   and not to the good of the king, or the other way about. If the general
   withdraws from his allegiance to the king, the will of the soldier,
   withdrawing from the will of the general and directing his affection to
   the king, will be good; and the will of the soldier, following the
   general's will against the will of the king, will be evil. Now not only
   are pure spirits subordinate to God, but also one of them is
   subordinate to another from first to last (B. II, Chap. [413]XCV). And
   because in any voluntary agent, short of God, there may be sin in his
   will, if we consider him as left to his own nature, possibly one of the
   higher angels, or even the very highest of all, committed a sin in his
   will. And this is probable enough, that the sinner was highest of them
   all: for he would not have made his own good estate the final end of
   his acquiescence, had not his goodness been very perfect. Some of the
   lower angels then of their own will may have subordinated their good to
   [thrown in their lot with] that leader, and so have withdrawn their
   allegiance from God, and sinned as he did: while others, observing due
   regard to God in the motion of their will, rightly withdrew from their
   subordination to the sinner, although he was higher than they in the
   order of nature.

   This is the difference between man and a pure spirit, that in the one
   being of man there are several appetitive faculties, one subordinate to
   another: this is not the case in pure spirits, although one of them is
   under another. But in man, however the inferior appetite may swerve
   from due subordination, any sin that occurs occurs in his will. As then
   it would be a sin in pure spirits for any inferior amongst them to
   swerve from due subordination to a superior, while that superior
   remained in subordination to God; so in the one person of man sin may
   occur in two ways: in one way by the human will not subordinating its
   own good to God, and that sin man has in common with the pure spirit;
   in another way by the good of the lower appetite not being regulated
   according to the higher, as when the pleasures of the flesh, to which
   the concupiscible appetite tends, are willed not in accordance with
   reason; and this sin does not occur in pure spirits. [726]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [724] A being capable by his own nature of sinning, may be secured from
   sin by a supernatural endowment, as is the case with the Blessed in
   heaven.

   [725] Every voluntary agent loves himself. God, having none higher than
   Himself, is not called upon to subordinate His love of Himself to any
   other love. But angels, or man, while naturally, necessarily, and
   rightly loving himself, is further called upon to subordinate his love
   of himself to the love of God. This further call he may fail to comply
   with: then he sins. The argument in the text is directed against the
   Platonists, who ascribed all sinful tendency to the body, and
   consequently could see no possibility of sin in a pure spirit, or
   angel, and thus came to reject the Christian dogma of the fall of the
   angels.

   [726] The parallel between the subordination of angel to angel and
   appetite to appetite is not perfect: for if the lower angel disobeys,
   it is the sin of that angel: but if the lower appetite disobeys, it is
   no sin, unless the disobedience be countenanced by the higher; and then
   the sin is primarily in the higher, and only redundance in the lower
   appetite.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTERS CVIII, CX--Arguments seeming to prove that Sin is impossible
   to Spirits, with Solutions of the same

   ARG. 1. Every other cognitive faculty but the understanding makes use
   of living bodily organs. In pure spirits therefore it is impossible for
   there to be any cognitive faculty but the understanding; and whatever
   they take cognisance of, they have understanding of. [727] But in so
   far as one has understanding, one does not err: for all error springs
   from lack of understanding. Therefore there can be no error in the
   apprehension of these spirits. But without such error there can be no
   sin in the will: because the will always tends to good as apprehended:
   hence unless there he a mistake in the apprehension of good, there can
   be no sin in the will. [728]

   Arg. 2. In us there occurs sin of the will in respect of matters about
   which we have true knowledge of their general bearings, but on a
   particular point our judgement is hampered by some passion fettering
   the reason. But these passions cannot be in spiritual beings, because
   such passions belong to the sensitive part, and that has no action
   without a bodily organ. Having therefore a right knowledge in general,
   the will of a pure spirit cannot tend to evil by any defed of knowledge
   in particular.

   Arg. 3. No cognitive faculty is deceived about its own proper object,
   but only about some object foreign to it: thus sight is not deceived in
   judging of colours, but when a man undertakes by sight to judge of
   tastes, then deception occurs. Now the proper object of understanding
   is the essence of a thing. [729] No deception then is incident to the
   apprehension of understanding, so long as it fixes upon the pure
   quiddities of things: but all intellectual deception, we may think,
   arises from the forms of things apprehended coming to be mixed up with
   phantasms, [730] as in our experience. But such a mode of cognition
   does not obtain in pure spirits, since phantasms cannot be without a
   body. To pure spirits therefore no error in cognition can possibly be
   incident, and consequently no sin in the will.

   Reply to Arguments 1, 2, 3. We are not obliged to say that there was
   any error in the understanding of a pure spirit, in the shape of a
   false judgement, judging that to be good which is not good: the
   mistake, such as it was, lay in not attending to the higher good, to
   which the spirit's private good ought to have been referred: the reason
   of which inattention [read inconsiderationis ratio] may have been the
   inward turning of the will upon the spirit's private good: [731] for it
   is open to the will to turn more or less of its affection upon this
   object or upon that. [732]

   Arg. 5. Since appetite or desire tends to nothing but its own proper
   good, it seems impossible for desire to go astray in the case when the
   person desiring has one only definite good to desire. The reason why
   sin is incident to our desire is the composition of our nature, a
   compound of the spiritual and the corporeal, occasioning a multiplicity
   of things to be good for us, one thing being good for us in mind and
   another in body. Of this variety of good things the less important has
   to be subordinated to the more important. Hence sin of the will arises
   in us when we neglect that order, and go after what is good for us
   under a certain qualification, discarding what is good for us
   absolutely. But in pure spirits there is no such composition, no
   diversity of things good for them; nay, all their good is intellectual.
   Hence it seems they are incapable of sin in the will.

   Reply. The angel who sinned did not go after any other good than the
   one good that was proper to him: but his sin lay in this, that he
   dropped the higher good to which he should have subordinated himself As
   we sin by pursuing the lower goods of the body away from the order of
   reason, so the devil sinned by not referring his own excellence to the
   excellence of God. [733]

   Arg. 6. In us, sin of the will arises out of excess or defect, while
   virtue lies in the mean between them. But pure spirits can pursue only
   intellectual good things, in which things no excess is possible, for of
   themselves they are in the mean between excess and defect, as truth is
   in the mean between two errors.

   Reply. The devil passed the mean of virtue inasmuch as he did not
   submit himself to a superior order; and thus he gave himself more than
   his due, and to God less than His due.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [727] Is not this also true of man, in so far at least as his
   consciousness is fully awakened, and his cognition lively? In such a
   case sense never acts alone. Then the objection holds good for man
   also, in respect of any fully deliberate sin.

   [728] See the latter half of Chap. X, where the explanation given of
   the spiritual (not the fleshly) sins of man applies likewise to angels.

   [729] And yet it is commonly confessed that we do not know the essences
   of things. Who knows the essence even of a fly, or (till molecular
   mechanics go further than they have done) of a lump of sugar? We know
   essences, only in their highest generalities and most abstract
   outlines. But we do know that, or we should know nothing. We do not
   understand anything unless we can say roughly what it is; and that what
   it is is here called the quidditas or essence. Lower animals take
   quiddities as they find them, e.g., a dog the quiddity of its master:
   they may be said to know them materially, but they do not pass upon
   them any explicit, formal judgement. Scientists and philosophers make
   it their endeavour to go beyond the quiddity, which is sufficient for
   the plain man to know. They start from sense, but seek to transcend
   sense. The pure quiddity' which the angel intues is not the bare
   abstraction visible to the popular mind: it is an intuition highly
   concrete, full of content,' discerning the essential from the
   accidental and the appropriate from the irrelevant, yet not ignorant
   even of the latter: for things irrelevant from one point of view are
   relevant from another. Science and philosophy is an attempt to soar
   from a human to an angelic view of things.

   [730] Not because the phantasm represents sensible phenomena is it
   therefore non-intellectual; but because in a phantasm all phenomena are
   clustered together without principle, without reference, without
   assortment; no point of view being yet arrived at from whence phenomena
   assume a relative importance to some other than an immediately present
   end. This fixing upon a distant point of view is the work of intellect.

   [731] And thy heart was lifted up with thy beauty: thou hast lost thy
   wisdom in thy beauty. -- Ezechiel xxviii, 17.

   [732] Thus though an angel do not suffer from error, he may suffer from
   limitation of view: his mind, to borrow Marshal Ney's excuse at his
   trial, may "cease to be in full relation with facts." Cf. B. II, Chap.
   CI.

   [733] This reply virtually lays it down that even for the angel good is
   not single, but twofold, the good of his own nature, and the superior
   goodness of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXII--That Rational Creatures are governed by Providence for
   their own sakes, and other Creatures in reference to them [734]

   THE very condition of intellectual nature, whereby it is mistress of
   its own acts, requires the care of Providence, providing for it for its
   own sake: while the condition of other creatures, that have no dominion
   over their own act, indicates that care is taken of them not for
   themselves, but for their subordination to other beings. For what is
   worked by another is in the rank of an instrument: while what works by
   itself is in the rank of a prime agent. Now an instrument is not sought
   for its own sake, but for the use of the prime agent: hence all
   diligence of workmanship applied to instruments must have its end and
   final point of reference in the prime agent. On the other hand all care
   taken about a prime agent, as such, is for its own sake.

   2. What has dominion over its own act, is free in acting. For he is
   free, who is a cause to himself of what he does: whereas a power driven
   by another under necessity to work is subject to slavery. Thus the
   intellectual nature alone is free, while every other creature is
   naturally subject to slavery. But under every government the freemen
   are provided for for their own sakes, while of slaves this care is
   taken that they have being for the use of the free.

   3. In a system making for an end, any parts of the system that cannot
   gain the end of themselves must be subordinate to other parts that do
   gain the end and stand in immediate relation to it. Thus the end of an
   army is victory, which the soldiers gain by their proper act of
   fighting: the soldiers alone are in request in the army for their own
   sakes; all others in other employments in the army, such as grooms or
   armourers, are in request for the sake of the soldiers. But the final
   end of the universe being God, the intellectual nature alone attains
   Him in Himself by knowing Him and loving Him (Chap. [414]XXV).
   Intelligent nature therefore alone in the universe is in request for
   its own sake, while all other creatures are in request for the sake of
   it. [735]

   6. Everything is naturally made to behave as it actually does behave in
   the course of nature. Now we find in the actual course of nature that
   an intelligent subsistent being converts all other things to his own
   use, either to the perfection of his intellect, by contemplating truth
   in them, or to the execution of works of his power and development of
   his science, as an artist develops the conception of his art in bodily
   material; or again to the sustenance of his body, united as that is to
   an intellectual soul.

   Nor is it contrary to the conclusion of the aforesaid reasons, that all
   the parts of the universe are subordinate to the perfection of the
   whole. For that subordination means that one serves another: thus there
   is no inconsistency in saying that unintelligent natures serve the
   intelligent, and at the same time serve the perfection of the universe:
   for if those things were wanting which subsistent intelligence requires
   for its perfection, the universe would not be complete.

   By saying that subsistent intelligences are guided by divine providence
   for their own sakes, we do not mean to deny that they are further
   referable to God and to the perfection of the universe. They are cared
   for for their own sakes, and other things for their sake, in this
   sense, that the good things which are given them by divine providence
   are not given them for the profit of any other creature: [736] while
   the gifts given to other creatures by divine ordinance make for the use
   of intellectual creatures.

   Hence it is said: Look not on sun and moon and stars besides, to be led
   astray with delusion and to worship what the Lord thy God hath created
   for the service of all nations under heaven (Deut. iv, 19): Thou hast
   subjected all things under his feet, sheep and all oxen and the beasts
   of the field (Ps. viii, 8).

   Hereby is excluded the error of those who lay it down that it is a sin
   for man to kill dumb animals: for by the natural order of divine
   providence they are referred to the use of man: hence without injustice
   man uses them either by killing them or in any other way: wherefore God
   said to Noe: As green herbs have I given you all flesh (Gen. ix, 3).
   Wherever in Holy Scripture there are found prohibitions of cruelty to
   dumb animals, as in the prohibition of killing the mother-bird with the
   young (Deut. xxii, 6, 7), the object of such prohibition is either to
   turn man's mind away from practising cruelty on his fellow-men, lest
   from practising cruelties on dumb animals one should go on further to
   do the like to men, or because harm done to animals turns to the
   temporal loss of man, either of the author of the harm or of some
   other; or for some ulterior meaning, as the Apostle (1 Cor. ix, 9)
   expounds the precept of not muzzling the treading ox.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [734] The general proposition, that matter serve mind, will hardly be
   denied by any one. There are the starry heavens, vast and superhuman:
   but there are also angels, besides astronomers.

   [735] Still in face of such texts as, The heavens are telling the glory
   of God (Ps. xviii): Praise ye him, O sun and moon: praise ye him, all
   ye stars and light (Ps. cxlviii): it is hard to deny that God might
   have chosen to erect a monument to His glory in the shape of a world of
   irrational creatures, and even of inanimate nature alone. Such
   creatures would have been, in Aristotelian and Thomist phrase, natural
   slaves,' paying their service immediately to God; and of them the text
   would have been verified: The Lord shall rejoice in his works (Ps.
   ciii).

   [736] Thus the strength of the labourer is given him to till the earth,
   not for the profit of the earth, but for the profit of human society.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXIII--That the acts of the Rational Creature are guided by
   God, not merely to the realisation of the Specific Type, but also to
   the realisation of the Individual

   EVERYTHING is reckoned to exist for the sake of its activity, activity
   being the final perfection of a thing. Thus then everything, so far as
   it comes under divine providence, is guided by God to its proper act.
   But a rational creature subject to providence is governed and provided
   for as an individual for its own sake, not merely for the sake of the
   species, as is the case with other perishable creatures (Chap.
   [415]CXII). Thus then rational creatures alone are guided by God to
   their acts, not merely specific but individual.

   2. Whatever things are guided in their acts only in what appertains to
   the species, such things have not the choice of doing or not doing: for
   what is consequent upon the species is common and natural to all
   individuals contained under the species; and what is natural is not in
   our power. [737] If then man were guided in his acts only to the extent
   of fitting him for his species, he would have no choice of doing or not
   doing, but would have to follow the natural inclination common to the
   whole species, as happens in all irrational creatures. [738]

   3. In whatsoever beings there are found actions over and above such as
   fall in with the common inclination of the species, such beings must be
   regulated by divine providence in their actions with some guidance
   beyond that which is extended to the species. But in the rational
   creature many actions appear, which the inclination of the species is
   not sufficient to account for, as is shown by their being not alike in
   all, but various in various individuals.

   4. The rational creature alone is capable of being guided to its acts
   not merely specifically but individually: for by the gift of
   understanding and reason it is able to discern the diversity of good
   and evil according as is befitting to diverse individuals, times and
   places. [739]

   5. The rational creature is not only governed by divine providence, but
   is also capable to some extent of grasping the notion of providence,
   whereas other creatures share in providence merely by being subject to
   providence. Thus the rational creature is partaker in providence, not
   merely by being governed, but by governing: for it governs itself by
   its own acts, and also other beings. But every lower providence is
   subject to the supreme providence of God. Therefore the government of
   the acts of the rational creature, in so far as they are personal acts,
   belongs to divine providence.

   6. The personal acts of the rational creature are properly the acts
   that come from a rational soul. Now the rational soul is capable of
   perpetuity, not only in the species, as other creatures are, but also
   in the individual. The acts therefore of the rational creature are
   guided by divine providence, not only as they belong to the species,
   but also as they are personal acts. [740]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [737] Naturalia non sunt in nobis, the natural being marked off from
   the voluntary (note, p. 268). The natural appetites, apart from their
   voluntary gratification to this or that effect, do not induce acts of
   the individual man, but acts of the species man. Such acts are not the
   acts of Charles or James: they are racial, not personal; and so long as
   they remain racial, and are not in any way brought about or taken up by
   the will of the person in whom they occur, they are outside of the
   category of morality, being neither moral nor immoral, but organic.

   [738] The phrase, realisation of a species type,' or fitness for the
   species' (congruentia speciei), in this chapter, points, not the
   attributes which a man should have to make him a good man, but the
   attributes that he actually has and must have by the fact of his being
   a man at all. -- With regard to dogs, horses and other educable'
   animals, who come to possess individual characteristics of their own,
   St Thomas would say that any dog or horse, so born, so bred, so
   circumstanced, would behave just as this or that dog or horse behaves.
   Determinists say the same of man: but St Thomas, not being a
   determinist, would deny it of man. Under determinism, all St Thomas's
   argumentation of a special divine providence over each individual man
   falls to the ground. According to St Thomas, a man using free will is
   an original, not merely one of a tribe. Originality is lost in
   determinism, and all true individuality; and no difference between man
   and man is left beyond the difference of one piece of iron hammered
   into the shape of a crook and another into the shape of a cross.

   [739] When one of a pair of horses falls on its side, it will go on
   using its legs as though it were still trotting, thereby kicking its
   yoke-fellow. A beaver, shut up in a room, is said to make dams with the
   furniture.

   [740] The idea of this argument is that God cares for the ongoings of
   permanent beings. In dumb animals the species is permanent, but in man
   also the soul of the individual.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXIV--That it was necessary for a Law to be given to Man by God

   THE acts of irrational creatures, as they belong to the species, are
   guided by God according to a natural inclination, consequent upon the
   nature of the species. Therefore, over and above that, there must be
   given to men something to guide them in their personal acts, and that
   we call law.'

   3 and 4. To them is a law fittingly given, who know what they are
   about, and have the alternative of doing a thing or leaving it undone.
   But that is proper to the rational creature only. Therefore the
   rational creature alone is conceptible of law. [741]

   Hence it is said: I will give my law in their hearts (Jer. xxx, 33): I
   will write for him my manifold laws (Osee viii, 12).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [741] St Thomas is here speaking of the Natural (moral) Law, not of the
   Eternal Law, which binds every creature. See Ethics and Natural Law,
   pp. 131-134.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXV--That the main purpose of the Divine Law is to subordinate
   Man to God

   THE end which God intends is Himself.

   2. The end of every human creature is to adhere to God, for in that his
   happiness consists.

   4. That should be the main purpose of a law, from which the law derives
   its efficacy. But the law given by God has efficacy among men from the
   fact that man is suited to God. This therefore ought to be the chief
   precept in the divine law, that the human mind should adhere to God.

   Hence it is said: And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God ask of
   thee but that thou fear the Lord thy God and walk in his ways, and love
   him and serve the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and thy whole soul?
   (Deut. x, 12.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXVI--That the End of the Divine Law is the Love of God

   THE main intention of the divine law is that man should adhere to God;
   and man adheres to God chiefly by love. There are two powers whereby
   man may cleave to God, his understanding and his will. By the lower
   faculties of his soul man cannot cleave to God, but adheres to lower
   things. Now the adhesion that is of the understanding is completed by
   that which is of the will: for by the will man comes to rest in what
   the understanding apprehends. The will cleaves to a thing either
   through love or through fear, but in different ways. When it adheres to
   a thing through fear, it adheres for the sake of something else,
   namely, to avoid an evil threatening it, if it does not adhere: but
   when it adheres to a thing through love, it adheres for the thing's own
   sake. But what is for its own sake carries the day over what is only
   for the sake of something else. Therefore the adhesion of love to God
   is the chief way of adhering to Him, and is the point principally
   intended in the divine law.

   2. The end of every law, and particularly of the divine law, is to make
   men good. Now a man is called good from having a good will: for the
   will it is which reduces to act whatever good there is in the man: but
   the will is good by willing good, and particularly the chief good,
   which is the end: the more then the will wills this good, the better
   the man is. Therefore the will of the sovereign good, which is God, is
   what most of all makes men good, and is principally intended in the
   divine law.

   3. The law aims at making men virtuous: but it is a condition of virtue
   that the virtuous person should act firmly and with pleasure; and love
   it is that best makes us do a thing firmly and with delight.

   Therefore it is said: The end of the commandment is charity (1 Tim. i,
   5): The greatest and first commandment is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy
   God (Matt. xxii, 37, 38).

   CHAPTER CXVII--That by the Divine Law we are directed to the Love of
   our Neighbour

   THERE should be a union of affection among those who have one common
   end: [742] but men share in the one common last end of happiness, to
   which they are ordained of God; and therefore they should be united in
   mutual love.

   2. Whoever loves another, must in consequence also love those whom that
   other loves and who are united with him. [743] But men are loved by
   God, seeing that for them He has prepared the enjoyment of Himself as
   their last end. Therefore as one is a lover of God, so must he also be
   a lover of his neighbour.

   3. Since man is naturally a social animal, he needs to be helped by
   other men to gain his proper end; and this is most aptly done by mutual
   love prevailing amongst men.

   4. To attend to divine things, a man needs tranquillity and peace. Now
   the things that might trouble peace are most effectually taken away by
   mutual love. Since then the law of God orders men to attend to divine
   things, mutual love amongst men must necessarily be a provision of the
   divine law.

   5. The divine law is given to man to bear out the natural law. [744]
   But it is natural to all men to love one another: a sign of this is the
   fact that by a sort of natural instinct man helps any man, even a
   stranger, in necessity, as by calling him back from a wrong turn that
   he may have taken on his way, lifting him up from a fall, and the like,
   as though every man were kinsman and friend of every other man.

   Hence it is said: This is my commandment, that ye love one another
   (John xv, 12): This commandment we have of God, that he who loveth God
   do love also his brother (1 John iv, 21): The second commandment is,
   thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself (Matt. xxii, 39).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [742] Except it be a competitive end, and then the proverb comes in
   which is as old as Hesiod, Works and Days, 25: kai kerameus keramei
   koteei kai aoidos aoido: Two of a trade can never agree.

   [743] Love me, love my dog.

   [744] In the order of nature, apart from revelation, the divine law is
   the natural law: it is the exigency of nature enforced by God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXVIII--That by Divine Law men are obliged to a Right Faith

   AS sight by the bodily eye is the principle of the bodily passion of
   love, so the beginning of spiritual love must be the intellectual
   vision of some object of the same. But the vision of that spiritual
   object of understanding, which is God, cannot be had at present by us
   except through faith, because God exceeds our natural reason,
   especially if we consider Him in that regard under which our happiness
   consists in enjoying Him.

   2. The divine law directs man to be entirely subject to God. But as man
   will is subjected to God by loving Him, so his understanding is
   subjected to Him by believing Him, -- but not by believing anything
   false, because no falsehood can be proposed to man by God, who is the
   truth: hence he who believes anything false does not believe God.

   3. Whoever holds an erroneous view about a thing, touching the essence
   of the thing, does not know the thing. Thus if any one were to fix on
   the notion of irrational animal, and take that to be man, he would not
   know man. The case would be otherwise, if he was mistaken only about
   some of the accidents of man. But in the case of compound beings,
   though he who errs about any of the essentials of a thing does not know
   the thing, absolutely speaking, still he knows it in a sort of a way:
   thus he who thinks man to be an irrational animal knows him
   generically: but in the case of simple beings this cannot be, -- any
   error shuts out entirely all knowledge of the thing. But God is to the
   utmost degree simple. Therefore whoever errs about God does not know
   God. Thus he who believes God to be corporeal has no sort of knowledge
   of God, but apprehends something else instead of God. [745] Now as a
   thing is known, so is it loved and desired. He then who errs concerning
   God, can neither love Him nor desire Him as his last end. Since then
   the divine law aims at bringing men to love and desire God, that same
   law must bind men to have a right faith concerning God.

   Hence it is said: Without faith it is impossible to please God (Heb.
   xi, 6); and at the head of all other precepts of the law there is
   prescribed a right faith in God: Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God is
   one Lord (Deut. vi, 4).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [745] This reasoning is not very convincing. Though God is a simple
   being in Himself, He is not simple to us. We do not know Him, as we
   know a triangle, or the number two, by one comprehensive apprehension,
   but by an accumulation of partial concepts. It is not clear that error
   in one of these concepts spoils our view of all the rest. There was a
   hermit in the early Church, who believed that God was a being in human
   shape. When some one undeceived him, he went ahout weeping and crying,
   "They have taken away my God." In making that complaint the hermit was
   mistaken. For all his anthropmorphism, he had known God as Maker, Lord,
   Father, Last End; and in all those capacities God still remained to
   him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXIX--That by certain Sensible Rites our mind is directed to
   God

   BECAUSE it is connatural to man to gather his knowledge through the
   senses, and most difficult for him to transcend sensible things God has
   provided for man that even in sensible things there should be made for
   him a commemoration of things divine. To this end sensible sacrifices
   have been instituted, which man offers to God, not as though God needed
   them, but to bring home to man the lesson that he ought to offer
   himself and all he has to God, his end, Creator, Ruler, and Lord of
   all. There are also exercised upon man certain hallowings through
   certain sensible things, whereby man is washed, or anointed, or given
   to eat and drink, along with the utterance (prolatione) of audible
   words, to represent to man by these sensible signs the augmentation of
   spiritual gifts wrought in him from without, namely, by God, whose name
   is expressed in audible words. Also certain sensible rites are
   performed by men, not to rouse God to action, [746] but to prompt
   themselves to divine service. Of this nature are prostrations,
   genuflections, vocal cries and chants: which things are not done as
   though God had need of them, who knows all, even the affection of the
   mind, -- whose will is unchangeable (Chap. [416]XCV), and who moreover
   does not accept the movement of the body for its own sake: [747] but we
   do these things on our own behalf, that by these sensible rites our
   intention may be directed to God and our affection inflamed. At the
   same time also we hereby make profession of God being author of our
   soul and body, in that we pay Him acts of homage spiritual and bodily.
   [748]

   Hence it is not surprising that the [Manichean] heretics, who say that
   God is not the author of our body, blame these bodily observances being
   paid to God. In which censure they evidently fail to remember that they
   themselves are men, not seeing that sensible representations are
   necessary to us for inward knowledge and affection. For it is
   experimentally shown that our soul is excited by bodily acts to think
   and feel: hence we properly use such acts to raise our mind to God.

   In the payment of these bodily observances the cult, or worship, of God
   is said to consist. For we are said to cultivate those objects to which
   we pay attention by our works. Now we busy ourselves in paying
   attention to the things of God, not as though we were of service to
   Him, as is the case when we are said to tend, or cultivate, other
   things by our attentions, but because such actions are of service to
   ourselves, enabling us to come nearer to God. [749] And because by
   inward acts we go straight to God, therefore it is by inward acts
   properly that we worship God: nevertheless outward acts also belong to
   the cult, or worship, of God, inasmuch as by such acts our mind is
   raised to God, as has been said.

   Hence the worship of God is also called religion, because by such acts
   a man in some sort binds (ligat) himself, that his thought may not
   wander astray from God; and also because by a sort of natural instinct
   he feels himself bound (obligatum) to God, that in such manner as he
   can he should pay reverence to Him from whom is the origin of his being
   and of all his good. [750]

   Hence also religion has received the name of piety, for piety is that
   whereby we pay due honour to parents: hence aptly the honour paid to
   God, parent of all, is taken to be a part of piety, and they who oppose
   the worship of God are called impious.

   But because not only is God cause and origin of our being, but our
   whole being is in His power, and all that is in us is His due, and
   thereby He is truly our Lord and Master, therefore what we perform in
   honour of God is called service. Now God is our master not by accident,
   as one man is another's master, but by nature; and therefore the
   service that we owe to God is quite different from that whereby we are
   accidentally subject to a man, the dominion of man over man being
   partial, and derivative from God. Hence the service specially due to
   God is called among the Greeks latria. [751]

   [746] St Thomas is thinking of such a rite as that described in 3 (1)
   Kings xviii, 26-28.

   [747] I conceive that the insertion, et cujus voluntas est immutabilis,
   should stand after et affectum mentis, not before. If God does not
   accept the heart's affection for its own sake, what does he accept for
   its own sake that man can give? Moreover a special title of God is that
   of 'searcher of hearts'.

   [748] This last sentence is important to exclude a misconception. See
   Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 194-5, article 6.

   [749] This is the answer to the enquiry, started by Plato, Euthyphro,
   13, 14. The answer lies in a mean between the savage notion of gods
   hungering after the reek and savour of sacrificial meats, and the
   Epicurean poco-curante intermundane deum natura nihil indiga nostri,
   set forth in Lucretius I, 61.

   [750] From Lewis and Short's Dictionary, s.v. religio: "Cicero derives
   it from relegere, an opinion favoured by the verse, religentem esse
   oportet, religiosum nefas: whereas Servius, Lactantius, Augustine,
   assume religare as the primitive, and for this derivation Lactantius
   cites the expression of Lucretius, religionum nodis animos exsolvere.
   Modern etymologists mostly agree with this latter view, assuming as
   root lig (to bind), whence also lex: hence religio sometimes means the
   same as obligatio."

   [751] The word in Greek means either hired service or religious
   service, anyhow the service of one permanently retained by and bound to
   another. Hence the chained Prometheus says, tede latreuo petra, I do my
   fixed duty by this rock, P.V. 968).

   CHAPTER CXX--That the Worship of Latria is to be paid to God alone

   THERE have been some who have thought that this worship should be paid
   not only to the first principle of all things, but also to all
   creatures that are above men. Hence, while considering God to be the
   one prime and universal principle of all things, they have still
   thought it right to pay latria, first after God, to the subsistent
   intelligences in the heavens, which they also called gods, whether they
   existed entirely apart from bodies or were the souls of spheres or
   stars. Secondly, also to certain subsistent intelligences which they
   believed to be united to bodies of air, and called them genii
   (daimones): because they believed them to be above men, as a body of
   air is above a body of earth, they insisted that these intelligences
   also were to be worshipped by men with divine worship, and in
   comparison with men they said that they were gods, as being
   intermediate between men and gods. And because they believed that the
   souls of good men, by the fact of their separation from bodies, passed
   to a higher state than the state of the present life, they considered
   that divine worship should be paid also to the souls of the dead, whom
   they called heroes, or manes. Some again, taking God to be the soul of
   the universe, have believed that the worship proper to Godhead is to be
   paid to the whole universe and to all its parts, not however for the
   sake of the material part, but for the sake of the soul, which they
   said was God, as honour is paid to a wise man, not for his body but for
   his mind. Some again used to say that even things naturally below man
   still should be worshipped by man with divine honours, inasmuch as some
   portion of the power of a higher nature is communicated to them. Hence,
   believing that certain images made by man were receptive of
   supernatural power, either from the influence of the heavenly bodies or
   from the presence of Spirits within them, they said that such images
   should receive divine worship, and they called those images gods: on
   which account themselves were called idolaters,' because they paid the
   worship of latria to idols and images. [752]

   1. But it is irrational in men who posit one only separate first
   principle, to pay divine worship to another. For we pay worship to God,
   not as though He needed it, but to strengthen in ourselves by sensible
   signs a true opinion about God. Now the opinion that God is one,
   exalted above all, cannot be strengthened in us by sensible signs
   except by our paying him some separate and peculiar tribute, which we
   call divine worship. Evidently then true opinion about the one
   principle is weakened, if divine worship is paid to several.

   2. This exterior worship is necessary for man, to the end that man's
   soul may conceive a spiritual reverence for God. But custom goes a long
   way in moving the mind of man: for we are more easily moved to that to
   which we are accustomed. Now the custom among men is that the honour
   that is paid to him who holds the highest place in the commonwealth, as
   to the king or emperor, is paid to none other. Therefore there should
   be a worship that is paid to none other than the one principle of the
   universe; and that we call the worship of latria.

   3. If the worship of latria is due to another merely because he is
   superior, and not because he is supreme, it would follow that one man
   should pay latria to another man, and one angel to another angel,
   seeing that among men, and also among angels, one is superior to
   another. And since among men he who is superior on one point is
   inferior on another, it would follow that men should interchange latria
   in their mutual dealings, which is absurd.

   4. Man ought to pay God something special in recognition of the special
   benefit of his creation; and that is the worship of latria.

   5. Latria means service, and service is due to the master. Now he is
   properly and truly called master, who lays down to others precepts of
   conduct, and himself takes a precept of conduct from none: for he who
   executes the arrangement of a superior is rather minister than master.
   But God's providence disposes all things to their due actions: hence in
   Holy Writ the angels and the heavenly bodies are said to minister both
   to God, whose ordinance they execute, and to us, to whose benefit their
   actions tend. Therefore the worship of latria, due to the sovereign
   master, is to be paid only to the sovereign principle of the universe.

   6. Among all acts of latria, a unique rank belongs to sacrifice: for
   genuflections, prostrations and other such marks of honour may be paid
   even to man, although with another intention than they are paid to God:
   but no one ever thought to offer sacrifice except to him whom he
   regarded as God, or affected so to regard. The outward rite of
   sacrifice represents the inward true sacrifice, whereby the human mind
   offers itself to God, as to the principle of its creation, the author
   of its activity, the term of its happiness. Therefore to God alone
   should man offer sacrifice and the worship of latria, and not to any
   created spirits whatsoever.

   Hence it is said: He shall be slain who offers sacrifice to any gods
   but to the Lord alone (Exod. xxii, 20): The Lord thy God shalt thou
   adore, and him only shalt thou serve (Deut. vi, 13). And because it is
   an undue thing for the worship of latria to be paid to any other than
   the first principle of all things, and only an evil-minded rational
   creature will incite others to undue acts; evidently men have been set
   on to the aforesaid undue worships by the instigation of devils, who
   have presented themselves to men to be adored in place of God, seeking
   divine honour. Hence it is said: All the gods of the heathen are devils
   (Ps. xcv, 5): The things which the heathen sacrifice, they sacrifice to
   devils, and not to God (1 Cor. x, 20).
     __________________________________________________________________

   Graeco-Roman paganism, in its last stand against Christianity under
   Julian and the Neo-Platonists.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXXI--That the Divine Law directs man to a Rational Use of
   Corporeal and Sensible Things

   AS man's mind may be raised to God by corporeal and sensible things,
   provided that they are duly used to show reverence to God, so also the
   undue use of them either totally withdraws the mind from God, fixing
   the final intention of the will upon inferior things, [753] or clogs
   the mind's aspiration after God, making it take unnecessary interest in
   such things. [754] Now the divine law is given for this end chiefly, to
   lead man to cling to God. It is a function therefore of divine law to
   direct man in his affection for and use of corporeal and sensible
   things.

   2. As man's mind is subordinate to God, so his body is subordinate to
   his soul, and his lower powers to his reason. It belongs therefore to
   divine providence, the plan of which, as proposed by God to man, is the
   divine law, to see that all things keep their order. Therefore that
   divine law must so direct man as that his lower powers shall be subject
   to his reason, and his body to his soul, and exterior things shall
   serve his necessity.

   4. Every lawgiver must comprise in his legislation those enactments
   without which the law could not be observed. Now law being set over
   reason, [755] man could not follow the law unless all other things
   belonging to man were subjected to reason.

   Hence it is said: Your reasonable service (Rom. xii, i); and, This is
   the will of God, your sanctification (1 Thess. iv, 9).

   Hereby is excluded the error of such as say that those acts alone are
   sinful, whereby our neighbour is either hurt or shocked.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [753] As is the ease with those whose god is their belly (Phil. iii,
   19): i.e., who live for drink, and will do anything to get it, and for
   the lusts of the lower belly: that is their religion,' an insult to the
   living God.

   [754] The interest that we take in some things by way of much needed
   recreation and distraction of mind, cannot be called an "unnecessary
   interest."

   [755] That is, law being set to govern the rational will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXXII--Of the reason for which Simple Fornication is a Sin by
   Divine Law, and of the Natural Institution of Marriage

   HENCE appears the folly of those who say that simple fornication is not
   a sin. [756] For they say: Given a woman free from a husband, and under
   no control of father or any other person, if any one approaches her
   with her consent, he does her no wrong, because she is pleased so to
   act, and has the disposal of her own person: nor does he do any wrong
   to another, for she is under no one's control: therefore there appears
   no sin. Nor does it seem to be a sufficient answer to say that she
   wrongs God, for God is not offended by us except by what we do against
   our own good (Chap. [417]CXXI): [757] but it does not appear that this
   conduct is against man's good: hence no wrong seems to be done to God
   thereby. In like manner also it does not appear a sufficient answer,
   that wrong is thereby done to one's neighbour, who is scandalised: for
   sometimes a neighbour is scandalised by what of itself is not a sin, in
   which case the sin is only incidental: but the question is not whether
   fornication is a sin incidentally, but whether it is a sin ordinarily
   and in itself.

   We must seek a solution from what has been said before: for it has been
   said (Chapp. [418]XVI, [419]LXIV) that God has care of everything
   according to that which is good for it. Now it is good for everything
   to gain its end, and evil for it to be diverted from its due end. But
   as in the whole so also in the parts, our study should be that every
   part of man and every act of his may attain its due end. Now though the
   semen is superfluous for the preservation of the individual, yet it is
   necessary to him for the propagation of the species: while other
   excretions, such as excrement, urine, sweat, and the like, are needful
   for no further purpose: hence the only good that comes to man of them
   is by their removal from the body. But that is not the object in the
   emission of the semen, but rather the profit of generation, to which
   the union of the sexes is directed. But in vain would be the generation
   of man unless due nurture followed, without which the offspring
   generated could not endure. The emission of the semen then ought to be
   so directed as that both the proper generation may ensue and the
   education of the offspring be secured.

   Hence it is clear that every emission of the semen is contrary to the
   good of man, which takes place in a way whereby generation is
   impossible; and if this is done on purpose, it must be a sin. I mean a
   way in which generation is impossible in itself as is the case in every
   emission of the semen without the natural union of male and female:
   wherefore such sins are called 'sins against nature.' But if it is by
   accident that generation cannot follow from the emission of the semen,
   the act is not against nature on that account, nor is it sinful; the
   case of the woman being barren would be a case in point.

   Likewise it must be against the good of man for the semen to be emitted
   under conditions which, allowing generation to ensue, nevertheless bar
   the due education of the offspring. We observe that in those animals,
   dogs for instance, in which the female by herself suffices for the
   rearing of the offspring, the male and female stay no time together
   after the performance of the sexual act. But with all animals in which
   the female by herself does not suffice for the rearing of the
   offspring, male and female dwell together after the sexual act so long
   as is necessary for the rearing and training of the offspring. This
   appears in birds, whose young are incapable of finding their own food
   immediately they are hatched: for since the bird does not suckle her
   young with milk, according to the provision made by nature in
   quadrupeds, but has to seek food abroad for her young, and therefore
   keep them warm in the period of feeding, the female could not do this
   duty all alone by herself: hence divine providence has put in the male
   a natural instinct or standing by the female for the rearing of the
   brood. Now in the human species the female is clearly insufficient of
   herself for the rearing of the offspring, since the need of human life
   makes many demands, which cannot be met by one parent alone. Hence the
   fitness of human life requires man to stand by woman after the sexual
   act is done, and not to go off at once and form connexions with any one
   he meets, as is the way with fornicators. Nor is this reasoning
   traversed by the fact of some particular woman having wealth and power
   enough to nourish her offspring all by herself: for in human acts the
   line of natural rectitude is not drawn to suit the accidental variety
   of the individual, but the properties common to the whole species.
   [758]

   A further consideration is, that in the human species the young need
   not only bodily nutrition, as animals do, but also the training of the
   soul. Other animals have their natural instincts (suas prudentias) to
   provide for themselves: but man lives by reason, which [read quam]
   takes the experience of a long time to arrive at discretion. Hence
   children need instruction by the confirmed experience of their parents:
   nor are they capable of such instruction as soon as they are born, but
   after a long time, the time in fact taken to arrive at the years of
   discretion. For this instruction again a long time is needed; and then
   moreover, because of the assaults of passion, whereby the judgement of
   prudence is thwarted, there is need not of instruction only, but also
   of repression. For this purpose the woman by herself is not competent,
   but at this point especially there is requisite the concurrence of the
   man, in whom there is at once reason more perfect to instruct, and
   force more potent to chastise. Therefore in the human race the
   advancement of the young in good must last, not for a short time, as in
   birds, but for a long period of life. Hence, whereas it is necessary in
   all animals for the male to stand by the female for such time as the
   father's concurrence is requisite for bringing up of the progeny, it is
   natural for man to be tied to the society of one fixed woman for a long
   period, not a short one. This social tie we call marriage. Marriage
   then is natural to man, and an irregular connexion outside of marriage
   is contrary to the good of man; and therefore fornication must be
   sinful.

   Nor yet should it be counted a slight sin for one to procure the
   emission of the semen irrespective of the due purpose of generation and
   rearing of issue, on the pretence that it is a slight sin, or no sin at
   all, to apply any part of one's body to another use than that to which
   it is naturally ordained, as if, for example, one were to walk on his
   hands, or do with his feet something that ought to be done with his
   hands. The answer is that by such inordinate applications as those
   mentioned the good of man is not greatly injured: but the inordinate
   emission of the semen is repugnant to the good of nature, which is the
   conservation of the species. [759] Hence, after the sin of murder,
   whereby a human nature already in actual existence is destroyed, this
   sort of sin seem to hold the second place, whereby the generation of
   human nature is precluded.

   The above assertions are confirmed by divine authority. The
   unlawfulness of any emission of semen, upon which offspring cannot be
   consequent, is evident from such texts as these: Thou shalt not lie
   with mankind as with womankind: Thou shalt not lie with any beast
   (Levit. xviii, 22, 23): Nor the effeminate, nor sodomites, shall
   possess the kingdom of God (1 Cor. vi, 10). The unlawfulness of
   fornication and of all connexion with any other woman than one's own
   wife is clear from Deut. xxiii, 17: There shall be no whore among the
   daughters of Israel, nor whoremonger among the sons of Israel: Keep
   thyself from all fornication, and beyond thine own wife suffer not the
   charge of knowing another (Job. iv, 13): Fly fornication (1 Cor. vi,
   18).

   Hereby is refuted the error of those who say that there is no more sin
   in the emission of the semen than in the ejection of other superfluous
   products from the body.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [756] Fornication is said to be 'simple,' when neither of the parties
   is married. -- There is plain speaking in this chapter, but it contains
   "a godly and wholesome doctrine, and necessary for our times." There
   would be less sin, if there were a little more plain speaking to
   persons under temptation.

   [757] This saying should be noted by all moralists. It means that
   ethics must stand on rational, and not on mere theological grounds. The
   theological argument should supervene upon the ethical, and complete
   its force: but ethics are not theology, as air is not sunlight.

   [758] This is the scholastic form of the principle of general
   consequences.

   [759] In any community in which the inordinate practice here mentioned
   is carried on without scruple or remorse, the race is sure to suffer
   for it. Historians do not dwell on this unsavoury topic: but the
   inordination in question was the ruin of the Greek race, politically,
   socially, and physically.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXXIII--That Marriage ought to be Indissoluble

   LOOKING at the matter rightly, one must see that the aforesaid reasons
   not only argue a long duration for that natural human partnership of
   male and female, which we call marriage, but further imply that the
   partnership ought to be lifelong.

   1. Property is a means to the preservation of human life. And because
   natural life cannot be preserved in one and the same person of the
   father living on for all time, nature arranges for its preservation by
   the son succeeding his father in likeness of species: wherefore it is
   appropriate that the son should succeed his father in his property. It
   is natural therefore that the father's interest in his son should
   continue to the end of his life, and that father and mother should
   dwell together to the end. [760]

   2. Woman is taken into partnership with man for the need of
   childbearing: therefore when the fertility and beauty of woman ceases,
   there is a bar against her being taken up by another man. If then a
   man, taking a woman to wife in the time of her youth, when beauty and
   fertility wait upon her, could send her away when she was advanced in
   years, he would do the woman harm, contrary to natural equity.

   3. It is manifestly absurd for the woman to be able to send away the
   man, seeing that woman is naturally subject to the rule of man, and it
   is not in the power of a subject to run away from control. It being
   then against the order of nature for the woman to be allowed to desert
   the man, if the man were allowed to desert the woman, the partnership
   of man and woman would not be on fair terms, but would be a sort of
   slavery on the woman's side.

   4. Men show a natural anxiety to be sure of their own offspring; and
   whatever stands in the way of that assurance runs counter to the
   natural instinct of the race. But if the man could send away the woman,
   or the woman the man, and form a connexion with another, certainty as
   to parentage would be difficult, when a woman had intercourse first
   with one man and then with another.

   5. The greater the love, the more need for it to be firm and lasting.
   But the love of man and woman is counted strongest of all; seeing that
   they are united, not only in the union of the sexes, which even among
   beasts makes a sweet partnership, but also for the sharing in common of
   all domestic life, as a sign whereof a man leaves even father and
   mother for the sake of his wife (Gen. ii, 24). It is fitting therefore
   for marriage to be quite indissoluble.

   6. Of natural acts, generation alone is directed to the good of (the
   specific) nature: for eating and the separation from the body of other
   excretions concern the individual, but generation has to do with the
   preservation of the species. Hence, as law is instituted for the common
   good, the function of procreation ought to be regulated by laws divine
   and human. Now the laws laid down ought to proceed on the basis of the
   dictate of nature (ex naturali instinctu), if they are human laws, as
   in the exact sciences every human discovery takes its origin from
   principles naturally known: but if they are divine laws, they not only
   develop the dictate of nature, but also make up the deficiency of what
   nature dictates, as dogmas divinely revealed surpass the capacity of
   natural reason. Since then there is in the human species a natural
   exigency for the union of male and female to be one and indivisible,
   such unity and indissolubility must needs be ordained by human law. To
   that ordinance the divine law adds a supernatural reason, derived from
   the significancy of marriage as a type of the inseparable union of
   Christ with His Church, which is one as He is one. [761] Thus then
   irregularities in the act of generation are not only contrary to the
   dictate of nature, but are also transgressions of laws divine and
   human: [762] hence on this account any irregular behaviour in this
   matter is even a greater sin than in the matter of taking food or the
   like. But since all other factors in human life should be subordinate
   to that which is the best thing in man, it follows that the union of
   male and female must be regulated by law, not from the mere point of
   view of procreation, as in other animals, but also with an eye to good
   manners, or manners conformable to right reason, as well for man as an
   individual, as also for man as a member of a household or family, or
   again as a member of civil society. Thus understood, good manners
   involve the indissolubility of the union of male and female: for they
   will love one another with greater fidelity, when they know that they
   are indissolubly united: each partner will take greater care of the
   things of the house, reflecting that they are to remain permanently in
   possession of the same things: occasions of quarrels are removed, that
   might otherwise arise between the husband and the wife's relations, if
   the husband were to divorce his wife; and thus affinity becomes a
   firmer bond of amity: also occasions of adultery are cut off, occasions
   which would readily offer themselves, if husband could divorce his
   wife, or wife her husband. [763]

   Hence it is said: But I say to you that whoever putteth away his wife,
   except for fornication, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; and
   he that marrieth her that is put away, committeth adultery (Matt. xix,
   9): But to them that are united in marriage, it is not I that give
   commandment, but the Lord, that the wife depart not from her husband (1
   Cor. vii, 10).

   Divorce was reckoned an impropriety also among the ancient Romans, of
   whom Valerius Maximus (De memor. dictis, II, 1) relates that they
   believed that the marriage tie ought not to be broken off even for
   barrenness. [764]

   Hereby the custom is banned of putting away wives, which however in the
   Old Law was permitted to the Jews for their hardness of heart, because
   they were prone to the killing of their wives: so the less evil was
   permitted to keep out the greater.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [760] If the family is a good thing, and family property a good thing,
   divorce must be an evil thing, as dissolving the family.

   [761] Eph. v, 22-33. See Ethics and Natural Law, p. 276: Political and
   Moral Essays, pp. 287-289.

   [762] This distinction between the dictate (or exigency) of nature, and
   the divine law, answering to what Cardinal Newman calls " the critical
   and the judicial function of conscience" (Grammar of Assent pp.
   102-107), is of the first importance in the theory of morals. I have
   endeavoured to bring it out elsewhere: Ethics and Natural Law, pp.
   109-125. St Thomas speaks of the divine law' as known in the Jewish and
   Christian revelation. In a 'state of pure nature,' without revelation,
   we should have had to argue a priori that God must have willed to
   ratify the exigences of human nature and natural reason, and command
   their observance. What those exigences of nature are see Chap. CXXIX.

   [763] Carried down to our own time, St Thomas' words come to this, that
   to make adultery a legal ground of divorce is to set a premium on
   adultery.

   [764] In the Latin editions this remark appears in the next chapter. I
   have restored it to the chapter to which it evidently belongs. I know
   of no historical evidence to show that the Jews were "prone to the
   killing of their wives."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXXIV--That Marriage ought to be between one Man and one Woman

   ONE general reason holds for all animals, which is this, that every
   animal desires free enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual union as of
   eating: which freedom is impeded by there being either several males to
   one female, or the other way about: and therefore animals fight alike
   for food and for sexual jealousy. But in men there is a special reason,
   inasmuch as man naturally desires to be sure of his own offspring. But
   here a difference comes in. Both of the above mentioned reasons hold
   for the case of the cohabitation of one female with several males: but
   the second reason does not hold against the cohabitation of one male
   with several females, -- I mean certainty in point of parentage is not
   in that case prevented. But the first reason makes against it: for as
   the free enjoyment of the female is taken from the male, if the female
   has another partner, so the same free enjoyment is taken from the
   female, if the male has more than one partner.

   2. In every species of animal in which the sire takes any interest in
   the offspring, one male keeps company with one female only, as in all
   birds that rear their young in common: for one male could not avail for
   several females as a helper in the rearing of their progeny: whereas in
   animals in which the males take no interest in the offspring, one male
   consorts with several females promiscuously, and the female with
   several males, as appears in dogs, poultry, and the like. [765] But the
   male's interest in the offspring is greater in the human species than
   in any other. [766]

   3 and 4. The reason why a wife is not allowed more than one husband at
   a time is because otherwise paternity would be uncertain. If then while
   the wife has one husband only, the husband has more than one wife,
   there will not be a friendship of equality on both sides, friendship
   consisting in a certain equality. There will not be the friendship of a
   free man with a free woman, but a sort of friendship of a slave with
   her master. The husband might well be allowed a plurality of wives, if
   the understanding were allowable, that the friendship of each with him
   was not to be that of a free woman with a free man but of a slave with
   her master. And this is borne out by experience: for among men that
   keep many wives the wives are counted as menials.

   5. From one man having several wives there arises discord at the
   domestic hearth, as experience shows.

   Hence it is said: They shall be two in one flesh (Gen. ii, 24).

   [765] Except where man takes interest in the offspring, and sets limits
   to a promiscuity which in all animals, man himself included, makes
   against the improvement of the stock.

   [766] Evolutionists at any rate ought not to reject this method of
   argument from the lower animals to man. If animal species, man
   included, develop at all, they develop towards monogamy.

   CHAPTER CXXV--That Marriage ought not to take place between Kindred

   SINCE in marriage there is a union of different persons, those persons
   who ought to reckon themselves as one because of their being of one
   stock, are properly excluded from intermarrying, that they may love one
   another more ardently on the mere ground of their common origin. [767]

   2. Since the intercourse of man and wife carries with it a certain
   natural shame, those persons should be prevented from such intercourse
   who owe one another a mutual reverence on account of the tie of blood.
   And this is the reason touched on in Leviticus xviii.

   3. Excessive indulgence in sexual pleasures makes for the corruption of
   good manners: for such pleasures of all others most absorb the mind and
   hinder the right exercise of reason. But such excessive indulgence
   would ensue, if the intercourse of the sexes were allowed among persons
   who must necessarily dwell under the same roof, where the occasion of
   such intercourse could not be withdrawn.

   5. In human society the widening of friendships is of the first
   importance. That is done by the marriage tie being formed with
   strangers. [768]

   It is to be observed that as that inclination is natural,' which works
   upon objects as they usually occur, so law too is framed for what
   usually happens. Thus it is no derogation from the reasons above
   alleged, that in some particular case the venture may turn out
   otherwise: for the good of the individual ought to be overlooked in
   view of the good of the many, since the good of the multitude is ever
   more divine than the good of the individual. [769] Lest however any
   particular complaint might remain wholly without remedy, there rests
   with legislators and others on like footing authority to dispense in a
   general enactment so far as is necessary in a particular case. If the
   law is human, a dispensation may be given by men possessed of power
   like to that which made the law. If the law is a divine enactment, a
   dispensation may be given by divine authority, as in the Old Law a
   dispensatory indulgence seems to have been granted for plurality of
   wives, and for concubines, and divorce. [770]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [767] The idea is that two sources of affection ought not to be
   intermixed: the intermixture may be the spoiling of them both.

   [768] St Thomas fails to draw the argument from the dreadful
   physiological effects of endogamy, or breeding in.'

   [769] Cf. note, p. 284. The words next following must have been much in
   evidence, when Henry VIII was vexing the Universities with the
   question, whether the prohibition in Leviticus xviii, 16, from which
   Julius II had dispensed him, was merely human, at least under the New
   Law, or divine, and therefore beyond the competence of papal dispensing
   power.

   [770] This dispensation,' frequently mentioned by St Thomas, seems to
   have been nothing more than paresin hamartematon, that overlooking of
   (what in a more perfect stage of society would have been) sins,
   mentioned by St Paul (Rom. iii, 25, where, because the text is much
   misunderstood, I am compelled to refer to my Notes on St Paul h.l.).
   This overlooking appears again in Acts xvii, 30 (huperidon); and is
   referred to in Romans v, 13: Sin is not imputed when there is no law.
   At the time spoken of there was no perfect law, either revealed or
   natural, because a very rude society could not bear such perfection. I
   may refer to Aquinas Ethicus, I, 284, 301: Political and Moral Essays,
   pp. 184-188: and the conference on Progressive Morality in Oxford and
   Cambridge Conferences, Second Series, pp. 203-214. I make these
   somewhat egotistic references, because among Catholics the science of
   morals is handled sometimes as law, with canons and authorities;
   sometimes as an exact science, like mathematics, lying out of the
   category of time; seldom with much regard to history and anthropology,
   aspects which have opened out so widely since St Thomas' day.

   CHAPTER CXXVI--That not all Sexual Intercourse is Sin

   THE members of the body being the instruments of the soul, the end of
   every member is the use of it, as in the case of any other instrument.
   But there are members of the body the use of which is for the
   intercourse of the sexes: that therefore is their end. But that which
   is the end of any natural thing cannot be in itself evil, because the
   things of nature are ordinances of divine providence. Therefore the
   intercourse of the sexes cannot be in itself evil.

   3. Natural inclinations are put into things by God, who is the prime
   mover of all. Therefore it is impossible for the natural inclination of
   any species to be directed to an object in itself evil. But in all
   full-grown animals there is a natural inclination to sexual union,
   which union therefore cannot be in itself evil.

   4. That without which something good and excellent cannot be, is not in
   itself evil. [771] But the perpetuity of the species in animals is not
   preserved except through generation, which is of sexual intercourse.

   Hence it is said: She sinneth not, if she marry (1 Cor. vii, 36).

   Hereby is excluded the error of those who totally condemn marriage,
   which some do because they believe that temporal things proceed not
   from a good but from an evil principle. [772]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [771] It is not evil in itself,' that is, not absolutely, universally,
   and under all circumstances. Neither is it universally and under all
   circumstances good; but where there is a good, of nature established,
   there is somehow, and under some conditions, a natural and good way of
   attaining to that good; and where there is for all men but one way of
   attaining that good, the said way cannot be evil for ever and for all.

   [772] He means the Manicheans. There is a Manichean sentiment lurking
   in some souls, as though the intercourse of the sexes were a necessary
   evil, only permissible because inevitable, but a bad act in itself.
   They should take to heart St Augustine's saying: "He does not perfectly
   believe in Thee, O Lord, who objects to any creature that Thou hast
   made."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXXVII--That of no Food is the Use Sinful in itself

   EVERYTHING is done rationally, when it is directed according to its due
   bearing upon a due end. But the due end of the taking of food is the
   preservation of the health by nourishment. Therefore whatever food can
   serve that end, may be taken without sin.

   2. Of no thing is the use evil in itself unless the thing itself be
   evil in itself. [773] But no food is in its nature evil; because
   everything is in its nature good (Chap. [420]VII); albeit some
   particular food may be evil to some particular person, inasmuch as it
   makes against his bodily health. Therefore of no food, considered as
   such and such a thing, is the partaking a sin in itself: but it may be
   a sin, if a person uses it irrationally and not to his health.

   3. To apply things to the purpose for which they exist is not in itself
   evil. But plants exist for the sake of animals, some animals for the
   sake of others, and all for the sake of man (Chap. [421]LXXXI).
   Therefore to use either plants, or the flesh of animals, either for
   eating, or for any other purpose for which they are useful to man (vel
   ad quidquid aliud sunt homini utilia), is not in itself a sin.

   4. The defect which makes sin redounds from soul to body, but not
   backwards from body to soul: for by sin we mean a disorder of the will.
   But articles of food concern the body immediately, not the soul.
   Therefore the taking of various foods cannot be in itself a sin, except
   in so far as it is inconsistent with rectitude of will. And that may
   come to be in several ways: in one way by some inconsistency with the
   proper end of food, as when for the pleasure of eating one uses food
   that disagrees with health either in kind or in quantity. Another way
   would be when the food becomes not the condition of him who eats it, or
   of the society in which he lives, as when one is more nice in his food
   than his means will allow, or violates the social conventions of those
   with whom he sits at table. A third way would be in the case of certain
   foods prohibited by some special law: thus in the Old Law sundry meats
   were forbidden for what they signified; and in Egypt of old the eating
   of beef was prohibited, lest agriculture should suffer; [774] and again
   there is the case of rules prohibiting the use of certain foods in
   order to check the lower appetites. [775]

   Hence the Lord says: Not what entereth in at the mouth defiles a man
   (Matt. xv, 11). [776] Since eating and the intercourse of the sexes are
   not things in themselves unlawful, and exterior possessions are
   necessary for getting food, for rearing and supporting a family, and
   other bodily wants, it follows that neither is the possession of wealth
   in itself unlawful, provided the order of reason be observed, -- I
   mean, provided the man possesses justly the things that he has, and
   does not fix the final end of his will in them, [777] and uses them
   duly for his own and others' profit.

   Hereby is excluded the error of some, who, as Augustine says, "most
   arrogantly called themselves Apostolics, because they did not receive
   into their communion married men and proprietors, such as are many
   monks and clerks whom the Catholic Church now contains: these people
   are heretics, because, separating themselves from the Church, they
   think that there is no hope for other persons who make use of what they
   do without" (De haeresibus, c. 40). [778]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [773] e.g., obscene language, or a bad book.

   [774] "The male line, if clean, and the male calves, are used for
   sacrifice by the Egyptians universally; but the females they are not
   allowed to sacrifice, since they are sacred to Isis" (Herodotus, ii,
   41). Rawlinson says, "in order to prevent the breed of cattle being
   diminished: but some mysterious reason being assigned for it, the
   people were led to respect an ordinance which might not otherwise have
   been attended to." He quotes Porphyry, De abstin. ii, 11, who doubtless
   was St Thomas's authority. The sacrifice and eating of bull beef in
   Egypt is described by Herodotus, ii, 40.

   [775] Such rules are the Church laws of fasting and abstinence, and the
   rules of several religious orders. They are positive enactments only,
   not inherent in the nature of things, and therefore dispensable.

   [776] See further 1 Cor. viii: 1 Cor. x, 19-28: Rom. xiv: 1 Tim. iv, 3,
   4. These passages are interesting to the moralist, as showing the
   incidental binding force of public sentiment, creating a new
   obligation. There are some remarks on the value of sentiment in ethics
   in Political and Moral Essays, pp. 279-281.

   [777] According to Aristotle, Politics, i, 9, whatever we desire as a
   final end, and not merely as a means, we desire without end or measure.
   Thus to desire wealth is to make a god of Mammon, as some do of
   pleasure (Matt. vi, 24: Phil. iii, 18), and consequently to stick at
   nothing that can safely procure it: it is to be the slave of money. Cf.
   St Paul's expressions, Rom. vi, 16-20, and the phrase in Thucydides i,
   81, douleuein te ge, to be the slaves of one's land,' i.e., to be ready
   to make any unpatriotic sacrifice to save one's estates.

   [778] This curious passage is in the Liber de haeresibus, printed as
   the genuine work of St Augustine in Tom. viii of the Maurist edition.
   St Athanasius, Ep. ad Dracont., mentions married monks, though they
   probably were the exception. The enforcement of clerical celibacy
   originally went no further than a prohibition of marriage subsequent to
   ordination. Such a marriage came readily to fall under the prohibition
   of a second marriage, which underlies the phrase husband of one wife, 1
   Tim. iii, 2. Like some other things in the Church, clerical and
   monastic celibacy developed in time from a gospel germ (Matt. xix) and
   apostolic practice (1 Cor. vii, 7).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXXVIII--How the Law of God relates a man to his Neighbour

   OF all things that man makes use of, the chief are other men. Man is
   naturally a social animal, needing many things that the individual
   cannot procure by himself. The divine law therefore must needs instruct
   man to live according to the order of reason in his relations with
   other men.

   2. The end of the divine law is to bring man to cleave to God. Now man
   is aided thereto by his fellow-man, as well in point of knowledge as in
   point of affection: for men help one another in the knowledge of the
   truth, and one incites another to good and restrains him from evil.
   Hence it is said: Iron is sharpened by iron, and man sharpens the face
   of his friend (Prov. xxvii, 17): Better two together than one, etc.
   (Eccles iv, 9-12).

   There is then orderly concord amongst men, when to each there is
   rendered his own, which is the act of justice; and therefore it is
   said: The work of justice is peace (Isa. xxxii, 17). To the observance
   of this justice man is inclined both by an interior and an exterior
   principle. By an interior principle, in so far as a man has a will to
   observe the precepts of the divine law, which is done by his bearing
   love to God and to his neighbour: for whoever loves another renders him
   his due spontaneously and with pleasure, and even acts more by
   liberality: hence the whole fulfilment of the law hinges upon love
   (Rom. xiii, 10: Matt. xxii, 40). But because some are not so inwardly
   disposed as to do of their own accord what the law commands, they have
   to be dragged by an exterior force to the fulfilment of the justice of
   the law; and so they fulfil the law under fear of penalties, not as
   freemen but as slaves. Hence it is said: When thou shalt do thy
   judgements upon the earth by punishing the wicked, the inhabitants of
   earth shall learn justice (Isa. xxvi, 9). Others are so disposed as to
   do of their own accord what the law bids them. They are a law to
   themselves, having charity, which bends their wills in place of a law
   to generous conduct. There was no need of an exterior law being enacted
   for them: hence it is said: The law was not made for the just, but for
   the unjust: which is not to be taken to mean that the just are not
   bound to fulfil the law, as some have misunderstood the text, but that
   the just are inclined of themselves to do justice even without a law.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXXIX--That the things commanded by the Divine Law are Right,
   not only because the Law enacts them, but also according to Nature

   BY the precepts of the divine law the human mind is subordinated to
   God, and all the rest of man is subordinated to reason. But this is
   just what natural order requires, that the inferior be subject to the
   superior. Therefore the things commanded by the divine law are in
   themselves naturally right.

   2. Divine providence has endowed men with a natural tribunal of reason
   (naturale judicatorium rationis), to be the ruling principle of their
   proper activities. But natural principles are ordained to natural
   purposes. There are certain activities naturally suited to man, and
   these activities are in themselves right, and not merely by positive
   law. [779]

   3. Where there is a definite nature, there must be definite activities
   proper to that nature: for the proper activity of every nature is
   consequent upon the nature. Now it is certain that men's nature is
   definite. [780] There must therefore be certain activities that in
   themselves befit man.

   4. Wherever a thing is natural to any one, any other thing also is
   natural, without which the first thing cannot be had, for nature fails
   not in necessities. But it is natural to man to be a social animal.
   Those things therefore naturally befit man, without which the
   maintenance of human society would be impossible. Such things are the
   securing to every man of his own, and abstinence from wrongdoing. Some
   points therefore of human conduct are naturally right.

   5. The use of lower creatures to meet the need of human life is a
   natural property of man. Now there is a certain measure in which the
   use of the aforesaid creatures is helpful to human life. If this
   measure is transgressed, as in the disorderly taking of food, it
   results in harm to man. There are therefore certain human acts
   naturally appropriate, and others naturally inappropriate.

   6. In the natural order man's body is for his soul, and the lower
   powers of the soul for reason. It is therefore naturally right for man
   so to manage his body and the lower faculties of his soul as that the
   act and good of reason may least of all be hindered, but rather helped.
   Mismanagement in this regard must naturally be sinful. We count
   therefore as things naturally evil carousings and revellings and the
   disorderly indulgence of the sexual instinct, whereby the act of reason
   is impeded and subjected to the passions, which do not leave the
   judgement of the reason free.

   7. To every man those things are naturally befitting, whereby he tends
   to his natural end; and the contraries are naturally unbefitting. But
   God is the end to which man is ordained by nature (Chap. [422]CXV).
   Those things therefore are naturally right, whereby man is led to the
   knowledge and love of God; and the contraries are naturally evil for
   man.

   Hence it is said: The judgements of the Lord are righteous, having
   their justification in themselves (Ps. xviii, 10).

   Hereby is excluded the tenet of those who say that things just and
   right are the creation of positive law.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [779] The term right may be taken in two senses: (1) as the
   contradictory of wrong, thus it means not wrong, but permissible. So it
   is right to wear a red waistcoat. Positive laws can command nothing
   which is not right to begin with, in this sense. (2) Right may mean
   requisite, incumbent upon human nature as such, and requiring to be
   made obligatory upon all, e.g., sobriety and the payment of debts. This
   sense of right includes the former sense and adds to it. The law
   commanding such right is not called positive but natural law. St Thomas
   calls it divine law, meaning the natural law as revealed. Right in this
   chapter is right in the second sense of the term.

   [780] This is precisely what Nominalism denies, or ignores. Nominalism
   eradicates the conception of nature' (phusis), and reduces everything
   to convention' (nomos). This chapter, an admirable one, containing the
   very pith and marrow of moral philosophy, is written against the
   Nominalists. It tells against Hobbes. For its importance see notes, pp.
   261, 286, with the text corresponding [3.97 and 3.123].
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXXX--That the Divine Government of Men is after the manner of
   Paternal Government

   THE father has care of the child, not only in his relations with other
   men, as the king has care of him, but also in his individual concerns,
   as has been shown above of God (Chap. [423]XCIII). And this with good
   reason, for a parent is like God in giving natural origin to a human
   being. Hence divine and paternal government extend to the individual,
   not merely as a member of society, but as a person subsisting in his
   own nature by himself. The two governments differ however in this, that
   paternal government can extend only to the things that appear in man
   externally, but divine government reaches also to interior acts and
   dispositions. For no man can take cognisance of things hidden from him:
   the secrets of hearts are hidden from men, though open to God (B. I,
   Chap. [424]LIX). God therefore takes account of man not only as to his
   exterior behaviour, but also as to his inward affections, what he means
   to do, and what he intends to gain by doing it. Of such points man
   takes no cognisance, except so far as by outward acts the inward
   disposition is shown. [781]

   Every one has care of things according as they belong to him: for
   solicitude about things that are no affair of yours is blamed as
   meddlesomeness. But one man belongs to another's charge otherwise than
   as he belongs to God. One man belongs to another either by natural
   origin and bodily descent, or by some combination in external works.
   But man belongs to God inasmuch as he has his origin from Him, which
   origin means a certain likeness to God: for every being acts to the
   production of its own likeness. Now man has more of the likeness of God
   in his soul than in his body, and most of all in his mind. [782]
   Clearly therefore, in the origin of man as coming from God, the main
   thing intended is the mind, and for the mind's sake the other
   (sentient) parts of the soul are produced by God; and for the soul the
   body is produced: so God's principal care is for the mind of man, --
   first, for the mind; then for the other parts of the soul, and after
   them for the body. Hence it is by the mind that man attains his last
   end, which is human happiness (Chap. [425]XXXVII). Other things in man
   serve as instruments for the securing of happiness. Hence we may
   observe that human government takes cognisance of interior acts so far
   as they are directed to external conduct and are thereby unfolded to
   view: [783] but God contrariwise takes cognisance of external conduct
   so far as it points to interior dispositions, particularly in regard of
   the mind, whereby man is capable of happiness, -- human happiness
   consisting, as has been said, in the fruition of God. The whole care
   therefore that God has of man is in view of preparing his mind for the
   fruition of God, whereunto the mind is prepared by faith, hope and
   charity: [784] for by faith man's mind is disposed to recognise God as
   a Being above himself: by hope it is strengthened to reach out to Him
   and see in Him man's true good: by charity it fixes upon Him so as
   immovably to adhere to Him. All things that God requires of man in this
   life are referable to these three virtues.

   Hence it is said: And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God ask of
   thee, except that thou fear the Lord thy God and walk in his ways?
   (Deut. x, 12.) Now there remain faith, hope and charity, these three (1
   Cor. xiii, 13).

   But because the human mind is naturally more imperfect than other
   intellectual natures; and the more perfect a thing is, the more energy
   it shows in tending to its end; it appears that the human mind is
   naturally weaker in tending to God, the end of all, than are the higher
   minds of the angels. This weakness shows itself on two points. First,
   in the deficiency of intellectual power in the human soul, as compared
   with higher intelligences, so that it cannot go straight to
   intellectual truth as it is in itself (Chapp. [426]XLI, [427]CXIX).
   Secondly, in the obstacles that keep it back from throwing itself with
   all its force upon God; obstacles on the part of the body, which claims
   care for sustenance and repose; and again obstacles on the part of the
   lower powers of the soul, inasmuch as the excitements of phantasy and
   the perturbations of passion trouble that interior peace, which is so
   necessary for the mind freely to throw itself upon God. These obstacles
   cannot be wholly removed by man from his path, so long as he lives in
   this mortal body: for he has to attend to the things necessary for this
   mortal life, and is thereby hindered from always actually tending to
   God. But the aforesaid hindrances should be so far got under that there
   should be in man's mind an intention at least, directed to God without
   interruption; [785] and the more the mind can be even actually fixed on
   God, the more perfect will man's life be, as keeping nearer to its last
   end. And this actual fixing of the mind upon God will go to strengthen
   the intention directed towards Him, which intention must needs come to
   naught unless at times the mind be fixed upon Him actually. All the
   precepts and counsels therefore of the divine law go to furnish man
   with aids for fixing his mind on God and removing obstacles to such
   attention.

   For both these purposes man needs to live at peace and concord with his
   fellow-men. For man needs to be aided by man, as well to the
   preservation of life and limb, as also to the end that one man may
   inflame and incite and instruct another to yearn after God. In the
   absence of peace and concord, man's mind must be disquieted by
   contentions and fighting, and hindered from aspiring to God. And
   therefore the divine law has made provision for the preservation of
   peace and concord amongst men by the practice of justice. It commands
   that to every man be rendered his due, as honour to parents: that none
   be harmed or hindered in the enjoyment of the good that belongs to him,
   whether by word, -- hence the prohibition of false witness, -- or by
   deed touching his own person, -- hence the prohibition of murder, -- or
   by deed touching a person allied to him, -- hence the prohibition of
   adultery, or by deed touching his property, -- hence the prohibition of
   theft. And because God takes cognisance not only of the public but also
   of the domestic behaviour of men, the divine law has forbidden neglect
   of wife, servants, etc., which is no concern of human law.

   But it is not enough for peace and concord to be preserved among men by
   precepts of justice, unless there be a further consolidation of mutual
   love. Justice provides for men to the extent that one shall not get in
   the way of another, but not to the extent of one helping another in his
   need. One may happen to need another's aid in cases in which none is
   bound to him by any debt of justice, or where the person so bound does
   not render any aid. Thus there came to be need of an additional precept
   of mutual love amongst men, so that one should aid another even beyond
   his obligations in justice.

   Hence it is said: His commandment we have received, that whoever loveth
   God should also love his brother (1 John iv, 21): This is my
   commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you (John xv,
   12).

   It is evident that love suffices for the fulfilment of the works of
   justice. Hence it is said: Love is the fulfilment of the law (Rom.
   xiii, 10): to commend which fulfilment there are given us precepts and
   counsels of God concerning works of mercy, love and succour of enemies,
   and the like deeds of kindness, which overflow and run over the
   measures of justice.

   But because the aforesaid precepts of justice require their completion
   in the love of one's neighbour, and that depends on the love of God;
   and when love is gone, and faith and charity are also gone, the human
   mind cannot duly tend to God; it follows that the observance of the
   precepts of the aforesaid virtues is necessarily required of man, and
   by the neglect of them man is entirely thrown out of his subordination
   to God. Now human life takes its denomination from the end to which it
   is directed. They who constitute their last end in pleasures are said
   to lead a life of pleasure. They who constitute their last end in the
   contemplation of truth are said to lead a contemplative life: hence
   whosoever constitute their last end in the enjoyment of God, their life
   is an adherence to God, which is absolutely the life of man, for to
   that end man is naturally ordained (Chap. [428]XXXVII). On other ends
   man's life is dependent only in a qualified sense, inasmuch as such
   ends are not imposed on man by nature, but by his own choice. [786]
   Death then being the opposite of life, it is a sort of death to a man
   to drop out of the order which has its last term in God. [787] Hence
   the sins whereby a man breaks away from such order are called mortal,'
   or deadly' sins; and those instructions of the law whereby men are held
   to their engagements of justice, charity, hope, and faith, are called
   commandments,' or prohibitions,' because they are to be of necessity
   observed.

   As one necessary condition for the flight of the mind to God is peace
   with neighbours, with whom man has to live in society and be aided by
   them, so another necessary condition is peace and good order of the
   elements within man himself. We observe that there are two ways in
   which the free flight of the mind to God may be hindered. One way is by
   the intensification of the acts of the lower powers. When one power
   comes vigorously into action, it draws to itself the interest of man,
   which cannot be scattered over many objects simultaneously: hence
   another power must be either stopped from acting or have its activity
   diminished. By the lower powers I mean the sentient powers, as well
   apprehensive, namely, the external and internal senses, the phantasy
   and other attendant powers, [788] as also appetitive, as the irascible
   and concupiscible faculties. [789] Hence when there is strong delight
   in sense, or much excitement of phantasy, or an inclination of the
   concupiscible or of the irascible faculty to their several objects, the
   mind must necessarily be impeded in its act of ascent to God.

   In another way the movement of the mind to God may be hindered on the
   part of the mind itself, by its occupation with other things: for one
   power cannot be in perfect activity over several objects
   simultaneously.

   But since the mind at times uses the inferior powers as obedient
   instruments, and can occupy itself with several objects, when they all
   bear upon one and all help to apprehend that one, we must understand
   that the mind is then only hindered from its flight to God by the lower
   powers, or by its own occupation with other objects, when those powers
   or those objects bear not at all on the mind's movement to God:
   otherwise, far from being hindrances, they may be positive helps to the
   free flight of man's mind to his Creator. [790]

   Indeed man cannot altogether avoid occupying his mind about other
   things, by the fact that he must be solicitous about the necessaries of
   his bodily life. There are however among men various degrees of this
   solicitude. The first degree of solicitude extends just so far as the
   common measure of human life requires. It involves the providing of
   necessaries for self, wife, children, and other persons belonging to
   oneself according to one's state. This degree of solicitude is lawful,
   and may be said to be connatural to man. [791]

   The second degree is reached when a man is more solicitous about the
   aforesaid things of the body than the common measure of human life
   requires according to his state, without however this solicitude going
   so far as to withdraw him from his subordination to God, or making him
   transgress the commandments of justice and charity. There is evidently
   sin in this, since the man exceeds his proper measure; yet not mortal
   sin, since he undertakes nothing contrary to the precepts of justice
   and charity. His sin is called venial,' as being readily pardonable,'
   -- as well because, for one who keeps his face set towards his last
   end, any error that he may make is easily put straight, -- thus in
   speculative sciences any one who has a true conception of principles
   may thereby easily correct such errors as he may fall into in drawing
   conclusions; and the end in view in the things of action is like the
   first principle in things of speculation, -- as also because to one
   steady in friendship any delinquency is readily forgiven, -- as also
   because it is no easy matter absolutely to observe due measure and
   exceed in nothing. Hence whoever does not cast away from his heart the
   rule of reason, which is laid down by the end in view, even though he
   does not altogether observe rectitude in the things which have to be
   regulated by that rule, is not over-much to be blamed, but deserves
   pardon. [792]

   The third degree is when the solicitude for temporals grows so great as
   to withdraw the soul from subordination to God, and bring it to
   transgress the commandments of justice and charity, faith and hope,
   without which man's mind cannot remain in due relation with God; and
   this is manifest mortal sin.

   The fourth degree is when contrariwise man's solicitude for worldly
   things stops short of the common measure of human life. If this is
   owing to remissness and flabbiness of mind, or to any undue eagerness,
   [793] it is to be held for a base proceeding: for the transgression of
   the golden mean in either direction is blameworthy. But if lower things
   are neglected that better things may be attended to, to wit, that the
   mind may take a free flight to the things of God, this is a virtue more
   perfect than human. To teach man such perfection, there have not been
   given him commandments, but rather counsels to draw him forth and
   incite him. [794]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [781] St Thomas's words exactly define what is called in English law an
   overt act.' Overt acts apart, the maxim holds, De aeternis non judicat
   praetor. A godless morality relieves a man of responsibility for all
   the secret workings of his will, -- not that it declares them all
   right, but it removes them from the province of law and legal sanction.

   [782] The intellectual part of the soul, spoken of by Aristotle as
   divine,' is in the natural order the most godlike thing in man; and of
   that St Thomas here speaks.

   the State teaches virtue.

   [784] In other words, man lives under a supernatural providence; or, as
   St Augustine was fond of repeating to his people at Hippo: "Not for
   this world are you a Christian." Not that the interests of this world
   are to be disregarded, but they are to be kept subordinate. A momentous
   utterance, indicative of the whole policy of the Christian Church, and
   of the Church's abiding quarrel with secularism, utilitarianism, greed
   of markets, and other aberrations from the eternal goal, and even from
   the true notion of happiness on earth, as that consists in content of
   mind and heart and social charity; in lieu of which we have taken in
   exchange our ever growing armaments, our thousands of unemployed, the
   degradation of our poor, our inanities and frivolities, our mental
   unrest and unsatisfied soul-hunger.

   [785] Such an uninterrupted intention will not be actual but virtual;
   that is to say, once made, it will continue to motive conduct without
   further express advertence, as the consideration of wages motives a
   workman's toil. From intention St Thomas distinguishes attention.
   Actual attention can no more be continous than actual intention; and
   attention is nothing, if it is not actual; there is no virtual
   attention. Thus in no way can attention to God be continuous under
   ordinary conditions of humanity. We have to be satisfied with the
   virtual continuity of our intention to please God.

   [786] There is a usual Aristotelian distinction between what a man is
   by nature,' i.e. in the ordinary course of his development, and what he
   chooses' to make himself, more or less arbitrarily and eccentrically.

   [787] Man is made for God as a watch is made to keep time. Estranged
   from God, man is like a watch with the main-spring broken, which is a
   sort of dead watch.

   [788] The "other attendant powers" are the cogitative faculty (B. II,
   Chap. LX) and the memory.

   [790] Thus good church music is an aid to prayer.

   [791] What of the solicitude Writ large' in advertisements, the
   eagerness to outstrip rivals and to make a fortune, the "endless
   money-making" rebuked by Aristotle and St Thomas (Aquinas Ethicus, II,
   96, 97), now become the mainspring of human society? Such solicitude is
   not wrong in itself, but sin finds an easy passage under cover of it,
   as St Thomas goes on to say, with St Paul, 1 Tim. vi, 9, 10; cf. Luke
   viii, 14.

   [792] A venial sin must always be some particular act. Now it is not
   easy to specify and put one's finger on the particular act, whereby a
   man, once poor, but now making money fast and eagerly, "exceeds his
   proper measure," as St Thomas puts it. Like every thing else in the
   Middle Ages, differences of class, marked by differences of dress, were
   more fixed and immutable than with us. Sumptuary laws restrained the
   low-born from donning the habiliments proper to the nobility. Sumptuary
   laws are not yet quite dead. A University would take it in ill part for
   a Commoner to go about in a Master's gown. A civilian would not be
   received in society, who persisted in wearing the uniform of a
   field-marshal. St Thomas would apparently take such uppishness and
   assumption for a venial sin.

   [793] E.g., in the miser.

   [794] The ruin of a lower happiness may be sheer ruin and waste. Or it
   may be the building up of a higher.

   CHAPTER CXXXI--Of the Counsels that are given in the Divine Law

   BECAUSE the best part for man is to fix his mind on God and divine
   things, and it is impossible for man to busy himself with intense
   ardour in a number of different directions, there are given in the
   divine law counsels for enabling the human mind to take a more free
   flight to God. These counsels withdraw men from the occupations of the
   present life, so far as is possible for men still living on earth. Such
   withdrawal is not so necessary to justice as that justice cannot be
   without it: for virtue and justice is not done away with by man's
   making use of corporeal and earthly things according to the order of
   reason: therefore these admonitions of the divine law are called
   counsels, and not commandments, inasmuch as they advise a man to drop
   things less good for things that are better.

   Human solicitude busies itself about the common measure of human life
   in three chief particulars. First, about one's own person, what one is
   to do or where to live; secondly, about persons related to oneself,
   especially wife and children; thirdly, about the procurement of
   exterior things, needful for the support of life. For cutting off
   solicitude about exterior things there is given in the divine law the
   counsel of poverty, which prompts to the casting away of the things of
   this world. Hence the Lord says: If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell what
   thou hast and give to the poor, and come, follow me (Matt. xix, 21).
   For cutting off solicitude about wife and children there is given man
   the counsel of virginity, or continence. Hence it is said: About
   virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give a counsel; and,
   adding the reason of this counsel, he continues: He that is without a
   wife is solicitous for the things of the Lord, how he may please God;
   but he that is with a wife is solicitous for the things of the world,
   how he may please his wife, and is divided (1 Cor. vii, 25-33). For
   cutting off man's solicitude even about himself there is given the
   counsel of obedience, whereby a man commits the disposal of his acts to
   his superior. Therefore it is said: Obey your superiors and be subject
   to them, for they watch as having to render an account of your souls
   (Heb. xiii, 17).

   Because the highest perfection of human life consists in the mind of
   man being detached from other things and fixed on God, and the three
   counsels aforesaid seem singularly to dispose the mind to this
   detachment, we may see in them proper adjuncts of a state of
   perfection, not that they themselves constitute perfection, but
   inasmuch as they are dispositions to perfection, which consists in the
   union of the detached soul with God. This is expressly shown in the
   words of our Lord counselling poverty: If thou wilt be perfect, go,
   sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and follow me, -- where He
   places the perfection of life in the following of Him.

   They may also be called effects and signs of perfection. For when the
   mind is strongly possessed with love and desire of anything, it
   thereupon counts other things as quite secondary: so from man's mind
   being carried with fervent love and desire to divine things, wherein
   its perfection consists, the consequence is a casting off of all that
   might retard its movement to God, -- care of property, affection for
   wife and children, and even love of one's own self. This is signified
   by the words of Scripture: If a man shall give the whole substance of
   his house in exchange for love, he will account it nothing (Cant. viii,
   7): Having found one precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had,
   and acquired it (Matt. xiii, 46): the advantages that I had I
   considered as dirt, that I might gain Christ (Philip. iii, 8).

   Since then the three counsels aforesaid are dispositions to perfection,
   and effects of perfection, and signs of the same, they who make the
   three corresponding vows to God are properly said to be in a state of
   perfection. The perfection to which they dispose the mind consists in
   the free converse of the soul with God. Hence they who make profession
   of the aforesaid vows are called religious,' as dedicating themselves
   and all that is theirs to God by a manner of sacrifice, extending to
   property by poverty, to the body by continence, and to the will by
   obedience: for religion consists in the worship of God (Chap.
   [429]CXIX).

   CHAPTERS CXXXII, CXXXV--Arguments against Voluntary Poverty, with
   Replies

   THERE have been found persons to condemn voluntary poverty, thereby
   going against the teaching of the gospel, Of these Vigilantius was the
   first. He has had imitators, men making themselves out to be doctors of
   the law, not understanding either what they say or about what they
   affirm (1 Tim. i, 7). [795] They have been led by these and the like
   reasons.

   Arg. 1. Animals that cannot find the necessaries of life at any time of
   the year, have a natural instinct for gathering such necessaries at a
   time when they can be found, and laying them up, as we see in bees and
   ants. But men need many things for the preservation of their life,
   which cannot be found any time. Therefore man has a natural tendency to
   gather together and lay up such things, and it is against the law of
   nature to scatter them again.

   Reply. Still it is not necessary for every one to be busy with this
   task of gathering: as even among bees not all have the same duty, some
   gather honey, others make cells out of wax, -- to say nothing of the
   queen-bees being exempt from all such occupations. And so it must be
   with men: for many things being necessary to human life, for which one
   man by himself cannot suffice, different functions have to be
   undertaken by different men, -- some have to labour in the fields, some
   to tend cattle, and some to build. And because human life needs not
   only corporal but also spiritual aids, some have to devote themselves
   to spiritual things for the benefit of the rest; and these persons
   should be set free from the care of temporals.

   Arg. 2. As every one is bound by natural law to preserve his life, so
   also his exterior substance, as being the means whereby life is
   preserved.

   Reply. For them who relinquish temporal things there still remains
   every likelihood and hope of finding the sustenance necessary for life,
   either through their own labour, or the benefactions of others, whether
   in the shape of possessions held in common or of food daily given: for
   what we can do through our friends, in a manner we can do of ourselves,
   as the Philosopher says (Eth. Nic. VIII, xi).

   Arg. 3. Man is by nature a social animal. But society cannot be
   maintained among men except on a system of mutual aid. To take their
   part in this system of aid they render themselves incapable, who fling
   away their exterior substance.

   Reply. It is a greater thing to aid another in spirituals than in
   temporals, spiritual things being the more necessary to the end of
   final happiness. Hence he who by voluntary poverty strips himself of
   the ability to aid others in temporals, in order to the acquirement of
   spiritual good, whereby he may aid others to better advantage, does
   nothing against the good of human society.

   Arg. 4. If it is an evil thing to have worldly substance, a good thing
   to rid neighbours of evil, and an evil thing to lead them into evil, it
   follows that to give any of the substance of this world to a needy
   person is evil, and to take away such substance from him who has it is
   good: which is absurd. It is therefore a good thing to have worldly
   substance, and to fling it entirely away by voluntary poverty is evil.

   Reply. Wealth is a good thing for man, so far as it is directed to
   rational good, but not in itself: [796] hence poverty may very well be
   better than wealth, if by poverty man finds his way to a more perfect
   good.

   Arg. 5. Occasions of evil are to be shunned. But poverty is an occasion
   of evil, leading men on to thefts, flatteries, perjuries, and the like.

   Reply. Neither riches, nor poverty, nor any other exterior condition is
   of itself the good of man. Such things are good only as tending to the
   good of reason. Hence vice may arise out of any of them, when they are
   not turned to man's use according to the rule of reason. Still not for
   that are they to be accounted simply evil, but only the abuse of them
   is evil.

   Arg. 6. Virtue, lying in the mean, is spoilt by either extreme. There
   is a virtue called liberality, which consists in giving where one
   should give, and holding one's hand where one should hold it. On the
   side of defect is the vice of stinginess, which holds its hand in all
   cases indiscriminately. On the side of excess is the vice of lavish
   giving away of everything, as is done by those who embrace voluntary
   poverty, a vice akin to prodigality.

   Reply. The golden mean is not determined according to quantity of
   exterior goods, but according to the rule of reason. Hence sometimes it
   happens that what is extreme in quantity of some exterior commodity is
   the mean according to the rule of reason. There is none who tends to
   great things more than the magnanimous man, or who in expenditure
   surpasses the munificent, or princely man. [797] The rule of reason
   does not measure the mere quantity of commodity employed, but the
   condition of the person and his intention, fitness of place, time, and
   the like, also many conditions of virtue. Therefore one does not run
   counter to virtue by voluntary poverty, even though one abandon all
   things. Nor is this an act of prodigality, seeing that it is done with
   a due end and other due conditions. To expose oneself to death, under
   due conditions, is an act of fortitude and a virtue: yet that is going
   far beyond the abandonment of one's possessions.

   [795] A reference to William de Saint Amour, the great opponent of the
   religious Orders in the University of Paris, against whom St Thomas,
   about the same time that he penned these chapters, wrote also his two
   Opuscula, Against the assailants of the worship of God and religion, Of
   the perfection of religious life. As long as religious lived apart in
   monasteries and lonely places, they encountered no rivalry and their
   institute was little questioned. But the Friar Preachers and the Friar
   Minors, coming into towns and universities, soon provoked jealousy and
   set men's minds questioning the whole notion of religious life. Saint
   Amour's invective against the Friars was entitled, Perils of the latter
   days. Vigilantius was a contemporary of St Jerome, who one night in the
   year 406 sat up and finished a Liber contra Vigilantium at a sitting.

   [796] "As the various organs of the body have no function, and
   therefore no real existence apart from the living body, so particular
   good things (virtue, health, beauty, wealth) have no existence, except
   as elements of the noble life. The Idea of the Good is the unity of
   good things, and that by reason of which they are good, -- that
   definite system of order, by belonging to, and observing which,
   particular things are said to be good, rather than pleasant, or
   otherwise attractive to mere sense . . . . Nous in man, like phusis in
   the plant and animal worlds, recognises and imposes definite limits.
   Particular details are valued by it, not for themselves (for if they
   were, no limit could be assigned to their desirable multiplication) but
   for the sake of the beautiful Life which transforms them." -- Professor
   J. A. Stewart, Notes on the Nicomachean Ethics, Vol. I, p. 96, ed.
   1892.

   [797] St Thomas deals with the Aristotelian virtues of magnanimity and
   munificence in Sum. Theol. 2a-2ae, qq. 129, 134 (Aquinas Ethicus, II,
   261, 278).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTERS CXXXIII, CXXXVI--Of various Modes of Living adopted by the
   Votaries of Voluntary Poverty

   FIRST MODE. The first mode is for the possessions of all to be sold,
   and all to live in common on [the capital fund accumulated by] the
   price, as was done under the Apostles at Jerusalem: As many as had
   possessions in lands or houses sold them, and laid the price at the
   feet of the Apostles, and division was made to each according to the
   need of each (Acts iv, 34, 35).

   Criticism. It is not easy to induce many men with great possessions to
   take up this mode of life; and if the amount realised out of the
   possessions of a few rich is divided among many recipients, it will not
   last long.

   Reply. This mode will do, but not for a long time. And therefore we do
   not read of the Apostles instituting this inode of living when they
   passed to the nations among whom the Church was to take root and
   endure.

   Second Mode. To have possessions in common, sufficient to provide for
   all members of the community out of what the property brings in, as is
   done in most monasteries.

   Criticism. Earthly possessions breed solicitude, as well for the
   gathering in of the returns as also for the defence of them against
   acts of fraud and violence; and this solicitude is all the greater as
   greater possessions are required for the support of many. In this way
   then the end of voluntary poverty is defeated, at least in the case of
   many, who have the procuratorship of these possessions. Besides, common
   possession is wont to be a source of discord.

   Reply. The administration of these common possessions may be left to
   the care of one or a few persons, and the rest remain without
   solicitude for temporals, free to attend to spiritual things. Nor do
   they who undertake this solicitude for others lose any of the
   perfection of their life: for what they seem to lose by defect of quiet
   they recover in the service of charity, in which perfection consists.
   Nor is there any loss of concord by occasion of this mode of common
   possessions. For they who adopt voluntary poverty ought to be persons
   who despise temporal things; and such persons are not the men to
   quarrel over temporals.

   Third mode. To live by the labour of one's hands, as St Paul did and
   advised others to do. We have not eaten bread of any one for nothing,
   but in labour and fatigue, night and day working, not to be a burden to
   any of you: not that we had not authority to act otherwise, but to
   present ourselves to you as a model for you to imitate: for when we
   were with you, we laid down to you the rule, if any man not work,
   neither let him eat (2 Thess. iii, 8-10).

   Criticism. It seems folly for one to abandon what is necessary, and
   afterwards try to get it back again by labour. Moreover, whereas the
   end of the counsel of voluntary poverty is the readier following of
   Christ in freedom from worldly solicitudes, earning one's livelihood by
   one's own labour is a matter of more anxiety than living on the
   possessions which one had before, especially if they were a modest
   competency. And the Lord seems to forbid manual labour to His disciples
   in the text: Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do
   they reap: consider the lilies of the field how they grow, they labour
   not, neither do they spin (Matt. vi, 26, 28). Moreover this mode of
   living is inadequate. Many desire a perfect life, who have not the
   capacity for earning their livelihood by labour, not having been
   brought up thereto: also there is the possibility of sickness. And no
   little time must be spent in labour to suffice for earning a
   livelihood: many spend their whole time in labour, and yet can scarcely
   live. Thus the votaries of voluntary poverty will be hindered from
   study and spiritual exercises; and their poverty will be more of a
   hindrance than a help to the perfection of their life.

   Reply. In the case of rich men, their possessions involve solicitude in
   getting them or keeping them; and the heart of the owner is drawn to
   them; inconveniences which do not happen to one whose sole object is to
   gain his daily bread by the labour of his hands. Little time is
   sufficient, and little solicitude is necessary, for gaining by the
   labour of one's hands enough to support nature: but for gathering
   riches and superfluities, as craftsmen in the world propose, much time
   has to be spent and much solicitude shown. Our Lord in the Gospel has
   not forbidden labour of the hands, but anxiety of mind about the
   necessaries of life. He did not say, Do not labour, but, Be not
   solicitous. And this precept He enforces by an argument from less to
   greater. For if divine providence sustains birds and lilies, which are
   of inferior condition, and cannot labour at those works whereby men get
   their livelihood, much more will it provide for men, who are of
   worthier condition, and to whom it has given ability to win their
   livelihood by their own labours. It is the exception for a man not to
   be able to win enough to live upon by the labour of his hands; and an
   institution is not to be rejected for exceptional cases. The remedy is,
   for him whose labour is not enough to keep him, to be helped out either
   by others of the same society, who can make more by their labour than
   is necessary for them, or by others who are well off. Nor need those
   who are content with little spend much time in seeking a livelihood by
   the labour of their hands: so they are not much hindered from spiritual
   works, especially as in working with their hands they can think of God
   and praise Him.

   Fourth mode. To live on the alms contributed by others, who retain
   their wealth. This seems to have been the method observed by our Lord:
   for it is said that sundry women followed Christ, and ministered to him
   out of their means (Luke viii, 2, 3).

   Criticism. It seems irrational for one to abandon his own and live on
   an other's property, -- or for one to receive of another and pay him
   back nothing in return. There is no impropriety in ministers of the
   altar and preachers, to whom the people are indebted for doctrine and
   other divine gifts, receiving support at their hands: for the labourer
   is worthy of his hire, as the Lord says (Matt. x, 10); and the Apostle,
   the Lord hath ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by
   the gospel (1 Cor. ix, 14). But it is an apparent absurdity for these
   persons who minister to the people in no office to receive the
   necessaries of life from the people. Others moreover, who through
   sickness and poverty cannot help themselves, must lose their alms
   through these professors of voluntary poverty, since men neither can
   nor will succour a great multitude of poor. Moreover independence of
   spirit is particularly requisite for perfect virtue: otherwise men
   easily become partakers in other people's sins, either by expressly
   consenting to them, or by palliating or dissembling them. But this
   method of life is a great drawback to such independence, for a man
   cannot but shrink from offending one by whose patronage he lives.
   Moreover the necessity of exposing one's necessities to others, and
   begging relief, renders mendicants objects of contempt and dislike,
   whereas persons who take up a perfect life ought to be reverenced and
   loved. But if any one will praise the practice of begging as conducive
   to humility, he seems to talk altogether unreasonably. For the praise
   of humility consists in despising earthly exaltation, such as comes of
   riches, honours, fame, but not in despising loftiness of virtue, for in
   that respect we ought to be magnanimous. That then would be a
   blameworthy humility, for the sake of which any one should do anything
   derogatory to loftiness of virtue. But the practice of begging is so
   derogatory, as well because it is more virtuous to give than to
   receive, as also because there is a look of filthy lucre about it.

   Reply. There is no impropriety in him being supported by the alms of
   others, who has abandoned his own possessions for the sake of something
   that turns to the profit of others. Were this not so, human society
   could not go on. If every one busied himself only about his own
   affairs, there would be no one to minister to the general advantage.
   The best thing then for human society (hominum societati) is that they
   who neglect the care of their own interests to serve the general
   advantage, should be supported by those whose advantage they serve.
   Therefore do soldiers live on pay provided by others, and civil rulers
   are provided for out of the common fund. But they who embrace voluntary
   poverty to follow Christ, certainly abandon what they have to serve the
   common advantage, enlightening the people by wisdom, learning and
   example, or sustaining them by their prayer and intercession. Hence
   there is nothing base in their living on what they get from others,
   seeing that they make a greater return, receiving temporals and helping
   others in spirituals. Hence the Apostle says: Let your abundance in
   temporals supply their want, that their abundance in spirituals also
   may supply your want (2 Cor. viii, 14: cf. Rom. xv, 27). For he who
   abets another becomes a partner in his work, whether for good or evil.
   By their example other men become less attached to riches, seeing them
   abandon riches altogether for the sake of perfection. And the less one
   loves riches, the more ready will he be to make distribution of his
   riches in other's need: hence they who embrace voluntary poverty are
   useful to other poor people, provoking the rich to works of mercy by
   word and example. Nor do they lose their liberty of spirit for the
   little they receive from others for their sustenance. A man does not
   lose his independence except for things that become predominant in his
   affections: for things that a man despises, if they are given to him,
   he does not lose his liberty. Nor is there any unseemliness in their
   exposing their necessities, and asking what they need either for
   themselves or others. The Apostles are read to have done so (2 Cor.
   viii, ix). Such begging does not render men contemptible, if it is done
   moderately, for necessaries, not for superfluities, without
   importunity, and with due regard to the conditions of the persons
   asked, and place and time. There is no shadow of disgrace about such
   begging, though there would be, if it were done with importunity or
   without discretion.

   There is, no doubt, a certain humiliation in begging, as having a thing
   done to you is less honourable than doing it, and receiving than
   giving, and obeying royal power than governing and reigning. The
   spontaneous embracing of humiliations is a practice of humility, not in
   any and every case, but when it is done for a needful purpose: for
   humility, being a virtue, does nothing indiscreetly. It is then not
   humility but folly to embrace any and every humiliation: but where
   virtue calls for a thing to be done, it belongs to humility not to
   shrink from doing it for the humiliation that goes with it, for
   instance, not to refuse some mean service where charity calls upon you
   so to help your neighbour. Thus then where begging is requisite for the
   perfection of a life of poverty, it is a point of humility to bear this
   humiliation. Sometimes too, even where our own duty does not require us
   to embrace humiliations, it is an act of virtue to take them up in
   order to encourage others by our example more easily to bear what is
   incumbent on them: for a general sometimes will do the office of a
   common soldier to encourage the rest. Sometimes again we may make a
   virtuous use of humiliations as a medicine. Thus if any one's mind is
   prone to undue self-exaltation, he may with advantage make a moderate
   use of humiliations, either self-imposed or imposed by others, so to
   check the elation of his spirit by putting himself on a level with the
   lowest class of the community in the doing of mean offices.

   Fifth mode. There have also been some who said that the votaries of a
   perfect life should take no thought either for begging or labouring or
   laying up anything for themselves, but should exped their sustenance
   from God alone, according to the texts, Be not solicitous, and, Take no
   thought for the morrow (Matt. vi, 25, 34).

   Criticism. This seems quite an irrational proceeding. For it is foolish
   to wish an end and omit the means ordained to that end. Now to the end
   of eating there is ordained some human care of providing oneself with
   food. They then who cannot live without eating ought to have some
   solicitude about seeking their food. There follows also a strange
   absurdity: for by parity of reasoning one might say that he will not
   walk, or open his mouth to eat, or avoid a stone falling, or a sword
   striking him, but expect God to do all, which is tantamount to tempting
   God. [798]

   Reply. It is quite an irrational error to suppose that all solicitude
   about making a livelihood is forbidden by the Lord. Every action
   requires care: if then a man ought to have no solicitude about temporal
   things, it follows that he should do nothing temporal, which is neither
   a possible nor a reasonable course. For God has prescribed to every
   being actions according to the peculiarity of its nature. Man, being
   made up of a nature at once spiritual and corporeal, must by divine
   ordinance exercise bodily actions; and at the same time have spiritual
   aims; and he is the more perfect, the more spiritual his aims are. But
   it is not a mode of perfection proper to man to omit bodily action:
   bodily actions serve necessary purposes in the preservation of life;
   and whoever omits them neglects his life, which he is bound to
   preserve. To look for aid from God in matters in which one can help
   oneself by one's own action, and so to leave that action out, is a
   piece of folly and a tempting of God: for it is proper to the divine
   goodness to provide for things, not immediately by doing everything
   itself, but by moving other things to their own proper action (Chap.
   [430]LXXVII). We must not then omit the means of helping ourselves, and
   expect God to help us in defect of all action of our own: that is
   inconsistent with the divine ordinance and with His goodness.

   But because, though it rests with us to act, still that our actions
   shall attain their due end does not rest with us, owing to obstacles
   that may arise, the success that each one shall have in his action
   comes under divine arrangement. The Lord then lays it down that we
   ought not to be solicitous for what does not belong to us, that is, for
   the success of our actions: but He has not forbidden us to be
   solicitous about what does belong to us, that is, for the work which we
   ourselves do. It is not then to act against the precept of the Lord, to
   feel solicitude for the things which have to be done; but he goes
   against the precept, who is solicitous for what may turn out even when
   (etiam si) he does all that is in his power to do, and takes due
   precautions beforehand (praemittat) to meet the contingency of such
   untoward events.

   When that is done, we ought to hope in God's providence, by whom even
   the birds and herbs are sustained. [799] To feel solicitude on such
   points seems to appertain to the error of the Gentiles who deny divine
   providence. Therefore the Lord concludes that we should take no thought
   for the morrow (Matt. vi, 34), by which He has not forbidden us to lay
   up betimes things needful for the morrow; but He forbids that
   solicitude about future events which goes with a sort of despair of the
   divine assistance, as also the allowing of the solicitude that will
   have to be entertained to-morrow to come in before its time perversely
   to-day: [800] for every day brings its own solicitude; hence it is
   added, Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [798] See Sum. Theol. 2a-2ae, q. 97, Of Tempting God, where the gloss
   is quoted: "He tempts God, who, having a safe line of action open to
   him, unreasonably puts himself in danger by way of making trial of the
   possibility of a divine deliverance." It will be seen that St Thomas
   agrees with this Criticism, and makes no defence of this Fifth Mode. I
   think it likely to have been extracted from Friar Gerard's Introduction
   to the Eternal Gospel which was vehemently attacked by William of St
   Amour, and condemned also by St Thomas: indeed it is the first
   utterance of the then nascent seer of the Fraticelli. In the Breviary
   Legend of St Cajetan, the founder of Theatines, who were approved by
   Clement VII, we read: "He instituted an Order of Clerks Regular, who
   should lay aside the solicitude of all temporal things, and neither
   possess revenues, nor beg the means of subsistence from the faithful,
   but live solely on alms spontaneously offered." But as these religious
   lived in public, and their profession and mode of life was known, their
   very going about, preaching and working for souls, was a virtual appeal
   to charity. The Theatines flourished for three hundred years, and still
   had houses in Italy in 1845.

   [799] This passage is obscurely worded, and would not make English, if
   rendered literally. The text too needs correction, as I have marked

   [800] Read, ne male occupet hodie solicitudo (not solicitudinem) quae
   erit habenda in crastino. The sense of being beforehand is radical in
   the Latin occupo: e.g. Horace, Sat. I, ix, 6, numquid vis? occupo (I
   cut in with a goodbye).

   CHAPTER CXXXIV--In what the Good of Poverty consists

   LET us observe in riches what is to be thought of poverty. Exterior
   riches are necessary to the good of virtue inasmuch as by them we
   support the body and succour other people. Means to an end must derive
   their goodness from the end. Exterior riches therefore must be some
   sort of a good to man, still not a principal but a secondary good: for
   the principal good is the end, -- other things are good as subordinate
   to the end. Therefore it has been held that the virtues are the
   greatest of good things to man, and exterior riches the least. Now the
   means to any end must be checked by the requirements of that end. [801]
   Riches therefore are so far forth good as they make for the exercise of
   virtue. But if that measure is exceeded, and the exercise of virtue
   impeded by them, they are no longer to be counted among good but among
   evil things. Hence it comes about that the possession of riches is a
   good thing for some men, who turn them to a virtuous use; and an evil
   thing for other men, who thereby are withdrawn from virtue, either by
   excessive solicitude or excessive affection for their wealth, or by
   elation of mind thence arising.

   But there are virtues of the active life and virtues of the
   contemplative life; and these two orders of virtues make use of riches
   in different ways. The contemplative virtues need riches solely for the
   sustenance of nature: [802] the active virtues as well for this purpose
   as also for the further purpose of helping a neighbour. Hence the
   contemplative life is more perfect in this, that it requires fewer
   earthly aids, its attention being wholly given to divine things. Hence
   the Apostle says: Having food, and wherewith to be clothed, with these
   let us be content (1 Tim. vi, 8).

   Poverty then is praiseworthy, inasmuch as it delivers a man from the
   vices in which some men are entangled by riches. Again, inasmuch as it
   removes the solicitude that goes with wealth, it is useful to some
   persons, namely, to those who have the gift of occupying themselves
   with better things; but hurtful to others, who, set free from this
   solicitude, busy themselves about worse things. [803] But in so far as
   poverty takes away the good that comes of riches, namely, the helping
   of other people, and hinders self support, it is simply an evil, except
   in so far as the loss of the power of helping neighbours in temporals
   may be compensated by the advantage of a free attention to divine and
   spiritual things. But the good of one's own subsistence is so
   necessary, that the lack of it can be compensated by no other good: for
   on the offer of no other good should a man deprive himself of the means
   of supporting his own life. Poverty therefore is praiseworthy, when it
   delivers a man from earthly cares, and he thereby arrives to give his
   mind more freely to divine and spiritual things, yet so that he retains
   the means of lawful self-support, whereunto not much provision is
   requisite. And the less solicitude any method of poverty involves, the
   more praiseworthy is that poverty. But poverty is not more
   praiseworthy, the greater it is: [804] for poverty is not good in
   itself, but only inasmuch as it removes from a man's path the obstacles
   of his freely applying himself to spiritual things: hence the measure
   of such removal of obstacles is the measure of the goodness of poverty.
   And this is a general principle with respect to all creatures: they are
   good only in so far as they lead to virtue, not in themselves. [805]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [801] This is the great Aristotelian and Ignatian maxim, "the end in
   view prescribes limits to the means" (Politics I, ix: Spiritual
   Exercises, Fundamental Principle: also the quotation in note, p. 299).

   [802] Not also for the purchase of books and scientific instruments? or
   again for the building and furnishing of the glorious churches, which
   some contemplative Orders erect, to the glory of God, and the joy of
   men to whom it is given to see their glory?

   [803] "On the saying of Gregory, Often they who might have contemplated
   God in peace and quiet, have fallen and given way under the burden of
   occupations; and others who, had they had occupation, would have lived
   well and profitably to mankind, have perished under the sword of their
   own peace and quiet,' -- it is to be remarked that persons of strong
   passionate inclinations, which tempt them to impetuous actions, are,
   absolutely speaking, better fitted for an active life, owing to the
   restlessness of their Spirit. Hence Gregory Says: Some are so restless
   that if they get rest from labour, they labour all the more grievously,
   because the more liberty and free time they have for their own
   thoughts, the worse storms they endure in their hearts.' Others again
   have naturally a purity and peace of soul fitting them for
   contemplation; and if these persons are totally set aside for active
   occupations, they will suffer loss (Sum. Theol. 2a-2ae, q. 182, art. 4:
   Aquinas Ethicus, II, 390).

   [804] Again, probably, a remark directed against the Fraticelli. The
   reader of the Nicomachean Ethics will recognise the Aristotelianism of
   this paragraph, the "outfit sufficient for happiness."

   [805] St Thomas here speaks of moral, not of physical goodness. All
   creatures are physically good in themselves (Chap. VII); but what is
   morally good for us is not the mere having and enjoying of this or that
   particular creature, but the use that we put it to. Possessions perish
   and change hands: the credit of the use we put them to alone is
   eternal. Their works follow them (Apoc. xiv, 13).

   CHAPTER CXXXVII--Arguments against Perpetual Continence, with Replies

   ARG. 1. The good of the species is more godlike than the good of the
   individual. He then who abstains altogether from the act whereby the
   species is perpetuated, sins more than he would by abstaining from the
   act whereby the individual is preserved, namely, eating and drinking.

   Reply. Things that belong to the necessity of the individual stand on a
   different footing from things that belong to the necessity of the
   community. In the necessities of the individual, individual provision
   must be made: everyone must make use of meat and drink. But in the
   necessities of the community it is neither needful nor possible for the
   office of meeting such needs to be assigned to every individual. Many
   things are necessary to a multitude of men, which no one individual can
   attend to: therefore there must be different offices for different
   persons, as in the body the several members have their several
   functions. Since then procreation is not a necessity of the individual,
   but a necessity of the species, there is no need for all men to be
   procreants; but some men may abstain, and devote themselves to other
   offices, as to the life of a soldier or a contemplative.

   Arg. 2. By divine ordinance there are given to man members apt for
   procreation, and a force of appetite inciting him thereto: whoever then
   altogether abstains from procreation seems to resist the ordinance of
   God.

   Reply. Divine providence gives to man endowments necessary for the
   species as a whole: still there is no call upon every individual man to
   make use of every one of these endowments. Thus man has a building
   capacity and a fighting capacity: yet all men need not be builders or
   soldiers; neither need every one apply himself to procreation. [806]

   Arg. 3. If it is good for one man to lead a life of continence, it is
   better for many so to do, and the best thing of all would be for all to
   do it: so the human race would become extinct. [807]

   Reply. From things necessary to the community, though it be better for
   individuals to abstain, when one is given to better things, still it is
   not good for all to abstain. This is apparent in the order of the
   universe. Though a pure spirit is better than a bodily substance, still
   that would not be a better but a more imperfect universe, in which
   there were pure spirits alone. Though the eye is better than the foot,
   it would not be a perfect animal that had not both eye and foot. So
   neither would the state of the commonwealth of man kind be perfect,
   unless there were some applied to acts of procreation, and others
   abstaining from such acts and given to contemplation.

   Arg. 4. Chastity, like other virtues, lies in the mean. Therefore he
   acts against virtue, who altogether abstains from the gratification of
   his appetites. [808]

   Reply. This objection has been already solved in treating of poverty
   (Chapp. [431]CXXXII, CXXXV, Arg. 6). Irrational abstinence from all
   [lawful] sexual pleasures is called the vice of insensibility: but a
   rational abstinence [from all even lawful forms of such gratification]
   is a virtue exceeding the common measure of man, for it puts man in
   some sort of participation of the likeness of God. Hence virginity is
   said to be allied to angels. [809]

   But though we say in general that it is better for one individual to
   observe continence than to use marriage, it may very well be that for
   some other individual the second course is the better. Hence the Lord
   says: Not all men take this word: whoever can take, let him take (Matt.
   xix, 11, 12).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [806] No economist desires this in our time. A corrupt society is
   threatened by a precisely opposite peril.

   [807] If it is good for one man to blow a horn, it would be a good
   thing for the whole population to turn horn-blowers. -- This precious
   style of argument, by no means an uncommon style, assumes that you
   cannot have too much of a good thing; which is true of faith, hope, and
   charity, and of all ends, as such but never means (notes, pp. 290, 299,
   305). Celibacy, like poverty, is not an end in itself.

   [808] He may or may not be acting virtuously, but at least he is not
   acting against the cardinal virtue of temperance, of which chastity is
   a part. Temperance is a negative virtue: its sole office is to
   restrain: it never urges any one to any gratification of appetite: "for
   inclination to the proper objects of any faculties does not belong to
   the habit, but rather is of the very essence of the said faculties"
   (Sum. Theol. 1a-2ae q. 31, art. 1, in corp.) Cf. Arriaga De habitibus
   et virtutibus, disp. 36, nn. 4, 5, 6; and Ethics and Natural Law, pp.
   91, 95, ed. 3, a curious and little noticed point of Ethics.

   [809] Celibacy can be justified on mere natural and rational grounds in
   this sense, that no cogent reasons are apparent making it a man's duty
   under ordinary circumstances to marry. But celibacy does not amount to
   a virtue except when it is embraced on supernatural grounds, that is to
   say, on grounds of faith and love of God in Christ. The chapter next
   translated is the justification of the vow of obedience.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXXXIX--Against those who find fault with Vows

   SOME have taken it for a folly to bind oneself by vow to obey another,
   or to observe any practice: for there is more of virtue in a good act
   as there is more of freedom: hence the praiseworthiness of virtuous
   acts seems to be diminished by their being done under necessity of
   obedience or vow.

   But these cavillers seem to be ignorant of the nature of necessity. For
   there is a twofold necessity: a necessity of constraint, and this
   diminishes the praiseworthiness of virtuous acts, as telling against
   their voluntariness: for that is done under constraint, which is
   contrary to the will. There is again a necessity springing out of
   interior inclination; and this, far from diminishing, increases the
   credit of a virtuous act: for it makes the will tend to the act of
   virtue all the more earnestly. For evidently, the more perfect the
   habit of virtue is, with all the more force does it urge the will to
   the act of virtue and leaves it less chance of swerving. Nay, if it
   attains to the highest pitch of perfection, it induces a sort of
   necessity of well-doing, as will appear in the case of the Blessed, who
   cannot sin (B. IV, Chap. [432]XCII); nor yet is there anything thereby
   lost either to the freedom of the wilt or to the goodness of the act.
   There is another necessity derived from the bearing of the means on the
   end in view, as when it is said to be necessary for one to find a ship
   in order to cross the sea. But neither does this necessity diminish the
   freedom of the will or the goodness of the acts: nay rather, for one to
   act as doing something necessary to an end is in itself praiseworthy,
   and all the more praiseworthy the better the end. But it will be seen
   that the necessity of observing what one has vowed to observe, or
   obeying the superior under whom one has placed oneself, is not a
   necessity of constraint: nor again is it a necessity arising out of
   interior inclination, but out of the bearing of means on the end: for
   it is necessary for the votary to do this or that, if the vow is to be
   fulfilled, or the obedience kept. Since then these are praiseworthy
   ends, inasmuch as they are acts whereby a man submits himself to God,
   the aforesaid necessity takes off nothing from the praise of virtue.

   From yet another point of view the fulfilment of a vow, or of a
   superior's commands, for God's sake, is worthy of greater praise or
   reward. For as one act may be an act of two vices, in that the act of
   one vice is directed to the end of another vice, e.g., when one steals
   to commit fornication, in which case the act is specifically one of
   avarice, but intentionally one of lust, [810] -- so in the same way the
   act of one virtue may be directed to the act of another virtue, as when
   one gives for charity, in which case the act is specifically one of
   liberality, but finally one of charity: such an act is more
   praiseworthy for the greater virtue of charity than for liberality:
   hence, though the liberality come to fall short, the act will be more
   praiseworthy, inasmuch as it is referred to charity, and worthy of
   greater reward, than if it were done with greater liberality, but not
   in view of charity. [811] Let us suppose then a man doing some act of
   virtue, say, fasting, or restraining his sexual passion: if he does
   this without a vow, it will be an act of chastity, or abstinence: but
   if he does it under a vow, it is further referable to another virtue,
   that virtue to which it belongs to vow and pay one's vows to God, which
   is called the virtue of religion, a higher virtue than chastity, or
   abstinence, as putting us in a right relation with God. The act of
   abstinence therefore, or continence, will be more praiseworthy inasmuch
   as it is done under vow, even though the doer of it does not take so
   much delight in his abstinence, or continence: that deficiency is made
   up by his taking delight in a higher virtue, which is religion.

   If any one does anything for God, he offers the act to God, such as it
   is: but if he does it under a vow, he offers to God not only the act
   but also the power: thus he clearly has the intention of rendering to
   God some greater service. Therefore his act will be the more virtuous
   by reason of the greater good intended, even though another shows
   himself more fervent in the execution.

   Moreover, the will that goes before a deed, virtually endures
   throughout the whole course of the doing of it; and renders it
   praiseworthy, even when the agent in the execution of his work is not
   thinking of the purpose for which he began: for it is not necessary for
   him who has undertaken a journey for God's sake, to be actually
   thinking of God at every step of the journey. But clearly he who has
   vowed to do a thing has willed it more intensely than another who
   simply has a purpose of doing it; because he has not only willed to do
   it, but also has willed to fortify himself against failing to do it.
   This original earnestness of will renders the fulfilment of the vow,
   with more or less of earnestness, praiseworthy, even when the will is
   not actually fixed on the work, or is fixed on it but languidly. Thus
   what is done under vow is more praiseworthy than what is done without
   vow, other conditions however being equal. [812]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [810] Celibacy can be justified on mere natural and rational grounds in
   this sense, that no cogent reasons are apparent making it a man's duty
   under ordinary circumstances to marry. But celibacy does not amount to
   a virtue except when it is embraced on supernatural grounds, that is to
   say, on grounds of faith and love of God in Christ. The chapter next
   translated is the justification of the vow of obedience.

   [811] A very anti-utilitarian conclusion. But surely I am more obliged
   to a man who gives me half-a-crown, because he wants to make friends
   with me, than to another who gives me a sovereign, desiring never to
   see my face again.

   [812] Nevertheless it remains in the highest degree desirable that the
   vows of religion be heartily observed and never regretted. To serve
   this end, a novitiate is prefixed to the taking of them, that they may
   be appreciated, desired, and made matter of habitual practice before
   they come to bind. And after they are taken, the love of them is kept
   up by constant meditation and prayer. Like the words of our Saviour in
   the Gospel, the vows of religion are misinterpreted and misjudged in
   the abstract, away from the concrete facts which attend their first
   pronouncement and their habitual observance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXL--That neither all Good Works nor all Sins are Equal [813]

   COUNSELS are not given except of the better good. But in the divine law
   there are given counsels of poverty and continency: these then are
   better than the use of matrimony and the possession of temporal estate,
   which things however are quite consistent with virtuous action.

   2. Acts are specified by their objects. The better therefore the
   object, the more virtuous will be the act according to its species. But
   the end is better than the means thereto; and in the category of means
   the better is that which comes nearer to the end. Therefore among human
   acts that is the best, which tends straight to God, the last end; and
   after that, an act is better in its species according as its object is
   nearer to God.

   3. Good is in human acts according as they are regulated by reason. But
   some acts come nearer to reason than others: acts which are acts of
   reason itself have more of the good of reason in them than the acts of
   the lower powers commanded by reason. [814]

   4. The commandments of the law are best fulfilled by love (Chap.
   [433]CXXVIII). But one man may do his duty out of greater love than
   another.

   6. The better act is the act of the better virtue. But one virtue is
   better than another: thus munificence is better than liberality, and
   high-souled conduct in a high position (magnanimitas) than decency in a
   lowly state (moderantia, i.e., metriotes).

   Hence it is said: He who joineth his virgin in marriage doth well: but
   he who joineth her not doth better (1 Cor. vii, 38).

   By the same reasons it appears that not all sins are equal: for one sin
   goes wider of the last end than another sin, is a greater perversion of
   the order of reason, and does greater harm to one's neighbour. Hence it
   is said: Thou hast done more wicked things than they in all thy ways
   (Ezech. xvi, 47).

   But there may seem to be some reason in the position that all virtuous
   acts are equal, if we consider that every virtuous act is directed to a
   final good: hence, if there is the same final good for all virtuous
   acts, they must all be equally good. -- It is to be replied that,
   though there is one final end of goodness, nevertheless there is a
   difference of degree in the good things that are referred to that end,
   some of them being better than others and nigher to the last end. Hence
   there will be degrees of goodness in the will and its acts according to
   the diversity of good objects to which the will and its acts are
   terminated, though the ultimate end be the same. [815]

   Or again it may be argued that all sins are equal, because sin in human
   acts comes solely of overpassing the rule of reason: but he overpasses
   the rule of reason who swerves from it in a small matter, equally with
   him who swerves from it in a great one; just as, if a line be drawn,
   not to be overstepped, it comes to the same thing in court whether the
   trespasser has overstepped it little or much; or as a boxer is cast,
   once he has gone outside the limits of the ring, little or much: so
   then, once a man has overstepped the bounds of reason, the amount of
   his transgression makes no difference. On careful consideration,
   however, it appears that in all cases where perfection and goodness
   consists in a certain conformity to measure, the evil will be the
   greater, the greater the departure from that due conformity. Thus
   health consists in a due blending of humours, and beauty in a due
   proportion of features and limbs, and truth in a conformity of thought
   or speech to fact. The greater the unevenness of humours, the greater
   the sickness: the greater the incongruity of features or limbs, the
   greater the ugliness; and the greater the departure from truth, the
   greater the falsehood: thus the reckoning is not so false that brings
   in 5 for 3 as that which brings in 100 for 3. But the good of virtue
   consists in a certain conformity to measure: for virtue is a mean,
   according to due limitation under the circumstances, between contrary
   vices. Wickedness then is greater, the further it is out of this
   harmony. Nor is transgressing the limits of virtue like transgressing
   bounds fixed by a court. For virtue being of itself good, the
   transgression of it is of itself evil; and therefore the greater the
   departure from virtue, the greater the evil. But the transgression of a
   limit fixed by a court is not of itself evil, but only accidentally so,
   inasmuch as it is forbidden. But in these accidental connexions, though
   the being of one thing at all follows upon another's being at all, it
   does not follow that the being of the one thing in a higher degree
   follows upon the other's coming to be in a higher degree. Thus if a
   white body is musical, it does not follow that the whiter the body, the
   more musical: but it does follow that if whiteness is distinctive of
   vision, a stronger whiteness wilt be more distinctive. [816]

   A noteworthy difference between sins is that between mortal and venial
   sin. A mortal sin is one that deprives the soul of spiritual life. The
   essence of spiritual life consists in two things, according to the
   likeness of natural life. Just as the body lives naturally by its union
   with the soul, which is the principle of life; and again, quickened by
   the soul, the body moves of itself, while a dead body either remains
   immovable, or is moved only by an exterior power: [817] so is man's
   will alive, when conjoined by a right intention with its last end,
   which is its object and, as it were, its form; and in thus cleaving by
   love to God and to its neighbour, it is moved by an interior principle
   of action. But when a right intention of the last end and love is gone,
   the soul is, as it were, dead, and no longer moves of itself to do any
   right actions, but either wholly gives over doing them, or is led to do
   them only by an exterior principle, to wit, the fear of punishment.
   [818] Whatever sins therefore stand not with a right intention of the
   last end and love, are mortal sins: but, so long as these finalities
   are attended to, any deficiency in point of right order of reason will
   not be a mortal sin, but venial.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [813] Contrary to one of the paradoxes of the Stoics, refuted also in
   Sum. Theol., 1a-2ae, q. 73, art. 2 (Aquinas Ethicus, I, 211, 212). The
   text, James ii, 10, may refer to the breaking of even one commandment
   contumaciously and contemptuously. Now there is a certain
   contumaciousness in every mortal sin; and one such sin is enough to
   destroy sanctity and supernatural righteousness; cf. Ezechiel xxviii,
   12, 13.

   [814] Aristotle probably reckoned an act of speculative wisdom, or a
   scientific discovery, to be a better thing than an act of fortitude or
   temperance. St Thomas uses Aristotelian language, but can hardly mean
   more by it than this, that, other things being equal, an act is morally
   better, the more fully it represents the choice of reason,' that is, of
   the rational will.' On the ethical value of acts of pure intellect, as
   compared with acts of the conative faculties -- a difficult point,
   generally neglected -- cf. Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 73-77, Sect.
   III.

   [815] One proximate object of volition may be better than another,
   though the remote and ultimate object be the same. It is clearly better
   to swim to the rescue of a drowning neighbour than to swim for my own
   recreation, though both acts be done finally for the love of God.

   [816] So Aristotle, Topica, III, 5 cf. Metaph. IX, vii, 7. St Thomas
   and Aristotle are fond of this illustration, that white is
   disgregativum visus, diakritikon opseos and black congregativum,
   sunkritikon; but never explain it. It means that white, as representing
   light, is distinctive of vision, i.e., causes distinct vision; and
   black, as representing darkness, is confusive of vision. So, if all
   things were black -- the sun included, -- we should see nothing.

   [817] If the dead body remains immovable,' how comes it to decay? St
   Thomas means that it moves no longer as one organism to any purpose of
   human life, but breaks up into disgregate organisms and in organic
   parts.

   [818] The theology of the Catholic Church on this point stands as
   follows in the light of controversies and decisions subsequent to the
   age of St Thomas. (a) A man in mortal sin may do acts of natural
   virtue, such as even the heathen do (Matt. v, 47). (b) He may also do
   supernaturally good acts by aid of an exterior principle,' i.e., the
   actual grace sent him by God. This St Thomas presently declares
   ([434]Chap. CLVII). (c) These supernatural acts, done by a soul in
   deadly sin, need not proceed from fear alone: they may be motived by
   hope, by some sense of shame or gratitude, or even by some initial love
   of God (Council of Trent, Sess. 6, Cap. vi). (d) An act of perfect love
   of God is excluded by the supposition of the soul being still in mortal
   sin: for when a man in mortal sin is led on by grace to make such an
   act, which is possible enough, his sin is instantly taken away. Nor is
   St Thomas in disagreement with these propositions. See Sum. Theol.
   1a-2ae, q. 71, art. 4; 2a-2ae, q. 23, art. 7 ad 1 (Aquinas Ethicus, I,
   199, 355). On the other hand, the Church has condemned the following
   (a) Of Michael Le Bay: "Everything that the sinner, or the state of
   sin, does is a sin. He is of the party of Pelagius, who recognises any
   natural goodness, that is, any goodness arising from the mere power of
   nature." (b) Of Paschal Quesnel, the Jansenist: "What remains to the
   soul that has lost God and His grace, but sin and the consequences of
   sin, a proud poverty and a lazy indigence, that is, a general
   incapacity for labour, prayer, or any good work?" (Denziger,
   Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum, nn. 680, 915, 917, 1216.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXLI--That a Man's Acts are punished or rewarded by God

   TO him it belongs to punish or reward, to whom it belongs to lay down
   the law. But it belongs to divine providence to lay down the law for
   men (Chap. [435]CXIV): therefore also to punish or reward.

   2. Whenever there is due order to an end, that order must lead to the
   end, and departure from that order must shut out the end: for things
   that are according to an end derive their necessity from the end, in
   such way that they must be, if the end is to follow, and while they are
   without impediment, the end ensues. But God has imposed upon men's acts
   an order in respect of their final good. If then that order is duly
   laid down, it must be that they who walk according to it shall gain
   their final good, that is, be rewarded, and they who depart from that
   order by sin shall be shut out from their final good, that is,
   punished.

   3. As physical things are subject to the order of divine providence, so
   also human acts. In regard to both the one and the other the due order
   may be observed, or it may be transgressed. But there is this
   difference, that the observation or transgression of the due order lies
   in the power of the human will, but not in the power of physical
   things. As then in physical things, when due order is observed in them,
   there follows of natural necessity their preservation and good, but
   their destruction and evil when the due and natural order is departed
   from; so in human things it needs must be that when a man voluntarily
   observes the order of law by Heaven imposed upon him, he gains good,
   not of necessity, but by the dispensation of the ruler, -- that is to
   say, he gains reward; and conversely, when the order of law is
   neglected, he comes to evil, that is to say, is punished.

   4. It is part of the perfection of God's goodness to have no part of
   nature in disorder. Hence we see in the physical world that every evil
   is part of an orderly arrangement to some good, as the killing of the
   sheep is the feeding of the wolf. Since then human acts are subject to
   the order of divine providence as well as physical events, the evil
   that happens in human acts must lead up in an orderly way to good. But
   this is most aptly brought about by the punishment of sins: for thus
   excesses beyond the due amount are embraced under the order of justice,
   which restores equality. Man exceeds the due degree and proper amount
   by preference of his own will to that of God, satisfying himself
   against the ordinance of God: this inequality is removed by his being
   compelled to suffer something against his will according to the same
   ordinance.

   6. Divine providence has arranged things so that one shall profit
   another. But it is most fitting for man to be advanced to his final
   good as well by the good as by the evil of his fellow-man, being
   excited to do well by seeing well-doers rewarded, and withheld from
   evil-doing by seeing evil-doers punished.

   Hence it is said: I am the Lord thy God . . . . visiting the iniquities
   of the fathers upon the children . . . . and doing mercy a thousandfold
   upon them that love me and keep my commandments (Exod. xx, 5, 6): Thou
   wilt render to every one according to his works (Ps. lxi, 13): To them
   who, according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and
   incorruption, life everlasting: but to them who . . . . obey not the
   truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation (Rom. ii, 7,
   8). [819]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [819] Sin then "leads up in an orderly way" to hell, and hell is "good"
   for sin. Arguments such as those of this chapter explain what man can
   explain; and when the explanation is done, sin and hell remain
   mysteries. The mystery precisely is, not that sin should be punished,
   but that it should be at all.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXLII--Of the Difference and Order of Punishments

   EVIL is the privation of good: hence the order and difference of
   punishments must be according to the difference and order of good
   things. The chief good and final end of man is happiness: the higher
   good for him then is that which comes nearer to this end. Coming
   nearest to it of all is virtue, and whatever else advances man to good
   acts leading to happiness: next is a due disposition of reason and of
   the powers subject to it: after that, soundness of bodily health, which
   is necessary to unfettered action: lastly, exterior goods, as accessory
   aids to virtue. [820] The greatest punishment therefore for man will be
   exclusion from happiness: after that, the privation of virtue, and of
   any perfection of supernatural (supernaturalium) powers in his soul for
   doing well: then the disorder of the natural powers of his soul: after
   that, the harm of his body; and finally the taking away of exterior
   goods.

   But because it belongs to the idea of pain not only that it should be a
   privation of good, but also that it should be contrary to the will, and
   not every man's will esteems goods as they really are, but sometimes
   the privation of the greater good is less contrary to the will, and
   therefore seems less of a punishment, it so comes about that the
   majority of men, esteeming sensible and corporeal things more and
   knowing them better than the good things of the intellect and the
   spirit, dread corporeal penalties more than spiritual ones: thus in
   their estimation the order of punishments is the very reverse of that
   aforesaid. With them, injuries to the body and losses of exterior
   things make the greatest punishment: but as for disorder of the soul
   and loss of virtue and forfeiture of the enjoyment of God, in which the
   final happiness of man consists, all this they count little or nothing.
   Hence it is that they do not consider the sins of men to be punished by
   God, because they see usually sinners enjoying good health and the
   blessings of exterior fortune, of which sometimes virtuous men are
   deprived. This ought not to appear surprising to persons who look
   straight at the facts. For since all exterior things are referable to
   things interior, and the body to the soul, exterior and corporeal good
   things are really good for man in so far as they turn to the good of
   reason within him; and turn to his evil so far as they hinder that good
   of reason. Now God, the disposer of all things, knows the measure of
   human virtue: hence He sometimes supplies a virtuous man with corporeal
   and exterior good things to aid his virtue, and does him a favour in so
   doing: sometimes again He withdraws the aforesaid things, considering
   them to be an obstacle to man's virtue and enjoyment of God. Where they
   are such an obstacle, exterior good things turn to a man's prejudice,
   and the loss of them to his gain. If then punishment in every case
   means the infliction of some evil, and it is not an evil for a man to
   be deprived of exterior and corporeal good things so far as is
   conducive to his advancement in virtue, such deprivation will not be a
   punishment to a virtuous man: on the other hand a real punishment to
   the wicked will be the concession to them of exterior goods, whereby
   they are incited to evil. Hence it is said: The creatures of God are
   turned to hate, and to a temptation to the souls of men, and a trap for
   the feet of the unwise (Wisd. xiv, 11). But because it is of the notion
   of punishment not only to be an infliction of evil, but further an evil
   contrary to the will, the loss of corporeal and exterior goods, even
   when it makes for advancement in virtue and not for evil, is called
   punishment by a stretch of language, inasmuch as it is contrary to the
   will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [820] Adminiculantibus utimur ad virtutem, the Aristotelian choregia,
   scorned of Cynic and Stoic. Such adminicula might be called buttresses
   (appodiacula, Chap. XXVI) to the tower of happiness, whereof physical
   and moral virtue is the lower storey, intellectual virtue the spire,
   and the act of contemplation the crowning point, final end and
   realisation of the entire construction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXLIII--That not all Punishments nor all Rewards are Equal

   AS there are degrees in virtuous actions and in sins (Chap. [436]CXL),
   so there must be degrees of rewards and punishments: for so the
   equality of distributive justice requires, that unequal returns be made
   for unequal services.

   Hence it is said: According to the measure of the sin shall also be the
   measure of the stripes (Deut. xxv, 2).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXLIV--Of the Punishment due to Mortal and Venial Sins
   respectively in regard to the Last End

   MAN may sin in either of two ways, either so that the intention of his
   mind be quite turned away from subordination to God, the final good,
   and that is a mortal sin: or otherwise so that, while the mind's
   intention remains fixed on the final end, some obstacle is put in the
   way to retard its free movement to the end, and that is a venial sin.
   [821] As then the difference of punishments must be according to the
   difference of sins, it follows that whoever sins mortally must have for
   his punishment to be cast out from the attainment of his end; but he
   who sins venially is punished, not by being cast out, but by being
   retarded or experiencing difficulty in gaining his end; for so the
   equality of justice is preserved, in that as man, by sinning
   [venially], voluntarily turns aside from his end, so in suffering
   punishment, against his will, he should be impeded in the gaining of
   that end. [822]

   3. When any one attains a good thing that he was not intending, that is
   by luck and chance. If then he whose intention is turned away from the
   last end were to gain that last end, it would be by luck and chance, --
   which is an absurd thing to suppose, seeing that the last end is a good
   of intelligence, and luck and chance are inconsistent with intelligent
   action, because chance events come about without the direction of
   intelligence: it is absurd then to suppose intelligence gaining its end
   by an unintelligent method. He then will not gain his end, who by
   sinning mortally has his intention turned away from his last end.

   5. In an orderly course of means leading up to an end such a relation
   obtains that, if the end is or is to be, the means thereto must be: if
   the means to the end are not forthcoming, neither will the end be
   forthcoming: for if the end could be secured without the means to the
   end being taken, it would be labour lost to seek the end by the taking
   of such means. But it is by arts of virtue, the chief element in which
   is an intention of the due end, that man attains to his last end and
   happiness (Chap. [437]CXLI). Whoever then acts against virtue, and
   turns his back on his last end, it is proper for him to suffer
   deprivation of that end.

   Hence it is said: Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity (Matt.
   vii, 23).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [821] Presently described by St Thomas thus (n. 2): "The intention
   remains turned to the end, but is somewhat impeded by over-much
   adherence to the means."

   [822] A fine se divertit but not avertit. Let O be the origin of
   co-ordinates, representing man's start in life. Let f be the last end.
   Let p be the position of a soul in venial sin; q the position of a soul
   in mortal sin. It will be seen that the soul at p has travelled praeter
   finem, not contra finem:it will have to he reduced to order by penance
   and pain, represented by the value of the ordinate p p' along the axis
   of Y. On the other hand, q represents a soul that has wandered away in
   a negative direction, quite contra finem: if it leaves the body at that
   point, that soul is lost. By penance it has to be brought back to the
   origin at O, and so on to the positive side. Thus represented at the
   last day, by points moving to the left and to the right along the axis
   of X, as well as upwards along Y, the histories of human lives must
   make figures of wonderful complexity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXLV--That the Punishment whereby one is deprived of his Last
   End is Interminable [823]

   THERE is no privation except of that which naturally belongs to the
   subject: a puppy at birth cannot be said to lie under any privation of
   sight. But man is not apt to attain his last end in this life (Chap.
   [438]XLVIII). Therefore any privation of such end must come as a
   punishment after this life. But after this life there remains to man no
   ability of gaining his last end, since it is through the body that he
   gains perfection alike in knowledge and in virtue. [824] And once the
   soul is separated from the body, it returns not again to this state of
   receiving perfection from the body, as we have argued above (B. II,
   Chap. [439]LXXXIII) against the advocates of the transmigration of
   souls (transcorporationem ponentes). Whoever then incurs this
   punishment must be deprived of his last end, and remain eternally
   deprived of it.

   3. Natural equity seems to require every one to be deprived of the good
   against which he takes action, as thereby he renders himself unworthy
   of that good. Hence by process of civil justice whoever offends against
   the commonwealth is deprived of the society of the commonwealth
   altogether, either by death or by perpetual banishment. Nor is the time
   taken by his offence considered, but the power against which he has
   offended. He then who sins against his last end and against charity,
   which is the foundation of the society of the Blessed and of wayfarers
   on the road to Blessedness, ought to be punished eternally, though his
   sin took only a short space of time.

   4. In the divine judgement the will is taken for the deed: because as
   men see what is done outwardly, so does God view the hearts of men. But
   whoever for the sake of some temporal good has turned himself away from
   the final end, which is possessed for ever, has preferred the temporal
   enjoyment of that good to the eternal enjoyment of the last end: much
   more then, it clearly appears, would he have willed the enjoyment of
   that temporal good for all eternity. Therefore according to the divine
   judgement he ought to be punished as though he had gone on sinning for
   eternity. And beyond question, for eternal sin eternal punishment is
   due.

   Hence it is said: These shall go into everlasting punishment, but the
   just into life everlasting (Matt. xxv, 46).

   Hereby is excluded the error of them who say that the punishment of the
   wicked will at some time come to an end. This position seems to have
   had its foundation in the position of certain philosophers [825] who
   said that all punishments were purgatorial, and consequently at some
   time terminable. And this position seems plausible, as well by the
   custom of mankind, for human laws inflict penalties as means and in a
   manner medicines for the amendment of vices; as also by reason, for if
   punishment were inflicted, not for the sake of something else, but for
   its own sake, it would follow that the authority punishing took delight
   in punishments for their own sake, which is inconsistent with the
   goodness of God: it needs must be then that punishment is inflicted for
   the sake of something else, and no more suitable end appears than the
   amendment of vices. There seems therefore reason for saying that all
   punishments are purgatorial, and consequently terminable, since
   whatever is matter of purgation is accidental in regard of the
   creature, and can be removed without consumption of its substance.

   In reply it must be allowed that punishments are inflicted by God, not
   for their own sake, as though God took delight in them, but for the
   sake of something else, namely, in view of the order which He wishes to
   impose on creatures, in which order the good of the universe consists
   (B. II, Chap. [440]XLV). The order of the universe requires all things
   to be dispensed by God in due proportion, in weight, number, and
   measure (Wisd. xi, 21). But as rewards answer proportionably to
   virtuous actions, so punishments to sins; and to some sins everlasting
   punishments are proportionable. God then inflicts eternal punishments
   on some sins, that the due order may be observed in things, which order
   proves His wisdom.

   But even though one were to allow that all punishments are applied to
   the amendment of vices, and to no other purpose, not on that account
   are we obliged to suppose that all punishments are purgatorial and
   terminable. For even by human laws some men are punished by death, not
   for their amendment, but for the amendment of others: hence it is said:
   For the scourging of the pestilent man, the fool shall be wiser (Prov.
   xix, 25). [826] Sometimes also human laws drive men out of the State
   into perpetual banishment, that the State may be purer by being rid of
   them: hence it is said: Cast out the scorner, and the quarrel will go
   out with him, and suits and brow- beatings will cease (Prov. xxii, 10).
   Even then though punishments be employed only for the reformation of
   manners, it may very well be that by the judgement of God some men
   ought to be for ever separated from the society of the good and
   eternally punished, that by the fear of everlasting punishment men may
   cease to sin, and the society of the good may be the purer for their
   separation, as it is said: There shall not enter therein anything
   unclean, or making abomination or lying (Apoc. xxi, 27). [827]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [823] Cf. Sum. Theol. 1a-2ae, q. 87, art. 3 (Aquinas Ethicus, I, 254).
   Interminable here may have two meanings. (1) It may mean final in the
   sense that the person punished shall never be brought to his last end;
   but whether he shall exist for ever under privation of it, is left an
   open question (notwithstanding B. II, Chap. LXXIX). (2) Or it may mean
   eternal connoting the existence of the soul for ever under privation of
   the last end. That punishment is interminable in the second sense, is a
   revealed truth of faith. But, revelation apart, it is questionable
   whether the a priori arguments of philosophers evince more than
   interminability in the sense of finality, as explained under the former
   head. See Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 164-166. The reader will consider
   how far the arguments of this chapter carry him beyond finality to
   positive eternal duration.

   [824] In modern phraseology, St Thomas would say that death sets a
   bound to man's moral evolution, at least in respect of all specific
   change. That is true, but can philosophers prove it? What is the proof
   of the present allegation? St Thomas always seems to regard the soul
   as, to some extent, crippled by separation from the body. Cf B. II,
   Chap. LXXV, arg. 1, reply: B. II, Chap. XCIV, nn. 3, 4. For the
   capabilities of the soul after death, a priori arguments go very little
   way; and as for experience, it comes to us all, but too late.

   [825] In other words, the Origenist position is founded on the
   Platonist, for which see Ethics and Natural Law, p. 176; and on the
   whole question, ib. pp. 168 sq., Section III, Of Punishment
   Retrospective and Retributive.

   [826] Would this procedure be just, if the pestilent man did not
   deserve the scourge? And is not the very mention of deserving a
   retrospective and retributive consideration?

   [827] Even Plato consigns to everlasting punishment the "incurably
   wicked" tyrant, Ardiaeus (Rep. 615-6; Gorgias, 525b.c.; Phaedo, 113e),
   as an example to others. Aristotle distinguishes chastisement from
   vengeance, the former being "for the sake of him who offers it," the
   latter "for his sake who takes it " (Rhet. I, x, 17). And we read of
   One who says, Vengeance is mine (Rom. xii, 19). All this notion of
   vindictive, retrospective, or retributive punishment proceeds upon the
   doctrine of free will: it is inconsistent with determinism. And that is
   one of the objections to determinism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXLVI--That Sins are punished also by the experience of
   something Painful

   PUNISHMENT ought to be proportionate to the fault. But in a fault not
   only is there an aversion of the mind from the last end, but also an
   undue conversion of it to other objects as ends. Not only then should
   the sinner be punished by exclusion from the end, but also by other
   things turning to his pain.

   2. No one is afraid to lose what he does not desire to gain. They then
   who have their will turned away from their last end, have no fear of
   being shut out from it. Consequently that mere exclusion would not be
   enough to call them off from sinning. Some other punishment then must
   be employed, which sinners may fear.

   3. One who puts to undue use the means to a certain end, not only is
   deprived of the end, but incurs some other hurt besides. Thus
   inordinate taking of food not only does not bring health, but further
   induces sickness. But whoever sets up his rest in creatures does not
   use them as he ought: he does not refer them to their last end. Not
   only then ought he to be punished by going without happiness, but also
   by experiencing some pain from creatures.

   Hence divine Scripture not only threatens sinners with exclusion from
   glory, but also with affliction in other ways. Depart from me, ye
   cursed, into everlasting fire (Matt. xxv, 41). He shall rain nets on
   sinners: fire and brimstone and the breath of stormy winds shall be the
   portion of their cup (Ps. x, 7). [828]

   [828] We live by the light and heat of the central fire of the sun.
   Electricity, which we may call a fire, is now taken to be the essential
   basis of all matter. All the bright and delicious things of life come
   of fire. Without fire, no civilisation, no humanity, no joy on earth.
   If then the saying holds that "in the things wherein a man has sinned,
   in the same shall he be punished," fire forms not an unfit punishment
   for one who has abused the good things of our present existence.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXLVII--That it is Lawful for judges to inflict Punishments

   MEN who on earth are set over others are ministers of divine
   providence. But it is the order of providence that the wicked be
   punished.

   4. Good stands in no need of evil, but the other way about (Chap. XI).
   Whatever then is of necessity for the preservation of good, cannot be
   of itself evil. [829] But for the preservation of concord among men it
   is necessary for penalties to be inflicted on the wicked.

   5. The common good is better than the good of the individual. There
   fore some particular good must be withdrawn for the preservation of the
   common good. But the life of certain pestilent fellows is a hindrance
   to the common good, that is, to the concord of human society. Such
   persons therefore are to be withdrawn by death from the society of men.
   [830]

   Hence the Apostle says: He beareth not the sword in vain (Rom. xiii, 4:
   cf. 1 Pet. ii, 14).

   Hereby is excluded the error of those who say that corporal punishments
   are unlawful, and quote in support of their error such texts as, Thou
   shalt not kill (Exod. xx, 13): Let both grow until the harvest (Matt.
   xiii, 30). But these are frivolous allegations. For the same law which
   says, Thou shalt not kill, adds afterwards: Thou shalt not suffer
   poisoners (maleficos, pharmakous) to live (Exod. xxii, 18). And as for
   both growing until the harvest, how that is to be understood appears
   from what follows: lest perchance in gathering the tares ye root out
   along with them the wheat also: in this passage then the killing of the
   wicked is forbidden where it cannot be done without danger to the good,
   as happens when the wicked are not yet clearly marked off from the good
   by manifest sins, or when there is ground for apprehension that the
   wicked may involve many good men in their ruin.

   The fate of the wicked being open to conversion so long as they live
   does not preclude their being open also to the just punishment of
   death. Indeed the danger threatening the community from their life is
   greater and more certain than the good expected by their conversion.
   Besides, in the hour of death, they have every facility for turning to
   God by repentance. And if they are so obstinate that even in the hour
   of death their heart will not go back upon its wickedness, a fairly
   probable reckoning may be made that they never would have returned to a
   better mind.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [829] St Thomas speaks of a general and ordinary necessity, e.g., of
   food for the individual, of the union of the sexes for the race, not of
   an accidental necessity, or particular emergency. To extend the
   aphorism to the latter case would make it into an assertion of the end
   justifying the means, a doctrine read into the utterances of Catholic
   authors by persons who in malice or ignorance misconstrue passages like
   the present.

   [830] Writing later, St Thomas saw the need of qualifying this
   argument, which, taken absolutely, would make short shrift of lunatics
   and troublesome invalids generally, and would consecrate the principle
   of lynch-law. He puts in therefore these two qualifications (1) "Man by
   sinning withdraws from the order of reason, and thereby falls from
   human dignity, so far as that consists in man being naturally free and
   existent for his own sake; and falls in a manner into the state of
   servitude proper to beasts. . . . And therefore, though to kill a man,
   while he abides in his native dignity, be a thing of itself evil, yet
   to kill a man who is a sinner may be good, as to kill a beast." (2) "A
   beast is naturally distinguishable from a man: hence on this point
   there is no need of judgement. . . . But a sinner is not naturally
   distinguishable from just men; and therefore he needs a public
   judgement to make him out, and determine whether he ought to be slain
   for the benefit of the common weal." The student should read the whole
   of Sum. Theol. 2a-2ae, q. 64, art. 2 and 3 (Aquinas Ethicus, II, pp.
   40-42), whence these extracts are taken.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXLVIII--That Man stands in need of Divine Grace for the
   Gaining of Happiness

   IT has already been shown (Chapp. [441]CXI-[442]CXIII) that divine
   providence disposes of rational creatures otherwise than of other
   things, inasmuch as their nature stands on a different footing from
   that of others. It remains to be shown that also in view of the dignity
   of their end divine providence employs a higher method of government in
   their regard. Their nature clearly fits them for a higher end. As being
   intelligent, they can attain to intelligible truth, which other
   creatures cannot. So far as they attain this truth by their own natural
   activity, God provides for them otherwise than for other creatures,
   giving them understanding and reason, and further the gift of speech,
   whereby they can aid one another in the knowledge of truth. But beyond
   this, the last end of man is fixed in a certain knowledge of truth
   which exceeds his natural faculties, so that it is given to him to see
   the First Truth in itself. [831] To creatures lower than man it is not
   given to arrive at an end exceeding the capacities of their natures. In
   view of this end, a method of government must be found for man,
   different from that which suffices for the lower creation. For the
   means must be proportionate to the end: if then man is ordained to an
   end transcending his natural capacities, he must be furnished with some
   supernatural assistance from heaven, enabling him to tend to that end.

   2. A thing of inferior nature cannot be brought to that which is proper
   to a superior nature except by the virtue and action of the said
   superior nature. Thus the moon, which has no light of its own, is made
   luminous by the virtue and action of the sun. [832] But to behold the
   First Truth as it is in itself so transcends the capacity of human
   nature as to be proper to God alone (Chap. [443]LII). Therefore man
   needs help of God to arrive at such an end.

   5. There are many impediments in the way of man's arriving at his end.
   He is impeded by the weakness of his reason, which is easily dragged
   into error, and so erring he is thrown off the right way of arriving at
   his end. He is impeded by the passions of the sensitive portion of his
   nature, and by the tastes which drag him to sensible and inferior
   things. The more he clings to such things, the further he is separated
   from his last end: for these things are below man, whereas his end is
   high above him. He is impeded also very frequently by infirmity of body
   from the performance of the acts of virtue which carry him on to his
   end. Man therefore needs the divine assistance, lest with such
   impediments in his way, he fail altogether in the gaining of his last
   end.

   Hence it is said: No man can come to me, unless the Father, who hath
   sent me, draw him (John vi, 44): As the branch cannot bear fruit of
   itself unless it abide in the vine, so neither can ye unless ye abide
   in me (John xv, 4). [833]

   Hereby is excluded the error of the Pelagians, who said that man could
   merit the glory of God by sheer free will of his own.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [831] In the beatific vision,' cf. Chapp. L-LII, which should here be
   re-read. This beatific vision is the 'supernatural end' of man; and all
   that properly and of itself leads to that end belongs to the
   'supernatural order.' The study of the supernatural order belongs to
   revealed,' or dogmatic, theology,' not to philosophy, which deals with
   man, as man, -- with man in the natural order; and does not presuppose
   any revelation. In the above-mentioned chapters, Chapp. L-LII, St
   Thomas has argued that after death the disembodied soul requires a
   special divine assistance to enable it to see God. In these present
   chapters his argument deals with man in this life, arguing that he
   needs special divine endowments, called grace,' enabling him so to live
   on earth as to be found worthy of divine vision when he comes to die.
   As he cannot see God face to face by his natural powers, so neither can
   he lead a life worthy of that vision by the mere strength and rectitude
   of human nature.

   [832] And dogs and horses, parrots and monkeys, learn tricks by contact
   with man, which they never would have learnt in their wild state. And
   savages are civilised by coming in contact with a culture higher than
   their own, but for which contact with a higher race they would have
   remained perennial savages. As man humanises the brute, and civilises
   his savage brother, so does God divinise man.

   [833] The first text argues the need of actual,' the second of
   habitual' and 'sanctifying' grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXLIV--That the Divine Assistance does not compel a Man to
   Virtue

   DIVINE providence provides for all things according to their mode of
   existence (Chap. LXXIII, [444]n. 2). But it is proper to man and to
   every rational creature to act voluntarily and to be master of his own
   acts; and compulsion is contrary to voluntariness.

   3. It is by will that man is directed to a final end: for the good and
   the final end is the object of will. And the divine assistance is
   vouchsafed us for this special purpose, that we may attain to our final
   end. That aid therefore does not exclude the act of our will: on the
   contrary, it is precisely the act of our will that the divine
   assistance produces in us: hence the Apostle says: It is God who
   worketh in us both to will and to act according to the good will (Phil.
   ii, 13). But compulsion defeats in us the act of the will: for we do
   that under compulsion of which we will the contrary.

   4. Man arrives at his last end by acts of virtue. But acts done under
   compulsion are not acts of virtue, for in virtue the chief thing is
   choice.

   Hence it is said: Consider that to-day the Lord hath put forth in thy
   sight life and good, and on the other hand death and evil, that thou
   mayest love the Lord thy God and walk in his ways. But f thy heart is
   turned away, and thou wilt not hear, etc. (Deut. xxx, 15-18): Before
   man is life and death, good and evil: what pleases him shall be given
   to him (Ecclus xv, 18).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CL--That Man cannot Merit beforehand the said Assistance

   EVERYTHING stands as matter [834] to that which is above itself. Now
   matter does not move itself to its own perfection, but must be moved by
   another. Man then does not move himself to the gaining of the divine
   assistance, which is above him, but rather he is moved by God to the
   gaining of it. But the motion of the mover precedes the motion of the
   thing moved, alike in the order of thought and in the order of
   causation. The divine assistance therefore is not given to us because
   we are advanced to receive it by our good works; but rather we are
   proficient in good works because we are forestalled by the divine
   assistance.

   Hence it is said: Not by the works of justice that we have done, but
   according to his own mercy he hath saved us (Tit. iii, 5): It is not of
   him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth
   mercy (Rom. ix, 16): because man needs must be forestalled by the
   divine assistance for purposes both of willing well and doing well. As
   the victory is attributed to the general, which is won by the labour of
   the soldiers, so such expressions as the above are not to be taken as
   exclusive of the free choice of the will, according to the
   misconstruction which some have put upon them, as though man were not
   master of his own acts, interior and exterior, but they show that man
   is under God. Again it is said: Turn us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall
   be turned (Lament. v, 21): which shows that our turning, or conversion,
   is anticipated by the aid of God converting us. Still we read, as
   spoken in the person of God: Turn ye to me, and I will turn to you
   (Zach. i, 3); not that the work of God in us does not go before our
   conversion; but the meaning is that the conversion, whereby we turn to
   God, is aided also by His subsequent aid, strengthening it to arrive to
   effect, and securing it that it may reach its due term.

   Hereby is excluded the error of the Pelagians, who said that the divine
   assistance is given us in consideration of our deservings; and that,
   while the beginning of our justification is of ourselves, the
   consummation of it is of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [834] Materialiter se habet, i.e., is in an attitude of potentiality,
   not of activity. The matter' here spoken of is that which is in
   potentiality to the form.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLI--That the aforesaid Assistance is called Grace,' and what
   is the meaning of Grace constituting a State of Grace' [835]

   BECAUSE what is given to another without any previous deserts of his is
   said to be given gratis, and because the divine aid given to man
   anticipates all human deserving, it follows that this aid is given to
   man gratis, and therefore is aptly called by the name of grace.' Hence
   the Apostle says: If by grace, it is not now of works, otherwise grace
   is no more grace (Rom. xi, 6).

   There is also another reason why the aforesaid assistance of God has
   received the name of grace.' One person is said to be in the good
   graces' of another, because he is well loved by him. Now it is of the
   essence of love that he who loves should wish good and do good to him
   whom he loves. God indeed wishes and does good to all His creatures,
   for the very being of the creature and its every perfection is of God
   willing and working it (B. I, Chapp. [445]XXIX, [446]XXX: B. II, Chap.
   [447]XV): hence it is said: Thou lovest all things that are, and hatest
   none of the things that thou hast made (Wisd. xi, 25). But a special
   tie of divine love is observable in connexion with those to whom He
   renders assistance, enabling them to attain the good which transcends
   the order of their nature, namely, the perfect fruition, not of any
   created good, but of God's own self. This assistance then is aptly
   called grace,' not only because it is given gratis,' but also because
   by this assistance a man comes to be, by a special prerogative, in the
   good graces' of God.

   This grace, in the man in the state of grace, must be a form and
   perfection of him who has it.

   1. That whereby a man is directed to an end must be in continual
   relation with him: for the mover works change continually until the
   body moved attains the term of its motion. [836] Since then man is
   directed to his last end by the assistance of divine grace, he must
   continually enjoy this assistance until he arrives at the end. But that
   would not be if the assistance were afforded him only as a sort of
   motion or passion, and not as a form abiding and, as it were, resting
   in him: for the movement and passion would not be in the man, except
   when his attention was being actually turned to the end, as is not the
   case continually, which is evident most of all in men asleep. Therefore
   the grace that puts a man in the state of grace is a form and
   perfection abiding in man, even when he is not actively engaged.

   2. The love of God is causative of the good that is in us, as the love
   of man is called forth and caused by some good that is in the object of
   his love. But man is excited to special love by some special good
   pre-existent in the object. Therefore where there is posited a special
   love of God for man, there must consequently be posited some special
   good conferred by God on man. Since then the grace that constitutes the
   State of grace denotes a special love of God for man, there must be
   likewise denoted some special goodness and perfection thereby existing
   in man.

   3. Everything is ordained to an end suited to it according to the
   character of its form: for of different species there are different
   ends. But the end to which man is directed by the assistance of divine
   grace is something above human nature. Therefore there must be
   superadded to man some supernatural form and perfection, whereby he may
   be aptly ordained to the aforesaid end.

   4. Man ought to arrive at his last end by dint of activities of his
   own. Now everything is active in virtue of some form of its own. In
   order then that man may be brought to his last end by activities of his
   own, there must be superadded to him some form, to validate his
   activities for the gaining of his last end.

   5. Divine providence provides for all according to the mode of their
   nature. But it is a mode proper to man to require for the perfection of
   his actions, over and above his natural powers, certain perfections in
   the shape of habits, whereby he may do good, and do it well,
   connaturally, readily, and pleasantly. [837] Therefore the aid of
   grace, given man by God for arriving at his last end, implies some form
   and perfection intrinsic to man.

   Hence in Scripture the grace of God is spoken of as light: Ye were once
   darkness, but now light in the Lord (Eph. v, 8). The perfection whereby
   man is led on to his final end in the vision of God is appropriately
   termed light, light being the principle of vision.

   Hereby is set aside the opinion of some who say that the grace of God
   is no positive quality in man (nihil in homine ponit), as no positive
   quality is ascribed to the courtier who is said to be in the good
   graces of the King, but rather to the King who has an affection for
   him. We see how this mistake arose, from failing to observe the
   difference between divine love and human love: for divine love is
   causative of the good that it loves in another, but not so human love.
   [838]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [835] Gratia gratum faciens, 'sanctifying grace.' The expression is
   taken from St Paul, Eph. i, 6, gratiae suae in qua gratificavit nos,
   echaritosen hemas. Hence the celebrated kecharitomene of Luke i, 28,
   might be translated gratificata, or grata facta, or per grata facta, to
   express the fulness of the Greek perfect.

   [836] True of accelerated motion, as of a stone falling, of which St
   Thomas was thinking. True again of motion persistent, though impeded;
   as of an engine drawing a train, impeded by friction and resistance of
   the air. Not true, of course, of motion simply.

   [837] Here is implied the Aristotelian doctrine of habits, according to
   which a habit may be defined as a permanent acquired quality, resident
   in a power, and determining that power, originally indeterminate, to
   act regularly, readily, and pleasantly in a certain line of action.'
   Skill is a habit, so is virtue. The argument is that, as there are
   natural habits, so there should be a supernatural habit, which is
   habitual' or 'sanctifying' grace.

   [838] St Thomas here has refuted by anticipation the Lutheran doctrine
   of imputed justice. The Lutherans met his arguments with scornful
   epithets, Thomisticus asinus, and the like. Further his arguments may
   be pressed upon certain moderns, who see in sanctifying grace nothing
   but what they call a moral relation.' St Thomas seems to consider it
   something physical.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLII--That the Grace which constitutes the State of Grace
   causes in us the Love of God

   THE grace which constitutes the state of grace is an effect of God's
   love. But the proper effect of God's love in man is to make man love
   God: for the chief effort of the lover is laid out in drawing the
   beloved to the love of him; and unless that succeeds, the love must be
   broken off.

   2. There must be some union between those who have one end in view, as
   citizens in one State, and soldiers ranked together on the battlefield.
   But the final end to which man is led by the assistance of divine grace
   is the vision of God as He essentially is, which is proper to God
   Himself; and so God shares this final good with man. Man then cannot be
   led on to this end unless he is united with God by conformity of will,
   the proper effect of love: for it belongs to friends to like and
   dislike together, and to rejoice and grieve together. The grace then
   that constitutes the state of grace renders man a lover of God, as he
   is thereby guided to an end shared with him by God.

   3. The grace that constitutes the state of grace must principally
   perfect the heart. But the principal perfection of the heart is love.
   The proof of that is, that every motion of the heart starts from love:
   for no one desires, or hopes, or rejoices, except for some good that he
   loves; nor loathes, nor fears, nor is sad, or angry, except about
   something contrary to the good that he loves.

   4. The form whereby a thing is referred to any end assimilates that
   thing in a manner to the end: thus a body by the form of heaviness
   acquires a likeness and conformity to the place to which it naturally
   moves. [839] But the grace that constitutes the state of grace is a
   form referring man to his last end, God. By grace then man attains to a
   likeness of God. And likeness is a cause of love.

   5. A requisite of perfect work is that the work be done steadily and
   regularly. That is just the effect of love, which makes even hard and
   grievous tasks seem light. Since then the grace that constitutes the
   state of grace goes to perfect our works, the said grace must establish
   the love of God within us.

   Hence the Apostle says: The charity of God is spread abroad in our
   hearts by the Holy Ghost who is given to us (Rom. v, 5).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [839] Earth to earth,' as we say, or matter to matter. The fact of any
   substance having weight argues that it is material, and assimilates it
   to that great body of matter of which we have our first experience, our
   mother earth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLIII--That Divine Grace causes in us Faith

   THE movement of grace, guiding us to our last end, is voluntary, not
   violent (Chap. [448]CXLIX). But there can be no voluntary movement
   towards an object unless the object be known. Therefore grace must
   afford us a knowledge of our last end. But such knowledge cannot be by
   open vision in our present state (Chap. [449]XLVIII): therefore it must
   be by faith. [840]

   2. In every knowing mind, the mode of knowledge follows the mode of
   nature: hence an angel, a man, and a dumb animal have different modes
   of knowledge according to their differences of natures. But, for the
   gaining of his last end, man has a perfection superadded to him, over
   and above his nature, namely, grace. Therefore there must also be
   superadded to him a knowledge, over and above his natural knowledge,
   and that is the knowledge of faith, which is of things not discerned by
   natural reason.

   3. As when wood is first warmed by fire, the fire does not take kindly
   to the wood; but finally, when the wood is all ablaze, the fire becomes
   as it were connatural to the wood and a part of its very being: or as
   when a pupil is taught by a master, he must, to start with, take in the
   ideas of the master, not as understanding them of himself, but in the
   spirit of one ready to accept on another's word things beyond his
   capacity; and so in the end, when his education is advanced, he will be
   able to understand those things: in like manner, before we arrive at
   our final end, which is the clear vision of the First Truth as it is in
   itself, the intellect of man must submit to God in readiness to take
   His word; and that submission and readiness to believe is the work of
   divine grace.

   4. See further, B. I, Chapp. [450]IV, [451]V.

   Hence the Apostle says: By grace ye are saved through faith; and that
   not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God (Eph. ii, 8).

   Hereby is refuted the error of the Pelagians, who said that the
   beginning of faith in us was not of God, but of ourselves.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [840] Why not by reason? The answer is given in the next argument. The
   work of our salvation must be all of a piece. The essential means to a
   supernatural end must be themselves supernatural. Grace however is no
   miraculous illumination of the intellect, no private revelation of the
   mysteries of God: it supposes the Christian tradition handed down from
   man to man, rationally taught and rationally grasped: but it disposes
   us to accept that tradition as we hear it, and it assists the teaching
   Church to preserve it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLIV--That Divine Grace causes in us a Hope of future
   Blessedness

   IN every lover there is caused a desire of union with his loved one, so
   far as may be: hence it is most delightful to live in the society of
   those whom one loves. As then by grace man is made a lover of God,
   there must be caused in him a desire of union with God, so far as may
   be. But faith, which is caused of grace, declares the possibility of a
   union of man with God in perfect fruition, wherein blessedness
   consists. Consequently the desire of this fruition follows upon the
   love of God. But desire is a troublesome thing, without hope of
   attainment. It was proper therefore that in men, in whom the love of
   God and faith in Him was caused by grace, there should be caused also
   the hope of attaining to future blessedness.

   3. Virtue, the way to blessedness, is paved with difficulties: hence
   the need of hope.

   4. No one stirs to reach an end, which he reckons it impossible to
   compass.

   Hence it is said: He hath regenerated us unto a living hope (1 Pet. i,
   3): In hope we are saved (Rom. viii, 24).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLV--Of Graces given gratuitously [841]

   SINCE the things done by God are done in order (Chapp.
   [452]LXXVII-[453]LXXX), a certain order had to be followed in the
   manifestation of the truths of faith, so that some should receive those
   truths immediately from God, others receive of them, and so in order
   even to the last. The invisible good things, the vision of which makes
   the happiness of the blessed, and which are the objects of faith, are
   first revealed by God to the blessed angels by open vision: then by the
   ministry of angels they are manifested by God to certain men, [842] not
   by open vision, but by a certitude arising from divine revelation. This
   revelation is made by an inner light of the mind, elevating the mind to
   see such things as the natural light of the understanding cannot attain
   to. As the natural light of the understanding renders a man certain of
   what he observes by that light, so does this supernatural light convey
   certainty of the objects which it reveals: for we cannot securely
   publish to others what we are not certain of ourselves. This light,
   which inwardly enlightens the mind, is sometimes borne out by other
   aids to knowledge, as well exterior as interior. There may be formed by
   divine power some utterance, or locution, heard by the external senses.
   Or it may be an inner locution, caused by God, and perceived by
   phantasy. Or there may be bodily appearances, external and visible,
   formed by God. Or such corporeal appearance may be inwardly depicted in
   phantasy. By these means, aided by the light inwardly impressed on his
   mind, man receives a knowledge of divine things. Hence, without the
   inner light, these aids are insufficient for the knowledge of divine
   things; whereas the inner light is sufficient of itself without them.
   [843]

   Now because those who receive a revelation from God ought in the order
   of divine enactment to instruct others, there needed to be further
   communicated to them the grace of speech. Hence it is said: The Lord
   hath given me a learned tongue (Isai. l, 4): I will give you speech and
   wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to withstand and
   gainsay (Luke xxi, 15). Hence also the gift of tongues (Acts ii, 4).

   But because any announcement put forth requires confirmation before it
   can be received, -- unless indeed it is self-evident, and the truths of
   faith are not evident to human reason, -- there was need of something
   to confirm the announcements of the preachers of the faith. But,
   inasmuch as they transcend reason, they could not be confirmed by any
   demonstrative process of reasoning from first principles. The means
   therefore to show that the announcements of these preachers came from
   God was the evidence of works done by them such as none other than God
   could do, healing the sick, and other miracles. Hence the Lord, sending
   his disciples to preach, said: Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse
   lepers, cast out devils (Matt. x, 8); and, They going forth preached
   everywhere, the Lord working withal, and confirming their words by the
   signs that followed. [844]

   In the aforesaid effects of grace we observe a certain difference.
   Though the name of grace' applies to them all, inasmuch as they are
   given gratuitously' without any preceding merit, nevertheless the
   working of love alone has a further claim to the name of grace,' as
   constituting the subject in the state of grace,' or in the good graces
   of God' (gratum Deo facit): for it is said: I love them that love me
   (Prov. viii, 17). Hence faith and hope and other means to the last end
   may be in sinners, who are not in the grace of God: love alone is the
   proper gift of the just, because he who abideth in charity abideth in
   God, and God in him (1 John iv, 16). [845]

   There is another difference to be observed in these workings of grace,
   and it is this, that some of them are necessary for a whole lifetime,
   as believing, hoping, loving, and obeying the commandments of God,
   without which things salvation is impossible; and for these effects
   there must be in man certain habitual perfections, that he may be able
   to act according to them as occasion requires. [846] Other effects of
   grace are necessary, not for a whole lifetime, but at certain times and
   places, as working of miracles, or foretelling of future events. To
   these effects habitual perfections are not given, but certain
   impressions are made by God, which cease when the act ceases, and have
   to be repeated when the act is repeated. Thus prophets in every
   revelation are illumined with a new light; and in every working of
   miracles there must be a fresh putting into operation of divine power.
   [847]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [841] All graces are given gratuitously; but some graces constitute the
   recipient in the state of grace, as sanctifying, or habitual grace: or
   help him in or towards the state of grace, as actual grace: these are
   called gratia gratum faciens. They go to sanctify the recipient. Other
   graces are not given for the recipient, but for the sake of others, and
   do not of themselves make for the sanctification of him who has them.
   Such graces, called gratia gratis data, include the miraculous powers
   discussed in this chapter, and in 1 Cor. xii, xiv.

   [842] Not to any men now living, but to the prophets of the Old Law,
   with the apostles, and some few other saints of the New. The great
   revelation was that made in Christ (Heb. i, 1), of which the Church is
   the guardian and exponent. The Church gets no new revelations. The Pope
   has no revelations as Pope: he takes counsel of theologians: only a
   special providence, such as might preserve him, e.g., from drowning,
   prevents his authoritatively teaching the Church any point of faith or
   morals that is not a legitimate unfolding of the revelation of Christ.

   [843] Obviously, there is danger of illusion in these visions,
   locutions, and inner lights. No man is more suspicious of such things
   than the average Catholic priest. A priest from his training gets the
   mind of a lawyer: he loves Church law and public teaching, and reckons
   less of the private wisdom of individuals. Catholic faith stands clear
   of private revelations. Such are not the ordinary channels whereby God
   teaches His mysteries to men. The ordinary channel is the Word
   Incarnate and His living Church on earth, a visible external authority.
   Certainly, every Christian man has his inner light,' but that light is
   none other than the grace of faith, enabling him and prompting him to
   believe, as on God's word, what the Church teaches him as revealed in
   Christ.

   [844] Here follows a long disquisition on true and false prophecies,
   hardly within the scope of the modern reader.

   [845] Even in the sinner the habits of faith and hope, as also all
   actual graces, common to the just and the unjust, may be put under
   gratia gratum faciens, inasmuch as they tend to the sanctification of
   the recipient more directly than to the general edification of the
   Church, which is the purpose of gratia gratis data. Besides
   extraordinary miraculous gifts, there would come under gratia gratis
   data the ordinary powers that go with the Sacrament of Order.

   [846] These habitual perfections' are the infused habits' of faith,
   hope, charity, etc., which constitute the habitual grace' conferred
   upon the soul at baptism. Cf. Aquinas Ethicus, I, 195, 271; II, 3.

   [847] It may be discussed whether the charismata of 1 Cor. xiv were not
   habitual. A mark of a gift being or not being habitual is the ability
   or inability of the possessor to bring it into play at will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLVI--That Man needs the Assistance of Divine Grace to
   persevere in Good [848]

   THE power of free will regards matters of election: but a matter of
   election is some particular thing to be done; and a particular thing to
   be done is what is here and now: [849] but perseverance is not a matter
   of present and immediate conduct, but a continuance of activity for all
   time: perseverance therefore is an effect above the power of free will,
   and therefore needing the assistance of divine grace.

   3. Though man is master of his act, he is not master of his natural
   powers; and therefore, though he is free to will or not will a thing,
   still his willing cannot make his will in the act of willing adhere
   immovably to the thing willed or chosen. But the immovable adherence of
   the will to good is requisite for perseverance: perseverance therefore
   is not in the power of free will. [850]

   Hence it is said: He who hath begun a good work in you will perfect it
   unto the day of Christ Jesus (Philip. i, 6): The God of all grace, who
   hath called us to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, himself will
   perfect us through some little suffering, confirm and establish us (1
   Pet. v, 10). There are also found in Holy Scripture many prayers for
   perseverance: e.g., Perfect my steps in thy ways, that my footsteps may
   not slip (Ps. xvi, 5); and especially that petition of the Lord's
   Prayer, Thy kingdom come: for the kingdom will not come for us unless
   we persevere in good.

   Hereby is refuted the error of the Pelagians, who said that free will
   is sufficient for man for his perseverance in good, and that there is
   no need of the assistance of grace for the purpose.

   As free will is not sufficient for perseverance in good without the
   help of God given from without, so neither is any infused habit. For in
   the state of our present life the habits infused into us of God do not
   totally take away from our free will its fickleness and liability to
   evil, although they do to some extent establish the free will in good.
   And therefore, when we say that man needs the aid of grace for final
   perseverance, we do not mean that, over and above the habitual grace
   first infused into him for the doing of good acts, there is infused
   into him another habitual grace enabling him to persevere; but we mean
   that, when he has got all the gratuitous habits that he ever is to
   have, man still needs some aid of divine providence governing him from
   without.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [848] If there is question of supernatural good, -- as faith, hope,
   charity, or other virtues practised on motives of faith, hope, and
   charity -- man can do not a single act of such good, still less
   persevere in it, without the aid of grace. If there is question of
   natural good, -- as justice, fortitude, temperance, practised on a
   motive of 'sweet reasonableness,' -- we must further enquire whether
   the question is asked of man historically considered, as a fallen
   creature; then we must take St Thomas's answer, Sum. Theol. 1a-2ae, q.
   109, art. 8; or of man as the a priori philosopher views him, merely as
   man. In the latter view this fact still seems discernible, that, the
   acts of virtue being difficult, and the call for such acts continual,
   man under such a series of trials is likely to break down at times, if
   he have no other support than the mere liberty of his will. Aristotle
   refers him to the support of acquired habits of virtue (Eth. Nic.
   II-IV), a considerable support indeed, but these habits are difficult
   to acquire, and Aristotle seems to exaggerate the facility which they
   afford of well doing, and the security that comes of them against a
   fall. So even in his pure natural condition man seems to be a feeble
   creature, that cannot be trusted to walk quite alone, but needs "some
   aid of divine providence governing him from without," and disposing
   external circumstances in his favour. The aid and kind provision of
   environment, making for morality, which would have to be looked for
   from God by man even in his pure natural condition, has been termed by
   some theologians natural grace.'

   [849] When I resolve to do a thing next Christmas what is immediately
   accomplished in my mind is the resolution to do the thing in time: but
   the thing is not done. And so of a resolution to persevere in
   well-doing.

   [850] Is immovable adherence of the will to good requisite for
   perseverance, or is it sufficient that in each successive trial the
   will be not actually moved? Is perseverance distinguishable from what
   is sometimes called confirmation in grace'?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLVII--That he who falls from Grace by Sin may be recovered
   again by Grace

   IT belongs to the same power to continue and to repair after
   interruption, as is the case with the powers of nature in regard of
   bodily health. But man perseveres in good by the aid of divine grace:
   therefore, if he has fallen by sin, he may be recovered by help of the
   same grace. [851]

   2. An agent that requires no predisposition of its subject, can imprint
   its effect on its subject, howsoever disposed. But God, requiring no
   predisposition of the subject of His action, when the subject is
   corporeal, -- as when He gives sight to the blind, or raises the dead
   to life, -- does not require any previous merit either in the will for
   the conferring of His grace, which is given without merits (Chap.
   [454]CXLIX). Therefore even after a man has fallen from grace by sin,
   God can confer on him the grace that puts the recipient in the state of
   grace, whereby sins are taken away.

   5. In the works of God there is nothing in vain, as neither in the
   works of nature, for nature has this prerogative of God. Now it would
   be in vain for anything to move with no chance of arriving at its term.
   Whatever naturally moves to a certain end, must be somehow competent to
   get there. [852] But after a man has fallen into sin, so long as the
   state of this life lasts, there remains in him an aptitude of being
   moved to good, shown by such signs as desire of good and grief at evil.
   Therefore there is some possibility of his return to good.

   6. There exists in nature no potentiality, which cannot be reduced to
   act by some natural active power. Much less is there in the human soul
   any potentiality, which is not reducible to act by the active power of
   God. But even after sin there still remains in the human soul a
   potentiality of good, because the natural powers, whereby the soul is
   related to its proper good, are not taken away by sin.

   Therefore it is said: Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be
   made white as Snow (Isai. i, 18): Charity covereth all sins (Prov. x,
   12). Nor do we ask of the Lord in vain, Forgive us our trespasses.

   Hereby is refuted the error of the Novatians, who said that man cannot
   obtain pardon for sins committed after baptism. [853]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [851] But the vigour of a natural constitution is of no avail for
   restoring life, once it is interrupted by death. And mortal sin is
   death. The whole question is whether mortal sin is such a death as to
   be, in God's ordinary providence, beyond resurrection. This point
   cannot be determined a priori. Apart from His promises, God is not
   bound ever to forgive any mortal sin. Whether He will forgive, and on
   what conditions, depends on His free good pleasure, and that is
   ascertainable only by revelation, and its vehicle, Christian tradition.

   [852] "True, in the individual, plant or animal, there are many
   potentialities frustrate and made void. That is neither here nor there
   in philosophy. Philosophy deals not with individuals but with species;
   not with Bucephalus or Alexander, but with horse, man. Enough that one
   seed ever germinates, and that all normal specimens are apt to do the
   like, meeting with proper environment." -- Ethics and Natural Law, p.
   17.

   [853] How far the pardon of post-baptismal sin was obtainable through
   the Church's ministrations, or was to be looked for only from the
   unconvenanted mercies of God, was another matter of controversy in the
   early Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLVIII--That Man cannot be delivered from Sin except by Grace

   BY mortal sin man is turned away from his last end. And to that last
   end he is set on his way only by grace.

   2. Offence is removed only by love. [854] But by mortal sin man
   quarrels with God: for it is said that God hates' sinners, inasmuch as
   He is minded to deprive them of the last end, which He has in
   preparation for them who love Him. Man then cannot rise from sin except
   by grace, whereby friendship is established between God and man.

   Hence it is said: It is I who blot out thine iniquities for my own sake
   (Isai. xliii, 25).

   Hereby is refuted the error of the Pelagians, who said that man can
   rise from sin by free will.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [854] May one not come to forgive without positively coming to love the
   offender? Yes, when the offender was a stranger to begin with. But a
   friend is thoroughly forgiven only by being re-admitted to friendship.
   At the same time we do well to recall St Thomas's prefatory remark (B.
   I, Chap. IX): -- "For declaring truths that we believe on the
   revelation of God, there are certain probable arguments ready to hand,
   which may be advanced for the exercise and consolation of believers,
   but not for the confutation of opponents."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLIX--How Man is delivered from Sin

   BECAUSE man cannot return to one opposite without retiring from the
   other, to return to the state of righteousness he must withdraw from
   sin, whereby he had declined from righteousness. And because it is
   chiefly by the will that man is set on the way to his last end, or
   turned away therefrom, he must not only withdraw from sin in exterior
   act by ceasing to sin, but he must further withdraw in will, that so he
   may rise again by grace. Now withdrawal of the will from sin means at
   once repentance for the past and a resolution to avoid sin in future.
   For if a man did not purpose to cease from sin, sin as it is in itself
   (or sin in general) would not be contrary to his will. If he were
   minded to cease from sin, but had no sorrow for sin past, that same
   particular sin of which he was guilty would not be against his will.
   [855] Now the will must withdraw from sin by taking the course contrary
   to that which led it into sin. But it was led into sin by appetite and
   delight in inferior things. Therefore it must withdraw from sin by
   certain penal inflictions. As delight drew it to consent to sin, so
   these inflictions strengthen it in abomination of sin.

   When then man by grace has obtained pardon for his sin and has been
   restored to the state of grace, he still remains bound by God's justice
   to some punishment for his sin. If of his own will he exacts this
   punishment of himself, he is thereby said to make satisfaction' to God,
   inasmuch as by punishing himself for his sin he fulfils with labour and
   pain the order instituted of heaven, which order he had transgressed by
   sinning and following his own will. But if he does not exact this
   punishment of himself it will be inflicted by God, since the domain of
   divine providence cannot be suffered to lie in disorder. The punishment
   in that case will not be called 'satisfactory,' since it will not be of
   the choice of the sufferer, but it will be called purificatory,' or
   purgatorial,' because he will be purified and purged by another
   punishing him; and so whatever was inordinate in him will be brought
   back to due order. Hence the Apostle says: If we were to judge
   ourselves, we should not be judged: but while we are judged, we are
   chastised by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with this world (1
   Cor. xi, 31).

   Nevertheless, in the process of conversion, the disgust for sin and the
   fixing of the affections on God may be so intense as that there shall
   remain no outstanding liability to punishment. For the punishment which
   one suffers after the forgiveness of sin is necessary to bring the mind
   to cleave more firmly to good, -- punishments being medicines, -- as
   also for the observance of the order of justice in the punishment of
   the sinner. But love of God, especially when it is vehement and strong,
   is sufficient to establish man's mind in good; and intense disgust for
   a past fault carries with it great sorrow for the same. Hence by the
   vehemence of the love of God and hatred for sin there is excluded any
   further need of satisfactory or purgatorial punishment. [856] And
   though the vehemence be not so great as totally to bar the punishment,
   nevertheless, the greater the vehemence, so much less of punishment
   will suffice.

   But what we do through our friends we are reckoned to do of ourselves,
   inasmuch as friendship makes two one in heart, and this is especially
   true of the love of charity: therefore, as a man may make satisfaction
   to God of himself, so also may he do it through another, especially in
   case of necessity: for the punishment which his friend suffers on his
   account he reckons as his own punishment; and thus punishment is not
   wanting to him in that he has compassion for the sufferings of his
   friend, and that all the more for his being the cause of his friend's
   suffering. And again the affection of charity in him who suffers for
   his friend makes his satisfaction more acceptable to God than it would
   be if he were suffering for his own doings: for the one is an effort of
   spontaneous charity, the other an acquiescence in necessity. Hence we
   learn that one man may make satisfaction for another, provided both of
   them be in charity. Hence the saying of the Apostle: Bear ye one
   another's burdens, and so ye shall fulfil the law of Christ (Gal. vi,
   2).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [855] This remark tells against Luther, whose proposition: "The height
   of penance is not to do the thing again: the best penance is a new
   life," was condemned by Leo X less for what it affirms than for what it
   virtually excludes.

   [856] The very vehemence of love and sorrow, however, prompts this sort
   of penitent to make satisfaction by bodily penances: he will not
   indulge himself, or take his after-life easy; even if he thought all
   his obligations cancelled, he would still insist on paying more.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLX--That it is reasonably reckoned a Man's own Fault if he be
   not converted to God, although he cannot be converted without Grace

   SINCE no one can be set on the way to his last end without the aid of
   divine grace, or without it have the necessary means of reaching that
   end, as are faith, hope, love and perseverance, some might think that
   man is not to blame for being destitute of these gifts, especially
   seeing that he cannot merit the assistance of divine grace, nor be
   converted to God unless God convert him: for none is responsible for
   that which depends on another. But allow this, and many absurdities
   follow. It follows that the man who has neither faith nor hope nor love
   of God, nor perseverance in good, still does not deserve punishment:
   whereas it is expressly said: He that believeth not the Son shall not
   see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him (John iii, 36). And since
   none reaches the end of happiness without the aforesaid endowments, it
   would follow further that there are some who neither attain to
   happiness nor yet suffer punishment of God: the contrary whereof is
   shown from what will be said to all present at the judgement of God:
   Come . . . . possess ye the kingdom prepared for you, or, Depart
   . . . . into everlasting fire (Matt. xxv, 34-41).

   To solve this doubt, we must observe that though one can neither merit
   divine grace beforehand, nor acquire it by movement of his free will,
   still he can hinder himself from receiving it: for it is said of some:
   They have said unto God, Depart from us, we will not have the knowledge
   of thy ways' (Job xxi, 14). And since it is in the power of free will
   to hinder the reception of divine grace or not to hinder it, not
   undeservedly may it be reckoned a man's own fault, if he puts an
   obstacle in the way of the reception of grace. For God on His part is
   ready to give grace to all men: He wills all men to be saved and to
   come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Tim. ii, 4). But they alone are
   deprived of grace, who in themselves raise an obstacle to grace. So
   when the sun lights up the world, any evil that comes to a man who
   shuts his eyes is counted his own fault, although he could not see
   unless the sunlight first came in upon him. [857]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [857] Of the eternal lot of such as, wilfully sinning against the
   light, reject the known truth of their Saviour, there never can he any
   doubt. The doubt and difficulty begins when we turn to others, who
   never have heard of Christ, or who, however much they have heard of
   Him, never seem to have gathered tidings sufficient and adequate to
   their minds. Their situation, to the Christian thinker who mixes in
   modern life and knows men, is one of the darkest regions of his
   theology. He can but fall back on his Lord's precept: Judge not (Matt.
   vii, 1). On the dichotomy, Matt. xxv, 31-46, I quote Scripture Manuals
   for Catholic Schools, St Matthew, pp. 212-3: "But why is no mention
   made of faith, a condition of salvation upon which our Saviour and His
   apostles otherwise insist so strongly? Probably Lactantius and Origen
   are right in their conjecture, that though the Saviour of all is
   likewise judge of all (Acts xvii, 31), and will gather all nations (v.
   32) before His judgement-seat, yet the sheep and goats here
   particularised are good and bad Christians. The heathen who
   contumaciously reject Christ are already judged and condemned (John
   iii, 18: Mark xvi, 16). Of the heathens to whom Christ has not been
   preached, we get no information here." St Thomas himself habitually
   views the Christian in every man; and hardly conceives, still less can
   be considered here to discuss, the position of him who is not a
   Christian and a Catholic.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLXI--That a Man already in Mortal Sin cannot avoid more Mortal
   Sin without Grace [858]

   WHEN it is said that it is in the power of free will to avoid putting
   obstacles to grace, that saying is to be understood of those in whom
   the natural faculty is unimpaired by sin. [859] But if the will has
   fallen into evil courses by some previous inordinate act, it will not
   be altogether in its power to avoid putting obstacles in the way of
   grace. For though for some momentary occasion it may abstain from some
   particular act of sin by its own power, nevertheless, if left long to
   itself, it will fall into sin; and by sin an obstacle is put to grace.
   For when the mind of man turns aside from the state of righteousness,
   it clearly puts itself out of relation with its due end. Thus what
   ought to be the prime object of its affections, as being its last end,
   comes to be less loved than that other object to which it has
   inordinately turned, making of it another last end. Whatever in such a
   posture of the mind occurs to fit in with the inordinate end, however
   inconsistent with the due end, will be chosen, unless the will be
   brought back to due order, so as to prefer the due end to all others,
   and that is an effect of grace. But the choice of anything inconsistent
   with the last end puts an obstacle in the way of grace, as grace goes
   to turn one in the direction of the end. Hence after sin a man cannot
   abstain from all further sin before by grace he is brought back to due
   order.

   Moreover, when the mind is inclined to a thing, it is no longer
   impartial between two alternatives. And that to which the mind is more
   inclined it chooses, unless by a rational discussion, not unattended
   with trouble, it is withdrawn from taking that side: hence sudden
   emergencies afford the best sign of the inward bent of the mind. But it
   is impossible for the mind of man to be so continually watchful as
   rationally to discuss whatever it ought to do or not to do.
   Consequently the mind will at times choose that to which it is inclined
   by the present inclination: so, if the inclination be to sin, it will
   not stand long clear of sin, thereby putting an obstacle in the way of
   grace, unless it be brought back to the state of righteousness.

   Further we must consider the assaults of passion, the allurements of
   sense, the endless occasions of evil-doing, the ready incitements of
   sin, sure to prevail, unless the will be withheld from them by a firm
   adherence to the last end, which is the work of grace.

   Hence appears the folly of the Pelagian view, that a man in sin can go
   on avoiding further sins without grace. On the contrary the Lord bids
   us pray: Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

   But though persons in sin cannot of their own power help putting
   obstacles in the way of grace, unless they be forestalled by some aid
   of grace, [860] still this lack of power is imputable to them for a
   fault, because it is left behind in them by a fault going before; as a
   drunken man is not excused from murder, committed in drunkenness, when
   he gets drunk by fault of his own. [861] Besides, though this person in
   sin has it not in his unaided power altogether to avoid sin, still he
   has power here and now to avoid this or that sin: hence whatever he
   commits, he voluntarily commits, and the fault is imputed to him not
   undeservedly. [862]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [858] This chapter is complementary to Chapter CLVI. There we saw that
   a man in the state of grace still needs a succession of actual graces
   to enable him to observe the law of God on essential points steadily
   and to the end. Here we learn that a man in mortal sin needs actual
   graces to prevent his falling deeper. This chapter follows from the
   former as the less from the greater: for the victory that the man in
   grace cannot gain, still less can the sinner gain. The two chapters
   together argue that, left to his own unaided nature, unsupported by the
   movements of actual grace, every man capable of mortal sin will at
   times commit such sin.

   [859] Naturalis potentia integra. Among theologians, natura integra
   means a nature such as Adam had before the fall.

   [860] It may be asked: How can he be forestalled by any aid of grace,
   who puts obstacles in the way of grace, by being already in sin and
   going on to fresh sin? The answer is, that grace and good will are
   strong enough to break down any obstacle. But in this case a great
   grace is needed, e.g., a thorough fright. And that is the rationale of
   the sermons on hell that are preached in Lenten missions. They are as
   heavy siege artillery to breach the castle of the strong man armed
   (Luke xi, 21).

   [861] Akin to this is the problem of the cauterised conscience,'
   discussed by St Alphonsus Liguori in the opening of his Moral Theology,
   -- the imputability of sin to one who has become so habituated to it as
   to commit sin as a matter of course on every occasion, without giving
   it a second thought, with no hesitation and no remorse.

   [862] The upshot of the foregoing chapter is this, that a man in mortal
   sin has got himself into a false position; and his position will go on
   growing morally worse unless he makes strenuous efforts to get out of
   it, turning to God and asking His aid: if he will not do that, he must
   be answerable for the growing deterioration of his state. He sins
   therefore, but it is not always easy to say precisely when he sins. In
   general, he sins when he could help himself to do better, and will not.

   CHAPTER CLXII--That some Men God delivers from Sin, and some He leaves
   in Sin

   THOUGH the sinner raises an obstacle to grace, and by the exigence of
   the order of things ought not to receive grace, nevertheless, inasmuch
   as God can work setting aside the connatural order of things, as when
   He gives sight to the blind, or raises the dead, He sometimes out of
   the abundance of His goodness forestalls by the assistance of His grace
   even those who raise an obstacle to it, turning them away from evil and
   converting them to good. And as He does not give sight to all the
   blind, nor heal all the sick, that in those whom He heals the work of
   His power may appear, and in the others the order of nature may be
   observed, so He does not forestall by His aid all who hinder grace, to
   their turning away from evil and conversion to good, but some He so
   forestalls, wishing in them His mercy to appear, while in others He
   would have the order of justice made manifest. [863] Hence the Apostle
   says: God, though willing to show his wrath, and to make his power
   known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath, fitted for
   destruction, that he might show forth the riches of his glory upon the
   vessels of mercy, which he hath prepared unto glory (Rom. ix, 22, 23).

   But when, of men who are enthralled in the same sins, God forestalls
   and converts some, and endures, or permits, others to go their way
   according to the order of things, we should not enquire the reason why
   He converts these and not those: for that depends on His sheer will,
   just as from His sheer will it proceeded that, when all things were
   made out of nothing, some things were made in a position of greater
   advantage than others (digniora). [864] Hence again the apostle says:
   Hath not the potter power over the clay, to make of the same lump one
   vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour? (Rom. ix, 21.)

   Hereby is refuted the error of Origen, who said that the reason why
   some were converted to God, and not others, was to be sought in divers
   works that their souls had done before they were united with their
   bodies, a theory already set aside (B. II, Chapp. [455]XLIV,
   [456]LXXXIII).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [863] May we not however observe that as in the natural order of things
   God has provided, in the acquired skill of physicians and surgeons,
   certain ordinary means for healing the sick and even giving sight to
   the blind, so in the supernatural order He has provided an ordinary
   means for the justification of the sinner in the Sacraments of Baptism
   and Penance? Miracles are exceptional, but the forgiveness of sins is
   part of the Church's daily ministry; and the gratia praeveniens,
   necessary to bring the sinner to avail himself of this ministry, has to
   be presupposed as part of the institution. The fuller and fuller
   recognition of this consoling truth is a typical instance of the
   development' of the mind of the Church. On the texts from Romans quoted
   here cf. Notes on St Paul pp. 393-397.

   [864] Even if all material things were made on a dead level of hot gas,
   still in that uniform medium there was a promise and potency of
   differentiation, which can have depended only on the arbitrary will of
   the Creator. But query, -- Could differentiation ever have come out of
   a uniform medium? Or civilisation out of uniform savagery?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CLXIII--That God is Cause of Sin to no Man

   THOUGH there are some sinners whom God does not convert to Himself, but
   leaves them in their sins according to their deserts, still He does not
   induce them to sin.

   1. Men sin by deviating from God their last end. But as every agent
   acts to its own proper and befitting end, it is impossible for God's
   action to avert any from their ultimate end in God.

   2. Good cannot be the cause of evil, nor God the cause of sin.

   3. All the wisdom and goodness of man is derived from the wisdom and
   goodness of God, being a likeness thereof. But it is repugnant to the
   wisdom and goodness of man to make any one to sin: therefore much more
   to divine wisdom and goodness.

   4. A fault always arises from some defect of the proximate agent, not
   from any defect of the prime agent. Thus the fault of limping comes
   from some defect of the shin-bone, not from the locomotor power, from
   which power however is whatever perfection of movement appears in the
   limping. But the proximate agent of human sin is the will. The sinful
   defect then is from the will of man, not from God, who is the prime
   agent, of whom however is whatever point of perfect action appears in
   the act of sin. [865]

   Hence it is said: Say not, He himself hath led me astray: for he hath
   no use for sinful men: He hath commanded none to do impiously, and he
   hath not given to any man license to sin (Ecclus xv, 12, 21): Let none,
   when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God: for God tempteth no
   man to evil (James i, 13).

   Still there are passages of Scripture, from which it might seem that
   God is to some men the cause of sin. Thus it is said: I have hardened
   the heart of Pharaoh and his servants (Exod. x, 1): Blind the heart of
   this people, and make its ears dull, and close its eyes, lest perchance
   it see with its eyes, and be converted, and I heal it: Thou hast made
   us wander from thy ways: Thou hast hardened our heart, that we should
   not fear thee (Isai. vi, 10: lxiii, 17): God delivered them over to a
   reprobate sense, to do those things which are not seemly (Rom. i, 28).
   All these passages are to be understood as meaning that God does not
   bestow on some the help for avoiding sin which He bestows on others.
   This help is not merely the infusion of grace, but also an exterior
   guardianship, whereby the occasions of sin are providentially removed
   from a man's path. God also aids man against sin by the natural light
   of reason, and other natural goods that He bestows on man. [866] When
   then He withdraws these aids from some, as their conduct deserves that
   he should, according to the exigency of His justice, He is said to
   harden them, or to blind them.

   propriety enjoy the record of the exploits of heroes whom we cannot

   CHAPTER CLXIV--Of Predestination, Reprobation, and Divine Election

   SINCE it has been shown that by the action of God some are guided to
   their last end with the aid of grace, while others, bereft of that same
   aid of grace, fall away from their last end; and at the same time all
   things that are done by God are from eternity foreseen and ordained by
   His wisdom, as has also been shown, it needs must be that the aforesaid
   distinction of men has been from eternity ordained of God. Inasmuch
   therefore as He has from eternity pre-ordained some to be guided to the
   last end, He is said to have predestined' them. Hence the Apostle says:
   Who hath predestined us to the adoption of sons, according to the
   purpose of his will (Eph. i, 5). But those to whom from eternity He has
   arranged not to give grace, [867] He is said to have reprobated,' or
   hated,' according to the text: I have loved Jacob, and hated Esau
   (Malach. i, 2). In point of this distinction, inasmuch as some He has
   reprobated and some He has predestined, we speak of the divine
   election,' of which it is said: He hath elected us in him before the
   constitution of the world (Eph. i, 4). Thus it appears that
   predestination and election and reprobation is a part of divine
   providence, according as by the said providence men are guided to their
   last end. And it may be shown that predestination and election do not
   induce necessity, by the same arguments whereby it was shown that
   divine providence does not take away contingency from creation (Chap.
   [457]LXXII).

   But that predestination and election have no cause in any human merits
   may be shown, not only by the fact that the grace of God, an effect of
   predestination, is not preceded by any merits, but precedes all merit,
   but also by this further fact, that the divine will and providence is
   the first cause of all things that are made. Nothing can be cause of
   the will and providence of God; although of the effects of providence,
   and of the effects of predestination, one effect may be cause of
   another. [868] For who hath first given to him, and recompense shall be
   made him? For if him and by him and in him are all things: to him be
   glory forever, Amen (Rom. xi, 35, 36).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [867] That is, not efficacious' grace, or grace with which they will
   finally comply, though He gives them 'sufficient' grace for salvation.

   [868] There are two steps in predestination: (1) God's determination to
   give grace; (2) God's determination to give glory according to the
   measure of grace given and taken. The first determination is entirely
   gratuitous, and independent of all regard to merit in the recipient.
   This all Catholics confess. The second determination has been matter of
   great controversy among Catholic theologians, whether it is in view of
   or irrespective of foreseen merits in the predestinate.

OF GOD IN HIS REVELATION

   CHAPTER I--Preface [869]

   LO, these things that have been said are but a part of his ways; and
   whereas we have heard scarce one little drop of his speech, who shall
   be able to look upon the thunder of his greatness? (Job xxvi, 14.) It
   is the nature of the human mind to gather its knowledge from sensible
   things; nor can it of itself arrive at the direct vision of the divine
   substance, as that substance is in itself raised above all sensible
   things and all other beings to boot, and beyond all proportion with
   them. But because the perfect good of man consists in his knowing God
   in such way as he can, there is given man a way of ascending to the
   knowledge of God, to the end that so noble a creature should not seem
   to exist altogether in vain, unable to attain the proper end of his
   existence. The way is this, that as all the perfections of creatures
   descend in order from God, who is the height of perfection, man should
   begin from the lower creatures, and ascend by degrees, and so advance
   to the knowledge of God. Of this descent of perfections from God there
   are two processes. One is on the part of the first origin of things:
   for the divine wisdom, to make things perfect, produced them in order,
   that the universe might consist of a complete round of creatures from
   highest to lowest. The other process belongs to the things themselves:
   for, as causes are nobler than effects, the first and highest products
   of causation, while falling short of the First Cause, which is God,
   nevertheless are superior to the effects which they themselves produce;
   and so on in order, until we come to the lowest of creatures. [870] And
   because in that roof and crown of all things' (summo rerum vertice),
   God, we find the most perfect unity; and everything is stronger and
   more excellent, the more thoroughly it is one; it follows that
   diversity and variety increase in things, the further they are removed
   from Him who is the first principle of all. Therefore the process of
   derivation of creatures from their first principle may be represented
   by a sort of pyramid, with unity at the apex, and the widest
   multiplicity at the base. [871] And thus in the diversity of things
   there is apparent a diversity of ways, beginning from one principle and
   terminating in different terms. By these ways then our understanding
   can ascend to God.

   But the weakness of our understanding prevents us from knowing these
   ways perfectly. Our knowledge begins with sense; and sense is concerned
   with exterior accidents (phenomena), which are of themselves sensible,
   as colour, smell, and the like. With difficulty can our mind penetrate
   through such exterior phenomena to an inner knowledge of things, even
   where it perfectly grasps by sense their accidents. [872] Much less
   will it be able to attain to a comprehension of the natures of those
   objects of which we perceive only a few phenomena by sense; [873] and
   still less of those natures no accidents of which lie open to sense,
   but certain effects which they produce, inadequate to their power,
   enable us to recognise them. [874] But even though the very natures of
   things were known to us, still we should have but slight knowledge of
   their order, of their mutual relations, and direction by divine
   providence to their final end, since we cannot penetrate the plan of
   Providence. [875] The ways themselves then being so imperfectly known
   to us, how shall we travel by them to any perfect knowledge of the
   First Beginning of all things, which transcends all created ways and is
   out of all proportion with them? Even though we knew the said ways
   perfectly, we should still fall short of perfect knowledge of their
   origin and starting-point. [876]

   Feeble and inadequate then being any knowledge to which man could
   arrive by these ways, God has revealed to men facts about Himself which
   surpass human understanding; in which revelation there is observed an
   order of gradual transition from imperfect to perfect. In man's present
   state, in which his understanding is tied to sense, his mind cannot
   possibly be elevated to any clear discernment of truths that surpass
   all proportions of sense: in that state the revelation is given him,
   not to be understood, but to be heard and believed. [877] Only when he
   is delivered from the thraldom of sensible things, will he be elevated
   to an intuition of revealed truth. Thus there is a threefold knowledge
   that man may have of divine things. The first is an ascent through
   creatures to the knowledge of God by the natural light of reason. The
   second is a descent of divine truth by revelation to us; truth
   exceeding human understanding; truth accepted, not as demonstrated to
   sight, but as orally delivered for belief. The third is an elevation of
   the human mind to a perfect insight into things revealed.

   This triple knowledge is suggested by the text above quoted from Job.
   These things that have been said are but a part of his ways, applies to
   that knowledge whereby our understanding ascends by way of creatures to
   a knowledge of God. And because we know these ways but imperfectly,
   that is rightly put in, but a part, for we know in part (1 Cor. xiii,
   9). The next clause, and whereas we have heard scarce one little drop
   of his speech, refers to the second knowledge, whereby divine truths
   are revealed for our belief by means of oral declaration: for faith is
   hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ (Rom. x, 17). And because
   this imperfect knowledge is an effluent from that perfect knowledge
   whereby divine truth is seen in itself, -- a revelation from God by the
   ministry of angels, who see the face of the Father (Matt. xviii, 10),
   [878] he rightly terms it a drop, as it is written: In that day the
   mountains shall drop sweetness (Joel iii, 18). But because revelation
   does not take in all the mysteries which the angels and the rest of the
   blessed behold in the First Truth, there is a meaning in the
   qualification, one little drop: for it is said: Who shall magnify him
   as he is from the beginning? many things are hidden greater than these,
   for we see but a few of his works (Ecclus xliii, 35): I have many
   things to say to you, but ye cannot hear them now (John xvi, 2). These
   few points that are revealed to us are set forth under similitudes and
   obscurities of expression, so as to be accessible only to the studious,
   hence the expressive addition, scarce, marking the difficulty of the
   enquiry. The third clause, who shall be able to look upon the thunder
   of his greatness? points to the third knowledge, whereby the First
   Truth shall be known, not as believed, but as seen: for we shall see
   him as he is (1 John iii, 2). No little fragment of the divine
   mysteries will be perceived, but the Divine Majesty itself, and all the
   perfect array of good things: hence the Lord said to Moses: I will show
   thee all good (Exod. xxxiii, 19). Rightly therefore we have in the text
   the words look upon his greatness. And this truth shall not be proposed
   to man under the covering of any veils, but quite plain: hence the Lord
   says to His disciples: The hour cometh, when I will no longer speak to
   you in proverbs, but will tell you openly of my Father (John xvi, 25):
   hence [the] word thunder in the text, indicative of this plain showing.

   The words of the above text are adapted to our purpose: for whereas in
   the previous books we have spoken of divine things according as natural
   reason can arrive through creatures to the knowledge of them, -- but
   that imperfectly, according to the limitations of the author's
   capacity, so that we can say with Job: Lo, these things that have been
   said are but a part of his ways; it remains now to treat of truths
   divinely revealed for our belief, truths transcending human
   understanding. And the words of the text are a guide to our procedure
   in this matter. As we have scarce heard the truth in the statements of
   Holy Scripture, those being as it were one little drop coming down to
   us, and no man in this life can look upon the thunder of his greatness,
   our method will be as follows. Taking as first principles the
   statements of Holy Scripture, we will endeavour to penetrate their
   hidden meaning to the best of our ability, without presuming to claim
   perfect knowledge of the matter. Our proofs will rest on the authority
   of Holy Scripture, not on natural reason: still it will be our duty to
   show that our assertions are not contrary to natural reason, and
   thereby defend them against the assaults of unbelievers. And since
   natural reason ascends by creatures to the knowledge of God, while the
   knowledge of faith descends by divine revelation from God to us, and it
   is the same way up and down, we must proceed in these matters of
   supra-rational belief by the same way in which we proceeded in our
   rational enquiries concerning God. Thus we shall treat first of the
   supra-rational truths that are proposed for our belief concerning God
   Himself, as the confession of the Trinity [Chapp. I - XXVI: cf. I,
   Chap. [458]IX: this answers to Book I]. Secondly, of the supra-rational
   works done by God, as the work of the Incarnation and its consequences
   [Chapp. XXVII - LXXVIII: answering to Book II]. Thirdly, of the
   supra-rational events expected at the end of human history, as the
   resurrection and glorification of bodies, the everlasting bliss of
   souls, and events therewith connected [Chapp. LXXIX - XCVII: answering
   to Book III].

   [869] This fourth book is wanting in the mutilated Bergamo autograph in
   the Vatican Library.

   [870] See B. III, Chap. LXXVIII, with notes.

   [871] A somewhat free translation, still, I think, a fair rendering of
   the sense of the Latin: Oportet igitur processum emanationis a Deo
   uniri quidem in ipso principio, multiplicari autem secundum res infimas
   ad quas terminatur. How reconcile this statement with the law of
   biology, that simplicity (one organ for all work) prevails in the lower
   types, differentiation in the higher? A reconciliation may be sought
   from St Thomas himself, B. III, Chap. LXXVII, where he argues that
   perfection implies unity of direction, with multiplicity of
   subordinates, -- in one word, organisation. Every organism is a One in
   Many. The more perfect the organism, the more perfect the unity, as St
   Thomas says, i.e., the more perfect the central control. And this
   central control again is more perfect, the greater the variety and
   multiplicity and power of subordinates over which this unifying control
   effectually extends. In the lowest types of creatures, we get either
   multiplicity with little of unity, as in a heap of stones, e.g., the
   moraine on the side of a high hill; or unity with little of
   multiplicity, as in the first elements of matter, -- electrons,' or
   what ever else they may be. God, the Sovereign Unity, is likewise
   virtually all things (B. I, Chapp. XXXI, LIII, LIV).

   [872] For instance, such a piece of inner knowledge' as the reduction
   of colour to vibrations, took civilised man centuries to learn.

   [873] The stars, for example.

   [874] He means the angels. Sensu capi and percipiantur (not
   participetur) are the readings followed.

   [875] To transfer the remark from physics to another domain, -- though
   we had mastered the whole of history, how much could we read therein of
   the divine counsels and plan of government? In every direction, does
   not the universe and man's life in it grow more puzzling, the more we
   know of it, if we seek to trace any exact economy and purpose? Hence St
   Thomas argues the need of divine revelation.

   [876] We know so much more of the ways of creatures than was known in
   St Thomas's time, so much more of history and antiquities, so much more
   astronomy, dynamics, chemistry, molecular physics, biology: has there
   been any proportionate increase in our knowledge of God? Has theology
   grown with the growth of other sciences? The question is one to furnish
   matter for a long and curious dissertation, in which the results,
   professedly arrived at, would differ widely according to the various
   theological preconceptions, whether of faith or prejudice, with which
   the several writers took up their pens. Yet an outline statement of
   results may be hazarded. Growth in truth must surely bring out truth.
   If theology has gained nothing by the advance of 'science,' either
   'science' or theology must be condemned. Theology then has gained in at
   least three respects. It has gained in the overthrow of superstition,
   notably astrology and witchcraft. It has gained in a better
   appreciation of everything which, for want of a better name, I must
   call vastness' in God, -- His immensity, filling all stellar space; His
   incomprehensibility; His all-embracing, all-sustaining wisdom; and His
   tremendous power. Once more, theology has gained in kindliness.
   Harshness and narrowness of sympathy so often proceed, not from any
   particular love of truth or zeal for justice, but simply from want of
   experience, -- from the inexperience of a youthful and untravelled
   mind. With the weight of past ages upon us, the youngest of the really
   educated in our theological schools is no longer young in the
   depreciatory sense of that term. We have found out that men and women
   are not the easy subjects of moral dissection that unpractised eyes
   take them for. We recognise the wisdom of the Judge who made
   proclamation to the bystanders in court, Judge not (Matt. vii, 1).
   Accidentally, a quarrel has arisen between theology and modern science.
   This quarrel marks no intrinsic opposition: it is the fault of persons.
   Revealed theology is essentially a distinct kingdom from secular
   science. But it is a frontier kingdom; and the two kingdoms cannot but
   have relations with one another. These relations have been unfriendly,
   not without some fault on both sides. Theologians have repeated what
   other theologians have said before them, not considering the advance of
   physical science, or of history, since the authors whom they follow
   lived and wrote. Now if it were mere matter of dogmatic, or revealed,
   theology, this disregard of physics would be justified; but when it is
   question of providing, say, a biological setting for a theological
   truth, this neglect of modern progress in biology becomes deplorable.
   On the other hand, it goes without saying that some votaries of
   physics, or history, or criticism, cherish an acrimonious hatred for
   divine revelation, and even the very name of God; and chiefly value
   science as a weapon of offence against theology, -- thereby assuming a
   mental attitude the reverse of scientific. For the provisional
   adjustment of the contested frontier, we seem to require a sort of
   boundary commission of physicists, historians, critics, philosophers,
   and theologians working with one common endeavour, as the Jesuit rule
   lays it down, ut suus veritati sit locus, non ut in ea re superiores
   videantur. Such a commission would sit permanently in a Catholic
   University, if ever such an institution could be planted anywhere in
   the British Isles.

   [877] The mystery which is beyond understanding is likewise beyond
   imagination. The exercise of imagination upon the mysteries of faith is
   a necessary and wholesome process: it is part of mental prayer. But the
   result remains quite inadequate to the object. Forgetting this piece of
   psychology, people take for objectively incredible that which is
   subjectively unimaginable: and the childish shortcomings and vagaries
   of the imagination are mistaken for absurdities in the mystery proposed
   for belief, as a boy astronomer might mistake the effect of chromatic
   aberration in his telescope for colours in the stars. Dulness of
   imagination is a great obstacle to religious belief.

   [878] The law given on Sinai being ordained, ordered, set forth in
   detail, by angels (Gal. iii, 19: Heb. ii, 2: Acts vii, 53). The angels
   may have been the immediate authors of the prodigies on Mount Sinai:
   nay, an angel there may have spoken in the place of God (Exod. xix, 16
   sq.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER II--Of Generation, Paternity, and Sonship in God

   WE find in the New Testament frequent attestations that Jesus Christ is
   the Son of God: Matt. xi, 27: Mark i, 1: John iii, 35: v, 21: Rom. i,
   1: Heb. i, 1. And the same, though more rarely, in the Old Testament:
   Prov. xxx, 4: Ps. ii, 7: Ps. lxxxviii, 27. On the two last passages we
   must understand that as some expressions in the context may suit David,
   others not at all, these words are spoken of David and Solomon,
   according to the custom of Scripture, as prefiguring some one else, in
   whom all that is said is fulfilled.

   And because the names of Father' and Son' are consequent upon some
   generative process, Scripture has not omitted to speak of divine
   generation, Ps. ii, 7: Prov. viii, 24, 25: John i, 14, 18: Heb. i, 6.
   [879]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [879] St Thomas also appeals to Isaias lxvi, 9, in the Vulgate reading.
   He says: "To whatever meaning the term generation' is applied, still
   the reasoning put in the mouth of God remains firm and stable, that if
   He gives generation to others, He should not Himself be barren: since a
   perfection must always exist in a nobler way in the cause than in the
   things caused." But the reading in Isaias is uncertain, and the
   application to the eternal generation of the Word has seemed to many,
   even Catholic commentators, not to suit the text. Revelation is
   gradual, and must not be antedated.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER III--That the Son of God is God

   WE must not however fail to observe that divine Scripture uses the
   above names also to denote the creation of things: thus it is said: Who
   is the father of rain? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? From
   whose womb hath ice gone forth, and who hath begotten the frost from
   heaven? (Job xxxviii, 28.) Lest then by these names of paternity,
   sonship, and generation, nothing further should be understood than an
   act of creative energy, Scripture has further not failed to call Him
   God also, whom it has named Son and Begotten, -- John i, 1, 14: Titus
   iii, 11: Ps. xliv, 7, 8 [Heb. i, 8, 9]: Isa. ix, 6. And that Jesus
   Christ is the Son of God, Peter confessed, Matt. xvi, 16.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTERS IV, IX--The Opinion of Photinus touching the Son of God, and
   its rejection [880]

   IT is customary in Scripture for those who are justified by divine
   grace to be called sons of God, -- John i, 12: Rom. viii, 1: 1 John
   iii, 1: and begotten of God, James i, 1: 1 John iii, 9; and, what is
   more wonderful, even the name of Godhead is ascribed to them, Exod.
   vii, 1: Ps. lxxxi, 6: John x, 35. Going upon this usage, some
   wrong-headed men took up the opinion that Jesus Christ was a mere man,
   that His existence began with His birth of the Virgin Mary, that He
   gained divine honours above the rest of men through the merit of His
   blessed life, that like other men He was the Son of God by the Spirit
   of adoption, and by grace was born of God, and by a certain
   assimilation to God is called in the Scriptures God, not by nature, but
   by some participation in the divine goodness, as is also said of the
   saints, 2 Pet. i, 4. And this position they endeavoured to confirm by
   authority of Holy Scripture: All power is given to me in heaven and on
   earth (Matt. xxviii, 18): but, say they, if He were God before all
   time, He would not have received power in time. Also it is said of the
   Son that He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and
   predestinated the Son of God in power (Rom. i, 3, 4): but what is made
   and predestinated is not eternal. Again the text, He was made obedient
   unto death, even the death of the cross: wherefore hath God exalted
   him, and given him the name that is above every name (Phil. ii, 8, 9),
   seems to show that by merit of His obedience and suffering He was
   granted divine honours and raised above all. Peter too says: Let all
   the House of Israel most certainly know that this Jesus, whom ye have
   crucified, God hath made Lord and Christ (Acts ii, 36). He seems then
   to have become God in time, not to have been born so before all ages.
   They also allege in support of their opinion those texts of Scripture
   which seem to point to defect in Christ, as that He was carried in
   woman's womb (Luke i, 42: ii, 5), that He grew in age (Luke ii, 52),
   that He suffered hunger (Luke iv, 2) and fatigue (John iv, 6), and was
   subject to death, that he continually advanced (Luke ii, 40, 52), that
   He confessed He did not know the day of judgement (Mark xiii, 32), that
   He was stricken with fear of death (Luke xxii, 42, 44), and other
   weaknesses inadmissible in one who was God by nature.

   But careful study of the words of Holy Scripture shows that there is
   not that meaning in them which these Photinians have supposed. For when
   Solomon says: The abysses as yet were not, and I (Wisdom) was already
   conceived (Prov. viii, 24), he sufficiently shows that this generation
   took place before all corporeal things. And though an endeavour has
   been to wrest away these and other testimonies by saying that they are
   to be understood of predestination, in the sense that before the
   creation of the world it was arranged that the Son of God should be
   born of the Virgin Mary, not that her Son existed before the world;
   nevertheless the words which follow show that He was before Mary not
   only in predestination, but really. For it follows: When he weighed the
   foundations of the earth, I was with him arranging all things: but if
   He had existed in predestination only, He could have done nothing. This
   conclusion may be drawn also from the Evangelist John: for, that none
   might take as referring to predestination the words, In the beginning
   was the Word, he adds: All things were made by him, and without him was
   made nothing: which could not be true, had He not real existence before
   the world was. Likewise from the texts John iii, 13: vi, 38, it appears
   that He had real existence ere He descended from heaven. Besides,
   whereas according to the above-mentioned position, a man by the merit
   of His life was advanced to be God, the Apostle contrariwise declares
   that, being God, He was made man: Being in the form of God, he thought
   it no robbery, etc. (Phil. ii, 6.)

   Again, among the rest who had the grace of God, Moses had it
   abundantly, of whom it is said: The Lord spoke to Moses face to face,
   as a man is wont to speak to his friend (Exod. xxxiii, 11). If then
   Jesus Christ were only called Son of God' by reason of the grace of
   adoption, as is the, case with other Saints, Moses might be called Son
   of God' on the same title as Christ, allowing all the while that Christ
   was endowed with more abundant grace: for among the rest of the saints
   one is filled with greater grace than another, and still they are all
   called Sons of God.' But Moses is not called Son' on the same title as
   Christ: for the Apostle distinguishes Christ from Moses as the son from
   the servant: Moses indeed was faithful in his house as a servant: but
   Christ as the Son in his own house (Heb. iii, 5).

   The like argument may be gathered from many other places of Scripture,
   where Christ is styled Son of God' in a singular manner above others,
   as at His baptism, This is my beloved Son (Matt. iii, 17); or where He
   is called the Only-begotten,' -- The Only-begotten Son, who is in the
   bosom of the Father, he hath declared (John i, 18): for were He Son in
   a general way, as others are, He could not be called Only-begotten':
   sometimes too He is designated as First-born,' to show that there is a
   derivation of sonship from Him to others: To be made conformable to the
   image of his Son, that he may be the first-born among many brethren
   (Rom. viii, 29): God hath sent his Son, that we might receive the
   adoption of sons (Gal. iv, 4: which texts show that He, by the likeness
   of whose Sonship others are called sons, is Son Himself after another
   way than they.

   Furthermore, in the Holy Scriptures some works are set down as so
   peculiarly proper to God as to be never attributable to any one else,
   e.g., the sanctification of souls and the forgiveness of sins: for it
   is said, I am the Lord who sanctify you (Levit. xx, 8): I am he who
   blot out thy sins for mine own sake (Isai. xliii, 25). Yet both these
   works Scripture attributes to Christ, Heb. ii, 11: xiii, 12. He
   declared of Himself that He had the power of forgiving sins, and proved
   His assertion by a miracle (Matt. ix, 1-8); and the angel foretold of
   Him that He should save his people from their sins (Matt. i, 21).
   Christ therefore as sanctifier and forgiver of sins is not called God'
   in the same sense as others are called gods,' who are sanctified and
   whose sins are forgiven, but as one having the power and nature
   Godhead.

   As for those testimonies of Scripture whereby the Photinians
   endeavoured to show that Christ is not God by nature, they do not serve
   their purpose: for we confess in Christ the Son of God after the
   Incarnation two natures, a human and a divine: hence there are
   predicated of Him at once attributes proper to God, by reason of His
   divine nature, and attributes seeming to involve some defect, or
   shortcoming, by reason of His human nature. Thus His saying, All power
   is given to me, does not mean that He then received the power as a new
   thing to Him, but that the power, which, the Son of God had enjoyed
   from all eternity, had now begun to appear in the same Son made man, by
   the victory which He had gained over death by rising again. [881]
   Hereby it is also clear that Peter's saying (Acts ii, 36) of God having
   made him [Jesus] Lord and Christ, is to be referred to the Son in His
   human nature, in which He began to have in time what in His nature He
   had from eternity. [882]

   Nor does the Apostle (Rom. i, 3) say absolutely that the Son was made,'
   but that He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh by the
   assumption of human nature. Hence the following words, predestinated
   Son of God, apply to the Son in His human nature: for that union of
   human nature with the Son of God, which made it possible man to be
   called Son of God, was not due to any human merits, but to the grace of
   God predestinating. [883]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [880] Photinus, bishop of Sirmium, in the middle of the fourth century,
   a Unitarian in his doctrine of the Godhead, denied the divinity of
   Jesus Christ, though he allowed His miraculous birth.

   [881] Or, on St Paul's showing (Phil. ii, 9), that Christ as man had
   now received all power on a new title, the title of the redemption
   which He had just wrought out in His blood (Apoc. v, 9).

   [882] Still this text, Acts ii, 36, does not refer to the time of the
   Incarnation, but to that of the Resurrection. In the Resurrection, God
   gave to His Incarnate Son for the first time the full glory of
   Messiahship and Lordship, the glory of the Only-begotten (John i, 14),
   which was His by right, but was not actually enjoyed by Him, in the
   time of His voluntary kenosis (Phil. ii, 7), in the days of his flesh
   (Heb. v, 7). Similarly St Paul (Acts xiii, 32, 33) interprets the text,
   This day have I begotten thee (Ps. ii, 7), to mean, This day of thy
   resurrection have I shown thee forth for my Son.' -- An example from
   history. According to the maxim, The king never dies,' Charles II was
   king the instant his father's head fell, January 29, 1648: he came into
   possession of his kingdom when he entered London, May 29, 1660.

   [883] For predestinated the Greek is horisthentos, marked out,
   declared, a better reading.

   CHAPTER V--Rejection of the Opinion of Sabellius concerning the Son of
   God [884]

   BECAUSE it is a fixed idea in the mind of all who think rightly of God,
   that there can be but one God by nature, some, conceiving from the
   Scriptures the belief that Christ is truly and by nature God and the
   Son of God, have confessed that Christ, the Son of God, and God the
   Father are one God; and yet have not allowed that there was any God the
   Son,' so called according to His nature from eternity, but have held
   that God received the denomination of Sonship from the time that He was
   born of the Virgin Mary. Thus all things that Christ suffered in the
   flesh they attributed to God the Father. This was the opinion of the
   Sabellans, who were also called Patripassians,' because they asserted
   that the Father had suffered, and that the Father Himself was Christ.
   The peculiarity of this doctrine was the tenet that the term Son of
   God' does not denote any existing Person, but a property supervening
   upon a pre-existing Person.

   The falsity of this position is manifest from Scripture authority. For
   Christ in the Scriptures is not only called the Son of the Virgin, but
   also the Son of God. But it cannot be that the same person should be
   son of himself, or that the same should give existence and receive it.
   We observe also that after the Incarnation the Father gives testimony
   of the Son: This is my beloved Son (Matt. iii, 17): thereby pointing to
   His person. Christ therefore is in person other than His Father. [885]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [884] Sabellius, an African from the neighbourhood of Cyrene, in the
   early third century, an anti-Trinitarian, taught that one and the same
   divine Being as giving the Old Law was called the Father, as born of
   Mary was called the Son, as given to the Apostles was called the Holy
   Ghost, so that there were three manifestations, but not what we should
   call three Persons; and that when God was under one of these
   manifestations, He was not under either of the other two.

   [885] St Athanasius (Expos. fidei, II) tells us that Sabellius
   expressed his heresy in a word of his own coining, huiopator,
   Son-Father.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER VI--Of the Opinion of Arius concerning the Son of God [886]

   WHEREAS it is not in accordance with sacred doctrine to say, with
   Photinus, that the Son of God took His beginning from Mary; or, with
   Sabellius, that the eternal God and Father began to be the Son by
   taking flesh; there were others who took the view, which Scripture
   teaches, that the Son of God was before the Incarnation and even before
   the creation of the world; but because the Son is other than the
   Father, they accounted Him to be not of the same nature with the
   Father: for they could not understand, nor would they believe, that any
   two beings, distinct in person, had the same essence and nature. And
   because, according to the doctrine of faith, alone of natures the
   nature of God the Father is believed to be eternal, they believed that
   the nature of the Son was not from eternity, although the Son was
   before other creatures. And because all that is not eternal is made out
   of nothing and created by God, they declared that the Son of God was
   made out of nothing and is a creature. But because they were driven by
   the authority of Scripture to call the Son also God, they said that He
   was one with God the Father, not by nature, but by a union of wills,
   and by participation in the likeness of God beyond other creatures.
   Hence, as the highest creatures, the angels are called in Scripture
   gods' and 'sons of God,' -- e.g., Where werst thou, when the morning
   stars praised me, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? (Job
   xxxviii, 4-7): God stood in the assembly of gods (Ps. lxxxi, 1): --
   they considered that He should be called Son of God' and God'
   pre-eminently above others, inasmuch as through Him the Father created
   every other creature. [887] .
     __________________________________________________________________

   [886] Arius, priest of Alexandria, condemned at the Council of Nice in
   325, died in 336.

   [887] The Arian Word' is the Platonic Heaven,' first of creatures in
   time and dignity and containing all others. See the Timaeus, 30c-31b,
   where it is called "this one present only-begotten Heaven, that has
   been made."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER VII--Rejection of Arius's Position

   HOLY Scripture calls Christ Son of God' and the angels 'sons of God,'
   yet not in the same sense. To which of the angels did he ever say: Thou
   art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? (Heb. i, 5).

   2. If Christ were called Son' in the same sense as all the angels and
   saints, He would not be Only-begotten, however much, for the excellence
   of His nature above the rest, He might be called first-born (Ps.
   lxxxviii, 27). But the Scripture declares Him to be the Only-begotten
   (John i, 14).

   5. Of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things,
   God blessed for ever (Rom. ix, 5): [888] Expecting the blessed hope and
   coming of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ (Tit.
   ii. 13): I will raise up to David a just branch, and this is what they
   shall call him, the Lord our just one (Jerem. xxiii, 5, 6), where in
   the Hebrew we find the tetragrammaton, the name of God alone. [889]

   7. No creature receives the whole fulness of the divine goodness: but
   in Christ there dwells all the fulness of the Godhead (Col. ii, 9).

   8. An angel's mind falls far short of the divine mind: but the mind of
   Christ in point of knowledge does not fall short of the divine mind:
   for in Him are hidden all treasures of wisdom and knowledge (Col. ii,
   3).

   9. All things whatsoever that the Father hath are mine; All mine are
   thine, and thine are mine (John xvi, 15: xvii, 10). [Cf. Luke xv, 31.]
   Therefore there is the same essence and nature of the Father and the
   Son.

   10. In Phil. ii, 7, 8, by the form of God is understood no other than
   the nature of God, as by the form of a servant is understood no other
   than human nature.

   11. The Jews sought to kill him because he said that God was his
   Father, making himself equal to God (John v, 18). This is the narrative
   of the evangelist, whose testimony is true (John xix, 35): nor is it
   doubtful to any Christian but that what Christ said of Himself is true.

   13. No created substance represents God in His substance: for whatever
   appears of the perfection of any creature is less than what God is:
   hence through no creature can the essence of God be known. But the Son
   represents the Father; for the Apostle says of Him that He is the image
   of the invisible God (Col. i, 15). And lest He should be accounted an
   image falling short of and failing to represent the essence of God; or
   an image whence the essence of God could not be known, even as man is
   said to be the image of God (1 Cor xi, 7), He is declared to be a
   perfect image, representing the very substance of God, the splendour of
   his glory, and figure of his substance (Heb. i, 3).

   19. Our final happiness is in God alone; and to Him alone the honour of
   latria is to be paid (B. III, Chap. [459]CXX). But our happiness is in
   God the Son: This is life everlasting, that they know thee, and him
   whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ (John xvii, 3). And it is said: That
   all may honour the Son, as they honour the Father (John v, 23); and
   again, Adore him, all ye angels (Ps. xcvi, 8), which the Apostle (Heb.
   i, 6) quotes as applying to the Son.

   Taught by these and similar evidences of Holy Scripture, the Catholic
   Church confesses Christ to be the true and natural Son of God,
   co-eternal and equal with the Father; true God, of the same essence and
   nature with the Father; begotten, not created, nor made. Hence it
   appears that the faith of the Catholic Church alone truly confesses
   generation in God, referring the generation of the Son to the fact of
   His receiving the divine nature of the Father. Other teachers
   heretically refer this generation to a nature extraneous to Godhead, --
   Photinus and Sabellius to a human nature; Arius not to a human indeed,
   but still to a created nature, more honorable than other creatures.
   Arius further differs from Sabellius and Photinus in asserting that
   this generation was before the creation of the world, while they say
   that it was not before the Virgin birth. Sabellius however differs from
   Photinus in this, that Sabellius confesses Christ to be true God by
   nature, which neither Photinus nor Arius confesses; but Photinus says
   that He was a mere man, Arius that He was a sort of compound
   super-excellent creature, at once divine and human. Photinus and Arius
   confess that the person of the Father and of the Son is different,
   which Sabellius denies. The Catholic faith therefore, taking the middle
   course (media via incedens) confesses, with Arius and Photinus against
   Sabellius, that the person of the Father and of the Son is different,
   the Son being begotten, the Father absolutely unbegotten; but with
   Sabellius against Photinus and Arius, that Christ is true God by
   nature, and of the same nature with the Father, -- albeit not of the
   same person. Hence we gather some inkling of the truth of the Catholic
   position: for to the truth, as the Philosopher says, [890] even false
   opinions testify; whereas false opinions are at variance, not only with
   the truth, but with one another.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [888] Notes on St Paul, p. 389.

   [889] The Hebrew is Yahweh our justice: this whole phrase is the name,
   not Yahweh only: But in Jerem. xxxiii, 16 (heb.), the same name is
   given to the city of Jerusalem: in Gen. xxxii, 20 (heb.), Exod. xvii 15
   (heb. and LXX), a similar name is given to an altar. On which
   considerations Fr Knabenbauer, Cursus S. Scripturae auctoribus S.J.
   presbyteris, in h.l., p. 290, writes: Quare consilium erit ad divinam
   Messiae naturam probandam argumenta conquiri alia et meliora et
   clariora.

   [890] Something of the sort is in Eth. Nic. I, 8: "All existing facts
   are in harmony with truth, but truth quickly shows itself out of
   harmony with falsehood." A false opinion on a complex issue is never
   wholly false: it must be borne out by some measure of facts; and these
   facts ultimately fall in with the true opinion, and the true opinion
   with them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER VIII--Explanation of the Texts which Arius used to allege for
   himself

   THAT they may know thee, the only true God (John xvii, 3) is not to be
   taken to mean that the Father alone is true God, as though the Son were
   not true God, but that the one sole true Godhead belongs to the Father,
   without however the Son being excluded from it. Hence John,
   interpreting these words of the Lord, attributes to the true Son both
   these titles which here our Lord ascribes to His Father: That we may
   know the true God, and be in his true Son Jesus Christ: this is the
   true God and life everlasting (1 John v, 20). [891] But even though the
   Son had confessed that the Father alone is true God, He should not for
   that be understood Himself as Son to be excluded from Godhead; for
   since the Father and the Son are one God, whatever is said of the
   Father by reason of His Divinity is as though it were said of the Son,
   and conversely. Thus the Lord's saying: No one knoweth the Son but the
   Father, nor does any one know the Father but the Son (Matt. xi, 27), is
   not to be understood as excluding the Father from knowledge of Himself,
   or the Son either.

   2. In the text, Whom in his own time he will show forth, who is blessed
   and alone powerful, King of Kings and Lord of Lords (1 Tim.. vi, 15),
   it is not the Father that is named, but that which is common to the
   Father and the Son. For that the Son also is King of Kings and Lord of
   Lords, is manifestly shown in the text: He was clad in a garment
   sprinkled with blood, and his name was called, the Word of God: and he
   hath on his garment and on his thigh written, King of Kings and Lord of
   Lords (Apoc. xix, 13, 16).

   3. The sense of the text, the Father is greater than I (John xiv, 28),
   is taught us by the Apostle (Phil. ii, 6). For since greater' is
   relative to less,' this must be understood of the Son according as He
   is made less; and He was made less in His taking the form of a servant,
   yet withal being equal to God the Father in the form of God. And no
   wonder if on this account the Father is said to be greater than Him,
   since the Apostle says that He was even made less than the angels: That
   Jesus, who was made a little less than the angels, we have seen crowned
   with glory and honour for his suffering of death (Heb. ii, 9.: cf. Ps.
   viii, 4-6).

   4. Then the Son also himself shall be subject to him who subjected to
   him all things. [892] The context here shows that this is to be
   understood of Christ as man: for as man He died, and as man He rose
   again: but in His divinity, doing all things that the Father does (John
   v, 19), He too has subjected to Himself all things: for we look for a
   Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will reform the body of our
   lowliness, made conformable to the body of his glory, by the act of his
   power of subjecting all things to himself (Phil. iii, 20).

   5. By the Father being said to give to the Son (John iii, 35: Matt. xi,
   27), nothing else is understood than the generation of the Son, whereby
   the Father has given the Son His own nature And this may be gathered
   from the consideration of that which is given: for the Lord says: That
   which my Father hath given me is greater than all (John x, 29): where
   that which is greater than all is the divine nature, wherein the Son is
   equal to the Father. [893]

   6. Hence it appears how the Son is said to be taught (John v, 20: xv,
   15), although He is not ignorant. It has been shown above that, in God,
   understanding and being are the same (B. I, Chap. [460]XLV): hence the
   communication of the divine nature is also a communication of
   intelligence. But a communication of intelligence may be called a
   'showing,' or 'speaking,' or teaching.' By the fact, then, of the Son
   having received the divine nature of His Father at His birth, He is
   said to have heard' from His Father, or the Father to have 'shown' Him:
   not that the Son was in ignorance before, and afterwards the Father
   taught Him: for the Apostle confesses Christ the power of God and
   wisdom of God (1 Cor. i, 24); and wisdom cannot be ignorant, or power
   weak.

   7. The text, The Son cannot do anything of himself (John v, 19), argues
   no weakness in the Son; but since with God to act is no other thing
   than to be, it is here said that the Son cannot act of Himself, but has
   His action of the Father, as He cannot be of Himself, but only of the
   Father. Were He to be of Himself,' He could not be the Son. But because
   the Son receives the same nature that the Father has, and consequently
   the same power, therefore though He neither is of Himself' (a se) nor
   acts of Himself, still He is by Himself' (per se) and acts by Himself,
   since He at once is by His own nature, which He has received from the
   Father, and acts by His own nature received from the Father. [894]
   Hence, to show that though the Son does not act of Himself,'
   nevertheless He acts by Himself,' the verse goes on: Whatsoever things
   he (the Father) doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.

   8. All the texts about the Father giving commandment to the Son, and
   the Son obeying the Father, or praying to the Father, are to be
   understood of the Son as He is subject to His Father, which is only in
   point of the humanity which He has assumed (John xiv, 31: xv, 10: Phil.
   ii, 8), as the Apostle shows (Heb. v, 7: Gal. iv, 4).

   10. His saying, To sit on my right or left hand is not mine to give
   you, but to them for whom it is prepared (Matt. xx, 23), does not show
   that the Son has no power of distributing the seats in heaven, or the
   participation of life everlasting, which He expressly says does belong
   to Him to bestow: I give them life everlasting (John x, 27); and again
   it is said: The Father hath given all judgement to the Son (John v,
   22): He will set the sheep on his right hand and the goats on his left
   (Matt. xxv, 33): it belongs then to the power of the Son to set any one
   on His right or on His left, whether both designations mark different
   degrees of glory; or the one refers to glory, the other to punishment.
   We must look to the context, whereby it appears that the mother of the
   sons of Zebedee rested on some confidence of kindred with the man
   Christ. [895] The Lord then by His answer did not mean that it was not
   in His power to give what was asked, but that it was not in His power
   to give to them for whom it was asked: [896] for it did not belong to
   Him to give inasmuch as He was the Son of the Virgin, but inasmuch as
   He was the Son of God; and therefore it was not His to give to any for
   their connexion with Him according to fleshly kindred, as He was the
   Son of the Virgin, but it belonged to Him as Son of God to give to
   those for whom it was prepared by His Father according to eternal
   predestination.

   11. Nor from the text: Of that day and hour no one knoweth, no, not the
   angels of heaven, nor the Son, but my Father alone (Mark xiii, 32):
   [897] can it be understood that the Son did not know the hour of His
   coming, seeing that in Him are hidden all treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge (Col. ii, 3), and seeing that He perfectly knows that which
   is greater still, namely, the Father (Matt. xi, 27 [898] but the
   meaning is that the Son, as a man in His place amongst men, behaved
   Himself after the manner of one ignorant in not revealing that day to
   His disciples. For it is a usual mode of speaking in Scripture for God
   to be said to know a thing, if He makes it known: thus, Now I know that
   thou fearest the Lord (Gen. xxii, 12), means I have made it known.' And
   contrariwise the Son is said not to know that which He does not make
   known to us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [891] The text in the Epistle evidently points to that in the Gospel.
   The question is whether it outruns the Gospel in explicitness, as St
   Thomas argues, or keeps close within the textual lines of the former
   writing. The Vulgate, which St Thomas follows, differs from the Greek
   text in three particulars. (a) For the true God, the Greek is simply
   ton alethinon, him who is true. (b) For and be, the Greek is kai esmen,
   and we are. (c) For in his true Son, the Greek is en to alethino, en to
   huio autou, in him who is true, in his Son. The literal rendering of
   the Greek, et sumus in vero, in filio ejus, would easily slip into the
   present Vulgate, et sumus in vero, filio ejus. Critically, the Greek is
   the true reading. It means, and we are united with Him who is true, by
   being united with His Son,' or, through His Son.' But in the next
   clause, Hic est verus Deus, what is the antecedent of the pronoun this?
   The Fathers, in controversy with the Arians, refer the pronoun to his
   Son Jesus Christ. Others take the clause for a summing of and
   repetition of what has been said, much in the manner of St John. They
   refer the pronoun houtos therefore to ton alethinon and to alethino,
   him who is true. They point to the next clause, Keep yourselves from
   idols, and will have it that St John is not occupied here with the
   divinity of the Son, but with the divinity of the one true God in
   contradiction with idols, by worshipping which the whole world then lay
   in the power of the evil one. A Catholic's faith in the divinity of his
   Lord is not all staked on one pronoun. He can afford to be just, or
   even generous, to an Arian.

   [892] For a detailed study of this glorious passage, 1 Cor. xv, 24-25,
   see Notes on St Paul pp. 121-124.

   [893] So the text is explained by SS. Hilary, Ambrose and Augustine.
   But from passages in the same gospel, where the phrase That which my
   Father hath given me recurs (John vi, 37, 39: xvii, 2, 11, 12, 24:
   xviii, 9), it is argued to mean the elect. The meaning then would be:
   The elect are stronger than all the world beside,' -- the sentiment of
   1 John v, 4: All that is born of God overcometh the world. In this
   interpretation, our Lord speaks, not as the Eternal Son, but as Man and
   Redeemer: in which capacity many understand him to speak also in the
   other passages, John iii, 35: Matt. xi, 27.

   [894] This is the usual style of the Fathers and of St Paul,
   appropriating ex to the Father and dia to the Son, 1 Cor. viii, 6: Rom.
   xi, 36.

   [895] The kindred' is not easy to trace: but on John xix, 25, some take
   his mother's sister to be the mother of the sons of Zebedee of Matt.
   xxvii, 56, i.e., Salome, Mark xv, 40. If there was not kindred, there
   was certainly friendship, which is enough for the argument.

   [896] This would emphasise the pronoun, to give TO YOU. Unfortunately
   that pronoun is absent in the Greek, which may be rendered: It is not
   mine to give: it is only for them for whom it is prepared. We may
   perhaps accommodate St Thomas thus: It is not in my power to give on
   the title on which it is asked,' -- namely the title of personal
   friendship and family connexion.

   [897] St Thomas (Chap. VI), or his editor, quotes this as Matt. xxiv,
   36, where in the Sinaitic and Vatican manuscripts, and in the Revised
   Version, the clause, nor the Son, appears.

   [898] Without denial of the fulness of knowledge in the divine nature
   of Christ, there is a well-known current speculation as to how far His
   human nature participated in His divine knowledge, and whether any
   shade of ignorance was permitted to rest upon His human soul, as part
   of the self-imposed kenosis mentioned in Phil. ii, 7. This idea of
   kenosis may be wrong, but it is not Arianism. There never was kenosis
   of the Eternal Son, as such.

   CHAPTER 12--How the Son of God is called the Wisdom of God

   WISDOM in man is a habit whereby our mind is perfected in the knowledge
   of the highest truths: such are divine truths. Wisdom in God is His
   knowledge of Himself. But because He does not know Himself by any
   presentation of Himself other than His essence, and His act of
   understanding is His essence, the wisdom of God cannot be a habit, but
   is the very essence of God. But the Son of God is the Word and Concept
   of God understanding Himself. The Word of God, thus conceived, is
   properly called begotten Wisdom': -- hence the Apostle names Christ the
   wisdom of God (1 Cor. i, 24). This Word of wisdom, conceived in the
   mind, is a manifestation of the wisdom of the mind which thereby
   understands: as in us acts are a manifestation of habits. Also the
   divine wisdom is called light,' as consisting in a pure act of
   knowledge; and the manifestation of light is the brightness thence
   proceeding: the Word of divine wisdom therefore is fittingly called the
   brightness of light,' according to the text: being the brightness of
   his glory (Heb. i, 3). [899] But though the Son, or Word of God, is
   properly called conceived wisdom,' nevertheless the name of Wisdom,
   when used absolutely, must be common to the Father and the Son; since
   the wisdom that is resplendent through the Word is the essence of the
   Father, and the essence of the Father is common to Him with the Son.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [899] The brightness of light is nothing else than its intensity; or as
   we might say, its adequacy. Thus the Son is adequate, or equal, to the
   Father. But in these metaphors the imagination, and consequently the
   meaning, of the ancients who first used them, and our imagination,
   disciplined by modern science, continually fail to correspond. To
   understand the ancients, we must leave our science behind, and dwell in
   the prima facie region of sense and first impressions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVII--That the Holy Ghost is true God

   A TEMPLE is consecrated to none but God: hence it is said: The Lord in
   his holy temple (Ps. x, 5). But there is a temple appointed to the Holy
   Ghost, as it is said: Know ye not that your members are the temple of
   the Holy Ghost? (i Cor. vi, 19.) The Holy Ghost then is God,
   particularly since our members, which the text says are the temple of
   the Holy Ghost, are the members of Christ: for the writer had said
   before: Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? (v.
   15.) Seeing that Christ is true God, it would be inappropriate for the
   members of Christ to be the temple of the Holy Ghost, unless the Holy
   Ghost were God.

   2. The service of latria (B. III, Chap. [461]CXX) is paid by holy men
   to God alone (Deut. vi, 13). But holy men pay that service to the Holy
   Ghost: for it is said: We who serve the Spirit as God (qui spiritui Deo
   servimus. -- Phil. iii, 3). And though some manuscripts have, We who
   serve in the spirit of the Lord (qui spiritu Domini servimus [showing
   the reading theou]), yet the Greek manuscripts and the more ancient
   Latin ones have, We who serve the Spirit as God (qui spiritui Deo
   servimus); and from the Greek itself [latreuontes] it appears that this
   is to be understood of the service of latria, which is due to God
   alone. [900]

   3. To sanctify men is a work proper to God: I am the Lord who sanctify
   you (Levit. xxii, 9). But it is the Holy Ghost who sanctifies,
   according to the words of the Apostle: Ye are washed and sanctified and
   justified, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of
   our God (1 Cor. vi, 11).

   4. As the life of the body is by the soul, so the soul's life of
   justice is by God: hence the Lord says: As the living Father hath sent
   me, and I live by the Father, so whosoever eateth me, the same shall
   also live by me (John vi, 58). But such life is by the Holy Ghost;
   hence it is added: It is the Spirit that giveth life (John vi, 63): and
   the Apostle says: If with the spirit ye mortify the deeds of the flesh,
   ye shall live (Rom. viii, 18). [901]

   7. The Spirit searcheth all things, even the profound things of God.
   For what man knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of man that is
   in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth but the
   Spirit of God (1 Cor. ii, 10, 11). But to comprehend all the profound
   things of God is not given to any creature: for no one knoweth the Son
   but the Father, nor doth any one know the Father but the Son (Matt. xi,
   27); and in the person of God it is said, My secret to me (Isai. xxiv,
   16). Therefore, the Holy Ghost is, not a creature.

   8. According to the above comparison, the Holy Ghost is to God as a
   man's spirit to man. But a man's spirit is intrinsic to man, not of a
   foreign nature, but part of him. Therefore the Holy Ghost is not of a
   nature extrinsic to Deity.

   11. Evidently from Holy Scripture it was God who spoke by the prophets,
   as it is said: I will hear what the Lord God speaketh in me (Ps.
   lxxxiv, 9). But it is equally evident that the Holy Ghost spoke in the
   prophets: The Scripture must be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost
   foretold by the mouth of David (Acts i, 16). The holy men of God spoke,
   inspired by the Holy Ghost (2 Pet. i, 21). Clearly then the Holy Ghost
   is God.

   17. The Holy Ghost is expressly called God in the text: Ananias, why
   hath Satan tempted thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost? . . . . Thou
   hast not lied to men, but to God (Acts. v, 3, 4).

   23. Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit. And there
   are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are
   diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in
   all. . . . But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh,
   dividing to every one according as he will (1 Cor. xii, 4, 5, 6, 11).
   This text clearly declares the Holy Ghost to be God, as well by saying
   that the Holy Ghost works what it has previously said that God works,
   as also by the declaration of His working according to the arbitrement
   of His own will. [902]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [900] This argument is confidently urged by St Ambrose, De Spiritu
   Sancto, ii, 6, from whom St Thomas takes it. The value of it depends on
   a variant reading in the Greek. The textus receptus has oi pneumati
   theo latreuontes; and such must have been the reading of St Chrysostom,
   who explains pneumati, toutestin, pneumatikos: with this
   interpretation, he cannot have read theou, as MSS represent him. The
   Vulgate agrees, qui spiritu Deo servimus, we who in spirit serve the
   Lord.' So too à Lapide. with this reading, theo, which St Thomas also
   supposes, the interpretation which he gives cannot stand. We who serve
   the Spirit of God, would require oi theo to pneumati latreuontes. For
   the text as it stands, we who serve God as a Spirit,' is quite a
   possible translation (cf. John iv, 24), though that is not to St
   Thomas's purpose. But there is another reading, theou, adopted by
   Westcott and Hort. St Thomas was a stranger to this reading, but it is
   the making of his argument. oi pneumati theou latreuontes&gt; can only
   mean we who serve the Spirit of God.' I am inclined, however, to think
   that the Vulgate is right, that theo is the reading, that pneumati
   means pneumatikos and that the argument is untenable.

   [901] In these and many similar texts, e.g., 2 Thess. ii, 13, it is
   difficult to decide whether the spirit spoken of is the Holy Ghost or
   the sanctified spirit of man. However, the spirit of man is sanctified
   only by the action, and even indwelling, of the Holy Ghost.

   [902] "Under the names of Spirit, Lord, and God, we have here mentioned
   the Holy Ghost, the Son, and the Father, Cf. 2 Cor. xiii. Graces,
   ministries, and operations, are all one and the same thing, the extra
   ordinary manifestations of divine indwelling which then followed upon
   baptism, all the work of one and the same God" (Notes on St Paul p.
   93).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XVIII--That the Holy Ghost is a Subsistent Person

   BUT inasmuch as some have maintained that the Holy Ghost is not a
   subsistent Person, but is either the divinity of the Father and the Son
   (cf. St Aug. de haeresibus, n. 52), or some accidental perfection of
   the mind given us by God, as wisdom, or charity, or other such created
   accidents, we must evince the contrary.

   1. Accidental forms do not properly work, but the subject that has them
   works according to the arbitrement of his own will: thus a wise man
   uses wisdom when he wills. But the Holy Ghost works according to the
   arbitrement of His own will (1 Cor. xii, 11).

   2. The Holy Ghost is not to be accounted an accidental perfection of
   the human mind, seeing that He is the cause of such perfections: for
   the charity of God is spread abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost who
   is given to us (Rom. v, 5): To one is given by the Spirit the utterance
   of wisdom, to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same
   Spirit (1 Cor. xii, 8).

   3. The Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and receives from the Son
   (John xv, 26: xvi, 14): which cannot be understood of the divine
   essence.

   4. Scripture speaks of the Holy Ghost as of a subsistent Person: The
   Holy Ghost said to them: Set aside for me Barnabas and Saul for the
   work unto which I have taken them: . . . . and they, sent by the Holy
   Ghost, went (Acts xiii, 2, 4): It hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost
   and us (Acts xv, 28).

   5. The Father and the Son being subsistent Persons and of divine
   nature, the Holy Ghost would not be numbered with them (Matt. xxviii,
   19: 2 Cor. xiii, 13: 1 John v, 7) were He not a Person subsistent in
   the divine nature.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XX--Of the Effects which the Scriptures attribute to the Holy
   Ghost in respect of the whole Creation

   THE love wherewith God loves His own goodness is the cause of the
   creation of things (B. I, Chap. [462]LXXXVI); and it is laid down that
   the Holy Ghost proceeds as the love wherewith God loves Himself.
   Therefore the Holy Ghost is the principle of the creation of things;
   and this is signified in Ps. ciii, 30: Send forth thy spirit and they
   shall be created. Again, as the Holy Ghost proceeds as love, and love
   is an impulsive and motor power, the motion that is from God in things
   is appropriately attributed to the Holy Ghost. But the first motion, or
   change, coming from God in things is the production of the diversity of
   species from matter created formless (ex materia creata informi species
   diversas produxit). This work the Scripture attributes to the Holy
   Ghost: The Spirit of God moved over the waters (Gen. i, 2) [903] By the
   the waters Augustine wishes to be understood primordial matter. The
   Spirit of the Lord is said to move over them, not as being in motion on
   Himself, but as the principle of motion. The government of creation
   also is fitly assigned to the Holy Ghost, as government is the moving
   and directing of things to their proper ends. And because the governing
   of subjects is an act proper to a lord, lordship too is aptly
   attributed to the Holy Ghost: the Spirit is Lord (1 Cor. iii, 17).
   [904]

   Life also particularly appears in movement. As then impulse and
   movement by reason of love are proper to the Holy Spirit, so too is
   life fitly attributed to Him, as it is said: It is the Spirit that
   quickeneth (John vi, 64: 2 Cor. iii, 6).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [903] Moved, or as another version has it, brooded, which is better in
   keeping with the character of the Holy Ghost as the giver of life.' I
   need only mention the other translation of Spiritus Dei as a mighty
   wind is a translation as old as St Ephrem and Theodoret; and one which
   St Thomas was not unwilling to take account of; as he presently says
   (Chap. XXIII): "Although some wish to understand this, not of the Holy
   Ghost, but of the air, which has its natural place near the water:
   hence, to signify its manifold transformations, it is said that it was
   borne over the waters." Nor can I deal with the vexed question as to
   what notion the human authors of the Old Testament had of the triple
   personality of God.

   [904] ho de kurios to pneuma estin, means now the Lord is the Spirit:
   that is to say, the Lord, mentioned in the previous verse, 16, -- even
   the Yahweh of Exodus xxxiv, 34, to which that verse refers, -- is the
   Holy Ghost. This is a statement of the divinity of the Holy Ghost in so
   many words, as the Greek Fathers elaborately argue, and as St Thomas
   would not have failed to argue, had he been more familiar with Greek.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXI--Of the Effects attributed to the Holy Ghost in Scripture
   in the way of Gifts bestowed on the Rational Creature

   SINCE the Father, Son and Holy Ghost have the same power, as they have
   the same essence, everything that God works in us must be by the
   efficient causation of Father, Son and Holy Ghost together. But the
   word of wisdom, sent us by God, whereby we know God, is properly
   representative of the Son; and the love, wherewith we love God, is
   properly representative of the Holy Ghost. Thus the charity that is in
   us, though it is the effect of Father, Son and Holy Ghost, is in a
   certain special aspect said to be in us through the Holy Ghost. But
   since divine effects not only begin by divine operation, but are also
   sustained in being by the same, and nothing operates where it is not
   [905] , it needs must follow that wherever there is any effect wrought
   by God, there is God Himself who works it. [906] Hence, since the
   charity wherewith we love God is in us through the Holy Ghost, the Holy
   Ghost Himself must be in us, so long as charity is in us. Know ye not
   that ye are the temple of God, and the Holy Ghost dwelleth in you? (1
   Cor. iii, 16.) And through the Holy Ghost the Father and Son also dwell
   in us. Hence the Lord says: We will come to him, and take up our abode
   with him (John xiv, 23). Cf. 1 John iv, 13, 16.

   It is a point of friendship to reveal one's secrets to one's friend:
   for as friendship unites affections, and makes of two as it were one
   heart, a man may well seem not to have uttered beyond his own heart
   what he has revealed to his friend. Hence the Lord says to His
   disciples: I will not call you servants, but friends, because all
   things that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you (John
   xv, 15). Since then by the Holy Ghost we are constituted friends of
   God, the revelation of divine mysteries to men is fittingly said to
   take place through the Holy Ghost: To us God has revealed them through
   the Holy Ghost (1 Cor. ii, 10). Besides the revealing of one's secrets
   to one's friend, which is part of the union of affections that goes
   with friendship, there is a further requisite of the same union, to
   share one's possessions with one's friend, according to 1 John iii, 17.
   And therefore all the gifts of God are said to be given us by the Holy
   Ghost (1 Cor. xii, 7-11). And by such gifts of the Spirit we are
   conformed to God, and by Him rendered apt to the performance of good
   works, and our way is thereby paved to happiness: which three effects
   the Apostle declares: God hath anointed us, and sealed us, and given
   the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts (2 Cor. i, 21, 22: cf. Eph. i,
   13, 14). The sealing may be taken to imply the likeness of conformity
   to God: the anointing, the fitting of man to do perfect acts: the
   pledge, the hope whereby we are set on the way to the heavenly
   inheritance of life everlasting.

   And because good will towards a person leads at times to the adoption
   of him as a son, that so the inheritance may belong to him, the
   adoption of the sons of God is properly attributed to the Holy Ghost:
   Ye have received the spirit of adoption of sons, wherein we cry, Abba,
   Father (Rom. viii, 15).

   Again, by admission to friendship all offence is removed. Since then we
   are rendered sons of God through the Holy Ghost, through Him also our
   sins are forgiven us by God; and therefore the Lord says: Receive ye
   the Holy Ghost: whose sins ye shall forgive, they are forgiven them
   (John xx, 22). And therefore forgiveness is denied to them who
   blaspheme against the Holy Ghost (Matt. xii, 31), as to persons who
   have not that whereby man attains the forgiveness of his sins. [907]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [905] Nothing operates where it is not,' is the rejection of actio in
   distans. The axiom has been disputed, especially since the discovery of
   the law of gravitation. Presence has been distinguished into local' and
   virtual'; a distinction coming near to that conveyed by the two Latin
   verbs, adsum and intersum. Presence indeed is not easy to define. Does
   presence belong to the term whence action comes, or to the term whither
   it goes, or to both? e.g., is the sun in any sense present on the
   earth? The mind is present in the body: is it not present too, although
   with a different presence; in the fixed stars, when it thinks about
   them? The presence of God, as St Thomas well lays down (B. III, Chap.
   LXVIII), is best defined by His action. Where God acts, God is': that
   statement of the axiom is sufficient for the argument in this case.

   [906] And the higher the effect, the fuller the presence. There is more
   of God in the war-horse than in the worm, more of Him in mind than in
   matter; and, what is to the point here, there is a presence of God in
   the just which is denied to the wicked, the presence that goes with
   sanctifying grace (B. III, Chapp. CLI, CLII).

   [907] Ipse est remissio omnium peccatorum, "He (the Holy Ghost) is the
   forgiveness of all sins" (Post-communion for Whit Tuesday).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXII--Of the Effects attributed to the Holy Ghost in the
   attraction of the Rational Creature to God

   IT is a mark of friendship to take delight in the company of one's
   friend, to rejoice at what he says and does, and to find in him comfort
   and consolation against all troubles: hence it is in our griefs
   especially that we fly to our friends for comfort. Since then the Holy
   Ghost renders us friends of God, making Him to dwell in us and we in
   Him, we have through the same Holy Spirit joy in God and comfort under
   all the adversities and assaults of the world: hence it is said: Give
   me back the joy of thy salvation, and strengthen me with thy guiding
   Spirit (Ps. l, 14): The kingdom of God is justice and peace and joy in
   the Holy Ghost (Rom. xiv, 17): The Church had peace, and was edified,
   walking in the fear of the Lord, and filled with the consolation of the
   Holy Ghost (Acts ix, 31).

   Another mark of friendship is to fall in with a friend's wishes. Now
   God's wishes are unfolded to us by His commandments, the keeping of
   which therefore is part of our love of God : If ye love me, keep my
   commandments (John xiv, 15). As then we are rendered lovers of God by
   the Holy Ghost, by Him we are also led to fulfil God's commandments:
   Whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, the same are the sons of God
   (Rom. viii, 14). But it is a noteworthy point that the sons of God are
   led by the Holy Ghost, not as bondsmen, but as free. He is free, who is
   a cause unto himself; [908] and we do that freely which we do of
   ourselves, that is, of our own willing; but what we do against our
   will, we do, not freely, but after the manner of bondsmen. The Holy
   Ghost then, rendering us lovers of God, inclines us to act of our own
   will, freely, out of love, not as bondsmen prompted by fear. Ye have
   not received the spirit of bondage again in fear, but ye have received
   the spirit of adoption as sons (Rom. viii, 15). True good being the
   object of the will, whenever a man turns away from true good under the
   influence of passion or ill habit, and so is swayed by a power foreign
   to his proper self, he in that respect behaves like a bondsman. On the
   other hand, if we consider his act as a genuine act of his will,
   inclined to what is good for him in his own eyes, although not really
   good, he acts freely in thus following passion or corrupt habit. But
   again he acts like a bondsman, if, while the volition of fancied good
   just mentioned remains, he nevertheless abstains from what he wills for
   fear of the law enacted to the contrary. Since then the Holy Ghost
   inclines the will by love to true good, its natural object, He takes
   away alike the servitude whereby, a slave to passion and sin, man acts
   against the due order of his will, and that other servitude whereby man
   acts according to the law, but against the motion of his will, like a
   slave of the law and no friend to it. Hence the Apostle says: Where the
   Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (2 Cor. iii, 17): If ye are led
   by the Spirit, ye are not under the law (Gal. v, 18) [909]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [908] Liber, qui sui causa est. That causa is meant by St Thomas for
   the nominative case, is clear from the context here, as also from B. I,
   Chap. LXXXVIII (ad fin in the Latin); also B. II, Chap. XLVIII, n. 2,
   where the same definition is quoted. But turning to the original,
   Aristotle, Metaph. I, ii, eleutheros anthropos ho hautou eneka kai me
   allou on (he is a free man, who is for his own sake, and not for the
   sake of another), we find sui causâ, hautou eneka, for his own sake.'

   [909] Not under the law that threatens slaves, but under the Spirit
   that leads the children of God. Cf. Rom. vi, 14: viii, 2.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXIII--Replies to Arguments alleged against the Divinity of the
   Holy Ghost

   CHAP. XVI. It was the position of Arius that the Son and Holy Ghost
   were creatures, the Son however being greater than the Holy Ghost, and
   the Holy Ghost being His minister, even as he said the Son was to the
   Father. [910] After Arius came Macedonius, who was orthodox on the
   point of the Father and Son being of one and the same substance, but
   refused to believe the same of the Holy Ghost, and said that He was a
   creature.

   Chap. XXIII. 2. He shall not speak of himself but whatsoever things he
   shall hear, he shall speak (John xvi, 13). Since all the knowledge and
   power and action of God is the essence of God, all the knowledge and
   power and action of the Son and of the Holy Ghost is from another; but
   that of the Son is from the Father only, that of the Holy Ghost from
   the Father and the Son. To hear then, on the part of the Holy Ghost,
   signifies His taking knowledge, as He takes essence, from the Father
   and the Son.

   3. The Son of God is said to have been sent in this sense, that He
   appeared to man in visible flesh; and, thus came to be in the world in
   a new way, in which He had not been before, namely, visibly, although
   He had always been there invisibly as God. And the Son's doing this
   came to Him of His Father: hence in this respect He is said to be
   'sent' by the Father. In like manner the Holy Ghost too appeared
   visibly both in the appearance of a dove over Christ in His baptism,
   and in fiery tongues over the Apostles; and though He did not become a
   dove or fire, still He appeared under such visible appearances as signs
   of Himself. And thus He too came to be in a new way in the world,
   visibly; and this He had of the Father and of the Son, hence He is said
   to be 'sent' by the Father and the Son, which does not imply
   inferiority in Him, but procession. [911] There is yet another way in
   which the Holy Ghost is said to be sent, and that invisibly. The Son
   proceeds from the Father as the knowledge wherewith God knows Himself;
   and the Holy Ghost proceeds from Father and Son as the love wherewith
   God loves Himself. Hence when through the Holy Ghost one is made a
   lover of God, the Holy Ghost is an indweller in him; and thus He comes
   to be in a new way in man, in point of the new special effect of His
   indwelling in man. Now that the Holy Ghost works this effect in man,
   comes to Him of the Father and the Son; and therefore He is said to be
   invisibly sent by Father and Son.

   4. Nor is the Holy Ghost excluded from the Divinity by the occasional
   mention of the Father and the Son without the Holy Ghost (Matt. xi, 27:
   John xvii, 3: Rom. i, 7: 1 Cor. viii, 6): for hereby the Scripture
   silently intimates that whatever attribute of divinity is predicated of
   one of the three, must be understood of them, all, seeing that they are
   one God. God the Father can never be taken to be without the Word and
   without Love; and the Word and Love cannot be taken to be without the
   Father. Hence it is said of the Son: No one knoweth the Father but the
   Son (Matt. xi, 27): so it is also said of the Holy Ghost: The things
   that are of God, none knoweth but the Spirit of God (1 Cor. ii, 11):
   though it is certain that neither the Father nor the Son is excluded
   from this knowledge of divine things.

   7. Habitually in Holy Scripture the language of human passion is
   applied to God (B. I, Chapp. [463]LXXXIX-[464]LXCI). Thus it is said:
   The Lord was angered in fury against his people (Ps. cv, 40): for He
   punishes, as men in anger do: hence it is added: And gave them over
   into the hands of the Gentiles. So in the text, Sadden not the Holy
   Spirit of God (Eph. iv, 30), the Holy Ghost is said to be saddened,
   because He abandons sinners; as men, when they are saddened and
   annoyed, forsake the company of them that annoy them.

   8. Another customary phraseology of Holy Scripture is the attributing
   of that to God, which He produces in man. So it is said: The Spirit
   himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings (Rom. viii, 26):
   because He makes us ask, for He produces in our hearts the love of God,
   whereby we desire to enjoy Him and ask according to our desire. [912]

   9. Since the Holy Ghost proceeds as the love wherewith God loves
   Himself; and since God loves with the same love Himself and other
   beings for the sake of His own goodness (B. I Chapp. [465]LXXV,
   [466]LXXVI); it is clear that the love wherewith God loves us belongs
   to the Holy Ghost. In like manner also the love wherewith we love God.
   In respect of both these loves the Holy Ghost is well said to be given.
   In respect of the love wherewith God loves us, He may be said to be
   given, in the sense in which one is said to give his love to another,
   when he begins to love him. Only, be it observed, there is no beginning
   in time for God's love of any one, if we regard the act of divine will
   loving us; but the effect of His love is caused in time in the creature
   whom He draws to Himself. Again, in respect of the love wherewith we
   love God, the Holy Ghost may be said to be given us, because this love
   is produced in us by the Holy Ghost, who by reason of this love dwells
   in us, and so we possess Him and enjoy His support. And since the Holy
   Ghost has it of the Father and the Son that He is in us and is
   possessed by us, therefore He is aptly said to be given us by the
   Father and the Son. Your Father from heaven will give the good Spirit
   to them that ask him (Luke xi, 13; cf. Acts v, 32: John xv, 26). Nor
   does this argue Him to be less than the Father and the Son, but only to
   have His origin from them.

   11. It is reasonable that in the case of the divine nature alone nature
   should be communicated in more modes than the one mode of generation.
   In God alone act and being are identical: hence since there is in God,
   as in every intelligent nature, both intelligence and will, alike that
   which proceeds in Him as intelligence, to wit, the Word, and that
   proceeds in Him as love and will, to wit, Love, must have divine being
   and be God; thus as well the Son as the Holy Ghost is true God.

   CHAPTER XXIV--That the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son [913]

   IF any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of him (Rom. viii,
   9). These words of the Apostle show that the same Spirit is of the
   Father and of the Son: for the text alleged follows upon these words
   immediately preceding: If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.
   Now it cannot be said that the Holy Ghost is the Spirit merely of the
   man Christ (Luke iv, 3): for from Gal. iv, 6, Since ye are sons, God
   hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, it appears that the
   Holy Ghost makes sons of God inasmuch as He is the Spirit of the Son of
   God, -- sons of God, that is to say, by adoption, which means
   assimilation to Him who is Son of God by nature. For so the text has
   it: He hath predestined (them) to become conformable to the image of
   his Son, that he may be the first-born among many brethren (Rom. viii,
   29). But the Holy Ghost cannot be called the Spirit of the Son of God
   except as taking His origin from Him: for this distinction of origin is
   the only one admissible in the Godhead.

   2. The Holy Ghost is sent by the Son: When the Paraclete cometh, whom I
   will send you from the Father (John xv, 26). Now the sender has some
   authority (auctoritatem) over the sent. We must say then that the Son
   has some authority in respect of the Holy Ghost. Now that cannot be an
   authority of dominion, superiority, or seniority: it can only be an
   authority in point of origin. So then the Holy Ghost is from the Son.
   But if any one will have it that the Son also is sent by the Holy
   Ghost, according to the text (Luke iv, 18) where the Lord said that the
   saying of Isaias (lxi, 1) was fulfilled in Him: The Spirit of the Lord
   is upon me: to preach glad tidings to the poor he hath sent me: we must
   observe that it is in respect of the nature which He has assumed that
   the Son is said to be sent by the Holy Ghost [cf. Acts x, 38]: but the
   Holy Ghost has assumed no such nature, that the Son in point thereof
   should send Him or have authority regarding Him.

   3. The Son says of the Holy Ghost: He shall glorify me, because he
   shall receive of mine (John xvi, 14). Now it cannot be maintained that
   He shall receive that which belongs to the Son, namely, the divine
   essence, but not receive it of the Son, but only of the Father: for it
   follows, All things whatsoever that the Father hath are mine: therefore
   did I say to you that he shall receive of mine: for if all things that
   the Father has belong to the Son, the authority of the Father, whereby
   He is the principle of the Holy Ghost, must belong likewise to the Son.

   7. The Son is from the Father, and so too is the Holy Ghost. The Father
   then must be related to the Son and to the Holy Ghost as a principle to
   that which is of the principle. Now He is related to the Son in the way
   of paternity, but not so to the Holy Ghost, otherwise the Holy Ghost
   would be the Son. There must then be in the Father another relation,
   which relates Him to the Holy Ghost; and that relation is called
   'spiration.' In like manner, as there is in the Son a relation which
   relates Him to the Father, and is called filiation,' there must be in
   the Holy Ghost too a relation which relates Him to the Father, and is
   called procession.' And thus in point of the origin of the Son from the
   Father there are two relations, one in the originator, the other in the
   originated, namely, paternity and filiation; and other two in point of
   the origin of the Holy Ghost, namely spiration and procession. Now
   paternity and spiration do not constitute two persons, but belong to
   the one person of the Father, because they are not opposed one to the
   other. Neither then would filiation and procession constitute two
   persons, but would belong to one person, but for the fact of their
   being opposed one to the other. But it is impossible to assign any
   other opposition than that which is in point of origin. There must then
   be an opposition in point of origin between the Son and the Holy Ghost,
   so that one is from the other.

   10. If the rejoinder is made that the processions of Son and Holy Ghost
   differ in principle, inasmuch as the Father produces the Son by mode of
   understanding, as the Word, and produces the Holy Ghost by mode of
   will, as Love, the opponent must go on to say that according to the
   difference of understanding and will in God the Father there are two
   distinct processions and two distinct beings so proceeding. But will
   and understanding in God the Father are not distinguished with a real
   but only with a mental distinction (B. I, Chapp. [467]XLV,
   [468]LXXIII). Consequently the two processions and the two beings so
   proceeding must differ only by a mental distinction. But things that
   differ only by a mental distinction are predicable of one another: thus
   it is true to say that God's will is His understanding, and His
   understanding is His will. It will be true then to say that the Holy
   Ghost is the Son, and the Son the Holy Ghost, which is the impious
   position of Sabellius. Therefore, to maintain the distinction between
   Holy Ghost and Son, it is not enough to say that the Son proceeds by
   mode of understanding and the Holy Ghost by mode of will, unless we
   further go on to say that the Holy Ghost is of the Son.

   13. The Father and the Son, being one in essence, differ only in this,
   that He is the Father, and He the Son. Everything else is common to
   Father and Son. But being the origin of the Holy Ghost lies outside of
   the relationship of paternity and filiation: for the relation whereby
   the Father is Father differs from the relation whereby the Father is
   the origin of the Holy Ghost. Being the origin then of the Holy Ghost
   is something common to Father and Son.

   CHAPTER XXVI--That there are only Three Persons in the Godhead, Father
   and Son and Holy Ghost

   FROM all that has been said we gather that in the divine nature there
   subsist three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and that these
   three are one God, being distinct from one another by relations alone.
   The Father is distinguished by the relation of paternity and by being
   born of none: the Son is distinguished from the Father by the
   relationship of filiation: the Father and Son from the Holy Ghost by
   spiration; and the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son by the
   procession of love whereby He proceeds from both. Besides these three
   Persons it is impossible to assign in the divine nature any fourth
   Person.

   1. The three divine Persons, agreeing in essence, can be distinguished
   only by the relation of origin. These relations of origin cannot obtain
   in respect of any process tending to things without, as whatever
   proceeded without would not be co-essential with its origin; but the
   process must all stay within. Now such a process, abiding within its
   origin, is found only in the act of understanding and will. [914] Hence
   the divine persons cannot be multiplied except in accordance with the
   requirements of the process of understanding and will in God. But in
   God there can be but one process of understanding, seeing that His act
   of understanding is one, simple, and perfect, whereby, understanding
   Himself, He understands all other things; and so there can be in God
   only one procession of the Word. In like manner the process of love
   must be one and simple, because the divine will also is one and simple,
   whereby in loving Himself God loves all other things. There can
   therefore be in God but two Persons proceeding: one by way of
   understanding, as the Word, or Son; the other by way of love, as the
   Holy Ghost: there is also one Person not proceeding, namely, the
   Father. There can only therefore be three Persons in the Trinity.

   2. The divine Persons must be distinguished according to their mode of
   procession. Now the mode of personal procession can be but threefold.
   There may be a mode of not proceeding at all, which is proper to the
   Father; or of proceeding from one who does not proceed, which is proper
   to the Son; or of proceeding from one who does proceed, which is proper
   to the Holy Ghost. It is impossible therefore to assign more than three
   Persons.

   3. If any objicient says that, the Son being perfect God, there is in
   Him perfect intellectual power, whereby He can produce a Word; and in
   like manner the Holy Ghost, being infinite goodness, which is a
   principle of communication, [915] must be able to communicate the
   divine nature to another divine person, he should take note that the
   Son is God as begotten, not as begetting; hence the power of
   understanding is in Him as in one proceeding as a Word, not as in one
   producing a Word. In like manner the Holy Ghost being God as
   proceeding, there is in Him infinite goodness as in a person receiving,
   not as in one communicating infinite goodness to another. The whole
   fulness of Godhead then is in the Son, numerically the same as in the
   Father, but with a relation of birth, as it is in the Father with a
   relation of active generation. If the relation of the Father were
   attributed to the Son, all distinction would be taken away: for the
   divine Persons are distinguished one from another solely by their
   mutual relations. And the like argument holds of the Holy Ghost.

   A likeness of the divine Trinity is observable in the human mind. That
   mind, by actually understanding itself, conceives its word' in itself,
   which word' is nothing else than what is called the intellectual
   expression (intentio intellecta, cf. B. I, Chap. [469]LIII) existing in
   the mind; which mind, going on to love itself, produces itself in the
   will as an object loved. Further it does not proceed, but is confined
   and complete in a circle, returning by love to its own substance,
   whence the process originally began by formation of the intellectual
   expression' of that substance. There is however a process going out to
   exterior effects, as the mind for love of itself proceeds to some
   action beyond itself. Thus we remark in the mind three things: the mind
   itself, whence the process starts within its own nature; the mind
   conceived in the understanding; and the mind loved in the will. And so
   we have seen that there is in the divine nature a God unbegotten, the
   Father, the origin of the entire procession of Deity; and a God
   begotten after the manner of a word' conceived in the understanding,
   namely, the Son; and a God proceeding by mode of love, who is the Holy
   Ghost: beyond Him there is no further procession within the divine
   nature, but only a proceeding to exterior effects. But the
   representation of the divine Trinity in us falls short, in regard of
   Father, Son and Holy Ghost being one nature, and each of them a perfect
   Person. [916] Hence there is said to be in the mind of man the image'
   of God: Let us make man to our image and likeness (Gen. i, 26). But as
   for the irrational creation, on account of the remoteness and obscurity
   of the representation as found in them, there is said to be the
   foot-print' of the Trinity, but not the image' (vestigium, non imago).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [914] In other words, the process must be by an immanent,' not by a
   transient' act; and the only immanent act is that of understanding and
   will.

   [915] According to the axiom, Good tends to diffuse itself.'

   [916] In the human mind neither is there so perfect a unity nor so
   distinct a trinity.

   CHAPTER XXVII--Of the Incarnation of the Word according to the
   Tradition of Holy Scripture

   OF all the works of God, the mystery of the Incarnation most transcends
   reason. Nothing more astonishing could be imagined as done by God than
   that the true God and Son of God should become true man. To this chief
   of wonders all other wonders are subordinate. We confess this wonderful
   Incarnation under the teaching of divine authority, John i, 14: Phil.
   ii, 6-11. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself also declare it,
   in that sometimes He says of Himself humble and human things, e.g., The
   Father is greater than I (John xiv, 28): My soul is sorrowful even unto
   death (Matt. xxvi, 38): which belonged to Him in the humanity which He
   had assumed: at other times lofty and divine things, e.g., I and the
   Father are one (John x, 30): All things that the Father hath are mine
   (John xvi, 15): which attach to Him in His divine nature. And the
   actions that are recorded of Him show the same duality of nature. His
   being stricken with fear, sadness, hunger, death, belongs to His human
   nature: His healing the sick by His own power, His raising the dead and
   effectually commanding the elements, His casting out of devils,
   forgiving of sins, His rising from the dead when He willed, and finally
   ascending into heaven, show the power of God that was in Him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXVIII--Of the Error of Photinus concerning the Incarnation

   PHOTINUS and others pretend that the divinity was in Christ, not by
   nature, but by a high degree of participation in divine glory, which He
   had merited by His works. But on this theory it would not be true that
   God had taken flesh so as to become man, but rather that a fleshly man
   had become God. It would not be true that the Word was made flesh (John
   i, 14), but that flesh had been made the Word. Kenosis and coming down
   would not be predicable of the Son of God, but rather glorification and
   being lifted up would be predicated of man. It would not be true that,
   being in the form of God, he emptied [ekenosen] himself, taking the
   form of a servant (Phil. ii, 6), but only the exaltation of man to
   divine glory would be true, of which presently we read, wherefore hath
   God exalted him. It would not be true, I descended from heaven (John
   vi, 38), but only, I ascend to my Father (John xx, 17): notwithstanding
   that Holy Scripture joins both assertions together: None ascendeth into
   heaven but he who descendeth from heaven, the Son of man, who is in
   heaven (John iii, 13): He who descended, the same also ascendeth above
   all the heavens (Eph. iv, 10). Nor would it be true to say of the Son
   that He was sent by the Father, or that He went out from the Father to
   come into the world, but only that He went to the Father, although He
   Himself makes the two declarations together: I go to him who sent me: I
   went out from the Father, and came into the world; and again I leave
   the world and go unto the Father (John xvi, 5, 28).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXIX--Of the Error of the Manicheans concerning the Incarnation

   THE Manicheans said that the Son of God took not a real but an apparent
   body; and that the things which He did as man, -- being born, eating,
   drinking, walking, suffering, and being buried, -- were not done in
   reality, but in show. To begin with, this theory robs Scripture of all
   authority. For since a show of flesh is not flesh, nor a show of
   walking walking, the Scripture lies when it says, The Word was made
   flesh, if the flesh was only apparent: it lies when it says that Jesus
   Christ walked, ate, was dead and buried, if these things happened only
   in fantastic appearance. But if even in a small matter the authority of
   Holy Scripture is derogated from, [917] no point of our faith can any
   longer remain fixed, as our faith rests on the Holy Scripture,
   according to the text, These things are written that ye may believe
   (John xx, 31).

   Some one may say that the veracity of Holy Scripture in relating
   appearance for reality is saved by this consideration, that the
   appearances of things are called figuratively and in a sense by the
   names of the things themselves, as a painted man is called in a sense a
   man. But though this is true, yet it is not the way of Holy Scripture
   to give the whole history of one transaction in this ambiguous way,
   without there being other passages of Holy Scripture from whence the
   truth may be manifestly gathered. Otherwise there would follow, not the
   instruction but the deception of men: whereas the Apostle says that
   whatsoever things are written, are written for our instruction (Rom.
   xv, 4); and that all Scripture, divinely inspired, is useful for
   teaching and instructing (2 Tim. iii, 16). Besides, the whole gospel
   narrative would be poetical and fabulous, if it narrated appearances of
   things for realities, whereas it is said: We have not been led by
   sophisticated fables in making known to you the power of our Lord Jesus
   Christ (2 Peter i, 16). Wherever Scripture has to tell of appearances,
   it gives us to understand this by the very style of the narrative,
   e.g., the apparition of the three men to Abraham, who in them adored
   God and confessed the Deity (Gen. xviii). As for the visions of the
   imagination (imaginarie visa) seen by Isaias, Ezechiel, and other
   prophets, they originate no error, because they are not narrated as
   history, but as prophetic pictures: still there is always something put
   in to show that it is but an apparition (Isai. vi, 1: Ezech. i, 4:
   viii, 3).

   When divine truths are conveyed in Scripture under figurative language,
   no error can thence arise, as well from the homely character of the
   similitudes used, which shows that they are but similitudes; as also
   because what in some places is hidden under similitudes, in others is
   revealed by plain speaking. But there is no Scripture authority to
   derogate from the literal truth of all that we read about the humanity
   of Christ. When the Apostle says: God sent his Son in the likeness of
   sinful flesh (Rom. viii, 3): he does not say, in the likeness flesh,
   but adds sinful, since Christ had true flesh, but not sinful flesh,
   there being no sin in Him; but His flesh was like sinful flesh,
   inasmuch as He had flesh liable to suffering, as man's flesh was
   rendered liable by sin. So the expression, made in the likeness of men
   (Phil. ii, 7), conveys no idea of illusion: that is shown by what
   follows, taking the form of a servant, where form' is clearly put for
   nature,' as the adjoining clause shows, being in the form of God: for
   it is not supposed that Christ was God only in resemblance. [918]

   Moreover there are passages in which Holy Scripture expressly bars the
   suspicion of Christ being a mere appearance, Matt. xiv, 26, 27: Luke
   xxiv, 37-39: Acts x, 40, 41: and St John's words, What was from the
   beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we
   have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life (1
   John i, 1). In fact, if Christ had not a real body, He did not really
   die; neither therefore did he really rise again: And if Christ be not
   risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain,
   yea and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have given
   testimony of God that he hath raised up Christ, whom he hath not raised
   up [if He never really died] (1 Cor. xv, 14, 15).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [917] Understand, in anything which Holy Scripture, as God's word,
   really does say.'

   [918] The term likeness, and its synonym figure, should be pressed more
   home, as in the original it is evidently emphatic. The meaning will be
   clear, if we consider the gist of the whole passage, Phil. ii, 3-11.
   The Philippians are not to be contentious or vainglorious, but in
   humility they are to give way to one another, and abate their
   pretensions to personal distinction: this on the example of their Lord,
   who being God and man, did not think the glory of the Godhead, as
   extended to His human nature, a thing to be seized upon without paying
   a price for it (harpagmon, R.V. prize), but submitted to kenosis in His
   human nature, being made in the likeness of ordinary men, and in the
   configuration and general circumstances of His humanity being found
   just like any other man. This He did in the days of his flesh, i.e.,
   His mortal life, from birth to crucifixion: cf. Heb. v, 7-10, which is
   a parallel passage to this. It is to be borne in mind that, as God,
   Jesus Christ had a right to a glorified humanity from the first: but He
   waived that right, and went without the glory of His body, until He had
   purchased His glorification by His death. In this consisted His
   kenosis, a voluntary human act of self-abasement and self-renunciation
   on His part. This kenosis met with its great reward in the glory of His
   resurrection, in the triumph of His ascension, and in the divine
   honours rendered Him age by age in His Church.

   CHAPTERS XXXII, XXXIII--Of the Error of Arius and Apollinaris
   concerning the Soul of Christ

   ARIUS held that Christ had no soul, but assumed flesh alone, to which
   the Divinity stood in the place of a soul. In this he was followed by
   Apollinaris. Apollinaris however was brought to confess that Christ had
   a sensitive soul; but he averred that the Divinity stood to that
   sensitive soul in place of mind and intellect (S. Aug. de haeresibus,
   55). [919]

   1. It is impossible for the Word of God to be the form of a body. [920]

   2. Take away what is of the essence of man, and a true man cannot
   remain. But manifestly the soul is the chief constituent of the essence
   of man, being his form. If Christ then had not a soul, He was not true
   man, though the Apostle calls Him such: One mediator between God and
   men, the man Christ Jesus (1 Tim. ii, 5).

   4. What is generated of any living being cannot be called its
   offspring, unless it come forth in the same species. But if Christ had
   no soul, He would not be of the same species with other men: for things
   that differ in form' cannot be of the same species. At that rate Christ
   could not be called the Son of Mary, or she His mother: which however
   is asserted in Scripture (Luke i, 43: ii, 33: John xix, 25).

   5. Express mention is made of the soul of Christ, Matt. xxvi, 8: John
   x, 18: xii, 27.

   9. The body stands to the soul as matter to form, and as the instrument
   to the prime agent. But matter must be proportionate to form, and the
   instrument to the prime agent. Therefore according to the diversity of
   souls there must also be a diversity of bodies. And this is apparent
   even to sense: for in different animals we find different arrangements
   of limbs, adapted to different dispositions of souls. [921] If then in
   Christ there were not a soul such as our soul, neither would He have
   had limbs like the limbs of man.

   [919] A curious foreshadowing of Averroes: see B. II, Chap. LX.
   Apollinaris, a friend of St Athanasius and of the Sophist Libanius, sat
   in a synod in 362 as bishop of Laodicea. He was a better classical
   scholar than theologian; and was the first to attempt to rewrite the
   classics in the service of Christianity. His doctrine was condemned in
   the second General Council, that of Constantinople, in 380. Arius,
   making the Word but a creature, had less difficulty in supposing the
   Logos to do the office of a soul. Apollinaris was anti-Arian, and so
   came to admit some manner of human soul in Christ.

   [920] Matter and form combine to make one nature, and therefore must be
   in proportion with one another. But there is no proportion between the
   Deity and anything corporeal. It will be seen that the error of
   Apollinaris is akin to that of Eutyches, who posited but one nature in
   Christ.

   [921] This argument suggests at least the likelihood of a rational soul
   being only possible in a body of human shape: a good instance of an
   intrinsic connexion in the nature of things between this and that, over
   and above the facts of number and space, to which we are too apt to
   confine such necessity. Cf. B. III, Chap. XCVII, note, p. 262.

   CHAPTER XXXIV--Of the Error of Theodore of Mopsuestia concerning the
   Union of the Word with Man

   BY the foregoing chapters it appears that neither was the divine nature
   wanting to Christ, as Photinus said; nor a true human body, according
   to the error of the Manicheans; nor again a human soul, as Arius and
   Apollinaris supposed. These three substances then meet in Christ, the
   Divinity, a human soul, and a true human body. It remains to enquire,
   according to the evidence of Scripture, what is to be thought of the
   union of the three. Theodore of Mopsuestia, then, and Nestorius, his
   follower, brought out the following theory of this union. [922]

   They said that a human soul and a human body were naturally united in
   Christ to constitute one man of the same species and nature with other
   men; and that in this man God dwelt as in His temple by grace, as He
   does in other holy men. Hence He said Himself: Dissolve this temple,
   and in three days I will raise it up: which the Evangelist explains: He
   spoke of the temple of his body (John ii, 19). Hereupon there followed
   a union of affections between the Man Christ and God, the Man adhering
   with hearty good will to God, and God willingly accepting Him, as He
   says Himself: He that sent me is with me; and he hath not left me
   alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him (John
   viii, 29): giving us to understand that the union of that Man with God
   is as the union of which the Apostle speaks: He that adhereth to God,
   is one spirit (1 Cor. vi, 17). And as by this union the names that
   properly apply to God are transferred to men, so that they are called
   gods, and sons of God, and lords, and holy ones, and christs, as
   appears by divers passages of Scripture (e.g., Pss. lxxxi, civ); so are
   divine names duly applied to the Man Christ, and by reason of the
   indwelling of God and the union of affections with Him He is called
   God, and Son of God, and Lord, and Holy One, and Christ. Moreover,
   because in that Man there was greater fulness of grace than in other
   holy men, He was above others the temple of God, and more closely
   united with God in affection, and shared the divine names by a peculiar
   privilege of His own; and for this excellence of grace He was put in
   participation of divine honour and dignity, and has come to be adored
   along with God. And thus one is the person of the Word of God, and
   another the person of that Man who is adored along with God. Or if
   there is said to be one person of them both, that will be by reason of
   the aforesaid union of affections, on the strength of which that Man
   and the Word of God will be one person, in the same way in which it is
   said of husband and wife that they are no more two, but one flesh
   (Matt. xix, 6). And because such a union does not authorise us to
   predicate of the one whatever can be predicated of the other -- for not
   whatever is true of the husband is true of the wife, or vice versa, --
   therefore in the case of the union of the Word with that Man this
   Nestorian doctrine has it we should not fail to notice how the
   properties of that Man, belonging to His human nature, cannot fitly be
   predicated of the Word of God, or God. Thus it is proper to that Man to
   have been born of a Virgin, to have suffered, died, and been buried:
   all of which things, Nestorians say, are impossible to predicate of
   God, or of the Word of God. But because there are some names which,
   while applying to God in the first place, are communicated to man in a
   sense, as Christ, Lord, Holy One, or even Son of God, they see no
   difficulty in terms expressive of the above incidents of humanity being
   united as predicates with these names. So they think it proper to say
   that Christ,' the Lord of glory,' the Saint of saints,' or even the Son
   of God,' was born of a virgin,' 'suffered,' died,' and was buried.'
   Therefore they say that the Blessed Virgin should not be called mother
   of God,' or of the Word of God,' but mother of Christ.'

   1. Any thoughtful person may see that this theory cannot stand with the
   truth of the Incarnation. The theory holds that the Word of God was
   united with the Man Christ only by the indwelling of grace and
   consequent union of wills. But the indwelling of the Word of God in man
   does not mean the Word of God being Incarnate: for the Word of God and
   God Himself dwelt in all the saints from the beginning of the world,
   according to the text: Ye are the temple of the living God, as God
   says: I will dwell in them (2 Cor vi, 16: Levit. xxvi, 12). But this
   indwelling cannot be called an incarnation: otherwise God must have
   become incarnate frequently from the beginning of the world. Nor is it
   enough to constitute an incarnation, if the Word of God and God dwelt
   in the Man Christ with more abundant grace: for greater and less do not
   make a difference of species in point of union.

   3. Everything that is made anything is that which it is made, as what
   is made man is man, and what is made white is white. But the Word of
   God has been made man (John i, 14). Therefore the Word of God is man.
   But, of two things differing in person, or suppositum, [923] the one
   cannot possibly be predicated of the other. When it is said Man is an
   animal,' that self-same being which is an animal is man. When it is
   said, Man is white,' some particular man himself is pointed at as being
   white, although whiteness is beyond the essential notion of humanity.
   But in no way can it be said that Socrates is Plato, or any other of
   the individuals either of the same or of a different species. If then
   the Word has been made flesh, that is, man, it is impossible for there
   to be two persons, one of the Word, the other of the Man.

   4. No one would say, I am running,' when some one else was running,
   except perhaps figuratively, meaning that another was running in his
   place. But that man who is called Jesus (John ix, 11) says of Himself,
   Before Abraham was, I am (John viii, 58); I and the Father are one
   (John x, 30); and sundry other phrases, manifestly proper to the
   divinity of the Word. Therefore the person of that Man speaking is the
   person of the Son of God.

   6. To ascend into heaven is clearly an attribute of Christ as man, who
   in their sight was taken up (Acts i, 9). And to descend from heaven is
   an attribute of the Word of God. But he who descended, the same is he
   that hath ascended (Eph. iv, 10).

   11. Though a man be called Lord' by participation in the divine
   dominion, still no man, nor any creature whatever, can be called the
   Lord of glory': because the glory of happiness to come is something
   which God alone by nature possesses, others only by the gift of grace:
   hence it is said: The Lord of mighty deeds, he is the king of glory
   (Ps. xxiii, 10). But, had they known, never could they have crucified
   the Lord of glory (1 Cor. ii, 8). It is true then to say that God was
   crucified.

   12. Scripture attributes suffering and death to the only-begotten Son
   of God: He spared not his own Son, but gave him up for us all (Rom.
   viii, 32): God so loved the world as to give his only begotten Son
   (John iii, 16: cf. verse 1 and Rom. v, 8).

   17. The word was made flesh (John i, 14). But the Word was not flesh
   except of a woman. The Word then was made of a woman (Gal. iv, 4), --
   of a Virgin Mother, for a Virgin is the Mother of the Word of God.
   [924]

   19. Phil. ii, 5-11. If with Nestorius we divide Christ into two -- into
   the Man, who is the Son of God by adoption, and the Son of God by
   nature, who is the Word of God, -- this passage cannot be understood of
   the Man. That Man, if he be mere man, was not, to begin with, in the
   form of God so as afterwards to come to be in the likeness of men, but
   rather the other way about, being man, He became partaker of the Deity,
   in which participation He was not emptied, but exalted. It must then be
   understood of the Word of God, that He was, to begin with, from
   eternity in the form of God, that is, in the nature of God, and
   afterwards emptied himself by being made in the likeness of men. That
   emptying cannot be understood to mean the mere in dwelling of the Word
   of God in the man Christ Jesus. For from the beginning of the world the
   Word of God has dwelt by grace in all holy men, yet not for that is it
   said to be emptied: for God's communication of His goodness to
   creatures is no derogation from Himself but rather an exaltation,
   inasmuch as His pre-eminence appears by the goodness of creatures, and
   all the more the better the creatures are. Hence if the Word of God
   dwelt more fully in the Man Christ than in other saints, there was less
   emptying of the Word in His case than in the case of others. Evidently
   then the union of the Word with human nature is not to be understood to
   mean the mere indwelling of the Word of God in that Man, but the Word
   of God truly being made man. Thus only can that emptying be said to
   take place; the Word of God being said to be emptied, that is made
   small, not by any loss of His own greatness, but by the assumption of
   human littleness. [925]

   24. The man Christ, speaking of Himself, says many divine and
   supernatural things, as, I will raise him up at the last day (John vi,
   40): I give them life everlasting (John x, 28). Such language would be
   the height of pride, if the speaker were not Himself God, but only had
   God dwelling in him. And still Christ says of Himself: Learn of me,
   because I am meek and humble of heart (Matt. xi, 29). [926]

   26. In him all things were made (Col. i, 16) is said of the Word of
   God; and first-born of the dead (ib. 18) is said of Christ; in such
   context as to show that the Word of God and Christ are one and the same
   person.

   27. The same conclusion appears in 1 Cor. viii, 6: And one Lord Jesus
   Christ, by whom are all things.

   The opinion of Nestorius on the mystery of the Incarnation differs
   little from the opinion of Photinus. Both asserted that the man Christ
   was God only through the indwelling of grace. Photinus said that Christ
   merited the name and glory of Godhead by His passion and good works.
   Nestorius avowed that He had this name and glory from the first instant
   of His conception on account of the full and ample indwelling of God in
   Him. But concerning the eternal generation of the Word they differ
   considerably; Nestorius confessing it, Photinus denying it entirely.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [922] The great feature in the theology of the fourth and fifth
   centuries was the opposition between the school of Alexandria,
   allegorical, mystical, Oriental, and the school of Antioch,
   matter-of-fact, literal, accurate, Western-minded. There were Saints
   and Doctors of both schools, and heretics in both, the latter carrying
   the tendencies of their respective schools to excess. From Alexandria
   came Origen, Athanasius, Cyril, Arius, Apollinaris, Dioscorus. From
   Antioch, John Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Nestorius.
   Theodore in his early career was a friend of St John Chrysostom, who
   addressed to him the still extant treatise, Ad Theodorum lapsum,
   against the forsaking of monastic life. He was a priest with Chrysostom
   at Antioch, then in 392 bishop of Mopsuestia (Mopsou hestia) in
   Cilicia, and died in his bishopric in 428, three years before the
   Council of Ephesus. Theodore was a voluminous writer and biblical
   commentator, fond of the literal sense, hating allegories. He was a
   vigorous opponent of Arius, and especially of Apollinaris. On the other
   hand, he countenanced the Pelagians, and wrote against St Jerome and St
   Augustine. Theodore, like Bishop Jansenius of Ypres, enjoyed the
   reputation of orthodoxy all his life, and died in the peace of the
   Church. As the Jansenists took up the book of Jansenius, drew their
   heresy from it, and involved themselves and it in a final condemnation;
   so the Nestorians fell back upon Theodore, the protagonist of the
   Antiochene school. Thus Theodore and his works came to be condemned in
   the fifth General Council, the second of Constantinople in 553. Since
   their condemnation, the greater part of them have perished. Nestorius,
   a Syrian, educated at Antioch, became bishop of Constantinople in 428,
   the year of Theodore's death. He was condemned and deposed in the
   Council of Ephesus in 431. Nestorianism is the most rationalistic, and
   in that way the acutest, of all heretical perversions of the
   Incarnation. At this day, east and west, beyond the visible pale of the
   Catholic Church, thousands of professing Christians are, consciously or
   unconsciously, Nestorians.

   [923] Persona is a rational nature complete by itself Suppositum is any
   nature so complete, whether rational or irrational.

   [924] "Enough," says St Thomas, "that the body is of the mother, though
   the soul is not. Suitably therefore is the Blessed Virgin said to be
   the mother of the Word of God, and even of God, though the divinity of
   the Word is not borrowed from a mother. There is no need of a son
   borrowing all his substance from his mother, but only his body" (above,
   n. 13) -- Mary is the mother of Him who is God. She is not mother of
   the Godhead, or divine nature. Neither is any man's mother mother of
   his soul.

   [925] In note on page 361] a somewhat different interpretation is
   offered according to more modern views of this important passage. St
   Thomas and the older school take the emptying (exinanitio, kenosis) to
   consist in the Incarnation itself. The more modern view represents it
   as consisting, not in the Incarnation itself, but in the manner of life
   chosen by the Word Incarnate, a life fraught with the miseries, needs
   and liabilities of ordinary humanity, whereas the glory and
   impassibility, which He assumed only at His resurrection, was His by
   right from His mother's womb. This is the meaning of that term, so
   celebrated in modern theology, kenosis. If we regard the divine nature,
   the Incarnation itself was, as St Thomas says, "no loss of God's own
   greatness," which nothing can possibly diminish. Again, if we regard
   the human nature assumed at the Incarnation, that humanity, again to
   employ St Thomas's words, "was not emptied, but exalted," -- and that
   much more by the hypostatic union than by any Nestorian inhabitatio
   divinitatis. Either way explained, the passage tells against Nestorius.

   [926] This is the thesis, Christus si non Deus, non bonus, urged in
   Liddon's Bampton Lectures on the Divinity of Christ, where also many of
   these texts are handled.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXV--Against the Error of Eutyches

   EUTYCHES, [927] to save the unity of person in Christ against
   Nestorius, said that in Christ there was only one nature. He went on to
   explain how before the union there were two distinct natures, one
   divine and one human; but in the union they both met so as to form one.
   He said then that the person of Christ was of two natures, but did not
   subsist in two natures. The falsity of this statement is apparent on
   many counts.

   1. In Christ Jesus there was a Body, and a natural Soul, and the
   Divinity. The Body of Christ, even after the union, was not the
   Divinity of the Word: for the Body of Christ, even after the union, was
   passible, visible to bodily eyes, and distinct in lineaments and limbs,
   all of which attributes are alien to the Divinity of the Word. In like
   manner the Soul of Christ after union was distinct from the Divinity of
   the Word, because the Soul of Christ, even after the union, was
   affected by the passions of sadness and grief and anger (Mark iii, 5:
   xiv, 34), which again can in no way be adapted to the Divinity of the
   Word. But soul and body make up human nature. Thus then, even after
   union, there was a human nature in Christ, other than the Divinity of
   the Word, which is the divine nature.

   2. Being in the form of God, he took the form of a servant (Phil. ii,
   6, 7). It cannot be said that the form of God and the form of a servant
   are the same, for nothing takes that which it already has. In
   Eutyches's view, Christ having already the form of God, could not have
   taken the form of a servant, the two being the same. Nor can it be said
   that the form of God in Christ was changed by the union, for so Christ
   after the union would not be God. Nor again can it be said that the
   form of the servant was mingled with the form of God, for mingled
   elements do not remain entire, but both are partially changed: hence it
   should not be said that He had taken the form of a servant, but
   something of that form. Thus the Apostle's words must mean that in
   Christ, even after union, there were two forms, therefore two natures.

   3. If we suppose a blending of both natures, divine and human, neither
   would remain, but some third thing; and thus Christ would be neither
   God nor man. Eutyches then cannot be understood to mean that one nature
   was made out of the two. He can only mean that after union only one of
   the natures remained. Either then in Christ only the divine nature
   remained, and what seemed in Him human was merely phenomenal, as the
   Manicheans said; or the divine nature was changed into a human nature,
   as Apollinaris said: against both of whom we have argued above (Chapp.
   [470]XXIX, [471]XXXI).

   5. When one nature is constituted of two permanent components, these
   components are either bodily parts, like the limbs of an animal, a case
   not in point here, or they are matter and form, like body and soul: but
   God is not matter, nor can He stand to any matter in the relation of
   form. Therefore in Christ, true God and true Man, there cannot be one
   nature only.

   7. Where there is no agreement in nature, there is no specific
   likeness. If then the nature of Christ is a compound of divine and
   human, there will be no specific likeness between Him and us, contrary
   to the saying of the Apostle: He ought in all things to be made like to
   his brethren (Heb. ii, 17).

   9. Even this saying of Eutyches seems inconsistent with the faith, that
   there were two natures in Christ before the union: for as human nature
   is made up of body and soul, it would follow that either the soul, or
   the body of Christ, or both, existed before the Incarnation, which is
   evidently false.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [927] Eutyches, a monk of Constantinople, an extreme opponent of
   Nestorius and of the Antiochene school,--and as such supported by the
   patriarch of Alexandria, Dioscorus,--was condemned in the Council of
   Chalcedon in 451. The Monophysite heresy, which he started, continued
   to trouble the peace of the Eastern Church and Empire for two
   centuries. It pervaded Alexandria and even Antioch, under such worthy
   prelates as Timothy "the Cat" (Alexandrin.) and Peter "the Fuller"
   (Antiochen.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXVI--Of the Error of Macarius of Antioch, who posited one
   Operation only and one Will only in Christ [928]

   TO every nature there is a proper activity: for the form is the
   principle of activity, and different natures have different forms and
   different acts. If then in Christ there is only one operation, there
   must be in Him only one nature: but to hold that is the Eutychian
   heresy.

   2. There is in Christ a perfect divine nature, whereby He is
   consubstantial with the Father; and a perfect human nature, whereby He
   is of one species with us. But it is part of the perfection of the
   divine nature to have a will (B. I, Chap. [472]LXXII); and part of the
   perfection of human nature to have a will, whereby a man is capable of
   free choice. There must therefore be two wills in Christ.

   3. If in Christ there is no other will than the will of the Word, by
   parity of reasoning there can be in Him no understanding but the
   understanding of the Word: thus we are brought back to the position of
   Apollinaris (Chap. [473]XXXII).

   4. If there was only one will in Christ, that must have been the divine
   will: for the Word could not have lost the divine will, which he had
   from eternity. But it does not belong to the divine will to merit. Thus
   then Christ would have merited neither for Himself nor for us by His
   passion, contrary to the teaching of the Apostle: He was made obedient
   unto death, therefore hath God exalted him (Phil. ii, 8, 9).

   6. In one ordinary man, though he be one in person, there are
   nevertheless several appetites and operations according to different
   natural principles. In his rational part there is in him will: in his
   sensible part there is in him an irascible [thumos] and a concupiscible
   appetite [epithumetikon]: and again there is physical tendency
   following upon physical powers. [929] In like manner he sees with the
   eye, hears with the ear, walks with the foot, speaks with the tongue,
   and understands with the mind, all so many different activities. And
   the reason is, because activities are not only multiplied according to
   difference of active subjects, but also according to the difference of
   the principles whereby one and the same subject works, from which
   principles also the activities derive their species. But the divine
   activity differs much more from the human than the natural principles
   of human nature from one another. There is therefore a difference of
   will and a difference of operation between the divine and the human
   nature in Christ, although Christ Himself is one in both natures.

   7. The authority of Scripture shows plainly two wills in Christ: Not to
   do my will, but the will of Him that sent me (John vi, 38): Not my will
   but thine be done (Luke xxii, 42). These texts show that Christ had a
   will of His own, besides the will of His Father. On the other hand
   there was a will common to Him with the Father: for Father and Son have
   one will, as they have one nature. There are then in Christ two wills.

   8. And in like manner of operations, or activities, -- there was in
   Christ one operation common to Him with the Father, of which He says:
   Whatsoever things the Father doeth, the same the Son doeth also (John
   v, 19); and there was in Him another operation which attached not to
   the Father, as sleeping, hungering, eating, and the like things that
   Christ did or suffered in His humanity, as the Evangelists record (Mark
   iv, 38; xi, 12; ii, 16).

   Monothelism appears to have sprung from the inability of its authors to
   distinguish between what is absolutely one and what is one in
   subordination to another. They saw that the human will in Christ was
   altogether subordinate to the divine will, so that Christ willed
   nothing with His human will otherwise than as the divine will
   predisposed Him to will. [930] In like manner Christ wrought nothing in
   His human nature either in doing or in suffering, except what the
   divine will arranged, according to the text, I do ever the things that
   are pleasing to him (John viii, 29). The human operation of Christ
   gained a divine efficacy by His union with the Divinity, in consequence
   of which everything that He did or suffered made for salvation:
   wherefore Dionysius calls the human activity of Christ theandric.'
   Seeing then that the human will and operation of Christ was subordinate
   to the divine, with a subordination that never failed, they [the
   Monothelites] judged that there was only one will and operation in
   Christ; although it is not the same thing to be one by subordination
   and one absolutely. [931]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [928] This error made the heresy of Monothelism, condemned at the sixth
   General Council, the third of Constantinople, in 680-1, where Macarius,
   Patriarch of Antioch, was its principal supporter.

   [929] Physical tendency (naturalis appetitus) does not involve
   consciousness: it is the unconscious nisus of nature, found in all
   material agents according to their several kinds.

   [930] Understand this of the human will of Christ, full, perfect, and
   absolutely determined, not of those first motions of the will which He
   renounces in Luke xxii, 42, saying, Not my will.

   [931] As a wife, however obedient to her husband, is never quite the
   same person.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XXXIX--The Doctrine of Catholic Faith concerning the
   Incarnation

   ACCORDING to the tradition of Catholic faith we must say that in Christ
   there is one perfect divine nature, and a perfect human nature, made up
   of a rational soul and human flesh; and that these two natures are
   united in Christ, not by mere indwelling of the one in the other, or in
   any accidental way, as a man is united with his garment, but in unity
   of one person. For since Holy Scripture without any distinction assigns
   the things of God to the Man Christ, and the things of the Man Christ
   to God, He must be one and the same person, of whom both varieties of
   attributes are predicable. But because opposite attributes are not
   predicable of one and the same subject in the same respect, and there
   is an opposition between the divine and human attributes that are
   predicated of Christ, -- as that He is passible and impassible, dead
   and immortal, and the like, -- these divine and human attributes must
   be predicated of Christ in different respects. If we consider that of
   which these opposite attributes are predicated, we shall find no
   distinction to draw, but unity appears there. But considering that
   according to which these several predications are made, there we shall
   see the need of drawing a distinction. [932] Since that according to
   which divine attributes are predicated of Christ is different from that
   according to which human attributes are predicated of Him, we must say
   that there are in Him two natures, unamalgamated and unalloyed. And
   since that of which these human and divine attributes are predicated is
   one and indivisible, we must say that Christ is one person, and one
   suppositum, supporting a divine and a human nature. Thus alone will
   divine attributes duly and properly be predicated of the Man Christ,
   and human attributes of the Word of God.

   Thus also it appears how, though the Son is incarnate, it does not
   follow that the Father or the Holy Ghost is incarnate: for the
   incarnation does not have place in respect of that unity of nature
   wherein in the three Persons agree, but in respect of person and
   suppositum, wherein the three Persons are distinct. Thus as in the
   Trinity there is a plurality of persons subsisting in one nature, so in
   the mystery of the Incarnation there is one person subsisting in a
   plurality of natures.

   CHAPTER XLI--Some further Elucidation of the Incarnation

   EUTYCHES made the union of God and man a union of nature: Nestorius, a
   union neither of nature nor of person: the Catholic faith makes it a
   union of person, not of nature. To forestall objections, we need to
   form clear notions of what it is to be united in nature,' and what it
   is to be united in person.'

   Those things then are united in nature,' which combine to constitute
   the integrity of some specific type, as soul and body are united to
   constitute the specific type of animal.' Once a specific type is set up
   in its integrity, no foreign element can be united with it in unity of
   nature without the breaking up of that specific type. [933] But what is
   not of the integrity of the specific type is readily found in some
   individual contained under the species, as whiteness and clothedness in
   Socrates or Plato. [934] All such non-specific attributes are said to
   be united in unity of suppositum,' or in the case of rational beings,
   in unity of person,' with the individual.

   Now some have reckoned the union of God and man in Christ to be after
   the manner of things united in unity of nature.' Thus Arius and
   Apollinaris and Eutyches. But that is quite an impossibility. For the
   nature of the Word is a sovereignly perfect whole from all eternity,
   incapable of alteration or change: nothing foreign to the divine
   nature, -- no human nature, nor any element of human nature, -- can
   possibly come to thrust itself into that unity. [935] Others saw the
   impossibility of this position, and turned aside in the contrary
   direction. Whatever is added to any nature without belonging to the
   integrity of the same, may be reckoned to be either an accident, as
   whiteness and music, or to stand in an accidental relation to the
   subject, as a ring, a dress, a house. Considering then that human
   nature is added to the Word of God without belonging to the integrity
   of His nature, these [Nestorians] thought that the union of this
   supperadded human nature with the Word was merely accidental.
   Manifestly, it could not be in the Word as an accident, for God is not
   susceptible of accidents; and besides human nature itself stands in the
   category of substance, and cannot be an accident of anything. The
   alternative which they embraced was to conclude that the human nature
   stood in an accidental relation with the Word. Nestorius then laid it
   down that the human nature stood to the word in the relation of a
   temple to the Deity whose temple it was; and that union with human
   nature meant a mere indwelling of the Word in that nature. And because
   a temple has its individuality apart from him that dwells in it, and
   the individuality proper to human nature is personality, it followed
   that the personality of the human nature was one, and the personality
   of the Word another; and thus the Word and the Man were two persons:
   all which conclusion has been set aside by our previous arguments.

   We must therefore lay it down that the union of the Word with the Man
   was such, that neither was one nature compounded out of two; nor was
   the union of the Word with human nature like the union of a substance
   with something exterior to it and standing in an accidental relation to
   it, like the relation of a man to his garment and his house: but the
   Word must be considered to subsist in human nature as in a nature made
   properly its own, so that that Body is truly the Body of the Word of
   God, and that Soul the Soul of the Word of God, and the Word of God
   truly is man. And though such union cannot be perfectly explained by
   mortal man, still we will endeavour, according to our capacity and
   ability, to say something towards the building up of faith and the
   defence of this mystery of faith against unbelievers.

   In all creation there is nothing so like this union as the union of
   soul and body. So the Athanasian Creed has it: "As the rational soul
   and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ." [936] But whereas
   the rational soul is united with the body, (a) as form with matter, (b)
   as chief agent with instrument (B. II, Chapp. [474]LVI, [475]LVII );
   this comparison cannot hold in respect of the former mode of union, for
   so we should be brought round to the [Eutychian] conclusion, that of
   God and man there was made one nature. We must take the point of the
   comparison then to be the union of soul with body as of agent with
   instrument. And with this the sayings of some ancient Doctors agree,
   who have laid it down that the human nature in Christ is an instrument
   of His divinity, as the body is an instrument of the soul. [937] The
   body and its parts, as instruments of the soul, come in a different
   category from exterior instruments. This axe is not my own proper
   instrument as is this hand. With this axe many men may work: but this
   hand is set aside for the proper activity of this soul. Therefore the
   hand is a tool conjoined with and proper to him that works with it: but
   the axe is an instrument extrinsic to the workman and common to many
   hands. Thus then we may take it to be with the union of God and man.
   All men stand to God as instruments wherewith He works: For he it is
   that worketh in us to will and accomplish on behalf of the good will
   (Phil. ii, 13). But other men stand to God as extrinsic and separate
   instruments. God moves them, not merely to activities proper to
   Himself, but to activities common to all rational nature, such as
   understanding truth, loving goodness, and working justice. But human
   nature has been taken up in Christ to work as an instrument proper to
   God alone, such works as cleansing of sins, illumination of the mind by
   grace, and introduction to everlasting life. The human nature therefore
   of Christ stands to God as an instrument proper and conjoined, as the
   hand to the soul.

   The aforesaid examples however are not alleged as though a perfect
   likeness were to be looked for in them. We must understand how easy it
   was for the Word of God to unite Himself with human nature in a union
   far more sublime and intimate than that of the soul with any proper
   instrument.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   [933] e.g., if horns came to be part of elephant nature, so that no
   animal could count as an elephant that had not horns, clearly our
   present specific type of elephant would be broken up, and a new type
   substituted.

   [934] Of these extra-specific attributes in the individual, the more
   permanent, e.g., the colour of his skin, go to constitute his notae
   individuantes. Read sub aliqua specie, not sub alia specie.

   [935] This argument would hold less against Arius than against
   Apollinaris and Eutyches, who admitted the divinity of the Logos.

   [936] St Thomas here remarks that this comparison, -- in itself not
   without difficulty, as it may be pressed and perverted to an
   Apollinarist or Eutychian sense, -- would hold better if Averroes's
   theory were tenable, of the unity of all human intellect. On that
   theory, as St Thomas points out, "a pre-existent intellect enters into
   a new union with a human concept, so that out of the two there results
   one person, just as we hold that the Word, pre-existent to human
   nature, is united to form one person with it." Averroism is, perhaps
   not altogether unconsciously, a travesty of the Incarnation. For
   Averroes see B. II, Chap. LIX.

   [937] The comparison, we see, is founded rather upon a Platonic than
   upon an Aristotelian view of the relation between soul and body; which,
   considering the devotion of the ancient Fathers, of the Alexandrines
   particularly, to Plato, is not surprising.

   CHAPTER XL, XLIX--Objections against the Faith of the Incarnation, with
   Replies

   ARG. 1. If God has taken flesh, He must be either changed into a body,
   or be some power resident in a body.

   Reply 1. The Incarnation does not mean either the conversion of the
   Word into flesh, or the union of the Word with a human body as the form
   of the same.

   Arg. 2. If the person of the Word of God acquires a new subsistence in
   a human nature, it must undergo a substantial change, as everything is
   changed that acquires a new nature.

   Reply 2. The change is not in the Word of God, but in the human nature
   assumed by the Word.

   Arg. 3. If the personality of the Word of God has become the
   personality of a human nature, it follows that since the Incarnation
   the Word of God has not been everywhere, as that human nature is not
   everywhere.

   Reply 3. Personality does not extend beyond the bounds of that nature
   from which it has its subsistence. But the Word of God has not its
   subsistence from its human nature, but rather draws that human nature
   to its own subsistence or personality: for it does not subsist through
   it, but in it.

   Arg. 4. One and the same thing has only one quiddity, substance, or
   nature. It seems impossible therefore for one person to subsist in two
   natures.

   Reply 4. The assertion is true, if you speak of the nature whereby a
   thing has being, absolutely speaking; and so, absolutely speaking, the
   Word of God has being by the divine nature alone, not by the human
   nature. But by the human nature it has being as Man.

   Arg. 8. Soul and body in Christ are of not less potency than they are
   in other men. But their union in other men constitutes a person:
   therefore also in Christ.

   Reply 8. The human soul and body in Christ being drawn into the
   personality of the Word, and not constituting another person besides
   the person of the Word, does not mark a diminution of potency, but a
   greater excellence. Everything is better for being united to what is
   more excellent than itself, better than it was, or would be, if it
   stood by itself. [938]

   Arg. 10. This man, who is Christ, considered merely as made up of soul
   and body, is a substance: but not a universal, therefore a particular
   substance: therefore a person.

   Reply 10. Yes, He is a person, but no other person than the person of
   the Word: because the human nature has been so assumed by the person of
   the Word that the Word subsists as well in the human as in the divine
   nature: but what subsists in human nature is this man': therefore the
   Word Himself is spoken of [939] when we say this Man.'

   Arg. 11. If the personality of the divine and human nature in Christ is
   the same, divine personality must be part of the notion of the Man who
   is Christ. But it is not part of the notion of other men. Therefore the
   application of the common term man' to Christ and to other men is an
   instance of the use of the same term not in the same sense; and thus He
   will not be of the same species with us.

   Reply 11. Variation of the sense of a term comes from diversity of form
   connoted, not from diversity of person denoted. The term man' does not
   vary in sense by denoting sometimes Plato, sometimes Socrates. [940]
   The term man' then, whether used of Christ or of other men, always
   connotes the same form, that is, human nature, and is predicated of
   them all in the same sense. But the denotation varies in this that, as
   taken for Christ, the term denotes an uncreated person; but as taken
   for other men, a created person.

   [938] May we then argue that a little State will be the better for
   being annexed by a large empire? Very often it will. But the goodness
   of States does not vary simply with their size: the little State may be
   the better of the two. Justice also has to be considered, which does
   not permit us to do to our neighbours, against their will, everything
   that we take to be for their good.

   [939] Supponitur: see the chapter on suppositio in the Latin logic
   books.

   supponere pro.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLIV--That the Human Nature, assumed by the Word, was perfect
   in Soul and Body in the instant of Conception

   THE Word of God took a body through the medium of a rational soul: for
   the body of man is not more assumable by God than other bodies except
   for the rational soul. [941] The Word of God then did not assume a body
   without a rational soul. Since then the Word of God assumed a body from
   the first instant of conception, in that very instant the rational soul
   must have been united with the body.

   4. The body which the Word assumed was formed from the first instant of
   conception, because it would have been against the fitness of things
   for the Word of God to have assumed anything that was formless.
   Moreover the soul, like any other natural form, requires its proper
   matter. Now the proper matter of the soul is an organised body: for
   "the soul is the actualisation of an organic, natural body, that is in
   potentiality to life." [942] If then the soul was united with the body
   from the first instant of conception, the body must needs have been
   organised and formed from the first instant of conception. Moreover in
   the order of the stages of generation the organisation of the body
   precedes the introduction of the rational soul: hence, positing the
   latter, we must posit the former stage also. But increase in quantity
   up to the due measure may very well be subsequent to the animation of
   the body. Thus then, concerning the conception of the Man assumed, we
   must think that in the very instant of conception His body was
   organised and formed, but had not as yet its due quantity. [943]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [941] St Gregory Nazianzen in his poem Against Apollinaris, 50 sq.,
   asks how two things so far apart as Deity and humanity could be united,
   and replies:

   Tis mystery, I but conjecture make.

   Divinity with flesh unmeet to blend:

   But thinking Soul, as twere a frontier power,

   Image of God, in body domiciled,

   Is apt to mediate between the twain.

   The Godhead then conjoined itself with Soul,

   And so assumed dimensions of a man.

   [942] Aristotle, De anima, I, ii.

   [943] The links of St Thomas's argument are these: (a) The Word was
   made flesh the very instant that His Humanity was conceived, the very
   instant that Mary spoke the word: Be it done to me according to thy
   word. (b) The Word would not take flesh otherwise than by assuming a
   body there and then animated with a rational soul. (c) A rational soul
   cannot inform a body not yet developed to human shape. In the ordinary
   course of human embryonic development, the embryo at conception, being
   incapable even of a sentient, still more of a rational soul, is
   animated with a vegetative soul, which after some days gives place to a
   sentient soul, and that after more days are expired, and the foetus is
   come to human shape, is finally replaced by a rational soul: all which
   process is drawn out at length in B. II, Chapp. [476]LXXXVIII,
   [477]LXXXIX. (d) This ordinary process of nature had to be set aside in
   the formation of Mary's miraculous Child. His Body was complete from
   the first, a fit receptacle for a rational soul. His Body consequently
   did not develop, it simply grew. Now the link (c) of this chain is
   broken by modern Catholic theologians. They see no difficulty in a
   rational soul informing a body not yet developed to human shape. They
   hold that the rational soul is always infused in the very instant of
   conception. Thereupon they conclude that the way of formation of
   Christ's body, after conception, in no way differed from that of other
   human bodies, nihil differens fuisse a reliquis foetibus humanis
   (Pesch, Praelectiones Dogmaticae, vol. IV, p. 85, ed. 1896). Scripture
   is silent on the subject; modern biology would be amazed at such a mode
   of growth as St Thomas and Suarez after him suppose; and miracles, as
   Suarez himself here owns, are not to be multiplied without necessity or
   high congruity (Suarez, De mysteriis Christi, disp. II, sect. 2, nn. 2,
   4). This discussion has an extrinsic interest as illustrating two
   several views of another mighty development, that of Church government
   and doctrine. The development of the Bridegroom may well be the pattern
   of that of the Bride. Accepting St Thomas's supposition of the three
   successive souls, as a supposition not yet quite exploded, there is
   still some doubt as to his conclusion, in point of link (b). The Word
   remained united with the dead Body of Christ, from whence all soul was
   departed: might it not then unite itself with a living Body into which
   in due course of nature a rational soul was soon to come?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XLV--That Christ was born of a Virgin without prejudice to His
   true and natural Humanity

   GOD'S power being infinite, and all other causes deriving their
   efficacy from that, any effect produced by any cause may be produced by
   God without aid of that cause, and yet be of the same species and
   nature as though it had been produced in the ordinary way. As then the
   natural power of the human semen produces a true man, having the
   species and nature of a man, so the divine power, which has given that
   power to the semen, may produce the effect of that power, without
   calling the cause into activity, and so constitute a true man, having
   the species and nature of a man. Nor is anything lost to the dignity of
   the Mother of Christ by the virgin conception and birth: there is
   nothing in that to prevent her being called the Mother of the Son of
   God: for by the working of divine power she supplied the matter
   physically requisite for the generation of the body of Christ: which is
   all that a mother need do.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTERS XLVI, XLVII--That Christ was conceived by the Holy Ghost

   THOUGH every divine activity, whereby anything is done in creatures, is
   common to the entire Trinity, nevertheless the formation of the body of
   Christ is appropriately attributed to the Holy Ghost: for in Scripture
   every grace is wont to be attributed to the Holy Ghost, since what is
   given gratuitously is reckoned to be bestowed out of the love of the
   giver; [944] and there is no greater grace bestowed on man than his
   coming to be united with God in union of person. [945] Still the Holy
   Ghost cannot be called the father of Christ in His human generation;
   because the Holy Ghost did not produce the human nature of Christ out
   of His own substance, but merely by an exertion of His power.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [944] And the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of love. But especially every
   miraculous grace is put down in Holy Scripture as a special charisma of
   the Holy Ghost; and the conception of the Word is the greatest of
   miracles.

   [945] Commonly called the hypostatic union.'
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIV--Of the Incarnation as part of the Fitness of Things

   BY the fact of God having willed to unite human nature to Himself in
   unity of person, it is plainly shown to men that man can be
   intellectually united with God and see Him with an immediate vision. It
   was therefore very fitting for God to assume human nature, thereby to
   lift up man's hope to happiness. Hence since the Incarnation men have
   begun to aspire more after happiness, as Christ Himself says: I have
   come that they may have life and have it more abundantly (John x, 10).

   2. Although in certain respects man is inferior to some other
   creatures, and in some respects is likened to the very lowest, yet in
   respect of the end for which he is created nothing is higher than man
   but God alone: for in God alone does the perfect happiness of man
   consist. This dignity of man, requiring to find happiness in the
   immediate vision of God, is most aptly shown by God's immediate
   assumption of human nature. The Incarnation has borne this fruit,
   visible to all eyes, that a considerable portion of mankind has
   abandoned the worship of creatures, trampled under foot the pleasures
   of the flesh, and devoted itself to the worship of God alone, in whom
   alone it expects the perfect making of its happiness, according to the
   admonition of the Apostle: Seek the things that are above (Col. iii,
   1).

   3. Since the perfect happiness of man lies in a knowledge of God beyond
   the natural capacity of any created intelligence (B. III, Chap.
   [478]LII), there was wanted for man in this life a sort of foretaste of
   this knowledge to guide him to the fulness of it; and that foretaste is
   by faith (B. III, Chapp. [479]XL, [480]CLIII). But this knowledge of
   faith, whereby a man is guided to his last end, ought to be of the
   highest certitude: to which perfect certitude man needed to be
   instructed by God Himself made man. So it is said: No man hath seen God
   ever: the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
   told us (John i, 18): For this I was born, and for this I came into the
   world to give testimony to the truth (John xviii, 37). Thus we see that
   since the Incarnation of Christ men have been instructed more evidently
   and surely in the knowledge of God, according to the text: The earth is
   filled with the knowledge of the Lord (Isai. xi, 9).

   4. Since the perfect happiness of man consists in the enjoyment of God,
   it was requisite for man's heart to be disposed to desire this
   enjoyment. But the desire of enjoying anything springs from the love of
   it. Therefore it was requisite for man, making his way to perfect
   happiness, to be induced to love God. Now nothing induces us to love
   any one so much as the experience of his love for us. Nor could God's
   love for man have been more effectually demonstrated to man than by
   God's willing to be united with man in unity of person: for this is
   just the property of love, to unite the lover with the loved.

   5. Friendship resting on a certain equality, persons very unequal
   cannot be conjoined in friendship. To promote familiar friendship then
   between man and God, it was expedient that God should become man, "that
   while we know God in visible form, we may thereby be borne on to the
   love of His invisible perfections " (Mass of Christmas Day).

   6. For the strengthening of man in virtue it was requisite that he
   should receive doctrine and examples of virtue from God made man, since
   of mere men even the holiest are found at fault sometimes. I have given
   you an example, that as I have done so ye also do (John xiii, 15).

   8. The tradition of the Church teaches us that the whole human race has
   been infected by sin. And it is part of the order of divine justice
   that sin should not be forgiven without satisfaction. But no mere man
   was able to satisfy for the sin of all mankind, since every mere man is
   something less than the whole multitude of mankind. For the deliverance
   then of mankind from their common sin, it was requisite for one to make
   satisfaction, who was at once man, so that satisfaction should be
   expected of him, and something above man, so that his merit should be
   sufficient to satisfy for the sin of the whole human race. Now in the
   order of happiness there is nothing greater than man but God alone: for
   though the angels are higher in condition of nature, they are not
   higher in respect to their final end, because they are made happy with
   the same happiness as man. [946] It was needful therefore for man's
   attainment of happiness that God should become man, to take away the
   sin of the world (John i, 29: Rom. iv, 25: v, 18: Heb. ix, 28).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [946] Man in his final state is to be as blissful and glorious as an
   angel. There is equality between angels and saints in heaven, isangeloi
   gar eisi (Luke xx, 36). -- The need' of the Incarnation, spoken of
   throughout this chapter, is a necessity of consequence only. The
   Incarnation was a boon to man; and needful' as the central part of a
   divine dispensation, which however in itself was not an absolute
   necessity (Cf. B. II, Chap. XXVIII).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LV--Points of Reply to Difficulties touching the Economy of the
   Incarnation

   WE must bear in mind that, so immovable is the divine goodness in its
   perfection, that nothing is lost to God, however near any creature is
   raised to Him: the gain is to the creature.

   3. Man being a compound of a spiritual and a corporeal nature, and
   thereby, we may say, occupying the borderland of two natures, all
   creation seems to be interested in whatever is done for man's
   salvation. Lower corporeal creatures make for his use, and are in some
   sort of subjection to him: while the higher spiritual creation, the
   angelic, has in common with man its attainment of the last end. This
   argues a certain appropriateness in the universal Cause of all
   creatures taking to Himself in unity of person that creature whereby He
   is more readily in touch with all the rest of creation.

   4. Sin in man admits of expiation, because man's choice is not
   immovably fixed on its object, but may be perverted from good to evil,
   and from evil brought back to good; and the like is the case of man's
   reason, which, gathering the truth from sensible appearances and signs,
   can find its way to either side of a conclusion. But an angel has a
   fixed discernment of things through simple intuition; and as he is
   fixed in his apprehension, so is he fixed also in his choice. Hence he
   either does not take to evil at all; or if he does take to evil, he
   takes to it irrevocably, and his sin admits of no expiation. Since then
   the expiation of sin was the chief cause of the Incarnation, it was
   more fitting for human nature than for angelic nature to be assumed by
   God.

   7. Though all created good is a small thing, compared with the divine
   goodness, still there can be nothing greater in creation than the
   salvation of the rational creature, which consists in the enjoyment of
   that divine goodness. And since the salvation of man has followed from
   the Incarnation of God, it cannot be said that that Incarnation has
   brought only slight profit to the world. Nor need all men be saved by
   the Incarnation, but they only who by faith and the sacraments of faith
   adhere to the Incarnation.

   8. The Incarnation was manifested to man by sufficient evidences. There
   is no more fitting way of manifesting Godhead than by the performance
   of acts proper to God. Now it is proper to God to be able to change the
   course of nature (naturae leges), by doing something above that nature
   of which Himself is the author. Works overriding the ordinary course of
   nature (opera quae supra leges naturae fiunt) are the aptest evidences
   of divine being. Such works Christ did; and by these works He argued
   His Divinity. When asked, Art thou he that is to come? He replied, The
   blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the
   dead rise again (Luke vii, 22). [947] And if it be said that the same
   miracles have been wrought by others, we must observe that Christ
   worked them in a very different and more divine way. Others are said to
   have wrought miracles by prayer, but Christ wrought them by command, as
   of His own power. And He not only wrought them Himself, but He gave to
   others the power of working the same and even greater miracles; and
   they worked them at the mere invocation of the name of Christ. And not
   only corporal miracles, but spiritual miracles, were wrought through
   Christ and at the invocation of His name: the Holy Ghost was given,
   hearts were set on fire with divine love, minds were suddenly
   instructed in the knowledge of divine things, and the tongues of the
   simple were rendered eloquent to propose the divine truth to men (Heb.
   ii, 3, 4).

   9. Human nature is so conditioned as not to be apt to be led to
   perfection at once; but it must be led by the hand through stages of
   imperfection, so to arrive at perfection at last, as we see in the
   training of children. If great and unheard-of truths were proposed to a
   multitude, they would not grasp them immediately: their only chance is
   to become accustomed to such truths by mastering lesser truths first.
   Thus it was fitting for the human race to receive their first
   instruction in the things of salvation by light and rudimentary lessons
   (levia et minora documenta), delivered by the patriarchs, the law and
   the prophets; and that finally in the consummation of ages the perfect
   doctrine of Christ should be set forth on earth. When the fulness of
   time was come, God sent his Son (Gal. iv, 4). The law was our
   paedagogue unto Christ, but now we are no longer under a paedagogue
   (Gal. iii, 24, 25). [948]

   12. It was not expedient for the Incarnate God in this world to live in
   wealth and high honour: first, because the object of His coming was to
   withdraw the minds of men from their attachment to earthly things, and
   to raise them to things heavenly, for which purpose He found it
   necessary to draw men by His example to a contempt of riches: secondly,
   because if He had abounded in riches, and had been set in some high
   position, His divine doings would have been ascribed rather to secular
   power than to the virtue of the Divinity. This indeed forms the most
   efficacious argument of His Divinity, that without aid of secular power
   He has changed the whole world for the better. [949]

   13. God's commandment to men is of works of virtue; and the more
   perfectly any one performs an act of virtue, the more he obeys God. Now
   of all virtues charity is the chief: all others are referred to it.
   Christ's obedience to God consisted most of all in His perfect
   fulfilment of the act of charity: for greater charity than this no man
   hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends (John xv, 13).

   15. Though God has no wish for the death of men, yet He has a wish for
   virtue; and by virtue man meets death bravely, and exposes himself to
   danger of death for charity. Thus God had a wish for the death of
   Christ, inasmuch as Christ took upon Himself that death out of charity,
   and bravely endured it.

   17. It is well said that Christ wished to suffer the death of the cross
   in order to give an example of humility. The virtue of humility
   consists in keeping oneself within one's own bounds, not reaching out
   to things above one, but submitting to one's superior. Thus humility
   cannot befit God, who has no superior, but is above all. Whenever any
   one subjects himself out of humility to an equal or any inferior, that
   is because he takes that equal or inferior to be his superior in some
   respect. Though then the virtue of humility cannot attach to Christ in
   His divine nature, yet it may attach to Him in his human nature. And
   His divinity renders His humility all the more praiseworthy: for the
   dignity of the person adds to the merit of humility; and there can be
   no greater dignity to a man than his being God. Hence the highest
   praise attaches to the humility of the Man God, who, to wean men's
   hearts from worldly glory to the love of divine glory, chose to endure
   a death of no ordinary sort, but a death of the deepest ignominy.

   19. It was necessary for Christ to suffer (Luke xxiv, 46), not only to
   afford an example of braving death for the love of truth, but also for
   the expiation of the sins of other men; which expiation He made by His
   own sinless Self choosing to suffer the death due to sin, and so
   satisfying for others by taking on Himself the penalty due to others.
   And though the sole grace of God is sufficient for the forgiveness of
   sins, nevertheless in the process of that forgiveness something is
   required on his part to whom the sin is forgiven, namely, to offer
   satisfaction to him whom he has offended. [950] And because men could
   not do this for themselves, Christ did it for all, suffering a
   voluntary death for charity.

   20. Although when it is a question of punishing sins, he must be
   punished who has sinned, nevertheless, when it is a question of making
   satisfaction, one may bear another's penalty. When punishment is
   inflicted for sin, his iniquity is put into the scale who has sinned:
   but when satisfaction is made by the offender's voluntary taking upon
   himself a penalty to appease him whom he has offended, account is taken
   in that case of the affection and good will of him who makes the
   satisfaction. And this appears best in the case of one taking upon
   himself a penalty instead of another, and God accepting the
   satisfaction of one for another (B. III, Chap. [481]CLIX ad fin.) [951]

   25. Though the death of Christ is sufficient satisfaction for original
   sin, there is nothing incongruous in the miseries consequent [952] upon
   original sin remaining in all men, even in those who are made partakers
   of the redemption of Christ. It was a fit and advantageous arrangement
   for the punishment [953] to remain after the guilt was taken away: --
   first, for the conformity of the faithful with Christ, as of members
   with their head, that as Christ endured many sufferings, so His
   faithful should be subject to sufferings, and so arrive at immortality,
   as the Apostle says: If we suffer with him, so that we be glorified
   with him (Rom. viii, 17): -- secondly, because if men coming to Christ
   gained immediate exemption from death and suffering, many men would
   come rather for these corporal benefits than for spiritual goods,
   contrary to the intention of Christ, who came into the world to draw
   men from the love of corporal things to spiritual things: -- thirdly,
   because this sudden impassibility and immortality would in a manner
   compel men to receive the faith of Christ, and so the merit of faith
   would be lost.

   26. Each individual must seek the remedies that make for his own
   salvation. The death of Christ is a universal cause of salvation, as
   the sin of the first man was a universal cause of damnation. [954] But
   there is need of a special application to each individual for the
   individual to share in the effect of a universal cause. [955] The
   effect of the sin of our first parent reaches each individual through
   his carnal origin. The effect of the death of Christ reaches each
   individual by his spiritual regeneration, whereby he is conjoined and
   in a manner incorporated with Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [947] Miracles show that physical nature, the cosmos of necessary cause
   and effect, is not everything; that some cause of another order has
   stept in to alter the effect from what it would have been, had physical
   causes alone operated. Such a cause is man himself, much more God. The
   forces of physical nature, were they endowed with consciousness, would
   regard all man's manipulation of nature as miraculous: a house would be
   a miracle to them or a railway. Geology does not build railways, nor
   gravitation cathedrals. There Mind and Will has come in. God, too, has
   Mind and Will and Power, beyond that of man; and a miracle shows it. A
   miracle does not clash with nature'; but evidences that what we call
   nature' is not all the power that is. People who believe in nature,
   physical nature, and nothing but physical nature, will not hear of
   miracles. But what is there in physical nature to assure them that such
   nature is all in all, and that there is nothing beyond it?

   [948] St Thomas here recognises that Christianity could but develop
   slowly. It remains for us to prosecute the enquiry, which did not occur
   to St Thomas, what development Christianity had attained in the
   apostolic age, and how it further unfolded itself in the centuries that
   followed.

   [949] Not however without considerable aid from the secular power since
   the days of Constantine downwards. And it is the common doctrine of the
   schools that the aid of secular power is necessary for the well-being
   of the Church.

   [950] Where sanctifying grace is given, sin is forgiven: but
   sanctifying grace would not be given to any man, if Christ had not made
   satisfaction to His Father for the sin of all mankind. Sanctifying
   grace is in fact the forgiveness of sin.

   [951] What St Thomas here calls 'satisfaction,' answers fairly well to
   the French amende honorable. As St Thomas here teaches, it is not
   correct, in the strictest theological parlance, to say that Christ was
   punished' for the sins of the world. Great authorities may speak
   popularly and loosely on this as on other topics. But in strict
   theology we say that Christ made the amende honorable for the sins of
   all His brethren, and that in the manner most humiliating, painful, and
   costly to Himself. When any sinner, identifying himself with this
   amende honorable and satisfaction of his Saviour, cries with Him:
   Father, forgive me, for I knew not what I did'; that is to say: I was a
   fool in doing as I did, and now I see my folly and repent of it': the
   satisfaction that Christ made becomes available for that man, and
   according to the nature of his sorrow he is either forgiven or on the
   road to forgiveness.

   [952] These paenalitates consequentes, as St Thomas calls them, --
   death, suffering, dulness of heart, concupiscence, -- are no longer
   punishments, after baptism. The Church has condemned the proposition,
   that "all his life long a man ought to do penance for original sin"
   (Denzinger, Enchiridion, n, 1176).

   [953] That is to say, it was originally a punishment, and after baptism
   still remains a misery: cf. Council of Trent, Sess. 5, Can. 5. It is to
   be observed that exemption from these miseries is not due to man: they
   go with human nature, as such, unless God grants an exemption, as He
   did to the first man, who sinned and lost it.

   [954] Damnation here means exclusion from heaven and the supernatural
   happiness described in B. III, Chapp. LXI-LXIII.

   [955] Thus water-pipes have to be laid down to each house for that
   house to share the benefits of that universal cause of water supply,
   the city reservoirs.

   CHAPTER L--That Original Sin is transmitted from our First Parent to
   his Posterity

   THIS expressly appears from the words of the Apostle: As by one man sin
   came into the world, and by sin death, so death passed on to all men,
   seeing that all have sinned (Rom. v, 12) [956] . It cannot be said that
   by one man sin entered into the world by way of imitation, because in
   that interpretation sin would have reached only to those who imitate
   the first man in sinning; and since by sin death came into the world,
   death would reach only those who sin in the likeness of the first man
   that sinned. But to exclude this interpretation the Apostle adds: Death
   reigned from Adam to Moses even over those who did not sin in the
   likeness of the transgression of Adam. The Apostle's meaning therefore
   was not that by one man sin entered into the world in the way of
   imitation, but in the way of origin.

   Moreover, the common custom of the Church is to administer baptism to
   new-born children. But there would be no purpose in such
   administration, unless there were sin in them. If it is said that the
   purpose of infant baptism is not the cleansing of sin, but the arriving
   at the kingdom of God, the saying is nonsensical. They who say so,
   appeal to our Lord's words: Unless a man be born again of water and the
   Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John iii, 5).
   [957] The fact is, no one is excluded from the kingdom of God except
   for some fault. For the end of every rational creature is to arrive at
   happiness; which happiness can be only in the kingdom of God; which
   kingdom again is nothing else than the organised society of those who
   enjoy the vision of God, in which true happiness consists (B. III,
   Chap. [482]LXIII). [958] But nothing fails to gain its end except
   through some fault or flaw. If then unbaptised children cannot arrive
   at the kingdom of God, we must say that there is some fault, flaw, or
   sin in them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [956] The locus classicus in Scripture on original sin, Romans V,
   12-21, is fully considered in my Notes on St Paul pp. 340-347.

   [957] No one enters the kingdom of God except he have sanctifying
   grace. God's first arrangement was to give sanctifying grace to every
   man in the moment when He created the man's rational soul. To speak as
   we should speak of a human scheme, this arrangement was defeated by
   Adam's sin. Consequently upon that sin, God arranged to give
   sanctifying grace, ordinarily, not in creation, but in baptism. Before
   baptism, the infant is devoid of sanctifying grace. That void is not a
   mere negation, it is a privation: for it is an absence of that which
   the child ought to have, if it is to answer to its Maker's design of
   leading all mankind to grace and the vision of Himself. Whence this
   privation? Through the sin of Adam, the head and representative of the
   human race, and therefore of that child. This privation of sanctifying
   grace, as traceable to the sin of the first parent, is original sin in
   that child.

   [958] Understand, in the present order of providence,' not in that
   possible, but unrealised order of mere nature, in which God never
   intends to raise His rational creature to grace and beatific vision.
   Cf. B. III, Chap. L, with notes. In the order of mere nature, what
   Catholic divines now understand by original sin' would have been an
   impossibility. Of this difficult doctrine of original sin, the best
   English exposition is in the Essay on the Immaculate Conception in the
   late Father Harper's Peace through the Truth, First Series.

   CHAPTERS LI, LII--Arguments against Original Sin, with Replies

   CHAP. LII -- Before dealing with objections, we must premise that there
   are apparent in mankind certain probable signs of original sin, as we
   can argue fault from penalty. Now the human race generally suffers
   various penalties, corporal and spiritual. Among corporal penalties the
   chief is death, to which all the others lead up, as hunger, thirst, and
   the like. Among spiritual penalties the chief is the weak hold that
   reason takes of man, so that man with difficulty arrives at the
   knowledge of truth, easily falls into error, and cannot altogether
   surmount his bestial appetites, but often has his mind clouded by them.
   Some one may say that these defects, corporal and spiritual, are not
   penal, but natural. But looking at the thing rightly, and supposing
   divine providence, which to all varieties of perfection has adapted
   subjects apt to take up each variety, [959] we may form a fairly
   probable conjecture that God, in uniting the higher nature of the soul
   to the lower nature of the body, had the intention that the former
   should control the latter; and further intended to remove, by His
   special and supernatural providence, any impediment to such control
   arising out of any defect of nature. Thus, as the rational soul is of a
   higher nature than the body, it might be supposed that such would be
   the terms of the union of the soul with the body, that nothing could
   possibly be in the body contrary to the soul whereby the body lives;
   and in like manner, as reason in man is associated with sensitive
   appetite and other sensitive powers, it might be expected that reason
   would not be hampered by those sensitive powers, but rather would rule
   them. In accordance with these natural anticipations, we lay it down,
   according to the doctrine of faith, that the original constitution of
   man was such that, so long as his reason was subject to God, his lower
   faculties served him without demur, and no bodily impediment could
   stand in the way of his body obeying him, God and His grace supplying
   whatever was wanting in nature to the achievement of this result. But
   when his reason turned away from God, his lower powers revolted from
   reason; and his body became subject to passions contrary to the
   [rational] life that is by the soul. Thus then, though it may be
   admitted that these defects are natural, if we look at human nature on
   its lower side; nevertheless, if we consider divine providence and the
   dignity of the higher portion of human nature, we have a fairly
   probable ground for arguing that these defects are penal. Thus we may
   gather the inference [a priori] that the human race must have been
   infected with some sin from its first origin. Now we may answer the
   arguments to the contrary.

   Arg. 1. The son shall not bear the iniquity of his father (Ezech.
   xviii, 20).

   Reply 1. There is a difference between what affects one individual and
   what affects the nature of a whole species: for by partaking in the
   species many men are as one man, as Porphyry says. The sin then that
   belongs to one individual is not imputable to another individual,
   unless he sins too, because the one is personally distinct from the
   other. But any sin touching the specific nature itself may without
   difficulty be propagated from one to another, as the specific nature is
   imparted by one to others [by generation]. [960] Since sin is an evil
   of rational nature, and evil is a privation of good, we must consider
   of what good the privation is, in order to decide whether the sin in
   question belongs to our common nature, or is the particular sin of a
   private individual. The actual sins then, that are commonly committed
   by men, take away some good from the person of the sinner, such as
   grace and the due order of the parts of his soul: hence they are
   personal, and not imputable to a second party beyond the one person of
   the sinner. But the first sin of the first man not only robbed the
   sinner of his private and personal good, namely, grace and the due
   order of his soul, but also took away a good that belonged to the
   common nature of mankind. According to the original constitution of
   this nature, the lower powers were perfectly subject to reason, reason
   to God, and the body to the soul, God supplying by grace what was
   wanting to this perfection by nature. This benefit, which by some is
   called original justice,' [961] was conferred on the first man in such
   sort that it should be propagated by him to posterity along with human
   nature. But when by the sin of the first man reason withdrew from its
   subjection to God, the consequence was a loss of the perfect subjection
   of the lower powers to reason, and of the body to the soul, -- and that
   not only in the first sinner, but the same common defect has come down
   to posterity, to whom original justice would otherwise have descended.
   Thus then the sin of the first man, from whom, according to the
   doctrine of faith, all other men are descended, was at once a personal
   sin, inasmuch as it deprived that first man of his own private good,
   and also a sin of nature (peccatum naturale), inasmuch as it took away
   from that man, and consequently from his posterity, a benefit conferred
   upon the whole of human nature. [962] This defect, entailed upon other
   men by their first parent, has in those other men the character of a
   fault, inasmuch as all men are counted one man hy participation in a
   common nature. This sin is voluntary by the will of our first parent,
   as the action of the hand has the character of a fault from the will of
   the prime mover, reason. In a sin of nature different men are counted
   parts of a common nature, like the different parts of one man in a
   personal sin. [963]

   Arg. 5. What is natural is no sin, as it is not the mole's fault for
   being blind.

   Reply 5. The defects above mentioned are transmitted by natural origin,
   inasmuch as nature is destitute of the aid of grace, which had been
   conferred upon nature in our first parent, and was meant to pass from
   him to posterity along with nature; and, inasmuch as this destitution
   has arisen from a voluntary sin, the defect so consequent comes to bear
   the character of a fault. Thus these defects are at once culpable, as
   referred to their first principle, which is the sin of Adam; and
   natural, as referred to a nature now destitute [of original justice].

   Arg. 6. A defect in a work of nature happens only through defect of
   some natural principle.

   Reply 6. There is a defect of principle, namely, of the gratuitous gift
   bestowed on human nature in its first creation; which gift was in a
   manner natural,' not that it was caused by the principles of nature,
   but because it was given to man to be propagated along with his nature.

   Arg. 9. The good of nature is not taken away by sin: hence even in
   devils their natural excellences remain. Therefore the origin of human
   generation, which is an act of nature, cannot have been vitiated by
   sin.

   Reply 9. By sin there is not taken away from man the good of nature
   which belongs to his natural species, but a good of nature which was
   superadded by grace. [964]

   10. The gift, not belonging to the essence of the species, was
   nevertheless bestowed by God gratuitously on the first man, that from
   him it might pass to the entire species: in like manner the sin, which
   is the privation of that gift, passes to the entire species.

   11. Though by the sacraments of grace one is so cleansed from original
   sin that it is not imputed to him as a fault, -- and this is what is
   meant by saying that he is personally delivered from that sin, -- yet
   he is not altogether healed; [965] and therefore by the act of nature
   [i.e., of generation] original sin is transmitted to his posterity.
   Thus then in the human procreant, considered as a person, there is no
   original sin; and there may very well be no actual sin in the act of
   procreation: still, inasmuch as the procreant is a natural principle of
   procreation, the infection of original sin, as regards the nature,
   remains in him and in his procreative act. [966]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [959] Or for every form has prepared matter apt to receive that form.

   [960] All this would be clearer if Averroes's theory were tenable, of
   one common human mind, or soul, one common psychic stock, as it were,
   sprouting out into various branches, or personalities, something like
   an aquatic plant, with many heads showing above water, and these
   distinct, but all meeting in one root under water. Then we might argue
   that the common stock remained infected with original sin, though
   individuals were cleansed. The theory is, I suppose, utterly untenable;
   or, if there is any truth in it, it is a truth that no man hitherto has
   been able to formulate without grave and dangerous error. We cannot
   impute such a notion to the great opponent of Averroism. But St
   Thomas's distinction between nature and person in this connexion would
   be plainer, and his whole argument more telling, on Averroistic
   principles. See his own remark on Averroism in Chap. XLI.

   [961] Here is a definition carefully to note. Original justice,'
   according to St Thomas, is the perfect subjection of man's lower powers
   to his reason, of his reason to God, and of his body to his soul.' He
   marks off grace,' i.e., sanctifying grace, from original justice.'
   Original justice then implies freedom from concupiscence, from folly,
   and from bodily weakness and incapacity of all sorts. A man in original
   justice would have no difficulty in banishing from his mind thoughts
   that he recognised as foolish and undesirable. He would have absolute
   control over his emotions and passions.

   [962] From the context it is apparent that this benefit is the
   benefit,' above mentioned, of original justice.'

   [963] The difficulty of this interesting passage is its seeming to
   place original sin in the privation of original justice, as above
   defined: whereas baptism, cleansing as it does from original sin, does
   not impart original justice, but sanctifying grace. Original sin is the
   privation of sanctifying grace, under the explanations given in
   [483]note, p. 379. God's sentence upon Adam has worked like an
   attainder upon a nobleman guilty of treason. The title is taken away
   from the family. We are by nature and birth a family of commoners, and
   worse than commoners, for we ought to be noble, and are not, because of
   the brand of treason resting upon our race. So we are tekna phusei
   orges (Eph. ii, 3): we are born in disgrace with God. Our nobility
   comes with our baptism, and consists in the sanctifying grace given in
   that Sacrament; not in original justice,' which shall not be restored
   to our race till the day of the resurrection of the just. There is no
   difficulty in the text of Ezechiel, which refers to the sins of the
   people to whom the prophet was sent; and describes the providence of
   God, not over Adam, but over his posterity.

   [964] An axiom of the first importance in arguing with a Calvinist or a
   Jansenist, or any other who will maintain that human nature is
   desperately wicked,' or that all the virtues of philosophers are
   vices,' or that there is no virtue which is not supernatural.

   [965] Non tamen totaliter sanatur. Though there is nothing in this
   passage of St Thomas inconsistent with the Council of Trent, Sess. 5,
   Can. 5, still I scarcely think that the Saint would have written this
   phrase had that canon been framed in his time. The Council insists on
   the axiom that there is nothing in the baptised that God hates (in
   renatis nihil odit Deus). But waiving the question of language and
   formularies, St Thomas here stands on two affirmations which every
   Catholic must affirm with him: (1) that the baptised Christian, though
   cleansed from original sin, is not endowed with original justice,' as
   above defined: (2) that the children of baptised parents are conceived
   and born in original sin.

   [966] The above is a summary of the scholastic theology of original
   sin. If I mention biblical criticism of the historic value of the early
   chapters of Genesis; evolutionist views of the gradual development of
   man from bestial ancestors; the observations of the anthropologist on
   what he calls primitive man,' a being far removed from original
   justice,' and only innocent inasmuch as he lived without law (Rom. vii,
   9); I do so by way of recognition of the many sciences that now claim
   the attention of the ecclesiastical student over and above scholastic
   theology. The leisurely hours of the seventeenth century were occupied
   with discussions as to the number of days that Adam spent in Paradise,
   and whether original justice consists of one form ' or many. That
   leisure is gone: schole (whence scholastic) has passed into ascholia.
   Still, to be deep, one must specialise; and one field of specialisation
   is scholastic theology. Only let the modern scholastic specialist never
   take his eyes off the thought of the century in which he lives. St
   Thomas is brimful of the speculations that were rife in his own
   University of Paris. So is Suarez replete with the best contemporary
   thought of Spain, and was not neglectful even of England. A great
   theologian is never behind the times.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVI--Of the Need of Sacraments

   THE death of Christ is the universal cause of man's salvation: but a
   universal cause has to be applied to particular effects. Thus it was
   found necessary for certain remedies to be administered to men by way
   of bringing Christ's death into proximate connexion with them. Such
   remedies are the Sacraments of the Church. And these remedies had to be
   administered with certain visible signs: -- first, because God provides
   for man, as for other beings, according to his condition; and it is the
   condition of man's nature to be led through sensible things to things
   spiritual and intelligible: secondly, because instruments must be
   proportioned to the prime cause; and the prime and universal cause of
   man's salvation is the Word Incarnate: it was convenient therefore that
   the remedies, through which that universal cause reaches men, should
   resemble the cause in this, that divine power works invisibly through
   visible signs.

   Hereby is excluded the error of certain heretics, who wish all visible
   sacramental signs swept away; and no wonder, for they take all visible
   things to be of their own nature evil, and the work of an evil author
   (B. III, Chap. [484]XV). [967]

   These visible sacramental signs are the instruments of a God Incarnate
   and Crucified (instrumenta Dei incarnati et passi).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [967] Manicheism, as represented by the Cathari and Albigenses, was a
   strong power in St Thomas's time. After a prevalence of more than a
   thousand years, it is entirely dead in the West. As the plague takes
   the place of other sicknesses, so Materialism has killed Manicheism. In
   old times, Matter baffled Mind; and Mind was tempted to pronounce
   Matter evil. Now the empire of Mind over Matter is consolidated and
   daily spreading; and Mind is apt to fall in love with its creature,
   Matter, to identify itself with it, and finally to worship it. There is
   a strand of Manicheism in those two lost causes, Calvinism and
   Puritanism.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVII--Of the Difference between the Sacraments of the Old and
   of the New Law

   THESE Sacraments, having their efficacy from the Passion of Christ,
   which they represent, must fall in and correspond with the salvation
   wrought by Christ. Before the Incarnation and Passion of Christ this
   salvation was promised, but not accomplished: it was wrought by the
   Incarnation and Passion of the Word. Therefore the Sacraments that
   preceded the Incarnation of Christ must have been such as to signify
   and promise salvation: [968] while the Sacraments that follow the
   Passion of Christ must be such as to render salvation to men, and not
   merely show it forth by signs.

   This avoids the error of the Jews, who believe that the sacred rites of
   the Law must be observed for ever, because they were instituted by God,
   who repents not and changes not. There is no change or repentance about
   an arrangement, which arranges for different things to be done
   according to the fitness of different times; as the father of a family
   gives different commands to his son in his nonage and when he is come
   of age. [969] Still more irrational was the error of those who said
   that the rites of the Law were to be observed along with the Gospel; an
   error indeed which is self-contradictory: for the observance of the
   Gospel rites is a profession that the Incarnation and the other
   mysteries of Christ are now accomplished; while the observance of the
   rites of the Law is a profession that they are still to be fulfilled.

   [968] But what was the use of this promise to men who were never to
   live to see the salvation of Christ? Were they to die in their sins? It
   is commonly replied that circumcision, the chief of the Sacraments of
   the Old Law, took away original sin, not of itself, but by virtue of
   the faith of them that performed it; whereas baptism is effectual of
   itself, even when conferred by a minister who does not believe in it,
   providing he confers it seriously and without maiming the rite.

   [969] A remark to remember, as bearing on the evolution of the moral
   law simultaneously with the evolution of society.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LVIII--Of the Number of the Sacraments of the New Law

   THE remedies that provide for spiritual life are marked off, one from
   another, according to the pattern of corporal life. Now in respect of
   corporal life we find two classes of subjects. There are some who
   propagate and regulate corporal life in others, and some in whom
   corporal life is propagated and regulated. To this corporal and natural
   life three things are ordinarily necessary, and a fourth thing
   incidentally so. First, a living thing must receive life by generation
   or birth. Secondly, it must attain by augmentation to due quantity and
   strength. The third necessity is of nourishment. These three,
   generation, growth, and nutrition, are ordinary necessities, since
   bodily life cannot go on without them. But because bodily life may
   receive a check by sickness, there comes to be incidentally a fourth
   necessity, the healing of a living thing when it is sick. So in
   spiritual life the first thing is spiritual generation by Baptism: the
   second is spiritual growth leading to perfect strength by the Sacrament
   of Confirmation: the third is spiritual nourishment by the Sacrament of
   the Eucharist: there remains a fourth, which is spiritual healing,
   either of the soul alone by the Sacrament of Penance, or of the soul
   first, and thence derivatively, when it is expedient, of the body also,
   by Extreme Unction. These Sacraments then concern those subjects in
   whom spiritual life is propagated and preserved. Again, the propagators
   and regulators of bodily life are assorted according to a twofold
   division, namely, according to natural origin, which belongs to
   parents, and according to civil government, whereby the peace of human
   life is preserved, and that belongs to kings and princes. So then it is
   in spiritual life: there are some propagators and conservators of
   spiritual life by means of spiritual ministration only, and to that
   ministration belongs the Sacrament of Order: there are others who
   propagate and preserve at once corporal and spiritual life together,
   and that is done by the Sacrament of Matrimony, whereby man and woman
   come together to raise up issue and educate their children to the
   worship of God. [970]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [970] Hence the saying of theologians, that the end and purpose of
   matrimony is generare regenerandos, to generate subjects for
   regeneration.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LIX--Of Baptism

   THE generation of a living thing is a change from not living to life.
   [971] Now a man is deprived of spiritual life by original sin; and
   whatever sins are added thereto go still further to withdraw him from
   life. Baptism therefore, or spiritual generation, was needed to serve
   the purpose of taking away original sin and all actual sins. And
   because the sensible sign of a Sacrament must be suited to represent
   the spiritual effect of the Sacrament, [972] and the washing away of
   filth is done by water, therefore Baptism is fittingly conferred in
   water sanctified by the word of God. And because what is brought into
   being by generation loses its previous form and the properties
   consequent upon that form, therefore Baptism, as being a spiritual
   generation, not only takes away sins, but also all the liabilities
   contracted by sins, -- all guilt and all debt of punishment: therefore
   no satisfaction for sins is enjoined on the baptised.

   With the acquisition of a new form there goes also the acquisition of
   the activity consequent upon that form; and therefore the baptised
   become immediately capable of spiritual actions, such as the reception
   of the other Sacraments. Also there is due to them a position suited to
   the spiritual life: that position is everlasting happiness: and
   therefore the baptised, if they die fresh from baptism, are immediately
   caught up into bliss: hence it is said that baptism opens the gate of
   heaven.

   One and the same thing can be generated only once: therefore, as
   Baptism is a spiritual generation, one man is to be baptised only once.
   The infection that came through Adam defiles a man only once: hence
   Baptism, which is directed mainly against that infection, ought not to
   be repeated. Also, once a thing is consecrated, so long as it lasts, it
   ought not to be consecrated again, lest the consecration should appear
   to be of no avail: hence Baptism, as it is a consecration of the person
   baptised, ought not to be repeated.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [971] I fear, this definition can hardly stand. It contradicts the now
   established axiom, Omne vivum ex vivo, and we may add, per vivum. If
   the generative products were themselves dead matter, no life could come
   out of them. Generation is now recognised as a mode of growth of living
   things. In baptism indeed the soul comes to be spiritually alive from
   being spiritually dead: in the order of grace it is brought from not
   living to living: but that is more like resurrection than generation.
   Hence in Romans vi, 3-11; Ephesians ii, 5, 6; baptism is compared to
   resurrection from the dead. But the transition in thought is easy from
   resurrection to new life, and from new life to new birth, or
   regeneration. Hence baptism is called the sacrament of regeneration.
   Cf. John iii, 3-5; Titus iii, 5; 1 Pet. i, 3.

   [972] Hence the axiom, a cardinal principle in the theology of the
   sacraments: The sacraments effect what they signify,' sacramenta
   efficiunt quod significant. It bears upon the Edwardine Ordinal. To
   spoil the significance is to spoil the effect.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LX--Of Confirmation

   THE perfection of spiritual strength consists in a man's daring to
   confess the faith of Christ before any persons whatsoever, undeterred
   by any shame or intimidation. This Sacrament then, whereby spiritual
   strength is conferred on the regenerate man, constitutes him a champion
   of the faith of Christ. And because those who fight under a Prince wear
   his badge, persons confirmed are signed with the sign of Christ,
   whereby He fought and conquered. They receive this sign on their
   foreheads, to signify that they do not blush publicly to confess the
   faith of Christ. The signing is done with a composition of oil and
   balsam, called chrism,' not unreasonably. By the oil is denoted the
   power of the Holy Ghost, whereby Christ is termed anointed' [Acts ii,
   36: x, 38] and from Christ [christos, anointed] Christians' have their
   name, as soldiers serving under Him. In the balsam, for its fragrance,
   the good name is shown, which they who live among worldly people should
   have, to enable them publicly to confess the name of Christ, to which
   end they are brought forth from the remote confines of the Church to
   the field of battle. [973] Appropriately too is this Sacrament
   conferred by bishops only, who are the generals of the Christian army:
   for in secular warfare it belongs to the general to enroll soldiers:
   [974] thus the recipients of this Sacrament are enrolled in a spiritual
   warfare, and the bishop's hand is imposed over them to denote the
   derivation of power from Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [973] As balsam is brought into Europe from the distant East. Cf.
   Æschylus, Agamemnon, 96, pelano muchothen basileio.

   [974] Under the Romans this was done by the proconsul, the military
   governor of the district.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXI--Of the Eucharist

   BECAUSE spiritual effects are produced on the pattern of visible
   effects, it was fitting that our spiritual nourishment should be given
   us under the appearances of those things that men commonly use for
   their bodily nourishment, namely bread and wine. And for the further
   correspondence of spiritual signs with bodily effects, in the spiritual
   regeneration of Baptism the mystery of the Word Incarnate is united
   with us otherwise than as it is united in this Sacrament of the
   Eucharist, which is our spiritual nourishment. In Baptism the Word
   Incarnate is only virtually contained, but in the Sacrament of the
   Eucharist we confess Him to be contained substantially, as nourishment
   must be substantially united with the nourished.

   And because the completion of our salvation was wrought by Christ's
   passion and death, whereby His Blood was separated from His Body,
   therefore the Sacrament of His Body is given us separately under the
   species of bread, and His Blood under the species of wine. [975]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [975] Thus the consecration of the Eucharist becomes a memorial of
   Christ's death, and thereby assumes the character of a representative
   Sacrifice. See Oxford and Cambridge Conferences, First Series, pp.
   292-306.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXIII--Of the Conversion of Bread into the Body of Christ

   IT is impossible for the true Body of Christ to begin to be in this
   Sacrament by local motion, because then it would cease to be in heaven,
   upon every consecration of this Sacrament; as also because this
   Sacrament could not then be consecrated except in one place, since one
   local motion can only have one terminus; also because local motion
   cannot be instantaneous, but takes time. Therefore its presence must be
   due to the conversion of the substance of bread into the substance of
   His Body, and of the substance of wine into the substance of His Blood.
   This shows the falseness of the opinion of those who say that the
   substance of bread co-exists with the substance of the Body of Christ
   in this Sacrament; [976] also of those who say that the substance of
   bread is annihilated. If the substance of bread co-exists with the Body
   of Christ, Christ should rather have said, Here is my Body, than, This
   is my Body. The word here points to the substance which is seen, and
   that is the substance of bread, if the bread remain in the Sacrament
   along with the Body of Christ. On the other hand it does not seem
   possible for the substance of bread to be absolutely annihilated, for
   then much of the corporeal matter of the original creation would have
   been annihilated by this time by the frequent use of this mystery: nor
   is it becoming for anything to be annihilated in the Sacrament of
   salvation. [977]

   We must observe that the conversion of bread into the Body of Christ
   falls under a different category from all natural conversions. In every
   natural conversion the subject remains, and in that subject different
   forms succeed one another: hence these are called formal conversions.'
   But in this conversion subject passes into subject, while the accidents
   remain: hence this conversion is termed 'substantial.' Now we have to
   consider how subject is changed into subject, a change which nature
   cannot effect. Every operation of nature presupposes matter, whereby
   subjects are individuated; hence nature cannot make this subject become
   that, as for instance, this finger that finger. But matter lies wholly
   under the power of God, since by that power it is brought into being:
   hence it may be brought about by divine power that one individual
   substance shall be converted into another pre-existing substance. By
   the power of a natural agent, the operation of which extends only to
   the producing of a change of form and presupposes the existence of the
   subject of change, this whole is converted into that whole with
   variation of species and form. [978] So by the divine power, which does
   not presuppose matter, but produces it, this matter is converted into
   that matter, and consequently this individual into that: for matter is
   the principle of individuation, as form is the principle of species.
   [979] Hence it is plain that in the change of the bread into the Body
   of Christ there is no common subject abiding after the change, since
   the change takes place in the primary subject [i.e., in the matter],
   which is the principle of individuation. Yet something must remain to
   verify the words, This is my body, which are the words significant and
   effective of this conversion. But the substance does not remain: we
   must say therefore that what remains is something beside the substance,
   that is, the accident of bread. The accidents of bread then remain even
   after the conversion.

   This then is one reason for the accident of bread remaining, that
   something may be found permanent under the conversion. Another reason
   is this. If the substance of bread was converted into the Body of
   Christ, and the accidents of bread also passed away, there would not
   ensue upon such conversion the being of the Body of Christ in substance
   where the bread was before: for nothing would be left to refer the Body
   of Christ to that place. But since the dimensions of bread (quantitas
   dimensiva panis), whereby the bread held this particular place, remain
   after conversion, while the substance of bread is changed into the Body
   of Christ, the Body of Christ comes to be under the dimensions of
   bread, and in a manner to occupy the place of the bread by means of the
   said dimensions.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [976] For this early mention of consubstantiation St Thomas refers to
   the Master of the Sentences (Peter Lombard), 4 Sent., dist. 11, not as
   approving but as recording the opinion.

   [977] See Chap. LXVI, with note. St Thomas is reluctant to call that
   substance annihilated, the accidents of which remain.

   [978] e.g., this whole book thrown into the fire, is converted into
   gas, smoke and ashes.

   [979] Many will find these scholastic explanations harder to accept
   than transubstantiation itself. The dogma is guaranteed by the Catholic
   Church. The explanations of the dogma lie beyond the domain alike of
   faith, of sensible experience, and of physical science. They rest on a
   structure of abstruse metaphysics, into which there enter elements much
   open to debate, as the principle of individuation.' At the same time,
   any one who will have it that transubstantiation is philosophically
   absurd, may well be asked whether he has mastered these scholastic
   subtleties, and has his reply ready to dispel them. All that a Catholic
   need care to do is to point out, as Newman does ([485]note, p. 391),
   how by reason of the very obscurity of the subject arguments against
   the possibility of transubstantiation cannot be cogent and apodictic.
   We are not bound to have forthcoming positive evidence of that
   possibility. We take the fact from the teaching of the Church, and
   leave the how to God. When physical science has said its last word on
   the constitution of matter; when psychology and metaphysics have
   finally disposed of substance and accident, things in themselves' and
   phenomena; we shall then be not quite so ill equipped as we are at
   present for speculating on the philosophy of transubstantiation.
   Meanwhile, one important point seems to have escaped notice. Faith does
   not raise the question of any substance being converted into any other
   substance, but only of the substances of bread and wine being converted
   into the substance of the Body and Blood of Christ. Now the Body and
   Blood of Christ are the Body and Blood of God, and consequently hold a
   unique position among substances. God's Body may well
   'supercomprehend,' so to speak, all lower material substances; and be
   able, after unseating any of them from the throne where it sits queen,
   surrounded by attendant accidents, itself occupy that same throne in
   the midst of those same accidents. We cannot safely conclude thereupon
   that any other material substance is capable of doing the like. It does
   not follow, to borrow St Thomas's own illustration, that because bread
   and wine can be changed into the Body and Blood of Christ, therefore,
   of my two fingers, one can be changed into the other. Of the intrinsic
   possibility of this latter conversion, -- and not even God can effect
   intrinsic impossibilities, -- I confess I entertain the gravest doubts.
   And Catholic faith allows me to doubt it. Vasquez (tom. 3, disp. 184)
   discusses an quaelibet res in quamlibet aliam converti possit.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXIV--An Answer to Difficulties raised in respect of Place

   IN this Sacrament something is present by force of conversion, and
   something by natural concomitance. By force of conversion there is
   present that which is the immediate term into which conversion is made.
   Such under the species of bread is the Body of Christ, into which the
   substance of bread is converted by the words, This is my body. Such
   again under the species of wine is the Blood of Christ, when it is
   said, This is the chalice of my blood. By natural concomitance all
   other things are there, which, though conversion is not made into them,
   nevertheless are really united with the term into which conversion is
   made. Clearly, the term into which conversion of the bread is made is
   not the Divinity of Christ, nor His Soul: nevertheless the Soul and the
   Divinity of Christ are under the species of bread, because of the real
   union of them both with the Body of Christ. If during the three days
   that Christ lay dead this Sacrament had been celebrated, the Soul of
   Christ would not have been under the species of bread, because it was
   not really united with His Body: nor would His Blood have been under
   the species of bread, nor His Body under the species of wine, because
   of the separation of the two in death. But now, because the Body of
   Christ in its nature is not without His Blood, the Body and Blood are
   contained under both species; the Body under the species of bread by
   force of conversion, and the Blood by natural concomitance; and
   conversely under the species of wine.

   Hereby we have an answer to the difficulty of the incommensurateness of
   the Body of Christ with the space taken up by the bread. The substance
   of the bread is converted directly into the substance of the Body of
   Christ: but the dimensions of the Body of Christ are in the Sacrament
   by natural concomitance, not by force of conversion, since the
   dimensions of the bread remain. [980] Thus then the Body of Christ is
   not referred to this particular place by means of its own dimensions,
   as though commensurate room had to be found for them, but by means of
   the dimensions of the bread, which remain, and for which commensurate
   room is found.

   And so of the plurality of places. By its own proper dimensions the
   Body of Christ is in one place only; but by means of the dimensions of
   the bread that passes into it, the Body of Christ is in as many places
   as there are places in which the mystery of this conversion is
   celebrated, -- not divided into parts, but whole in each: for every
   consecrated bread is converted into the whole Body of Christ.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [980] How this distinction meets the difficulty, is explained in Chap.
   LXVII, etsi difficile videatur, as St Thomas there avows.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXV--The Difficulty of the Accidents remaining

   IT cannot be denied that the accidents of bread and wine do remain, as
   the infallible testimony of the senses assures us. Nor is the Body and
   Blood of Christ affected by them, since that could not be without
   change in Him, and He is not susceptible of such accidents. It follows
   that they remain without subject. Nor is their so remaining an
   impossibility to the divine power. The same rule applies to the
   production of things and to their conservation in being. The power of
   God can produce the effects of any secondary causes whatsoever without
   the causes themselves, because that power is infinite, and supplies to
   all secondary causes the power in which they act: hence it can preserve
   in being the effects of secondary causes without the causes. Thus in
   this Sacrament it preserves the accident in being, after removing the
   substance that preserves it. [981]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [981] A Domino factum est istud; and how He does it, there are guesses
   many, but no man knoweth. We must not confound guesses as to the pos
   (the manner how) with articles of faith as to the hoti (the fact). We
   repeat the accredited phraseology of the Church: we believe in that
   phraseology as expressing truth in the best terms of human
   intelligence, with an expression accurate and correct, yet inadequate
   in respect of the further fulness that lies beyond our ken. So we wait
   in adoration behind closed veils, till the veil be rent and Christ
   revealed. The scoffer, on the contrary, has made up his mind on what he
   does not comprehend: in the darkness he has defined for himself one
   dogma, the absolute incredibility of Christian teaching.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVI--What happens when the Sacramental Species pass away

   FOR the removal of this doubt there has been invented a famous theory
   (famosa positio), which is held by many. They say that when this
   Sacrament comes to be changed in the ordinary process of digestion or
   to be burnt, or otherwise destroyed, the accidents are not converted
   into substance, but there returns by miracle the substance of bread
   that had been before, and out of that are generated the products into
   which this Sacrament is found to turn. But this theory cannot stand at
   all. It seems better to say that in the consecration there is
   miraculously conferred upon the accidents the power of subsistence,
   which is proper to substance: hence they can do all things, and have
   all things done to them, that the substance itself could do, or have
   done to it, if it were there: hence without any new miracle they can
   nourish, or be reduced to ashes, in the same mode and order as if the
   substance of bread and wine were there. [982]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [982] The Real Presence is attached, not to the chemical elements of
   bread and wine, still less to any ultimate atoms, molecules, electrons,
   or the like, but to the visible appearances of bread and wine. When
   these appearances disappear, the Real Presence is gone and the question
   is, what has happened to what is left. St Thomas here, and Sum. Theol.
   3, q. 77, art. 5, seems to hold that what is left continues in the
   miraculous state of accidents functioning as substance to the end of
   time. But may we not plead against the saint his own words, that at
   that rate "by the frequent use of this mystery much of the corporeal
   nature originally created would have been reduced," not exactly to
   "nothing," but to a state bordering on nothingness? (Chap. [486]LXIII.)
   This solution is not commonly taken. See Pesch, S.J., Praelectiones
   Dogmaticae, vol. VI, pp. 311, 312. Also that wary theologian, Cardinal
   Franzelin, writes: "When the accidents are so changed that naturally
   they would no longer point to the substance of bread and wine, but to
   some other, it becomes necessary for the Body and Blood of Christ no
   longer to remain under them. Were they to remain, it would be no longer
   the Sacrament instituted by Christ under the appearances of bread and
   wine. When this substance of the Body and Blood of Christ ceases to be
   under the changed accidents, those changed accidents connaturally
   require some substance to answer to them. As then upon the sufficient
   organisation of the foetus the creation and infusion of the soul
   follows according to a natural law laid down by God, so when the
   accidents are specifically changed and the Real Presence ceases, there
   follows the creation of a corresponding substance under those new
   accidents, and that, we may say, connaturally, according to a constant
   law laid down by God. This is equivalent to the restitution of the
   matter that was before consecration (De Eucharistia, pp. 240 sq. 293).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVII--Answer to the Difficulty raised in respect of the
   Breaking of the Host

   IT has been said above (Chap. [487]LXIV) that the substance of the Body
   of Christ is in this Sacrament by virtue of the Sacrament [Sacramental
   words]: but the dimensions of the Body of Christ are there by the
   natural concomitance which they have with the substance. This is quite
   the opposite way to that in which a body naturally is in place. [983] A
   body is in place by means of its dimensions, by which it is made
   commensurate with its place. [984]

   But substantial being and quantitative being do not stand in the same
   way related to that in which they are. Quantitative being is in a
   whole, but is not whole in each part: it is part in part, and whole in
   the whole. [985] But substantial being is whole in the whole, and whole
   in every part of the same, as the whole nature and species of water is
   in every drop of water, and the whole soul in every part of the body.
   [986] Since then the Body of Christ is in the Sacrament by reason of
   its substance, into which the substance of bread is changed, while the
   dimensions of bread remain, -- it follows that as the whole species of
   bread was under every part of its (visible) dimensions, so the whole
   Body of Christ is under every part of the same. The breaking then (of
   the Host) does not reach to the Body of Christ, as though the Body of
   Christ were subjected to that breaking: its subject is the dimensions
   of bread, which remain. [987]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [983] We must always remember that place' (locus) in St Thomas, is the
   Aristotelian topos, to proton periechon somaton hekaston (Physics, iv,
   2), the outline marked in space by the exterior surface lines of a
   body, -- the shell or mould, which the body fills up.

   [984] As the outer surfaces of the soft part of an egg formally render
   the contents commensurate with the shell.

   [985] In a phial filled with an ounce of wine, there is not an ounce of
   wine at the bottom, and an ounce at the top; but some uncial fraction
   of the wine in each section of the phial, and the whole ounce in the
   whole phial.

   [986] When St Thomas speaks of quantitas dimensiva, he means visible
   bulk.' Of invisible bulk he took no note at all. He says (Chap. LXIII,
   not translated): "If the substance of bread were resolved into its
   prime corporeal elements, this change would necessarily be perceptible
   to sense, since corporeal elements are sensible." By corporeal
   elements' he meant fire, air, earth, and water. The schoolmen herein
   followed Aristotle; Aristotle followed Plato; and Plato had a singular
   dislike for Democritus, the author of the atomic theory. Compare
   however the elemental trigona of Timaeus, 53 sq., which triangular
   atoms Plato expressly declares to be invisible. Every chemist and
   electrician now recognises that visible bulk is not of the essence of
   material substance; and the question stands open, whether the ultimate
   elements of such substance have any bulk, even invisible, -- whether
   they are extended at all. But every body is extended, still more every
   living body, in its natural state. We say then that the Body of Christ
   is not in the Sacrament of the Altar in its natural state.

   [987] Read 1 Cor. xiii, 8-12, and thereupon the following from some
   unpublished Dialogues of the Dead. Spirit of Aristotle: "Thomas, your
   explanations are harder to accept than the doctrine which you undertook
   to explain." Spirit of Aquinas: "My dear sir, take all this explanation
   as child's play on my part: for, as Paul says, when I was a child, I
   spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but
   now I am become a man, and see face to face, I have put away the things
   of a child." Surely we may call the things of a child all mere human
   speculations on a mystery so incomprehensible as the Holy Eucharist. I
   have nothing to say against the wisdom of the school, but it does not
   make transubstantiation one whit clearer to me. I remain in Cardinal
   Newman's frame of mind, when he wrote: "I cannot tell how it is, but I
   say: Why should it not be? What's to hinder it? What do I know of
   substance or matter? Just as much as the greatest philosophers, and
   that is nothing at all . . . . The Catholic doctrine leaves phenomena
   alone. It does not say that the phenomena go: on the contrary, it says
   that they remain: nor does it say that the same phenomena are in
   several places at once. It deals with what no one on earth knows
   anything about, the material substances themselves" (Apologia, p. 239,
   ed. 1895). The Cardinal in this passage writes in the easy epistolary
   style which he often affects, not in the solemn and strict phraseology
   of a legal document, civil or ecclesiastical. Newman knew, as well as
   any man, that substance is the reality that underlies appearances, the
   objective unity of those appearances, the noumenon, or thing in itself.
   We know that, and we say that; and, thanks to that modicum of
   knowledge, transubstantiation is not to us a vox nihili: but how much
   more do we know? and how far does that slight concept of substance
   carry towards a comprehensive understanding of transubstantiation?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXVIII--The Explanation of a Text

   NOR is there anything contrary to the tradition of the Church in the
   word of the Lord saying to the disciples, who seemed scandalised: The
   words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life (John vi, 63). He
   did not thereby give them to understand that His true flesh was not
   delivered to be eaten by the faithful in this Sacrament, but that it
   was not delivered to be eaten in the way of ordinary flesh, taken and
   torn with the teeth in its own proper appearance, as food usually is;
   that it is received in a spiritual way, not in the usual way of fleshly
   food.

   CHAPTER LXIX--Of the kind of Bread and Wine that ought to be used for
   the Consecration of this Sacrament

   THOSE conditions must be observed which are essential for bread and
   wine to be. That alone is called wine, which is liquor pressed out of
   grapes: [988] nor is that properly called bread, which is not made of
   grains of wheat. Substitutes for wheaten bread have come into use, and
   shave got the name of bread; and similarly other liquors have come into
   use as wine: but of no such bread other than bread properly so called,
   or wine other than what is properly called wine, could this Sacrament
   possibly be consecrated: nor again if the bread and wine were so
   adulterated with foreign matter as that the species should disappear. A
   valid Sacrament may be consecrated irrespectively of varieties of bread
   and wine, when the varieties are accidental, not essential. The
   alternative of leavened or unleavened bread is an instance of such
   accidental variety; and therefore different churches have different
   uses in this respect; and either use may be accommodated to the
   signification of the Sacrament. Thus as Gregory says in the Register of
   his Letters [989] : "The Roman Church offers unleavened bread, because
   the Lord took flesh without intercourse of the sexes: but other
   Churches offer leavened bread, because the Word of the Father, clothed
   in flesh, is at once true God and true man." Still the use of
   unleavened bread is the more congruous, as better representing the
   purity of Christ's mystical Body, the Church, which is figured in a
   secondary way (configuratur) in this Sacrament, as the text has it:
   Christ our passover is sacrificed: therefore let us feast in the
   unleavened bread of sincerity and truth (1 Cor. v, 7, 8).

   This shuts out the error of some heretics who say that this Sacrament
   cannot be celebrated in unleavened bread: a position plainly upset by
   the authority of the gospel, where we read (Matt. xxvi, 17: Mark xiv,
   12: cf. Luke xxii, 7) that the Lord ate the passover with His
   disciples, and instituted this Sacrament, on the first day of the
   azymes, at which time it was unlawful for leavened bread to be found in
   the houses of the Jews (Exod. xii, 15); and the Lord, so long as He was
   in the world, observed the law. It is foolish then to blame in the use
   of the Latin Church an observance which the Lord Himself adhered to in
   the very institution of this Sacrament. [990]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [988] Nothing is said of fermentation; and apparently the unfermented
   juice of the grape would be valid matter of consecration.

   [989] We have Registers of the letters of St Gregory I, St Gregory VII,
   and St Gregory IX, but this passage is none of them.

   [990] There follows a discussion of John xiii, 1: xviii, 28, as
   compared with the Synoptics. See Scripture Manuals for Catholic
   Schools, St Matthew, pp. 217-9: St John, pp. 94-5. Either of the two
   views taken by modern scholars holds with the employment of unleavened
   bread at the institution of the Holy Eucharist. To be well within the
   law, the Jews of the time had all the leaven removed from their houses
   by sundown on the 13th Nisan, which evening is the earlier of the two
   assignable dates for the Last Supper.

   CHAPTER LXX--That it is possible for a man to sin after receiving
   Sacramental Grace [991]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [991] St Thomas, characteristically, proves his thesis by four a priori
   arguments, and one of testimonies from Scripture. We may rest satisfied
   with the one too common argument of experience. He continues: "Hereby
   is excluded the error of certain heretics (St Jerome, Contra Jovin.
   Chap. XXXI, says it was an error of Jovinian), that man, after
   receiving the grace of the Holy Ghost, cannot sin; and that if he sins,
   he never had the grace of the Holy Ghost." The only possibility of
   heresy in such a plain matter is by taking sanctifying grace to consist
   in nothing else than election and predestination to glory (cf. B. III,
   Chap. [488]CLXIV). In the tautological sense that all whom God foresees
   in the ranks of the Blessed will be finally Blessed, it is true to say
   that once elect, always elect.' But it would be heresy to say that sin
   is never imputed to the elect. Oliver Cromwell, dying, asked a
   minister, whether it was possible to fall from grace. The Calvinist
   minister at his bedside said that it was not possible. "Then," said the
   dying man, "I am safe, for I was in grace once." How did he know that?
   Was it provable from a baptismal register? Not to a Calvinist. St
   Thomas concludes the chapter thus: "The text 1 John iii, 6, 9, means
   that any one who is adopted as a son, or born again as a son of God,
   receives gifts of the Holy Ghost, which of themselves are powerful
   enough to keep the man from sin, nor can he sin so long as he lives
   according to them: he may however act contrary to them, and by sinning
   depart from them. He that is born of God, cannot sin, in the same way
   that warm water cannot chill one,' or the just man never acts
   unjustly,' to wit, in so far as he is just." In other words, the text
   holds good in sensu composito, not in sensu diviso.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXI--That a man who sins after the Grace of the Sacraments may
   be converted to Grace [992]

   HEREBY is excluded the error of the Novatians, who denied pardon to
   sinners after baptism. [993] They took occasion of their error from the
   text: It is impossible for those who have been once enlightened
   [photisthentas, baptised], and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have
   been made partakers of the Holy Ghost . . . . and have fallen, to be
   again renewed [anakainizein, renovari, Vulg.] unto penance (Heb. vi, 4,
   6). But the sense is plain from the immediate context: crucifying to
   themselves again the Son of God, and making him a mockery. There is
   denied to them then that renewal unto penance, whereby a man is
   crucified along with Christ, which is by baptism: for as many of us as
   have been baptised in Christ Jesus, have been baptised in his death
   (Rom. vi, 3, 6: Gal. ii, 19, 20: v, 24). As then Christ is not to be
   crucified again, so he who sins after baptism is not to be baptised
   again. Hence the Apostle does not say that it is impossible for such
   persons to be reclaimed, or converted, to penance, but that it is
   impossible for them to be renewed [anakainizein], renovation being the
   effect usually ascribed to baptism, which is called the laver of
   regeneration and renewal [anakainoseos] (Titus iii, 5).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [992] This is proved here by seven arguments, having been already
   argued in B. III, Chap. CLVII.

   [993] Socrates, Hist. Eccl. iv, 28, quotes the Novatians as saying: "It
   is forbidden to admit to Communion him who has denied Christ. He should
   be exhorted to repent, but must look for his pardon from God, who alone
   is competent to give it."
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXII--Of the need of the Sacrament of Penance, and of the
   Parts thereof

   THE Sacrament of Penance is a spiritual cure. As sick men are healed,
   not by being born again, but by some reaction (alteratio) set up in
   their system; so, of sins committed after baptism, men are healed by
   the spiritual reaction of Penance, not by repetition of the spiritual
   regeneration of Baptism. Now a bodily cure is sometimes worked entirely
   from within by the mere effort of nature; sometimes from within and
   from without at the same time, when nature is aided by the benefit of
   medicine. But the cure is never wrought entirely from without: there
   still remain in the patient certain elements of life, which go to cause
   health in him. [994] A spiritual cure cannot possibly be altogether
   from within, for man cannot be set free from guilt but by the aid of
   grace (B. III, Chap. [489]CLVII). Nor can such a cure be altogether
   from without, for the restoration of mental health involves the setting
   up of orderly motions in the will. Therefore the spiritual restoration,
   effected in the Sacrament of Penance, must be wrought both from within
   and from without. And that happens in this way.

   The first loss that man sustains by sin is a wrong bent given to his
   mind, whereby it is turned away from the unchangeable good, which is
   God, and turned to sin. [995] The second is the incurred liability to
   punishment (B. III, Chapp.[490]CXLI-[491]CXLVI). The third is a
   weakening of natural goodness, rendering the soul more prone to sin and
   more reluctant to do good. The first requisite then of the Sacrament of
   Penance is a right ordering, or orientation of mind, turning it to God
   and away from sin, making it grieve for sin committed, and purposing
   not to commit it in future. All these things are of the essence of
   Contrition. This re-ordering of the mind cannot take place without
   charity, and charity cannot be had without grace (B. III, Chap.
   [492]CLI). Thus then Contrition takes away the offence of God, and
   delivers from the liability of eternal punishment, as that liability
   cannot stand with grace and charity: for eternal punishment is in
   separation from God, with whom man is united by grace and charity.
   [996]

   This re-ordering of the mind, which consists in Contrition, comes from
   within, from free will aided by divine grace. But because the merit of
   Christ, suffering for mankind, is the operative principle in the
   expiation of all sins (Chap. [493]LV), a man who would be delivered
   from sin must not only adhere in mind to God, but also to the mediator
   between God and men, the man Christ Jesus (1 Tim. ii, 5), in whom is
   given remission of all sins. For spiritual health consists in the
   turning of the mind and heart to God; which health we cannot gain
   otherwise than through the physician of our souls Jesus Christ, who
   saves his people from their sins (Matt. i, 21); whose merit is
   sufficient for the entire taking away of all sins, since He it is that
   taketh away the sins of the world (John i, 29). Not all penitents
   however perfectly gain the effect of remission; but each one gains it
   in so much as he is united with Christ suffering for sins. Our union
   with Christ in baptism comes not of any activity of our own, as from
   within, because nothing begets itself into being; it is all of Christ,
   who hath regenerated us unto living hope (1 Peter i, 3): consequently
   the remission of sins in baptism is by the power of Christ, uniting us
   to Himself perfectly and entirely; the result being that not only is
   the impurity of sin taken away, but also all liability to sin is
   entirely cancelled, -- always excepting the accidental case of those
   who gain not the effect of the Sacrament, because they are not sincere
   in approaching it. [997] But in this spiritual cure (the Sacrament of
   Penance), it is our own act, informed with divine grace, that unites us
   with Christ. Hence the effect of remission is not always gained totally
   by this union, nor do all gain it equally. The turning of mind and
   heart to God and to detestation of sin may be so vehement as to gain
   for the penitent a perfect remission of sin, including at once
   purification from guilt and a discharge of the entire debt of
   punishment. But this does not always occur. Sometimes, though the guilt
   is taken away and the debt of eternal punishment cancelled, there still
   remains some obligation of temporal punishment, to save the justice of
   God, which redresses fault by punishment.

   But since the infliction of punishment for fault requires a trial, the
   penitent who has committed himself to Christ for his cure must await
   the judgement of Christ in the assessment of his punishment. This
   judgement Christ exercises through His ministers, as in the other
   Sacraments. No one can give judgement upon faults that he is ignorant
   of. Therefore a second part of this Sacrament is the practice of
   Confession, the object of which is to make the penitent's fault known
   to Christ's minister. The minister then, to whom Confession is made,
   must have judicial power as viceregent of Christ, who is appointed
   judge of the living and of the dead (Acts x, 42). There are two
   requisites of judicial power, authority to investigate the offence, and
   power to acquit (potestas absolvendi) or condemn. This science of
   discerning and this power of binding or loosing are the two keys of the
   Church, which the Lord committed to Peter (Matt. xvi, 19). He is not to
   be understood to have committed them to Peter for Peter to hold them
   alone, but that through him they might be transmitted to others; or
   else the salvation of the faithful would not be sufficiently provided
   for. These keys have their efficacy from the Passion of Christ, whereby
   Christ has opened to us the gate of the heavenly kingdom. As then
   without Baptism, in which the Passion of Christ works, there can be no
   salvation for men, -- whether the Baptism be actually received, or
   purposed in desire, when necessity, not contempt, sets the Sacrament
   aside; so for sinners after Baptism there can be no salvation unless
   they submit themselves to the keys of the Church either by actual
   Confession and undergoing of the judgement of the ministers of the
   Church, or at least by purposing so to do with a purpose to be
   fulfilled in seasonable time: because there is no other name under
   heaven given to men, whereby we are to be saved (Acts iv, 12). [998]

   Hereby is excluded the error of certain persons, who said that a man
   could obtain pardon of his sins without confession and purpose of
   confession; or that the prelates of the Church could dispense a sinner
   from the obligation of confession. The prelates of the Church have no
   power to frustrate the keys of the Church, in which their whole power
   is contained; nor to enable a man to obtain forgiveness of his sins
   without the Sacrament which has its efficacy from the Passion of
   Christ: only Christ, the institutor and author of the Sacraments, can
   do that. The prelates of the Church can no more dispense a man from
   confession and absolution in order to remission of sin than they can
   dispense him from baptism in order to salvation.

   But this is a point to observe. Baptism may be efficacious to the
   remission of sin before it is actually received, while one purposes to
   receive it: though afterwards it takes fuller effect in the gaining of
   grace and the remission of guilt, when it actually is received. And
   sometimes [999] the very instant of baptism is the instant of the
   bestowal of grace and the remission of guilt where it was not remitted
   before. So the keys of the Church work their effect in some cases
   before the penitent actually places himself under them, provided he
   have the purpose of placing himself under them. But he gains a fuller
   grace and a fuller remission, when he actually submits himself to the
   keys by confessing and receiving absolution. And the case is quite
   possible (nihil prohibet) of a person at confession receiving grace and
   the forgiveness of the guilt of sin by the power of the keys in the
   very instant of absolution [i.e., not before then]. [1000] Since then
   in the very act of confession and absolution a fuller effect of grace
   and forgiveness is conferred on him who by his good purpose had
   obtained grace and remission already, we clearly see that by the power
   of the keys the minister of the Church in absolving remits something of
   the temporal punishment which the penitent still continued to owe after
   his act of contrition. He binds the penitent by his injunction to pay
   the rest. [1001] The fulfilment of this injunction is called
   Satisfaction, which is the third part of Penance, whereby a man is
   totally discharged from the debt of punishment, provided he pays the
   full penalty due. Further than this, his weakness in spiritual good is
   cured by his abstaining from evil things and accustoming himself to
   good deeds, subduing the flesh by fasting, and improving his relations
   with his neighbour by the bestowal of alms upon those neighbours from
   whom he had been culpably estranged.

   Thus it is clear that the minister of the Church in the use of the keys
   exercises judicial functions. But to none is judgement committed except
   over persons subject to his court. Hence it is not any and every priest
   that can absolve any and every subject from sin: [1002] priest can
   absolve that subject only over whom he is given authority.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [994] The lack of these elements of life' makes the class of
   incurables.' The sinner who, having open access to the Sacrament of
   Penance, disdains it, or will not co-operate towards receiving it, is a
   spiritual incurable.

   [995] Cf. Aquinas Ethicus I, pp. 209, 213, 256, 346, 347: II, 367. As
   we speak of the orientation' of churches, we might call this
   deordinatio mentis a deorientation,' the soul no longer looking towards
   its First Beginning. Under this head, as will be seen, St Thomas
   includes the privation of charity, which is the principal loss incurred
   by mortal sin. Throughout this chapter the sin spoken of is mortal sin.

   [996] Reading this passage, any instructed Catholic will see that St
   Thomas is speaking of that contrition which is called perfect,' as
   being founded on the love of God for His own sake above all things. An
   act of such contrition delivers the soul from mortal sin at once,
   before absolution is pronounced, not however without a purpose (in the
   instructed Catholic) of confession and absolution to follow in due
   time. The Catholic also knows that an inferior supernatural sorrow,
   called attrition'-- not mentioned in the Contra Gentiles -- is enough,
   when conjoined with absolution; and to such a case St Thomas tacitly
   alludes, when he says below: "The case is quite possible of a person at
   confession receiving grace and forgiveness of the guilt of sin by the
   power of the keys in the very instant of absolution," i.e., not before
   then.

   [997] St Thomas is thinking of the case of an adult coming to baptism
   without any intention of leading a good life. The conditions of the
   baptism of John (Luke iii, 10-14) hold likewise of Christ's baptism: so
   St Peter, metanoesate kai bapristheto ekastos (Acts ii, 38). But these
   are preliminaries, not parts of baptism; whereas the contrition and
   confession of the penitent are as true sacramental parts of the
   Sacrament of Penance as the absolution of the priest.

   [998] The sinner who will not confess is guilty of a sort of contempt
   of court, despising the summons of his Judge and the name of his
   Saviour.

   [999] In the case of infant baptism, always.

   [1000] The case is not only quite possible, but probably occurs daily.

   [1001] It is not the present practice for the confessor regularly to
   impose a penance such as he reckons adequate to all the debt of
   temporal punishment still owing for the sins confessed. Penances
   comparatively light and easy are imposed for grievous sins: for the
   rest, the penitent is left to his own penitential efforts, to the
   gaining of indulgences, and to the justice of God. When confessarius
   primus has imposed a penance smacking of the old canonical rigour,
   confessarius secundus finds next time that the penance has not been
   performed, nor is going to be.

   [1002] Ut quidam mentiuntur, is St Thomas's insertion here. To absolve,
   you require not only Order, but also Jurisdiction.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIII--Of the Sacrament of Extreme Unction

   BY dispensation of divine justice, the sickness of the soul, which is
   sin, sometimes passes to the body. [1003] Such bodily sickness is
   sometimes conducive to the health of the soul, where it is borne humbly
   and patiently and as a penance whereby one may make satisfaction for
   sin. Sometimes again sickness injures spiritual well-being by hindering
   the exercise of virtues. It was fitting therefore to have a spiritual
   remedy, applicable to sin precisely in this connexion of bodily
   sickness being a consequence of sin. By this spiritual remedy bodily
   sickness is sometimes cured, when it is expedient for salvation. This
   is the purpose of the Sacrament of Extreme Unction, of which St James
   speaks (James v, 14, 15). Nor is the Sacrament useless, even though
   bodily health does not ensue upon its reception: for it is directed
   against other consequences of sin, as proneness to evil and difficulty
   in doing good, infirmities of soul which have a closer connexion with
   sin than bodily infirmity. Negligence, the various occupations of life,
   and the shortness of time, prevent a man from perfectly remedying the
   above defects by penance. Thus this Sacrament is a wholesome provision
   for completing the sinner's cure, delivering him from his debt of
   temporal punishment, and leaving nothing in him at the departure of his
   soul from his body to hinder his reception into glory.

   This Sacrament is not to be given to all sick persons, but only to such
   as seem to be near to death from sickness. If they recover, this
   Sacrament may be administered to them again, if they are again reduced
   to the like state. For the unction of this Sacrament is not an unction
   of consecration, like the unction of Confirmation, the ablution of
   Baptism, and certain other unctions, which are never repeated, because
   the consecration always remains so long as the thing consecrated lasts:
   but the anointing in this Sacramentis for healing, and a healing
   medicine ought to be given again and again as often as the sickness
   recurs.

   Though some are in a state near to death without sickness, as are
   persons condemned to death, and they would need the spiritual effects
   of this Sacrament, still this Sacrament is not to be given to them, but
   only to the sick, since it is given under the form of bodily medicine,
   and bodily medicine is not proper except for one bodily sick. For in
   the administration of Sacraments their signification must be observed.
   [1004]

   Oil is the special matter of this Sacrament, because it is of efficacy
   for bodily healing by mitigation of pains, as water, which washes
   bodies, is the matter of the Sacrament in which spiritual cleansing is
   performed. And as bodily healing must go to the root of the malady, so
   this unction is applied to those parts of the body from which the
   malady of sin proceeds, as are the organs of sense.

   And because through this Sacrament sins are forgiven, and sin is not
   forgiven except through grace, clearly grace is conferred in this
   Sacrament. Nor is a bishop necessary to give this Sacrament, since the
   Sacrament does not bestow any excellence of state, as do those
   Sacraments in which a bishop is the minister. [1005] Since however a
   great abundance of grace, proper to effect a perfect cure, is required
   in this Sacrament, it is right that many priests should take part in
   the rite, [1006] and that the prayer of the whole Church should help
   out the effect of this Sacrament: hence James says: Let him bring in
   the priests of the Church, and the prayer of faith shall save the sick
   man. If however only one priest be present, he is understood to confer
   the Sacrament in the power of the whole Church, whose minister he is,
   and whose person he bears. As in other Sacraments, the effect of this
   Sacrament may be hindered by the insincerity (fictionem) of the
   recipient.

   that Baptism raises to the initial, but Confirmation to the perfect

     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIV--Of the Sacrament of Order

   SINCE Christ intended to withdraw His bodily presence from the Church,
   He needed to institute other men as ministers to Himself, who should
   dispense the Sacraments to the faithful. Hence He committed to His
   disciples the consecration of His Body and Blood, saying: Do this in
   memory of me (Luke xxii, 19). He gave them the power of forgiving sins,
   according to the text: Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven
   them (John xx, 23). [1007] He enjoined on them the function of
   baptising: Go, teach all nations, baptising them (Matt. xxviii, 19).
   Now a minister stands to his master as an instrument to a prime agent.
   An instrument must be proportionate to the agent: therefore the
   ministers of Christ must be conformable to Him. But Christ, our Lord
   and Master, by His own power and might worked out our salvation,
   inasmuch as He was both God and man. As man, He suffered for our
   redemption: as He was God, His suffering brought salvation to us. The
   ministers of Christ then must be men, and at the same time have some
   share in the Divinity (aliquid divinitatis participare) in point of
   spiritual power: for an instrument too has some share in the power of
   the prime agent. [1008]

   Nor can it be said that this power was given to the disciples of Christ
   not to be transmitted to others. It was given unto edification (2 Cor.
   xiii, 10), to the building up of the Church, and must be perpetuated so
   long as the Church needs building up, that is, to the end of the world
   (Matt. xxviii, 20). And since spiritual effects are transmitted to us
   from Christ under sensible signs, this power had to be delivered to men
   under some such signs, -- certain forms of words, definite acts, as
   imposition of hands, anointing, the delivery of a book or chalice, and
   the like. [1009] Whenever anything spiritual is delivered under a
   corporeal sign, that is called a Sacrament. [1010] Thus in the
   conferring of spiritual power a Sacrament is wrought, which is called
   the Sacrament of Order. Now it is a point of divine liberality that the
   bestowal of power should be accompanied with the means of duly
   exercising that power. But the spiritual power of administering the
   Sacraments requires divine grace for its convenient exercise: therefore
   in this Sacrament, as in other Sacraments, grace is bestowed.

   Among Sacraments the noblest, and that which sets the crown on the
   rest, is the Sacrament of the Eucharist. Therefore the power of Order
   must be considered chiefly in relation to this Sacrament: for
   everything is ruled by the end for which it is made. Now the power that
   gives perfection, also prepares the matter to receive it. [1011] Since
   then the power of Order extends to the consecration of the Body of
   Christ and the administration of the same to the faithful, it must
   further extend to the rendering of the faithful fit and worthy for the
   reception of that Sacrament. But the believer is rendered fit and
   worthy by being free from sin: otherwise he cannot be united with
   Christ spiritually, with whom he is sacramentally united in the
   reception of this Sacrament. [1012] The power of Order therefore must
   extend to the remission of sins by the administration of those
   Sacraments which are directed to that purpose, Baptism and Penance.
   [1013]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1007] Interpreted of the Sacrament of Penance by the Council of Trent,
   Sess. 14, can. 3.

   [1008] When the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland knights a man, he may be
   said to act as King,' i.e., for the King. Similarly St Thomas says that
   what a priest knows by the confessional, he knows as God' (scit ut
   Deus, Sum. Theol. Supplem. q. 11, art. 5). The Christian Priesthood is
   a development of the Incarnation. To rail at the former is to forget
   the latter. Clear your mind of Nestorianism ere you attack
   Sacerdotalism.

   [1009] One could have wished St Thomas here to have told us what he
   knew of any variation of Ordinal in local churches of his time; what
   ceremonies were comparatively recent, and what more ancient and
   primitive. Had any one in Paris, Rome, or Naples, an old Sacramentary
   or Pontifical that St Thomas could have looked into, and compared its
   formularies with those by which he himself was ordained? But the spirit
   of documentary research slumbered in the thirteenth century, except for
   the quest (or invention) of charters and bulls of privilege.

   [1010] Rather a wide definition, as it might be taken to include the
   institution of a clergyman to a benefice. It is usually insisted upon,
   as an essential note of a Sacrament, that the corporeal sign must have
   been ordained by Christ,' -- ex institutione ipsius Christi, as St
   Thomas himself says (Chap. LVI ad fin.) Christ's ordinance may have
   been more or less indeterminate, e.g., the imposition of hands in
   Ordination, an indeterminate prescription afterwards determined by the
   Church, adding rites and formularies, which it would be unsafe now to
   set aside as unessential because not primitive.

   [1011] Thus the Romans legislated where they had first conquered. The
   sword prepared for the code. The Code Napoléon followed the wars of the
   Revolution.

   [1012] The deniers of the Objective Presence deny that there is any
   sacramental union where, owing to sin, there is no spiritual union.
   According to them, Christ is not except where He is received with faith
   and love; and an unworthy Communion is no Communion at all. In the
   theology of the Catholic Church, the one Sacrament which is invalidated
   by an illicit reception is the Sacrament of Penance, of which the acts
   of the penitent are a constituent part.

   [1013] The economy of the Sacraments belongs to the positive law of
   Christ; and a positive law cannot be argued a priori. A priori perhaps
   the power of Order should be an essential prerequisite in the minister
   of Baptism: in point of fact any human being can validly baptize.

   CHAPTER LXXV--Of the Distinction of Orders

   SINCE the power of Order is principally directed to the consecration of
   the Body of Christ, and its administration to the faithful, and the
   cleansing of the faithful from sin, there must be some chief Order, the
   power of which extends chiefly to these objects; and that is the Order
   of Priesthood. There must be other Orders to serve the chief Order by
   one way or another preparing its matter; and these are the Orders of
   Ministers. The power of Priesthood extending to two objects, the
   consecration of the Body of Christ, and the rendering the faithful by
   absolution from sin fit to receive the Eucharist, the lower Orders must
   serve the Priesthood either in both or in one of these respects. The
   lower Orders serve the Priesthood only in preparing the people [for the
   Eucharist]. This the Doorkeepers do by shutting out unbelievers from
   the company of the faithful: the Lectors by instructing the catechumens
   in the rudiments of the faith, -- hence the Scripture of the Old
   Testament is committed to their reading: the Exorcists by cleansing
   those who are already instructed, if in any way they are hindered by
   the devil from the reception of the Sacraments. [1014] The higher
   Orders serve the priestly Order both in the preparation of the people
   and in the consummation of the Sacrament. Thus the Acolytes have a
   ministry to exercise over the vessels, other than sacred, in which the
   matter of the Sacrament is prepared: hence the altar-cruets are
   delivered to them at their ordination. The Subdeacons have a ministry
   to exercise over the sacred vessels, and over the arrangement of the
   matter not yet consecrated. The Deacons have a further ministry over
   the matter already consecrated, as the deacon administers the Blood of
   Christ to the faithful. These three Orders of Priests, Deacons and
   Subdeacons, are called Sacred Orders, because they receive a ministry
   over sacred things. [1015] The higher Orders also serve for the
   preparation of the people: for to Deacons is committed the publishing
   of the doctrine of the Gospel to the people: to Subdeacons that of the
   Apostles: while Acolytes render to both the attendance which conduces
   to solemnity of teaching, by carrying candles and otherwise serving.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1014] These three Orders, though still given, have long ceased to be
   exercised by their immediate recipients. Their functions are now
   virtually discharged by priests in the various occupations of their
   ministry, -- e.g., by care of Church property, or by refusal to receive
   into the Church ill-prepared converts; by lecturing and writing on
   behalf of the faith; by arguing, entreating, rebuking members of the
   flock who lie under some diabolical infatuation.

   [1015] The other four are the Minor Orders.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVI--Of the Episcopal Dignity, and that therein one Bishop is
   Supreme

   THERE must be some power of higher ministry in the Church to administer
   the Sacrament of Order; and this is the episcopal power, [1016] which,
   though not exceeding the power of the simple priest in the consecration
   of the Body of Christ, exceeds it in its dealings with the faithful.
   The presbyter's power is derived from the episcopal; and whenever any
   action, rising above what is common and usual, has to be done upon the
   faithful people, that is reserved to bishops; and it is by episcopal
   authority that presbyters do what is committed to them; and in their
   ministry they make use of things consecrated by bishops, as in the
   Eucharist the chalice, altar-stone and palls. [1017]

   1. Though populations are different in different dioceses and cities,
   still, as there is one Church, there must be one Christian people. As
   then in the spiritual people of one Church there is required one
   Bishop, who is Head of all that people; so in the whole Christian
   people it is requisite that there be one Head of the whole Church.
   [1018]

   2. One requisite of the unity of the Church is the agreement of all the
   faithful in faith. When questions of faith arise, the Church would be
   rent by diversity of judgements, were it not preserved in unity by the
   judgement of one. But in things necessary Christ is not wanting to His
   Church, which He has loved, and has shed His blood for it: since even
   of the Synagogue the Lord says: What is there that I ought further to
   have done for my vineyard and have not done it.? (Isai. v, 4.) We
   cannot doubt then that by the ordinance of Christ one man presides over
   the whole Church.

   3. None can doubt that the government of the Church is excellently well
   arranged, arranged as it is by Him through whom kings reign and
   lawgivers enact just things (Prov. viii, 15). But the best form of
   government for a multitude is to be governed by one: for the end of
   government is the peace and unity of its subjects: and one man is a
   more apt source of unity than many together. [1019]

   But if any will have it that the one Head and one Shepherd is Christ,
   as being the one Spouse of the one Church, his view is inadequate to
   the facts. For though clearly Christ Himself gives effect to the
   Sacraments of the Church, -- He it is who baptises, He forgives sins,
   He is the true Priest who has offered Himself on the altar of the
   cross, and by His power His Body is daily consecrated at our altars, --
   nevertheless, because He was not to be present in bodily shape with all
   His faithful, He chose ministers and would dispense His gifts to His
   faithful people through their hands. And by reason of the same future
   absence it was needful for Him to issue His commission to some one to
   take care of this universal Church in His stead. [1020] Hence He said
   to Peter before His Ascension, Feed my sheep (John xxi, 1) and before
   His Passion, Thou in thy turn confirm thy brethren (Luke xxii, 32); and
   to him alone He made the promise, To thee I will give the keys of the
   kingdom of heaven (Matt. xvi, 19). Nor can it be said that although He
   gave this dignity to Peter, it does not pass from Peter to others. For
   Christ instituted His Church to last to the end of the world, according
   to the text: He shall sit upon the throne of David and in his kingdom,
   to confirm and strengthen it in justice and judgement from henceforth,
   now, and for ever (Isai. ix, 7). Therefore, in constituting His
   ministers for the time, He intended their power to pass to posterity
   for the benefit of His Church to the end of the world, as He Himself
   says: Lo, I am with you to the end of the world (Matt. xxviii, 20).

   Hereby is cast out the presumptuous error of some, who endeavour to
   withdraw themselves from obedience and subjection to Peter, not
   recognising his successor, the Roman Pontiff, for the pastor of the
   Universal Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1016] The episcopate is established by positive indefeasible
   institution; and there are reasons why it should be: yet who shall
   pretend that presbyterian government, and ordination by an assembly of
   presbyters, is, absolutely speaking, an intrinsic absurdity? Or that it
   could not have been instituted by Christ, had He so willed? Here, as
   repeatedly in this work, St Thomas's necesse est is no argument of
   antecedent necessity, but of mere congruentia post factum.

   [1017] Pallis. The palla now is a small square of linen used to cover
   the chalice. But in St Thomas's time the palla was what is now called
   corporale, the linen cloth on which the consecrated elements are laid.
   The ends of it used to be turned up so as to cover the chalice. Both
   corporale and palla are now blessed by a simple priest with the
   bishop's leave.

   [1018] The argument is this. -- The Church is one society, as it is one
   Church, cf. Ephesians iv, 4-6: v, 23-31: John x, 16). But there is one
   society only where there is one government; and one government means
   one sovereign authority (this is an axiom of political science). Is
   that authority vested in many persons collectively or in one person? We
   may suppose that the government of the whole Church is analogous to the
   government of those local Churches, which are called dioceses. But a
   diocese is governed by one person, the Bishop: therefore the whole
   Church by one Bishop, supreme over other Bishops. For the value of the
   argument, cf. note, p. 399. The conclusion is finally evinced a
   posteriori by documents and facts of history.

   [1019] The arguments for monarchy are stronger in a State that is
   organised for war. A board of generals is never a success: an army in
   the field requires a perpetual dictatorship. Now the Church on earth,
   as mentioned in the next argument, is the Church Militant, ever at war,
   and therefore needing the strictest unity in its own organisation.

   [1020] In the little society of Christ and His disciples everything
   centred in the person of the Master. The smiting of the shepherd was
   the scattering of the flock (Matt. xxvi, 31). It remained, one fold, or
   one flock, so long as it had in Him one Shepherd (John x, 16). Then we
   ask whether so essential a feature of the infant Church ought not
   somehow to reappear and be conspicuous in the Church grown great and
   filling the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVII--That Sacraments can be administered even by Wicked
   Ministers

   NO agent can do anything in what is beyond his competence, unless he
   gets power from elsewhere: thus the mayor [1021] cannot put restraint
   upon the citizens except in virtue of the power that he receives from
   the king. But what is done in the Sacraments exceeds human competence.
   Therefore no one can administer the Sacraments, however good he may be,
   unless he receives power so to do. But the opposite of goodness is
   wickedness and sin. Therefore neither by sin is he hindered from the
   administration of the Sacraments, who has received power to do so.
   [1022]

   5. One man cannot judge of the goodness or wickedness of another man:
   that is proper to God alone, who searches the secrets of hearts. If
   then the wickedness of the minister could hinder the effect of the
   Sacrament, it would be impossible for a man to have a sure confidence
   of his salvation: [1023] his conscience would not remain free from the
   sense of sin. But it is irrational for any one to have to rest the hope
   of his salvation on the goodness of a mere man: for it said, Cursed is
   the man who puts his trust in man (Jer. xvii, 5). In order then that we
   may rest the hope of our salvation on Christ, who is God and man, we
   must allow that the Sacraments work salvation in the power of Christ,
   whether they be administered by good or evil ministers.

   Hence the Lord says: The Scribes and Pharisees have come to sit in the
   chair of Moses: whatever things therefore they say to you, observe and
   do: but according to their works do ye not (Matt. xxiii, 2).

   Hereby is cast out the error of those who say that all good men can
   administer the Sacraments, and no bad men. [1024]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1021] Balivus, the Scotch Bailie, a common term also in England when
   St Thomas wrote, or a little after. The privileges of the mediaeval
   towns originated in charters granted them by the king or some feudal
   lord. In all these matters of positive institution, the appointment
   gives the authority, not the personal character of the functionary, be
   he mayor or be he priest.

   [1022] Holiness does not make the priest, nor does wickedness unmake
   him: for contrariorum eadem est ratio. By administration' here is meant
   valid administration,' not licit.' It is a mortal sin to administer a
   Sacrament, being oneself in mortal sin. But that is the affair of the
   minister, not of the recipient.

   [1023] Fiduciam certam de sua salute, that is, a reasonable assurance
   of his being validly absolved and now in the state of grace.

   [1024] This was one of the tenets of the then rising sect of the
   Fraticelli (Denzinger, Enchiridion, nn. 413, 414), repeated by
   Wycliffe: "If bishop or priest be in mortal sin, he neither ordains nor
   consecrates nor baptises" (ib. n. 480). It would be as wise to hold
   that all good men can sign cheques, and no bad men. To this day that
   notion is not uncommon in England that a Romish priest claims to
   absolve from sin in virtue of his own superabundant personal sanctity.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXVIII--Of the Sacrament of Matrimony

   THOUGH by the Sacraments men are restored to grace, they are not
   immediately restored to immortality. Since then the faithful people
   needs to be perpetuated to the end of the world, this has to be done by
   generation. Now generation works to many ends: to the perpetuity of the
   species, to the perpetuity of the political commonwealth, and to the
   perpetuity of the Church. Hence it comes to be ruled and guided by
   different powers. As it works to the good of nature in the perpetuity
   of the species, it is guided to that end by nature so inclining; and in
   that respect it is called a function of nature.' As it works to social
   and political good, it is subject to the ordinance of the civil law. As
   it works to the good of the Church, it must be subject to Church
   government. But the things that are administered to the people by the
   ministers of the Church, are called Sacraments. [1025] Matrimony then,
   as consisting in the union of male and female, intending to beget and
   educate offspring to the worship of God, is a Sacrament of the Church.
   Hence a blessing is pronounced upon it by the ministers of the Church.
   And as in other Sacraments something spiritual is prefigured by
   external acts, so in this Sacrament, by the union of male and female,
   there is figuratively represented the union of Christ with His Church,
   according to the text of the Apostle (Eph. v, 32). And because the
   Sacraments effect what they represent (sacramenta efficiunt quod
   figurant), we must believe that grace is bestowed by this Sacrament on
   persons marrying, to enable them to have their part in the union of
   Christ with His Church; and this aid is very necessary for them, that
   in their application to fleshly and carnal things they may not be sepa
   rated from Christ and the Church.

   Now the figure must correspond to the reality which it signifies. But
   the union of Christ with His Church is of one Bridegroom with one Bride
   to be kept for ever. For of the Church it is said: One is my beloved,
   my perfect one (Cant. vi, 8): nor ever shall Christ be parted from His
   Church: for so He says Himself, Lo, I am with you even to the end of
   the world (Matt. xxviii, 20); and so the Apostle, We shall be for ever
   with the Lord (1 Thess. iv, 16). Matrimony therefore, as a Sacrament of
   the Church, must be of one husband with one wife, to continue without
   separation: this is meant by the faith (or troth), whereby husband and
   wife are bound to one another. So then there are three goods of
   matrimony, as it is a Sacrament of the Church: offspring, to be reared
   and educated to the worship of God: faith, whereby one husband is tied
   to one wife: and sacramental signification by the indivisible union of
   the matrimonial connexion, making it a sacred sign of the union of
   Christ with His Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1025] Again, rather a wide definition of a Sacrament. It must be borne
   in mind that the priest is not the minister of the Sacrament of
   Matrimony. The Sacrament is the contract of baptised man with baptised
   woman; and the contracting parties administer the Sacrament to one
   another in their agreement to live together perpetually as man and
   wife. Where the law of Trent is promulgated, the presence of the parish
   priest is necessary to the ecclesiastical validity of the contract, and
   therefore of the Sacrament. The proof that Matrimony is a Sacrament,
   rests on a close study of Ephesians v, 22-33, joined with the
   declarations of the Council of Trent. I hardly need say that the proof
   is not complete in the one word sacramentum, musterion, (verse 32).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXIX--That through Christ the Resurrection of our Bodies will
   take place

   AS we have been delivered by Christ from the penalties incurred by the
   death of the first man; and as by the sin of the first man there has
   been bequeathed to us not only sin, but also death, which is the
   punishment of sin; we must by Christ be delivered from both these
   consequences, both from guilt and from sin (Rom. iv, 12, 17). To show
   to us both effects in Himself, He chose both to die and to rise again;
   to die, to deliver us from sin (Heb. ix, 28); to rise again, to deliver
   us from death (1 Cor. xv, 20) [cf. Rom. iv, 25]. We gather the effect
   of Christ's death in the Sacraments so far as remission of guilt goes:
   at the end of the world we shall gain the effect of Christ's
   resurrection in our deliverance from death.

   But some do not believe in the resurrection of the body; and what is
   said in Scripture on that subject they perversely understand of a
   spiritual resurrection from the death of sin to grace: which error is
   reproved by the Apostle in Hymenaeus and Philetus (2 Tim. ii, 16).
   Moreover the Lord promises both resurrections, when He says: The hour
   cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the the Son
   of God, and they that hear shall live: which refers to the resurrection
   of souls, then beginning by men beginning to adhere to Christ by faith.
   But presently He makes explicit promise of a bodily resurrection: The
   hour cometh in which all who are in the tombs shall hear the voice of
   the Son of God: for manifestly not souls are in the tombs, but bodies.
   [1026] Cf. Job xix, 25.

   Reason too gives evident support to the resurrection of the flesh. --
   1. The souls of men are immortal (B. II, Chap. [494]LXXIX). But the
   soul is naturally united with the body, being essentially the form of
   the body (B. II, Chap. [495]LVII). Therefore it is against the nature
   of the soul to be without the body. But nothing that is against nature
   can be lasting. Therefore the soul will not be for ever without the
   body. Thus the immortality of the soul seems to require the
   resurrection of the body.

   2. The natural desire of man tends to happiness, or final perfection
   (B. III, Chap. [496]XXIV). Whoever is wanting in any point proper to
   his perfect well-being, has not yet attained to perfect happiness: his
   desire is not yet perfectly laid to rest. Now the soul separate from
   the body is in a sense imperfect, as is every part away from its whole,
   for the soul is part of human nature.

   3. Reward and punishment are due to men both in soul and in body. But
   in this life they cannot attain to the reward of final happiness (B.
   III, Chap. [497]XLVIII); and sins often go unpunished in this life:
   nay, here the wicked live and are comforted and set up with riches (Job
   xxi, 7). There must then be a second union of soul with body, that man
   may be rewarded and punished in body and in soul. [1027]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1026] See the context, John v, 25-29, which quite bears out St Thomas.
   The great proof of our corporeal resurrection is the corporeal
   resurrection of Christ: the first fruits, Christ, then they that are
   Christ's at his coming, 1 Cor. xv, 23. If the Christ seen by His
   disciples after His death was a mere wraith, or ghost, then there is no
   resurrection of the body awaiting us. I take it some ghost stories are
   true statements of an objective reality seen. But the appearance of the
   ghost is not the removal of the body from the grave. The corpse lies
   still where it was laid, even while the ghost walks. Now, Holy
   Scripture assures us, this is precisely what did not happen in the case
   of Christ. The body was not in the tomb (Matt. xxviii, 6: Mark xvi, 6:
   Luke xxiv, 3: John xx, 2). St Peter appeals publicly to the fact in
   Jerusalem a few weeks after, and says that Christ's flesh did not see
   corruption (Acts ii, 24-32). The Jews, Annas the high priest and
   Caiphas and John and Alexander, and all that were of the high priest's
   kin (Acts iv, 6), had every interest in producing the body of the Man,
   whose resurrection was proclaimed (Acts iv, 10), and whose blood was
   being brought upon their heads (Acts v, 28). They did not produce it,
   they were unable to trace it. All that they could produce was the lame
   story of the 'sleeping witnesses' (Matt. xxviii, 11-15). The wraith
   theory' is a direct contradiction of the witness of the Apostles (Acts
   iv, 33). It transforms the upper chamber (Acts i, 13), where the spirit
   of truth descended (John xvi, 13: Acts ii, 4) into a den of thieves
   (Mark xi, 17) A Christian at least will beware of such a theory.

   [1027] Many of us remain quite unconvinced by these a priori reasons.
   We believe in the resurrection of the body as a revealed doctrine. But
   we look upon it as not susceptible of a priori proof: in other words
   not like the immortality of the soul, a property incident to human
   nature as such. The body will rise again, because God has been pleased
   to place man in a supernatural state, and in Christ to renew the
   privileges of that state, one of those privileges being, as St Thomas
   points out, the final deliverance of the body from death. Of the three
   arguments last given in the text, the first two rest upon the
   assumption that the soul, which is the form' of the body in man's
   mortal life, becomes after death a nude form' crying for its matter.'
   The assumption is not incontrovertible. After death, the change of the
   soul lifewards can scarcely be less than the change of the body
   deathwards. The disembodied spirit must be mightily translated to
   higher existence, if, bereft of its senses, it still lives and
   energises and understands, and does not lie stunned and dormant, as in
   a trance, a supposition which no Catholic theologian will allow (see
   Chap. [498]XCI). Who shall define this higher existence? Who knows and
   can tell us that such elevation does not mean a fulness of spiritual
   nature, independent henceforth of matter and organs of sense? But if so
   independent, how shall the soul ever return to be the form of a body?
   It shall not return to be the form of an animal body, but of a
   spiritual body (1 Cor. xv, 44), that is, of a body entirely subservient
   to the soul, and no hindrance to its spiritual functions, as St Thomas
   presently explains (Chap. [499]LXXXVI). Of the two philosophies that
   have most affected Christian thought, Platonism makes for the
   immortality of the soul, but against the resurrection of the body.
   Aristotelianism raises a difficulty against the immortality of the
   soul: how shall the form' continue when the matter' is gone? But that
   obstacle surmounted, Aristotelianism favours the resurrection, as St
   Thomas's arguments show. Cf. II, Chap. [500]LXXXI
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXI--Some Points of Reply to Difficulties on the Resurrection

   IN the first creation of human nature God endowed the human body with
   an attribute over and above what was due to it by the natural
   principles of its constitution, namely, with a certain imperishability,
   to adapt it to its form, that as the life of the soul is perpetual, so
   the body might perpetually live by the soul. Granting that this
   imperishability was not natural in regard of the active principle,
   [1028] still it may be called natural in regard of the end, taking the
   end of matter to be proportioned to its natural form. When then,
   contrary to the order of its nature, the soul turned away from God,
   there was withdrawn from the body that God-given constitution which
   made it proportionate to the soul; and death ensued. Considering then
   how human nature actually was constituted to begin with, we may say
   that death is something which has accidentally supervened upon man
   through sin. This accident has been removed by Christ, who by the merit
   of His passion and death has destroyed death. Consequently that same
   divine power, which originally endowed the body with incorruption, will
   restore the body again from death to life.

   None of the essential elements in man is altogether annihilated in
   death. The rational soul, the form' of man, remains after death. The
   matter also remains, which was subject to that form. So by the union of
   numerically the same soul with numerically the same matter, numerically
   the same man will be restored. [1029]

   What does not bar numerical unity in a man while he lives on
   uninterruptedly, clearly can be no bar to the identity of the risen man
   with the man that was. In a man's body while he lives, there are not
   always the same parts in respect of matter, but only in respect of
   species. In respect of matter there is a flux and reflux of parts:
   still that fact does not bar the man's numerical unity from the
   beginning to the end of his life. We have an example in a fire, which,
   while it goes on burning, is called numerically one, because its
   species remains, though the wood is burnt out and fresh wood supplied.
   So it is in the human body: for the form and species (kind) of the
   several parts continues unbroken throughout life, but the matter of the
   parts is dissolved by the natural heat, and new matter accrues by
   nourishment. But the man is not numerically different by the difference
   of his component parts at different ages, although it is true that the
   material composition of the man at one stage of his life is not his
   material composition at another. So then, for numerically the same man
   to rise again, it is not requisite for all the material that ever
   entered into his composition throughout the whole course of his life to
   be gathered together and resumed, but just so much of it as suffices to
   make up his proper bulk and stature. We may expect that to be resumed
   by preference, which was more perfect in the species and form of
   humanity. [1030] If anything was wanting to his due stature, either
   through untimely death or mutilation, divine power will supply that
   from elsewhere. Nor will this supplementary matter mar the personal
   identity of the risen body: for even in the workmanship of nature
   addition is made from without to the stature of a boy without prejudice
   to his identity: for the boy and the adult is numerically the same man.
   [1031]

   The resurrection is natural in respect of its end and term, inasmuch as
   it is natural to the soul to be united to the body: but its efficient
   cause is not any agency of nature, but the divine power alone.

   All men will rise again, though not all have adhered by faith to
   Christ, or have received His Sacraments. For the Son of God assumed
   human nature, in order to restore it: the defect of nature then shall
   be made good in all, inasmuch as all shall return from death to life:
   but the defect shall not be perfectly made good except in such as have
   adhered to Christ, either by their own act believing in Him, or at
   least by the Sacrament of faith. [1032]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1028] By the active principle' he means what we should call the
   organism' of the human body. Of no animal body is the organism ever so
   perfect as to involve its living for ever, apart from special divine
   protection and sustenance. St Thomas was not blind to that fact,
   neither was St Augustine.

   [1029] I add by way of note the sequel in the text. The refinements of
   scholasticism have their place in the history of human thought.
   "Corporeity may be taken in two senses. In one way as it is the
   substantial form of a body, according as that body has its place in the
   genus of substance. Taken thus, the corporeity of any body is nothing
   else than its substantial form, in respect of which the body is
   classified according to genus and species: by virtue of this
   substantial form it is due to a bodily thing to exist in three
   dimensions. For there are not different substantial forms in one and
   the same thing; one form, to place it in the highest genus, say, of
   'substance'; and another to place it in the proximate genus, say, of
   corporeal' or animal substance'; and a third to put it in the species,
   say, of man' or horse': for if the first form made it a substance, the
   forms that followed would supervene upon something that was already in
   actuality and subsisting in nature; and thus the latter forms would not
   make it an individual thing, but would be in a subject that was already
   an individual thing, as is the case with accidental forms. Corporeity,
   therefore, considered as the substantial form in man, can be no other
   than the rational soul, which requires in its matter the possession of
   three dimensions: for it is the actualising principle of a body. In
   another way corporeity is taken to mean the accidental form whereby a
   body is said to be in the genus of quantity; and taken thus, corporeity
   is nothing else than the three dimensions which make the essence of a
   body. Though then this corporeity falls away to nothing when the human
   body rots, that cannot hinder the body from rising again numerically
   the same, since corporeity in the first sense does not fall away to
   nothing, but remains the same."

   [1030] With the good man, the elements of the beauty of his youth may
   be expected so rise again rather than the ungainly dimensions of
   middle-aged obesity.

   [1031] What is here said is answer sufficient to the difficulty about
   cannibalism, which St Thomas next goes into. The discussion of the man
   who all his life had eaten nothing but human flesh (solis carnibus
   humanis pastus), and whose father and mother had been reared on the
   same peculiar fare, reads like an afternoon causerie of the Angelic
   Doctor with some rather young undergraduates on the bank of the Seine.

   [1032] The case is that of infants, who die baptised before they are
   old enough to make an act of faith.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXII--That Men shall rise again Immortal

   THAT cannot be said to have been destroyed, which is to go on for ever.
   If then men were to rise again always with the prospect of another
   death, in no way could death be said to have been destroyed by the
   death of Christ. But it has been destroyed, -- for the present,
   causally, as was foretold: I will be thy death, O death (Osee xiii,
   14): and in the end it shall be destroyed actually: the last enemy to
   be destroyed is death (1 Cor. xv, 26).

   3. The effect is like its cause. But the resurrection of Christ is the
   cause of our resurrection; and Christ rising from the dead dieth now no
   more (Rom. vi, 9).

   Hence it is said: The Lord shall cast out death for ever (Isa. xxv, 8):
   Death shall be no more (Apoc. xxi, 24).

   Hereby entrance is denied to the error of certain Gentiles of old, who
   believed that times and temporal events recurred in cycles. For
   example, in that age one Plato, a philosopher in the city of Athens,
   and in the school that is called Academic, taught his scholars thus,
   that in the course of countless revolving ages, recurring at long but
   fixed intervals, the same Plato, and the same city, and the same
   school, and the same scholars would recur, and so would be repeated
   again and again in the course of countless ages. [1033] As for the
   text: What is that has been? That same that shall be. There is nothing
   new under the sun: nor can any one say, Lo, this is fresh: for it hath
   already gone before in the ages that have preceded us (Eccles i, 9): it
   is to be understood of events like in kind, but not in number. [1034]

   doctrine, appears in the mythus of Plato, Politicus, 270 sq. The
   distant way in which St Thomas speaks of Plato is in strong contrast
   with his familiar mention of the Philosopher.' See B. II, Chap. LVII,

     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXIII--That in the Resurrection there will be no use of Food
   or Intercourse of the Sexes

   WHEN our perishable life is over, those things which serve the needs of
   a perishable existence must also come to an end. One such thing is
   food, which serves to supply the waste of the body. [1035]

   The use of the intercourse of the sexes is for generation. If then such
   intercourse is to continue after the resurrection, unless it is to
   continue to no purpose, many men will come to exist after the
   resurrection, who did not exist before. [1036]

   But if any one says that in the risen Saints there will be use of food
   and sexual intercourse, not for the preservation of the individual and
   of the species, but solely for the pleasure that goes with such acts,
   to the end that no pleasure may be lacking in man's final reward, --
   such a saying is fraught with many absurdities. In the first place, the
   life of the risen Saints will be better ordered than our present life.
   But in this present life it is a disorderly and vicious thing to make
   use of food and procreation solely for pleasure, and not for the need
   of sustaining the body or rearing children. For the pleasures that
   attend such actions are not the ends of those actions, but rather the
   action is the end and purpose of the pleasure, nature having arranged
   for pleasure as a concomitant of such actions, lest for the labour that
   goes with them animals should desist from these actions necessary to
   nature, as they certainly would desist, were they not enticed by
   pleasure. It is therefore a perversion of order and an indecency for
   actions to be done solely for the pleasure that goes with them (B. III,
   Chap. [502]XXVII). This then shall nowise be the case with the risen
   Saints, whose life we must assume to be a life of perfect order and
   propriety. Moreover the notion is ridiculous of seeking bodily
   pleasures, common to us with brute animals, where there are in view the
   highest delights, shared with the angels, in the vision of God (B. III,
   Chap. [503]LI). Hence the Lord says: In the resurrection they shall
   neither marry nor be given in marriage, but shall be as the angels of
   God (Matt. xxii, 30).

   As for the alleged example of Adam, the perfection of Adam was
   personal, but human nature was not yet entirely perfect, as the race of
   mankind was not yet multiplied. Adam then was constituted in the
   perfection proper to the origin of the human race, for the
   multiplication of which he needed to beget children, and consequently
   to make use of food. [1037] But the maturity of the risen state is when
   human nature shall have come to its full perfection, and the number of
   the elect shall be complete. Then shall generation no more have place,
   nor the use of food. Therefore the immortality and incorruption of the
   risen Saints shall be different from that which was in Adam. The
   immortality and incorruption of the risen Saints will consist in their
   being incapable of death, or of the dissolution of any part of their
   bodily frame. The immortality of Adam consisted in his being capable of
   immortality, provided he did not sin, and capable of death, if he did
   sin; and this was secured, not by the prevention of all bodily waste in
   him, but by the aid of food to counteract an entire dissolution.

   The Scripture texts that seem to promise the use of food after the
   resurrection, are to be understood in a spiritual sense. What is said
   in the Apocalypse, xx, 4, of the thousand years, is to be understood of
   the resurrection of souls rising from sin, -- cf. Eph. v, 14, Rise from
   the dead, and Christ shall enlighten thee; and the thousand years means
   the whole period of Church history, during which the martyrs reign with
   Christ, and the other saints, as well in that kingdom of God which is
   the Church on earth, as in the heavenly country of departed souls.

   Hence we may finally conclude that all the activities of the active
   life shall cease, as they all bear upon the use of food, and the
   getting of children, and other necessities of a perishable existence.
   Alone left in the risen Saints shall be the occupation of the
   contemplative life: wherefore it is said of the contemplative Mary:
   Mary hath chosen the better part, which shall not be taken from her
   (Luke x, 42).
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1035] A flesh that thus has put on incorruption, a body that is no
   longer an animal body (1 Cor. xv, 44, 53), will not waste. The animal
   life of man will be over: there will be no more nutrition, or
   reproduction, or (so at least it would appear) respiration, or
   circulation of the blood, or beating of the heart. The flesh, it would
   appear, will be absolutely worked, or energised, by the spirit, the
   body by the soul. Quis sapiens et intelliget haec?

   [1036] St Thomas goes on to argue the theological inconveniences of
   such a supposition.

   [1037] "The semen is the overplus of the food" (Aristotle, De gen.
   animal. III, iv, 1), was a favourite axiom with the schoolmen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXIV--That Risen Bodies shall be of the same Nature as before

   SOME have supposed that in the resurrection our bodies are transformed
   into spirit, because the Apostle says: There is sown an animal body,
   there shall rise a spiritual body (1 Cor. xv, 40). [1038] And the text,
   Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of God (1 Cor. xv, 50),
   has prompted the conjecture that risen bodies shall not have flesh and
   blood. But this is a manifest error.

   1. Our resurrection shall be on the model of the resurrection of
   Christ, who will reform the body of our humiliation, so that it shall
   become conformable to the body of his glory (Phil. iii, 21). But Christ
   after His resurrection had a body that could be felt and handled, as He
   says: Feel and see, because a spirit hath not flesh and bones as you
   see me to have (Luke xxiv, 39): in like manner therefore also other
   risen men.

   5. For numerically the same man to rise again, his essential parts must
   be numerically the same. If then the body of the risen man shall not
   consist of these muscles and these bones of which it is now composed,
   the risen man will not be numerically the same. [1039]

   6. The supposition of the body passing into a spirit is altogether
   impossible: for those things only pass into one another which have some
   matter in common [cf. Chap. [504]LXIII].

   7. If the body passes into a spiritual substance, it must either pass
   into that spiritual substance which is the soul, or into some other. If
   into that which is the soul, then in the resurrection there will be
   nothing in man but soul, and he will be exactly as he was before the
   resurrection. But if into another spiritual substance, then two
   spiritual substances will be one in nature, which is impossible, since
   every spiritual substance subsists by itself.

   9. He who rises again must be an animal, if he is to be a man. [1040]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1038] The risen bodies are not transformed into spirit, but subjected
   to the perfect control of the spirit that animates them. Whereas in
   mortal man the soul can go only as far as the body will go, in the
   resurrection the body will go as far as the soul will go, to the utmost
   limits of its spiritual and quasi-angelic capacity. The soul (of the
   just) will then be delivered from the body of this death (Rom. vii,
   24), inasmuch as the body will no longer hold it back and bring it
   down.

   [1039] The tissues and organs, it would appear, retain in the
   resurrection their static entity, but part with many of their dynamic
   functions. There is still to be seen, I think, at Darlington Station
   one of Stephenson's first engines, erected on a pedestal. The parallel
   is not exact, but suggestive.

   [1040] The risen Saint is an animal, as consisting of body and soul:
   but he no longer functions as an animal in the processes of organic
   life: in him those processes have ceased: they are rendered unnecessary
   by the direct control which the spirit now wields over the flesh. His
   body is not spirit, but spiritualised. So the human nature of our Lord
   is not God, but divinised, tetheopoiemenon as the Fathers say.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXV--That the Bodies of the Risen shall be otherwise
   organised than before

   THOUGH the bodies of the risen are to be of the same species with our
   present bodies, still they will be otherwise organised (aliam
   dispositionem habebunt); and chiefly in this, that all the bodies of
   the risen, of good men and evil men alike, will be incorruptible. For
   that, three reasons may be assigned. First, in respect of the end of
   the resurrection, which is reward or punishment for the things done in
   the body; and both the one and the other is to be everlasting (B. III,
   Chapp. [505]LXII, [506]CXLV). Secondly, in respect of the formal cause
   of the resurrection, which is the soul. Since the recovery of the body
   is a provision for the perfection of the soul, it is fitting that the
   body be organised in such fashion as shall suit the soul (Chap.
   [507]LXXIX. But the soul is incorruptible, therefore the body shall be
   restored to it incorruptible. A third reason may be found in the
   efficient cause of the resurrection. God will restore to life bodies
   already corrupted and fallen to decay: much more will He be able, once
   He has restored life to them, to ensure that life abiding in them
   everlastingly.

   This body, now corruptible, will be rendered incorruptible in such sort
   that the soul shall have perfect control over it, giving it life.
   [1041] Nor shall any foreign power be able to hinder this communication
   of life. [1042] Risen man then shall be immortal, not by taking up
   another body, that shall be incorruptible, but by his present
   corruptible body being made incorruptible. This corruptible mast put on
   incorruption (1 Cor. xv, 53). So then that saying, Flesh and blood
   shall not possess the kingdom of God (1 Cor. xv, 50), means that in the
   risen state the corruption of flesh and blood shall be taken away,
   while the substance of flesh and blood remains. [1043]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1041] Anima in ipsum perfecte dominabitur quantum ad hoc quod ipsum
   vivificet (see further Chap. LXXXVI). This axiom seems to furnish the
   key to the whole situation of risen humanity. No longer dependent on
   energy supplied from external nature in the shape of food and oxygen,
   man's soul shall breathe its own spiritual energy direct into his body.
   The case is otherwise with mortal man. Whatever in us the will insists
   on having done, even the very act of the will so insisting, is paid for
   out of the store of physical energy belonging to the body, and latent
   somewhere in the animal system. Witness the reaction and prostration
   that follows sooner or later upon every heroic effort. The effort is
   only made by what we may call a forced loan of bodily energy, raised by
   the will, or rather by the man willing, for the will is not a motor
   power distinct, but belongs to the form' of the body. But in man risen
   and immortal, the soul (to use an expressive vulgarism) shall run the
   body, not merely by directing and whipping up bodily energy, but by
   communication to the body of the soul's own energy, proper to it as a
   spiritual substance, the energy of a spirit either isangelos (which
   Luke xx, 36, seems rather to imply), or minished a little less than the
   angels (Ps. viii, spoken of mortal man).

   [1042] Talis communicatio vitae [sc. vitae et virium vitae ab anima ad
   corpus]. Risen man, we may say, lives on his soul, as mortal man on his
   food.

   [1043] "Flesh and blood, that is, the body sown in corruption (v. 42),
   the natural body (v. 44), image of the earthly Adam (v. 49). It is not
   the substance of flesh and blood that is excluded from heaven, but
   their mortal accidents, bodily needs, and passions thence resulting.
   Corruption here means the corruptible body, as such, with all the train
   of evils attendant thereupon, both moral evils, which go by the name of
   the flesh in the bad sense of that term, and more particularly, the
   physical frailty and perishableness of our mortal frame." Notes on St
   Paul in h.l.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXVI--Of the Qualities of Glorified Bodies

   BRIGHTNESS. Though by the merit of Christ the defect of nature [i.e.,
   death] is taken away from all, good and bad alike, at the resurrection,
   there will still remain a difference between the good and bad in their
   personal attributes. It is of the essence of nature that the human soul
   be the form of the body, quickening it and preserving it in being;
   while by personal acts the soul deserves to be raised to the glory of
   the vision of God, or to be shut out from the order of this glory
   through its own fault. The bodies of all men alike will be organised as
   befits the soul, so that the soul shall be an imperishable form giving
   imperishable being to the body, because to this effect the power of God
   will entirely subject the matter of the human body to the human soul.
   [1044] But from the brightness and excellence of the soul that is
   raised to the vision of God, the body, united to such a soul, shall
   gain a further advantage. It will be entirely subject to the soul,
   God's power so disposing, not in being only, but in all its actions,
   experiences, motions and bodily qualities. As then the soul in the
   enjoyment of the vision of God will be replenished with a spiritual
   brightness, so by an overflow from soul to body, the body itself, in
   its way, will be clad in a halo and glory of brightness. Hence the
   Apostle says: It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory (1 Cor.
   xv, 43): because our body, which now has no light of its own, shall
   then be bright and shining, according to the promise: The just shall
   shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father (Matt. xiii, 43).

   II. Agility. The soul that shall enjoy the vision of God, being
   conjoined to its last end, will find its desire fulfilled in all
   things. And because the body moves at the desire of the soul, the body
   in this case will absolutely obey the beck of the spirit in its every
   command to move: hence the bodies of the risen will be agile; and this
   is what the Apostle means, when he says: It is sown in weakness: it
   shall rise in power (ib.) We experience weakness in the body, in that
   it proves incapable of satisfying the soul in the movements and actions
   which the soul commands. This weakness shall then be entirely removed
   by virtue overflowing into the body from the soul united to God. Hence
   it is said of the just that they shall run hither and thither like
   sparks in a dry bed of reeds (Wisd. iii, 7).

   III. Impassibility. As the soul that enjoys God will have its desire
   fulfilled in respect of the gaining of all good, so also in respect of
   the removal of all evil. The body therefore, being made perfect in
   proportion to the soul, shall be free from all evil, actual and
   potential. As for actuality, there will be in the risen no corruption,
   no deformity, no defect. In point of potentiality, the risen Saints
   will be beyond the possibility of suffering aught that could give them
   pain: they will thus be impassible. Still this does not bar in them
   that sensibility which is proper to sentient beings: for they will use
   the senses to their delight in things that are not inconsistent with
   their state of incorruption. This impassibility is declared by the
   Apostle: It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption.

   IV. Subtlety. [1045] As the soul enjoying God shall perfectly adhere to
   Him, and share in His goodness to the full height of its capacity; so
   the body shall be perfectly subject to the soul, and share in its
   attributes so far as possible, in clearness of sense, in seemliness of
   bodily appetite, and in general perfection of the entire organism: for
   a natural object is more perfect, the more perfectly its matter is
   subject to its form. Therefore the Apostle says (1 Cor. xv, 44): There
   is sown an animal body, there shall rise a spiritual body. The risen
   body will be spiritual, not as being a spirit, but as being wholly
   subject to the spirit; as the present body is called animal, not
   because it is an animal, [1046] but because it is subject to animal
   appetites and needs food.

   It appears by what has been said that the risen body shall be bright
   and shining, incapable of suffering, moving without difficulty and
   labour, and most perfectly actuated by its form.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1044] Materia corporis humani animae humanae subjicietur omnino.

   [1045] The fourth property is usually called 'subtlety'. St Thomas does
   not use the name, but indicates what is meant by it in the next chapter
   (Chap. [508]LXXXVI), where he assigns as the "place of glorified
   bodies" the region above all the heavens (Eph. iv, 10), by which he
   understands the solid crystal spheres which carry the stars. Then to
   the difficulty, "that these heavenly spheres cannot be broken, for the
   glorified bodies to rise above them," he answers: "The glorified bodies
   will be compenetrable with other bodies, of which we have evidence in
   the Body of Christ, which came in to the disciples when the doors were
   shut" (John xx, 19). This is the property of 'subtle ty,' whereby a
   glorified body passes through obstacles with the freedom of a spirit.
   Is the heaven of glorified bodies in some remote star? Or is it in some
   unknown dimensions of space? There is a mystery in that cloud which
   received him out of their sight (Acts i, 9); and in those clouds of
   heaven in which he shall come again (Matt. xxvi, 64: Acts i, 11).

   [1046] This remark hardly fits the Greek, soma psuchikon, which is
   better illustrated by psuchikos anthropos (1 Cor. ii, 14).
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXVIII--Of Sex and Age in the Resurrection

   STILL we must not suppose, what some have thought, that female sex has
   no place in the bodies of the risen Saints. For since resurrection
   means the reparation of the defects of nature, nothing of what makes
   for the perfection of nature will be withdrawn from the bodies of the
   risen. Now among other organs that belong to the integrity of the human
   body are those which minister to generation as well in male as in
   female. These organs therefore will rise again in both. Nor is this
   conclusion impaired by the fact that there will be no longer any use of
   these organs (Chap. [509]LXXXIII). If that were any ground for their
   absence from the risen body, all the organs bearing on digestion and
   nutrition should be absent, for there will not be any use for them
   either: thus great part of the organs proper to man would be wanting in
   the risen body. We conclude that all such organs will be there, even
   organs of which the function has ceased: these will not be there
   without a purpose, since they will serve to make up the restored
   integrity of the natural body. [1047]

   Neither is the weakness of the female sex inconsistent with the
   perfection of the resurrection. Such weakness is no departure from
   nature, but is intended by nature. [1048] This natural differentiation
   will argue the thoroughgoing perfection of nature, and commend the
   divine wisdom that arranges creation in diversity of ranks and orders.
   Nor is there anything to the contrary in the expression of the Apostle:
   Till we all meet and attain to the unity of faith and recognition of
   the Son of God, even to a perfect man, to the measure of the full
   stature of Christ (Eph. iv, 13). This does not mean that in that
   meeting in which the risen shall go forth to meet Christ in the air
   [1049] every one shall be of the male sex, but it indicates the
   perfection and strength of the Church, for the whole Church shalt be
   like a perfect, full-grown man, going out to meet Christ. [1050]

   Again, all must rise at the age of Christ, [1051] which is the age of
   perfect manhood, for the sake of the perfection of nature, which is at
   its best in this age above others.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1047] And surely it is becoming that the arms of righteousness (Rom.
   vi, 13: 2 Cor. vi, 7) should remain to the risen warrior.

   [1048] The celebrated saying about the mas accidentatus occurs in
   Aristotle, De gen. animal. B. II, iii, 18, to gar thelu hosper arren
   esti peperomenon. St Thomas seems to have had it in mind here to
   repudiate it. Whatever is intended by nature' is per se and not per
   accidens.

   [1049] The reference is to 1 Thess. iv, 17, where however the subject
   is not the risen,' but we who live, who are left behind, who seem to be
   contrasted with the risen ' in the previous verse 16, as also in 1 Cor.
   xv, 51 (Greek): 2 Cor. v, 4. Really this 1 Thess. iv, 17, is not a
   parallel passage to Eph. iv, 13. From what the Apostle says in the
   latter passage we are led to hope that the divisions of Christendom may
   one day be healed, and the imperfect faith of so many good men may be
   made perfect in Catholic unity; but the text has no immediate bearing
   on the resurrection of the body. The schoolmen are not at their best in
   exegesis.

   [1050] Rather the converse of the usual Scriptural figure, -- Matt.
   xxv, 6: Apoc. xix, 7: xxi, 2: besides the long passage in the same
   Epistle, Eph. v, 23-32. The perfect man of Eph. iv, 13, is explained by
   the contrast of babes in the next verse: cf. Heb. v, 13, 14, where the
   same contrast recurs.

   [1051] In aetate Christi, a conclusion suggested by aetatis
   plenitudinis Christi (Vulgate, l. c). The intrinsic appropriateness of
   this conclusion is more striking than its exegetical cogency. It is
   commonly held by Catholics, although not with the certitude of faith.
   Nor is it devoid of philosophical significance: cf B. II, Chap. LXXV,
   B. II, Chap. LXXXI, with notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER LXXXIX--Of the quality of Risen Bodies in the Lost

   THE bodies of those who are to be lost must be proportionate to their
   souls. Now the souls of the wicked have a nature which is good, as
   created by God: but the will in them will be disorderly, falling short
   of its proper end. Their bodies therefore, so far as nature goes, will
   be restored to entirety: thus they will rise at a perfect age without
   any diminution of organs or limbs, and without any defect or detriment,
   which any malformation or sickness may have brought on. Hence the
   Apostle says: The dead shall rise incorrupt (1 Cor. xv, 52): and that
   this is to be understood of all men, good and bad alike, is clear from
   the context. [1052] But inasmuch as their soul will have its will
   turned away from God and deprived of its proper end, their bodies will
   not be spiritual (1 Cor. xv, 44, in the sense of being wholly subject
   to the spirit, but rather their soul will be in effect carnal. Nor will
   their bodies be agile, obeying the soul without difficulty, but rather
   ponderous and heavy and insupportable to the soul, even as their souls
   are by disobedience turned away from God. Their bodies will remain
   liable to suffering, even as now, or more so: they will suffer
   affliction from sensible things, but not corruption; as their souls
   will be tormented by the natural desire of happiness made frustrate.
   Their bodies too will be opaque and darksome, as their souls will be
   void of the light of divine knowledge. This is the meaning of what the
   Apostle says, that we shall all rise again, but we shall not all be
   changed (1 Cor. xv, 51): for the good alone shall be changed to glory,
   and the bodies of the wicked shall rise without glory. [1053]

   Some may think it impossible for the bodies of the wicked to be liable
   to suffering, and yet not liable to disintegration, since every
   impression suffered, when it goes beyond the common, takes off from the
   substance: so we see that if a body is long kept in the fire, it will
   be entirely consumed; and when pain becomes unusually intense, the soul
   is separated from the body. But all this happens on the supposition of
   the transmutability of matter from form to form. Now the human body,
   after the resurrection, will not be transmutable from form to form,
   either in the good or in the wicked; because in both it will be
   entirely perfected by the soul in respect of its natural being. [1054]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1052] This interpretation rests on the Vulgate reading of 1 Cor. xv,
   51, and is sound theology, even though it be not correct exegesis: that
   is to say, the opinion is theologically right, though St Paul did not
   say so there.

   [1053] Adopting for this verse 51 the reading of the Vatican
   manuscript, pantes ou koimesometha, pantes de allagesometha, I have
   been led to take a different view of this chapter. "The whole chapter
   is written on the theme of the resurrection of the just: the wicked are
   nowhere considered" (Notes on St Paul pp. 131 sq.; cf pp. 378, 381, on
   Romans viii, 21-39). It is St Paul's manner at times to prescind from
   the wicked, and treat of the destiny of the normal Christian; or, as St
   Thomas would put it, to tell us of what is per se, and omit what is per
   accidens. St Thomas himself, in this very chapter, takes 1 Cor. xv, 44,
   to refer only to the resurrection of the just. Elsewhere however, on
   the solemn occasion of his trial before Felix, St Paul bears witness to
   the resurrection of the wicked: Having hope in God that there is to be
   resurrection of the dead, both just and unjust (Acts xxiv, 15).

   [1054] According to the schoolmen, the reason why any substance is
   changeable is because its matter is not fully actuated by its
   substantial form, and thus remains in potentiality to other forms. The
   heavenly spheres (corpora coelestia) they thought were fully actuated
   by their forms, and were therefore imperishable. They applied this
   doctrine to the body after the resurrection, saying that then the body,
   whether of a good or of a wicked man, was fully actuated by the soul,
   and therefore was incorruptible. This doctrine however had its
   difficulties, as we see here, in respect of the lost being subject to
   sensible pain, and even the just being susceptible of pleasurable
   impressions of sense. Cf. II, Chap. XCVIII (a passage not translated):
   "The matter of a heavenly sphere is so thoroughly perfected by its own
   form as not to lie potentially open to other forms." Just so is every
   risen human body, good or bad.

   CHAPTER XC--How Incorporeal Subsistent Spirits suffer from Corporeal
   Fire, and are befittingly punished with Corporeal Punishments

   WE must not suppose that incorporeal subsistent spirits, -- as the
   devil, and the souls of the lost before the resurrection, -- can suffer
   from fire any disintegration of their physical being, or other change,
   such as our perishable bodies suffer from fire. For incorporeal
   substances have not a corporeal nature, to be changed by corporeal
   things. Nor are they susceptible of sensible forms except
   intellectually; and such intellectual impression is not penal, but
   rather perfective and pleasurable. [1055] Nor can it be said that they
   suffer affliction from corporeal fire by reason of a certain
   contrariety, [1056] as their bodies shall suffer after the
   resurrection: for incorporeal subsistent spirits have no organs of
   sense nor the use of sensory powers. Such spirits shall suffer then
   from corporeal fire by a sort of constriction (alligatio). For spirits
   can be tied to bodies, either as their form, as the soul is tied to the
   human body to give it life; or without being the body's form, as
   magicians by diabolic power tie spirits to images. [1057] Much more by
   divine power may spirits under damnation be tied to corporeal fire; and
   this is an affliction to them to know that they are tied to the meanest
   creatures for punishment. [1058]

   1. Every sin of the rational creature comes of its not submitting in
   obedience to God. Now punishment ought to correspond and be in
   proportion to offence, so that the will may be penally afflicted by
   enduring something the very reverse of what it sinfully loved.
   Therefore it is a proper punishment for a sinful rational nature to
   find itself subject by a sort of constriction' to bodily things
   inferior to itself.

   2. The pain of sense answers to the offence in respect of its being an
   inordinate turning to some changeable good, as the pain of loss answers
   to the offence in respect of its being a turning away from the
   Unchangeable Good (B. III, Chap. [510]CXLVI). But the rational
   creature, and particularly the human soul, sins by inordinate turning
   to bodily things. Therefore it is a befitting punishment for it to be
   afflicted by bodily things.

   Though the promises in Scripture of corporal rewards, like meat and
   drink (Isai. xxv, 6: lxv, 13: Luke xxii, 29: Apoc. xxii, 2), for the
   Blessed, are to be taken in a spiritual sense, nevertheless some
   corporal punishments, with which the wicked are threatened in
   Scripture, are to be understood as corporal punishments in the proper
   sense of the terms used. For though it is not becoming for a higher
   nature to be rewarded by the use of something inferior to itself:
   rather its reward should consist in union with something higher than
   itself: nevertheless the punishment of a superior nature may fittingly
   consist in its being rated with things inferior to it. Some, however,
   of the corporeal imagery that we find in Scripture, speaking of the
   pains of the lost, may very well be interpreted in a spiritual and
   figurative sense. Thus in the saying, Their worm dieth not (Isai. lxvi,
   24: Mark ix, 44), by the worm may be understood the remorse of
   conscience with which the wicked will be tormented: for it is
   impossible for a material worm to gnaw a spiritual substance, or so
   much as the bodies of the damned, which will be imperishable. Weeping
   and gnashing of teeth too (Matt. xiii, 42) can only be understood
   metaphorically of subsistent spirits; although in the bodies of the
   lost after the resurrection the phrase may be taken to have its bodily
   fulfilment, -- not that there can be any flow of tears, for there can
   be no secretion from such bodies, but the weeping will mean pain of
   heart, trouble of eyes and head, and such usual accompaniments of
   weeping.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1055] In itself it is so: it is a good quality to be open to sensible
   impressions: but what if the impressions that come in are disquieting,
   disgusting, dreadful, the sensible settings of a vision of woe? The
   unsolved difficulty of the subject is to know how pure spirits, having
   no organs of sense, are cognisant of anything sensible: cf. II, Chap.
   XCIX. How can we know, tied as our experience is to sense?

   [1056] This is explained by a sentence at the end of the previous
   chapter: -- "The bodies of the damned shall be afflicted by corporeal
   fire, inasmuch as the keen quality of that fire is contrary to that
   equable bodily structure and harmony, which is connatural to sense,
   though it cannot break up the structure: for such affliction shall not
   be able to separate the soul from the body, since the body must ever
   remain under the same form." -- The notion is that the soul, reunited
   with the body in hell, has such a drastic hold upon the body that not
   one bodily atom can be torn from its place: on the other hand the fire
   too takes hold of the same body, and endeavours, as fire ever will do,
   to disintegrate and break the body up: thus over that body a conflict
   rages between the immortal soul and the everlasting fire. And this is
   the contrariety' in question; and in this contrariety, felt, the agony
   of hell-fire consists.

   [1057] The angel Raphael seized the evil spirit, and tied it up in the
   desert of Upper Egypt (Tobias viii, 3).

   [1058] The spirit may be constricted,' or tied, to some material
   substance, and that material substance be kept in violent agitation,
   such that, for every vibration or other agitation of the substance,
   there shall be a corresponding pang of the constricted spirit. -- I
   need scarcely add that this notion of constriction' is not of faith,
   but is a theory devised to explain what is of faith, namely, that
   everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. xxv,
   41), and somehow torments those spirits.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCI--That Souls enter upon Punishment or Reward immediately
   after their Separation from their Bodies

   THERE can be no reason for deferring reward or punishment beyond the
   time at which the soul is first capable of receiving either the one or
   the other, that is, as soon as it leaves the body.

   2. In this life is the state of merit and demerit: hence the present
   life is compared to a warfare and to the days of a hired labourer:
   Man's life is a warfare upon the earth, and his days as those of a
   day-labourer (Job vii, 1). But when the state of warfare is over, or
   the labour of a man hired for the day, then reward or punishment is due
   at once, according as men have acquitted themselves well or ill in the
   effort: hence it is said: The reward of thy hired labourer shall not
   rest with thee till morning (Levit. xix, 13).

   3. The order of punishment and reward follows that of offence and
   merit. Now it is only through the soul that merit and demerit appertain
   to the body: for nothing is meritorious or demeritorious except for
   being voluntary. Therefore reward and punishment properly pass from the
   soul to the body, not to the soul for the body's sake. There is no
   reason therefore why the resumption of bodies should be waited for in
   the punishing or rewarding of souls: nay, it seems fitting rather that
   souls, in which fault or merit had a prior place, should have a
   priority likewise of punishment or reward.

   Hereby is refuted the error of sundry Greeks, who say that before the
   resurrection of their bodies souls neither mount up to heaven nor are
   plunged into hell. [1059]

   But we must observe that there may be some impediment on the part of
   the good in the way of their souls receiving their final reward in the
   vision of God immediately upon their departure from the body. To that
   vision, transcending as it does all natural created capacity, the
   creature cannot be raised before it is entirely purified: hence it is
   said that nothing defiled can enter into it (Wisd. vii, 25), and that
   the polluted shall not pass through it (Isai. xxxv, 8). Now the
   pollution of the soul is by sin, which is an inordinate union with
   lower things: from which pollution it is purified in this life by
   Penance and other Sacraments. Now it happens sometimes that this
   process of purification is not entirely accomplished in this life; and
   the offender remains still a debtor with a debt of punishment upon him,
   owing to some negligence, or distraction, or to death overtaking him
   before his debt is paid. Not for this does he deserve to be entirely
   shut out from reward: because all this may happen without mortal sin;
   and it is only mortal sin that occasions the loss of charity, to which
   the reward of life everlasting is due. Such persons then must be
   cleansed in the next life, before entering upon their eternal reward.
   This cleansing is done by penal inflictions, as even in this life it
   might have been completed by penal works of satisfaction: otherwise the
   negligent would be better off than the careful, if the penalty that men
   do not pay here for their sins is not to be undergone by them in the
   life to come. The souls then of the good, who have upon them in this
   world something that needs cleansing, are kept back from their reward,
   while they endure cleansing purgatorial pains. And this is the reason
   why we posit a purgatory, or place of cleansing.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1059] Apart from interpretations put on Scripture texts, such as Jude
   6: 1 Pet, iii, 19: the belief in the deferring of rewards and
   punishments to the last day has been based upon a view of disembodied
   spirits as ghosts' that 'squeak and gibber' (Shakespeare, Julius
   Caesar: cf. Homer, Odyssey, xxiv, 5-9, where they are compared to
   bats'), existences altogether too slight, fleeting, shadowy and
   dormant, to be the subjects of any signal reward or punishment. Nor is
   this view readily disprovable, except by the positive teaching of
   revelation to the contrary, which indeed is express and clear in the
   Catholic Church.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCII--That the Souls of the Saints after Death have their Will
   immutably fixed on Good

   SO long as a soul can change from good to evil, or from evil to good,
   it is in a state of combat and warfare: it has to be careful in
   resisting evil, not to be overcome by it, or in endeavouring to set
   itself free from it. But so soon as the soul is separated from the
   body, it will be no longer in the state of warfare or combat, but of
   receiving reward or punishment, according as it has lawfully fought or
   unlawfully. [1060]

   3. Naturally the rational creature desires to be happy: hence it cannot
   will not to be happy: still its will may turn aside from that in which
   true happiness consists, or, in other words, it may have a perverse
   will: this comes of the object of true happiness not being apprehended
   as such, but some other object in its stead, [1061] and to this the
   will inordinately turns, and makes a last end of it: thus he who makes
   bodily pleasures the end of his existence, counts them best of good
   things, which is the idea of happiness. But they who are already
   blessed in heaven apprehend the object of true happiness as making
   their happiness and last end: otherwise their desire would not be set
   at rest in that object, and they would not be blessed and happy. The
   will of the blessed therefore cannot swerve from the object of true
   happiness.

   4. Whoever has enough in what he has, seeks nothing else beyond. But
   whoever is finally blessed has enough in the object of true happiness,
   and therefore seeks nothing that is not in keeping with that object.
   Now the only way in which the will can be perverse is by willing
   something inconsistent with the object of true happiness.

   5. Sin never befalls the will without some ignorance in the
   understanding [cf. B. III, Chap. [511]X]: hence it is said, They are
   mistaken who do evil (Prov. xiv, 22); and the Philosopher says that
   every evil man is ignorant. [1062] But the soul that is truly blessed
   can in no way be ignorant, since in God it sees all things that
   appertain to its perfect well-being. In no way then can it have an evil
   will, especially since that vision of God is always actual.

   6. Our soul can err about conclusions before it is brought back to
   first principles. When the knowledge of conclusions is carried back to
   first principles, we have scientific knowledge which cannot be false.
   [1063] Now as the principle of demonstration is in abstract sciences,
   so is the scope, end and aim, in matters of desire. So long then as our
   will does not attain its final end, it may be perverted, but not after
   it has arrived at the enjoyment of its final end, which is desirable
   for its own sake, as the principles of demonstration are self-evident.
   [1064] .
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1060] "There might be probation after probation even in the world to
   come. But some human souls would continue obstinately and unrepentingly
   set in wickedness, age after age, and probation after probation: for
   the possible malice of the will is vastly great. What is to become of
   such obstinate charaders? It seems against the idea of probation, that
   periods of trial should succeed one another in an endless series. . . .
   . The series of probations must end somewhere. And then?" (Ethics and
   Natural Law, p. 166.) "All this speculation, be it understood, lies
   apart from revelation" (ib. p. 165). St Thomas however presently (Chap.
   XCV) argues the notion of any probation at all in the next world to be
   an a priori impossibility.

   [1061] Plato, Theaetetus, 199b. "When the various articles of knowledge
   are flying about in the aviary of his mind, wishing to catch a certain
   article out of the general store, he takes the wrong one by mistake, as
   it were getting hold of the ring-dove, which he had in his mind, when
   he wanted the pigeon."

   [1062] Eth. Nic. III, ii, 14.

   [1063] It cannot be false, in so far as the principles are correct, the
   sequence rigorous, and all facts relevant to the question are
   adequately gauged and put into the reckoning. A very difficult thing to
   do in the concrete sciences: not so difficult in arithmetic, geometry,
   and formal logic, upon which abstract sciences the demonstratio of the
   schoolmen, the Aristotelian apodeixis, is modelled.

   [1064] Per se nota. As St Thomas observes (1a 2ae, q. 94, art. 2),
   there are propositions absolutely self-evident to any man who is not an
   idiot; and propositions relatively self-evident to the expert, who has
   kept up with the progress of a particular science, while to the layman,
   or the unprogressive student, they are not evident at all. At the same
   time, novelty is not always progress.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCIII--That the Souls of the Wicked after Death have their Will
   immutably fixed on Evil

   THE very disorder of the will is a punishment and a very great
   affliction, because insomuch as a person has a disordered will,
   everything that is done rightly displeases him: thus it will displease
   the damned to see the will of God fulfilled in all things, that will
   which they have sinfully resisted.

   3. The will is changed from sin to goodness only by the grace of God
   (B. III, Chapp. [512]CLVII, [513]CLVIII). But as the souls of the good
   are admitted to a perfect participation in the divine goodness, so the
   souls of the damned are totally excluded from grace.

   4. As the good, living in the flesh, make God the ultimate end of all
   their doings and desires, so the wicked set up their rest in some undue
   end which turns them away from God. But the disembodied spirits of the
   good will immovably cling to the end which they have set before
   themselves in this life, namely, God. Therefore the souls of the wicked
   will immovably cling to the end which they too have chosen for
   themselves. [1065] As then the will of the good cannot become evil, so
   the will of the evil cannot become good.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1065] Even when that end has been wrested from them and put out of
   their reach, e.g., sensual gratifications? To this some answer is
   attempted in Ethics and Natural Law, pp. 162, 163.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCIV--Of the Immutability of the Will of Souls detained in
   Purgatory

   BUT because there are souls which in the instant of their parting do
   not arrive at happiness, and yet are not damned, we must show that even
   these souls cannot change their purpose after parting from their
   bodies; and the proof is this: -- the souls of the blessed and of the
   lost have their will immutably fixed according to the end to which they
   have adhered. But the souls that carry with them into the next world
   some matter for purgatory are not ultimately in a different case from
   the blessed, for they die in charity, whereby we adhere to God as to
   our last end. Therefore they too will have their will immutably fixed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER XCV--Of the General Cause of Immutability in all Souls after
   their Separation from the Body

   THE end is in matters of desire like the first principles of
   demonstration in the abstract sciences. These principles are naturally
   known, and any error concerning them could come only from a perversion
   of nature [verging on idiotcy]: hence a man could not be moved from a
   true understanding of such principles to a false one, or from a false
   to a true, except through some change in his nature. It is impossible
   for those who go wrong over first principles to be brought right by
   other and more certain principles; or for any one to be beguiled from a
   true understanding of such principles by other principles more
   plausible. So it is in regard of the last end. Every one has a natural
   desire of the last end; and the possession of a rational nature,
   generically as such, carries with it a craving for happiness: but the
   desire of happiness and the last end in this or that shape and aspect
   comes from a special disposition of nature: hence the Philosopher says
   that as the individual is himself, so does the end appear to him.
   [1066] If then the frame of mind under which one desires a thing as his
   last end is fixed and immovable, the will of such a person is
   unchangeably fixed in the desire of that end. But these frames of mind,
   prompting such desires, can be removed from us so long as the soul is
   united with the body. Sometimes it is an impulse of passion that
   prompts us to desire a thing as our last end: but the impulse of
   passion quickly passes away, and with it is removed the desire of that
   end. In other cases the frame of mind, provocative of such desire,
   amounts to a habit; and that frame of mind is not so easily got rid of,
   and the desire of an end thence ensuing is consequently stronger and
   more lasting: yet even a habit is removable in this life. We have seen
   then that so long as the frame of mind lasts, which prompts us to
   desire a thing as our last end, the desire of that particular end is
   irremovable, because the last end, or whatever be taken for such, is
   desired above all things else; and no other object of greater desire
   can ever call us away from the desire of that which we take for our
   last end. Now the soul is in a changeable state so long as it is united
   with the body, but not after it is parted from the body. [1067]
   Separated therefore from the body, the soul will be no longer apt to
   advance to any new end, but must rest for ever in the end already
   attained. The will then will be immovable in its desire of what it has
   taken for its last end. But on the last end depends all the goodness or
   wickedness of the will. Whatever good things one wills in view of a
   good end, he does well to will them, [1068] as he does ill to will
   anything in view of an evil end. Thus the will of the departed soul is
   not changeable from good to evil, although it is changeable from one
   object of volition to another, its attitude to the last end remaining
   constant.

   Nor is such fixedness of will inconsistent with free will. The act of
   free will is to choose, and choice is of means to the end, not of the
   last end. [1069] As then there is nothing inconsistent with free choice
   in our will being immovably fixed in the desire of happiness and
   general abhorrence of misery, so neither will our faculty of free
   choice be set aside by our will being resistlessly carried to one
   definite object as its last end. [1070] As at present our common nature
   is immovably fixed in the desire of happiness in general, so hereafter
   by one special frame of mind we shall be fixed in the desire of this or
   that particular object as constituting our last end. [1071]

   Nor is it to be thought that when souls resume their bodies at the
   resurrection, they lose the unchangeableness of their will, for in the
   resurrection bodies will be organised to suit the requirements of the
   soul (Chapp. [514]LXXXVI, [515]LXXXIX): souls then will not be changed
   by re-entering their bodies, but will remain permanently what they
   were.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1066] Eth. Nic. III, vii, 17.

   [1067] In other words, the soul in the body is still phusis, something
   that grows: out of the body it telos, a made thing for ever, as an
   angel is.

   [1068] Bona quaecunque aliquis vult in ordine ad bonum finem, bene
   vult. The things must not only be in view of a good end,' they must
   also be good,' that is, permissible, in themselves. See Ethics and
   Natural Law, p. 32, n. 3. But has not St Thomas said that "on the last
   end depends all the goodness or wickedness of the will"? Yes, and
   therefore it is to be further observed that "whoever has placed a good
   end before him, and regards it steadily with a well-ordered love, never
   swerving in his affection from the way that reason would have him love,
   must needs take towards his end those means, and those only, which are
   in themselves reasonable and just: . . . . thus an end entirely just,
   holy, and pure, purifies and sanctifies the means, not by investing
   with a character of justice means in themselves unjust, but by way of
   elimination, removing unjust means as ineligible" (ib. pp. 36, 37).

   [1069] St Thomas here is not denying, what he throughout supposes, that
   in this life our acceptance (intentio, inhaesio, desiderium ultimi
   finis) of anything as our last end is a free act. He is merely quoting
   Aristotle as sufficient authority for his present purpose. Aristotle's
   words are in Eth. Nic. III, iv, 8. Cf. Aquinas Ethicus, I, pp. 51-54:
   Political and Moral Essays, p. 250. -- Free will goes with
   deliberation. We mortal men find ourselves deliberating continually
   about means, but very rarely about ends. Character is said to become
   formed' as time advances: that is to say, some definite view of the
   meaning and purpose of life comes to be finally adopted: or, in
   Thomistic phraseology, the will of the last end becomes fixed,'
   practically speaking, before death; and if so, he would argue, much
   more in death. A conversion or perversion, that is to say, a total
   change of front for better or worse, does not occur in mature life,
   except where a series of choices and preferences has for years been
   leading up to such a consummation. We must not look for conversions
   beyond the tomb, nor, happily, for perversions either.

   [1070] Unless that object be so narrowed down as that all means of
   approach to it are limited and exclusive, as if I were compelled to go
   to London, and saw only one way.

   [1071] Concerning angels' wills, good and bad, St Thomas writes (Sum.
   Theol. I, q. 64, art. 2): "Appetitive power is proportioned to
   apprehensive. Now an angel's apprehension differs from a man's in this,
   that the angel apprehends a thing at a glance, by one fixed intuition;
   man by a course of reasoning, inclining him to opposite conclusions.
   Hence man's will adheres to an object unsteadily, but an angel's
   fixedly and immovably." See above, Chap. [516]LV, § 4. Thus naturally
   there is no repentance for fallen angels.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER CXVI--Of the Last Judgement

   THERE is a twofold retribution for the things that a man has done in
   life, one for his soul immediately upon its separation from the body,
   another at the resurrection of the body. The first retribution is to
   individuals severally, as individuals severally die: the second is to
   all men together, as all men shall rise together. Therefore there must
   be a twofold judgement: one of individuals, regarding the soul; another
   a general judgement, rendering to all men their due in soul and body.
   And because Christ in His Humanity, wherein He suffered and rose again,
   has merited for us resurrection and life everlasting, it belongs to Him
   to exercise that judgement whereby risen men are rewarded or punished,
   for so it is said of Him: He hath given him authority to exercise
   judgement, because he is the Son of Man (John v, 27). And further,
   since in the last judgement there will be question of the reward or
   punishment of persons present in visible bodily shape, it is fitting
   for that judgement to be a visible process. Hence Christ will take His
   seat as judge in human shape, so that all can see Him, good and bad.
   But the vision of His Godhead, which makes men blessed, will be visible
   only to the good. As for the judgement of souls, that is an invisible
   process, dealing with invisible beings.

   CHAPTER XCVII--Of the State of the World after the Judgement

   IT needs must be that the motion of the heavens shall cease; and
   therefore it is said that time shall be no more (Apoc. x, 6). [1072]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1072] Perhaps this celebrated text simply means that there shall be no
   further delay in the coming of the judgement. Time and motion could
   only cease together. Science has sometimes dreamt of a final condition
   of things in which the machinery of the universe shall be completely
   run down, the energies of nature so dislocated as no longer to furnish
   any potentiality of organic life, a uniform temperature established
   everywhere, suns cooled, planetary revolutions stopped, the realisation
   in fact of the homou panta chremata, or universal deadlock, which was
   the Greek notion of a mindless chaos. Things may come to this final
   impasse, or they may not, science cannot tell. But there remains God's
   promise to re-establish (anakephalaiosasthai, gather up under a new
   head) all things in Christ (Eph. i, 10). "Hence it is said," quotes St
   Thomas: they are the last words of his book: "I saw a new heaven and a
   new earth (Apoc. xxi, 1): I will create new heavens and a new earth;
   and the things that were before shall not be in memory, neither shall
   they rise into thought; but ye shall be glad and rejoice for ever
   (Isai. lxv, 17, 18)." "So be it," says Aquinas.

   A WORD in conclusion from the translator, or restorer. There has been
   present in my mind throughout my task the figure which I employed in
   the preface, of the restoration of a thirteenth-century church. I find
   myself surrounded with débris which I have found it necessary to remove
   from the structure of the Contra Gentiles: -- Ptolemaic astronomy
   pervading the work even to the last chapter; a theory of divine
   providence adapted to this obsolete astronomy (B. III, Chapp. XXII,
   XXIII, LXXXII, XCI, XCII); an incorrect view of motion (B. I, Chap.
   XIII); archaic embryology (B. II, Chapp. LXXXVI, LXXXIX); total
   ignorance of chemistry, and even of the existence of molecular physics:
   deficient scholarship, leading at times to incorrect exegesis (B. IV,
   Chap. VII, § 5: Chap. XVII, § 2: Chap. XXXIV in Heb. ii, 10): even a
   theology of grace and the Sacraments that might here and there have
   expressed itself otherwise had the writer lived subsequently to the
   Council of Trent and the Baian and Jansenist controversies (B. III,
   Chap. L): finally, an over-cultivation of genera and species, that is,
   of logical classification, issuing in a tendency to deductive argument
   from essences downwards to effects, as though whatever is most valuable
   in human knowledge could be had by the Aristotelian method of
   demonstration,' with comparatively slight regard to observation and
   experiment, to critical, historical, and a posteriori methods
   generally.

   It may be asked: Seeing that St Thomas is so often at fault in matter
   where his doctrines have come under the test of modern experimental
   science and criticism, what confidence can be reposed in him on other
   points, where his conclusions lie beyond the reach of experience? To a
   Catholic the answer is simple enough; and it shall be given in St
   Thomas's own words: "Our faith reposes on the revelation made to the
   Apostles and Prophets who have written the Canonical Books, not on any
   revelation that may have been made to other Doctors" (Sum. Theol. I, q.
   8 ad 2, -- the context is worth reading). Our confidence is limited in
   conclusions of mere reason, by whomsoever drawn: our confidence is
   unlimited in matters of faith, as taught by the Church (B. I, Chapp.
   [517]III-[518]VI). The practical value of the Summa contra Gentiles
   lies in its exposition of the origin, nature, duty, and destiny of man,
   according to the scheme of Catholic Christianity. That scheme stands
   whole and entire in the twentieth century as it stood in the
   thirteenth: in that, there is nothing to alter in the Contra Gentiles:
   it is as practical a book as ever it was. The débris are the débris of
   now worn-out human learning, which St Thomas used as the best
   procurable in his day, to encase and protect the structure of faith.
   Or, to express myself in terms of the philosophy of our day, dogma has
   not changed, but our apperception' of it, or the mental system' into
   which we receive it. So the Summa contra Gentiles stands, like the
   contemporary edifices of Ely and Lincoln: it stands, and it will stand,
   because it was built by a Saint and a man of genius on the rock of
   faith.

   The Summa contra Gentiles is an historical monument of the first
   importance for the history of philosophy. In the variety of its
   contents, it is a perfect encyclopaedia of the learning of the day. By
   it we can fix the high water mark of thirteenth-century thought: -- for
   it contains the lectures of a Doctor second to none in the greatest
   school of thought then flourishing, the University of Paris. It is by
   the study of such books that one enters into the mental life of the
   period at which they were written; not by the hasty perusal of
   Histories of Philosophy. No student of the Contra Gentiles is likely to
   acquiesce in the statement, that the Middle Ages were a time when
   mankind seemed to have lost the power of thinking for themselves.
   Mediaeval people thought for themselves, thoughts curiously different
   from ours, and profitable for us to study.

   Lastly, the Summa contra Gentiles is mega tekmerion -- considering the
   ravages of six and a half centuries of time upon what was once the most
   harmonious blending of faith with the science of the day, -- it is a
   fact of solemn admonition to all Doctors and Professors of Philosophy
   and Theology within the Church of Christ, that they should be at least
   as solicitous as an English Dean and Chapter now are, for the keeping
   in yearly repair of the great edifice given over to their custody; that
   they should regard with watchful and intelligent eyes the advance of
   history, anthropology, criticism and physical science; and that in
   their own special sciences they should welcome, and make every sane
   endeavour to promote, what since 1845 has been known as the Development
   of Doctrine.
