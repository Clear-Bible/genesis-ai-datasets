PREFACE.

   THE present volume closes the series of Neander's Practical
   Commentaries. Of his original plan, embracing all the more important
   portions of the Bible, only the Exposition of Philippians, of James,
   and of the first Epistle of John had been completed, when their revered
   author was summoned to a higher sphere. All these are now before the
   American public. They form a worthy close of his earthly labors, and to
   many, will seem tile crowning glory of his noble lifework. The
   treasures of genius and learning, which enrich his more scientific
   works, here seem vivified by a new element, and melt under the fervor
   of his inner spiritual life, into a glowing stream of eloquent
   practical instruction. Not that this element is wanting in any of his
   productions. It was the informing spirit of his life, and of all his
   labors. But here it is predominant; all else is but the servant and
   instrument of Christian love, seeking to edify the body of Christ.

   Here, in the Epistle of John, Neander found a peculiarly congenial
   field. There is a noble freedom and assurance in his tread, a glow of
   feeling, an eloquence of utterance, such as even Neander exhibits
   nowhere else. He moves along the high track of revelation as in a
   familiar path; gazing into its deepest mysteries with reverent but open
   eye, and interpreting them to us, not as subjects for speculation, but
   as sources of vital influence to the human spirit.

   This exposition derives a peculiar interest from the fact, that it was
   intended to meet the religious wants of the time. He found the
   tendencies of the age of John reproduced in our own; and threatening as
   then, not to subvert Christianity by open opposition, but to corrupt
   Christianity itself, distilling into the sources of belief the poison
   of human opinion, under the name of Biblical criticism, and Christian
   philosophy. In developing the Apostle's meaning, he takes his stand,
   with a spirit and tone worthy of John himself, in defence of positive
   revealed religion. The Gospel history is to him no Myth; it is a record
   of divine facts. The Christ therein revealed, is the Eternal Son of God
   in human nature. He truly lived, he truly died; he rose victorious over
   death, and now lives at the right hand of the Father. Through his Life
   and his Suffering, he won immortal life for man; that life which
   consists in restoration to the likeness and fellowship of God. Only
   through him, can the human soul obtain this life. There is here no
   liberality, so-called, in the theology of Neander, truly liberal as he
   is on all minor points of belief. The crucified, the risen, the
   perpetually mediating Christ, must be the all and in all, or the soul
   wanders in darkness, cut off from the only fountain of salvation. On
   knowing Christ depends even the knowledge of God, as the universal
   Father end Creator. To the Christianity which does not accept Christ in
   his whole revealed character as the incarnate Eternal Word, the
   divine-human Redeemer, he refuses even the name of Christianity. In his
   own emphatic words: "Whoever denies or mutilates this fact, is to be at
   once rejected. No other mark for the designation of the undivine, the
   false, the anti-Christian, should be needed for the believer." This
   commentary, as well as the two preceding, exhibits in a striking light
   Neander's estimation of the Scriptures, as the inspired word of God. In
   what English interpreter, guiltless of German learning, can be found a
   more reverent reception of their teachings, a more devout and diligent
   seeking after what is revealed, a more child-like humility in pausing
   at the boundary where revelation ceases? The word of God is to him the
   supreme authority, the final appeal. His sole object is to develop its
   treasures, to penetrate through the letter to the spirit, and to bring
   this into contact with the living heart.

   But Neander found also, in the present age, a dead orthodoxy; which,
   while professing the most tenacious adherence to the Scriptures as the
   revelation of divine truth, no less dishonored and endangered true
   Christianity. In unfolding John's treatment of this error in his own
   age, he furnishes lessons of the richest practical instruction for the
   evangelical church of our time, and of all times. Religious truth is to
   him food for the soul, that on which it must live, something demanded
   by an inward necessity of its nature. Its office is not to exercise the
   intellect, but to raise and purify the spirit. Belief is the reception
   of this truth into the living heart, not the cold assent of the
   understanding. Hence both the earnestness with which he demands the
   reception of essential truths, and his comparative indifference to all
   points of doctrine, which do not affect the interests of salvation.
   Thus the true view of the person of Christ, is to him an object of
   infinite moment. This is not, however, for the sake of the knowledge in
   and for itself; but because it is only through this knowledge, that
   Christ himself can be rightly received into the soul perishing for his
   help. Only by knowing him as he is, can the soul rightly submit to him,
   trust in him, draw from him what it needs for the restoration of its
   God-like nature in the divine image. The right recognition of truth
   presupposes moreover, on the part of the percipient, that sense of his
   own moral state and of his relations to God, which converts the outward
   to inward knowledge. The famishing, the sick, the dying, knows that he
   has in this truth received refreshment, healing, life, in his inner
   being. The Christ revealed to him has become the Christ revealed in
   him; and in this inward revelation, continually derived anew from its
   divine fountain, lies the highest source of spiritual knowledge. For it
   is the perception imparted by the Son of God himself, the new
   God-related sense, which he alone can give. This is the Christian
   consciousness, so often mentioned by Neander in this commentary; to
   which he ascribes so high an office, both as the immediate ground of
   belief in Christ, and the test of whatever is presented to the
   Christian as divine truth.

   According to this view, a man's creed cannot in the Scriptural sense be
   right while his life, his spirit, is wrong. The letter of his creed may
   be right; but wanting that which made it God's truth, God's revelation
   to the soul, it is essentially false. It no less misrepresents God, is
   no less ruinous to the soul, than the unbelief which openly rejects the
   truth, or the false philosophy which corrupts it. How much orthodoxy,
   so-called, and contended for as essential to salvation, would at this
   Ithuriel-touch stand revealed in its true form as from beneath not from
   above! The spontaneous inevitable expression of belief in the Gospel,
   of orthodoxy in the sense of John, is Brotherly Love; love which
   regards all men as brethren, but whose most immediate sphere, where it
   unfolds in its highest power and glory, is the church, the body of
   Christ. Hard test! Who then,--we might almost exclaim, as, looking over
   evangelical Christendom, we see rather an arena of deadly combatants
   than the peaceful, loving home of the family of God,--who then
   believes! Convinced we must be, both that the true knowledge of Christ
   is as yet greatly wanting among professing Christians, and that all
   attempts at outward union, whether among individuals, churches, or the
   various great divisions of the church, is labor thrown away. The inward
   union, which springs from living fellowship with God through Christ,
   will gradually melt away all outward differences which mar the symmetry
   of the church; but the outward union can never heal the inward discord.
   So also with the evils of the world at large. All reforms which proceed
   not from this divine principle, however fair their appearance, will
   prove unreal and of brief duration. The source of all evil, whether in
   the church or the world, is estrangement from God; the one great cure,
   the restoration of the soul to a loving union with God, effected
   through the mediation of the divine Redeemer.

   Herein lies the peculiar characteristic of this whole Commentary,--the
   conception of Christianity in all its relations and manifestations, as
   a matter of the life. A believer, a Christian, is one who is in living
   fellowship with Christ. If this living fellowship is lost, he is,
   whatever may have been his former experiences, in precisely the same
   peril with one who has never known it. Neander knows of no dead state
   of grace. The human soul, created in the image of God, and redeemed by
   his well-beloved Son, is in his view too noble, and its price too
   costly, to be thus taken to heaven as a piece of purchased merchandise.
   The salvation won by Christ for man, is the life of God in the soul; a
   conscious life, a reaching forth of its warm living affections after
   him, a life manifested by free, unconstrained, joyful obedience to his
   commands, by the spirit of holiness and love pervading the whole
   character and conduct.

   On this view of the Christian life, rests his noble conception of the
   Christian church. It is not a body of men bound into an external unity
   by the same creed; but a company of individual believers drawn together
   by an inward affinity, by a common participation in that living
   fellowship with God. Neither are there here any distinctions of rank.
   It is one family of God, in which each member stands in immediate
   communion with his Father, and receives immediate life and light from
   the same divine Spirit. There is here no infallible head of the church
   on earth; no constituted priesthood to mediate between him and God; no
   articles of faith shaped and stereotyped by the ingenuity of man, to
   which he is required to bow. Each has the Anointing of the Holy One;
   all are Priests and Prophets, through the indwelling divine Spirit.

   It seems especially meet, that the illustration of these vital truths
   should be the closing labor of Neander's life. The spirit which
   pervades it, reveals a soul matured and mellowed under the influence of
   these truths, to the deepest and richest tone of Christian experience.
   From his own christian consciousness flowed these eloquent expositions,
   of the true character of religious knowledge and belief, of the nature
   of sin, of the efficacy of redemption, of fellowship with God. Only
   from personal intercourse with heaven, was caught the fire of his
   almost inspired delineation of the power of prayer! And beautifully
   fitting it seems also, that it should be the exposition of these truths
   as revealed through the Apostle John. With him, the man of "burning
   love and burning hate," [1] the beloved disciple and the son of
   thunder, the man of immediate perception and intuition of the divine,
   Neander had always felt a peculiar affinity. The illustration of John's
   writings had been a favorite labor of his life; and now, as its close
   draws near, we find him again holding communion with the aged Apostle,
   and interpreting his latest counsels to the church. Standing on the
   threshold of the unseen world, he seems to listen with a deeper
   spiritual sense to the inspired utterances, and interprets them in
   words of kindred sublimity, earnestness, and love. Their sweetness had
   hardly died upon his lips, when he was called "to the home of the Good,
   to Christ;" to join in that new song, to which while yet on earth his
   spirit and his life were so fully attuned, "Worthy the Lamb that was
   slain!"

   The brief sketch which has been given, of the leading features of the
   following work, will be pardoned by those who are conversant with
   Neander's peculiar modes of thought, for the sake of the many to whom
   they are still new.

   The quotations from the Epistle are given in the words of the common
   English version. The author's variations are added in brackets,

INTRODUCTION.

   IN order rightly to understand this Epistle, we must make ourselves
   acquainted with the Apostle's sphere of labor at the time of writing
   it, and with the peculiar circumstances to which he had reference, in
   the condition of the churches whom he addressed. From the true
   historical explanation will follow, moreover, its proper application to
   all succeeding times, and to our own age more especially, as bearing a
   more marked resemblance to that which we may designate as the Johannic
   period; an age which, in the disorganization and destruction of the old
   order of things, is preparing the way for a new epoch in the
   development of the kingdom of God. In the opposing influences with
   which John had to contend as a preacher of the Gospel, properly
   understood, we shall see prefigured the very same which obstruct the
   progress of evangelical truth in our own day.

   After the martyrdom of Paul, the influences which had already begun to
   oppose themselves to the christian life in the churches of Asia Minor,
   broke forth with increased strength when no longer restrained by the
   personal character and authority of the great Apostle. John was now
   called to supply his place in the guidance of the bereaved churches,
   left exposed to the perils of so dangerous a conflict. He had already
   labored long among them, when he sent out this pastoral letter, with
   reference to the many forms of corruption which here menaced genuine
   Christianity. Of these corruptions, some were chiefly speculative,
   others practical in their character. They were, in part, errors arising
   from a narrow and defective conception of christian truth; in part,
   practical mistakes which had no such deeper origin. But these errors,
   of whatever kind, with which John had to contend, did not respect
   merely those single points of difference in the mode of dogmatic
   conception, to which in later times a greater weight has often been
   attached, than is warranted by a more just estimate of their importance
   both to the inward and the outward christian life. On the contrary,
   they all had reference to that one great truth on which all others
   turn, the central truth of Christianity. The Apostle's example
   furnishes a model of the discrimination, too much neglected in after
   times, between that which is of practical importance in differences of
   doctrine, and that which cannot be so regarded.

   In the Pauline period, all had turned on the question between Law and
   Gospel; on the question whether faith in Jesus, as the Saviour, would
   alone suffice for the justification and sanctification of men, or
   whether obedience to the Mosaic law were also requisite. Now, on the
   contrary, the central point of the conflict between truth and error was
   the Person of Christ; and it became more and more evident, that a full
   and complete conception of Christianity, in its relation to faith and
   life, must be based on a full conception of the Person of Christ
   himself. The question had already taken this turn at the time of Paul's
   first imprisonment at Rome, as appears from his own opposition to those
   errorists in the church at Colosse. Here, even then, the Person of
   Christ in its relation to God, to the universe, and to humanity, formed
   the central point of controversy; and this was nothing else than a
   farther development of the inherent contrariety between genuine
   Christianity, and that which only assumes its likeness in order to
   vitiate it in its own peculiar nature. We see the same thing repeated
   in our own time,--all essential questions of religious faith resolving
   themselves more and more into the one question: What are we to hold
   respecting the Person of Christ?

   That the Word,--He who from the beginning was with God and was God, He
   by whom all things were created,--became Flesh; this, as John himself
   teaches, constitutes the peculiar nature of the Person of Christ.
   Herein is that grounded by which he is distinguished from all else that
   has ever appeared in the history of humanity,--the union of the Divine
   Essence with human nature in all its properties and peculiarities, the
   humanization of the Divine Essence in order to remodel human nature
   after this revealed form of the divine. And as it is this which
   constitutes the peculiar nature of the Person of Christ, so does it
   constitute the peculiar nature of entire Christianity; its grand
   purpose being, as befits the destiny of man created in the image of
   God, to raise whatever is human to the glorious dignity of the divine
   life, to transform it into the divine. Thus, on the right apprehension
   of Christ as the Incarnate Word, depends also the true conception of
   the whole moral change wrought in the life by Christianity, in other
   words, the peculiar nature of all christian morality. The true
   conception of this union of the divine and human, in the Person of
   Christ, being thus essential to a true understanding of what Christ
   was; there readily arose two opposite forms of error, exalting the one
   at the expense of the other, instead of grasping the full and entire
   unity of his divine-human person, both sides in perfect agreement and
   harmony with each other. Both these erroneous and mutilated conceptions
   of the Whole Christ, testify of that very truth from which they diverge
   in opposite directions. For such, and no other, must have been Christ's
   manifestation of himself on earth, in order that the contemplation of
   it might make such opposite impressions. Of this no other example can
   be found in human history. On the one class, so powerful was the
   impression of the purely human in that manifestation, that they would
   recognize in him nothing but the man, though gifted with extraordinary
   divine powers for the fulfilment of his human calling. The other class,
   contending against this narrow conception of the idea of Christ, ran
   into the opposite extreme. To their view, the divine glory shone in the
   appearance of Christ with an overpowering radiance, before which all
   that was human vanished from sight. They regarded it only as the
   visible form, in which the manifestation of a divine existence had made
   its abode, in order that it might become an object of human perception.
   Between these opposite forms of conception,--the Ebionitish and
   Docetish, with which John had to contend,--there arose a third, that of
   Cerinthus, which seemed to reconcile the two extremes, but which was at
   bottom a compound of what was erroneous in both, and allowed neither to
   the divine nor the human in Christ its just claims. According to this
   view, Jesus was a mere man, in all respects like other men. But at his
   solemn consecration to his Messianic calling by the baptism in Jordan,
   the celestial redeeming Spirit, as something wholly distinct from him,
   had descended upon and united itself with him. Thus the purely human
   and the divine were indeed both recognized; not however in their proper
   unity, but on the contrary as entirely distinct the one from the other,
   and only united in an outward and accidental relation. Thus neither the
   divine was recognized in its humanization, nor the human in its
   exaltation through the divine. The true significance of the Person of
   Christ, and of the new creation which was to proceed from him,--the
   God-man as the Redeemer of humanity,-- was necessarily obscured in this
   view no less than in the two others. In opposition to all these
   fragmentary conceptions of the person and work of Christ, the Apostle
   John felt himself constrained to give the testimony derived from his
   own direct perception and personal experience of the life of Christ, in
   which the glory of the only begotten of the Father had revealed itself
   to him, beaming forth in his whole manifestation.

   But it will easily be perceived, that these same contrarieties are
   repeated at the present day under new forms; and hence the Apostle's
   words apply with no less force to the spiritual aspects of our own age.
   The one class recognize in Christ only the enlightened man, the most
   perfect teacher of religious truth who had then ever appeared on earth,
   and the most perfect model for the human life. Christianity is in their
   view only a system of moral instruction, moral precept and moral
   example. They deny the supernatural, the divine in the life of Christ,
   and consider him as differing only in degree from the nobler of the
   race; they explain away the Gospel history, till everything in it is
   brought down to the level of common experience. Hence too, they cannot
   recognize nor comprehend those moral potencies proceeding from Christ,
   such as could proceed from no other, which are working the moral
   transformation of the world, and by which Christianity is distinguished
   from all other spiritual forces at work in humanity. The glory of a
   divine life, whereby everything human is transformed into the heavenly,
   remains hidden from their view. Christianity, in its peculiar nature,
   is to them still an unrevealed mystery. Others there are, on the
   contrary, who fully recognize the violence thus done to the
   representation of the life of Christ in the Gospel, who catch from the
   Gospel narrative the gleam of higher ideas; but they are ideas floating
   in ether, having no contact with the earthly and actual. According to
   their view, the historical manifestation had no actual existence; it is
   but a sublimated myth, which has become a medium for the divine. The
   historical Christ becomes to them a mere form of mist, a phantom, an
   illusion, as to the Docetes of the ancient world. There still remains,
   therefore, the same disagreement between the heavenly archetype and the
   actual being, which it was the very purpose of Christ's coming to do
   away; and which was to disappear more and more by the progressive
   incorporation of his divine life into the life of humanity, in those
   who enter into fellowship with him as their Redeemer. As the former
   will allow no guide but actual and ordinary experience, which can never
   rise to the divine Idea; so the latter content themselves with the
   contemplation of mere ideals which have no part in life, never become
   flesh and blood, never incorporate themselves with the actual; and thus
   on this side also, with all its tendency to the ideal, nothing remains
   but the common and actual. The one class admit only an ideal Christ;
   the other only an every-day Christ level to their low and natural view
   of the historical. The first admit only the spirit, the other only the
   letter; and thus both are lost, being rightly apprehended only in their
   unity.

   From both these forms of error are to be distinguished those practical
   mistakes, which have no such theoretical basis. Here too, as in the
   former case, we find directly opposite forms of error. The one class,
   in the consciousness of redemption already received, lost sight of the
   still remaining necessity of redemption, which should be ever present
   to the view of the believer; that ever present sense of still inhering
   sin, from which he can be purified only by a perpetually renewed
   surrender of himself to the Redeemer. The other class hoped for
   forgiveness of sin, without renunciation of sin in submission to the
   Redeemer. They supposed that forgiveness might be obtained, without a
   thorough work of sanctification in fellowship with Christ. To them,
   forgiveness of sin was something merely external; just as faith had
   become something external merely, having lost its true inward
   significance. A mechanical and worldly Christianity had arisen; a
   natural result where Christianity has become a thing of custom and
   habit, as in these churches founded in the time of Paul, in many of
   which Christianity had already been handed clown from one generation to
   another. Both these forms of error must be met by holding up to view
   the Holy One; Him who appeared as Redeemer to establish a kingdom of
   holiness in man; who, as Redeemer and Sanctifier, continues to work in
   that humanity, which is more and more to be purified and ennobled by
   him, and which can never cease to have need of Him as its Redeemer in
   all the progressive stages of sanctification. We need not stop to point
   out the perpetual recurrence of these practical mistakes, as it must be
   obvious to all.

   To these theoretical and practical mistakes stand opposed the counsels,
   instructions, and warnings of the Apostle in this pastoral letter. It
   will therefore easily be seen, how we are to apply what is here written
   as if intended expressly for our own time. We will now proceed to the
   consideration of them in detail.

CHAPTER I.

   JOHN commences without any preliminary introduction. His first words
   burst forth from the fulness of that which was the soul, the centre of
   his whole Christian life, that which formed the sum and substance of
   his preaching and of all his instructions. Taking his readers at once
   into the midst of that subject, on which no doubt all he had ever had
   occasion to say to them had turned, he begins by pressing home upon
   their hearts what had already become familiar to them from his lips;
   which needed only to be recalled to their remembrance, to be quickened
   and animated anew, and to be made the centre and axis of their whole
   christian life. We all remember the old tradition, that when this
   Apostle, in extreme old age, was carried in the arms of his disciples
   to the assemblies of the church, he did nothing but repeat this one
   admonition: "Little children, love one another." When asked the reason,
   he replied: "Because it is the Lord's command; and this being done, all
   is done." In this single trait, handed down to us by tradition, is
   fully expressed the peculiar nature and personality of John. It is not
   the rich variety in the development and expression of ideas, and of
   their remote relations, which we find in Paul. Here, on the contrary,
   are a few essential truths, repeated. over and over in simple words,
   which, as they fell from the lips of Christ himself, had stamped
   themselves deeply into the susceptible spirit of John, and had become
   as it were ingrown into his own peculiar nature. With him all proceeds
   from the direct contemplation of Christ, the God-man, whose living
   image is ever present to his soul, and to whom he is ever directing
   alike his hearers and readers. He ceases not to testify of that which
   he has learned in daily intercourse with him, the divine source of
   life, and which is to him of all things the most certain. He can find
   no words strong enough to express the assurance of his conviction, that
   this divine-human life was a reality. His very forms of expression
   stand forth in strong contrast with that sublimation of the image of
   Christ by the Docetes, of which we have already spoken.

   In his historical representation of Christ's Messianic labors, he
   distinguishes himself from the other Evangelists in this respect,--that
   he does not commence with the immediately preceding historical
   preparation, the prophetic advent of the Baptizer, nor yet with the
   beginning of the earthly life of Christ; but rises above the
   manifestation in time, to that divine Original which revealed itself
   therein. This characteristic peculiarity of John meets us also here, at
   the very commencement of this Epistle. No otherwise could John have
   spoken. The fulness of the divine essence, leading back to the Eternal
   Source in the invisible God himself, and the human manifestation,--all
   this he contemplated inseparably and as one. He beholds in Christ the
   revelation in humanity of Him who is exalted above all time, who had no
   beginning in time; who, antecedent to all creation, was from the
   beginning; the Eternal Image of the unknown divine existence. This
   having now presented itself in human nature to human apprehension, it
   was necessary that John, in reproducing the image of Christ to the view
   of his readers, should first of all comprehend both these in one; viz.
   that which was from, the beginning,--and that which had become, to
   those who witnessed his life on earth, an object of unquestionable
   physical perception. He begins, not with abstract ideas, but by
   referring to a fact, the highest of all facts in human history, and to
   its attestation by personal experience.

   Ch. i. 1.] "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard,
   which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
   hands have handled." It is noteworthy, that John here expresses himself
   in the indeterminate form. We should naturally expect a personal
   designation of Him who was from the beginning; who in his temporal
   manifestation had permitted himself to be seen and heard and handled,
   thus subjecting his reality to the test of all the senses. Yet John
   expresses himself thus indefinitely: "That which was from the
   beginning, that which we have seen and heard;" and again afterwards he
   resumes the same form: "That which we have seen and heard, declare we
   unto you." In the intermediate clause also, he designates him not
   personally, but by something relating to him,--"of the word of life."
   These expressions, taken in connection, are the very clue which is
   needed, to introduce us into the peculiar spirit and manner of John.
   All which he has to say to men proceeds from Christ, and leads back to
   Christ; it is Christ himself that appears in all; the sole object is to
   gain Him entrance to the hearts of men, to bring within reach of man
   that fountain of all true life, the self-communication of Christ. Thus
   it naturally happens that, in John's mode of conception, the
   distinction between the impersonal and the personal is lost from view.
   That which he has to announce, that which was from the beginning, that
   which he has seen and heard, is no other than the self-revelation and
   self-imparting of Him, who was from the beginning.

   Ch. i. 2.] John does not immediately carry out this thought, in the
   form of expression with which he had begun; but interrupting himself,
   expresses in a new form what was already in his mind and filled his
   soul while writing the first words: "Of the Word of life (for the Life
   was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto
   you that Eternal Life which was with the Father, and was manifested
   unto us)".

   What now are we to understand by "the Word of Life"? Shall we, as
   elsewhere, understand "word" in the sense of announcement? We must then
   refer it to that original proclamation of the Life, which was made by
   Christ. Even thus the mind would still be directed to the appearing of
   Christ himself: as, in what immediately follows, not merely the
   proclamation of the Life is spoken of, but the manifestation of the
   life in its self-revelation among men; and also the expression "That
   which was from the beginning" refers, as we have seen, not merely to an
   indefinite something, but to Him who was from the beginning. He it is,
   then, whom we here find represented as the "Word of life." The mind is
   thus directed to what John calls "The Word," at the beginning of his
   Gospel. Christ himself is the Word, in whom the hidden being of God has
   revealed itself. Since, in his temporal manifestation as the revelation
   of God in human nature, he is the perfect expression of the divine
   nature in human form; this his temporal manifestation is by John
   referred back to the Eternal Word, in which the hidden being of God
   originally imaged and revealed itself, became objective to itself,--in
   which the whole creation had its archetype. As the spirit of man,
   before it reveals itself outwardly in the spoken word, expresses itself
   to itself, unfolds and becomes objective to itself, in an inner word,
   the word of self-consciousness; so in God, this Word of his eternal
   self-revelation is to be distinguished from his hidden, unfathomable
   being. It was this Word which was from the beginning. It is this Word
   which John calls "the Word of Life." By life here he understands the
   divine life originating in God, proceeding from him alone as the only
   true life. Since now all communication of life from God is through the
   medium of this Word, it is itself the fountain of true life, and John
   calls it absolutely the Word of Life. He then proceeds, under this form
   of conception, to express what he had in mind at his opening words,
   what he wished to testify to his readers as something made certain to
   him by personal observation and experience. Having designated Christ as
   himself the Word of Life, he adds, under the same form of thought, the
   declaration that the Life absolutely, He whose nature is life, the
   divine life-fountain, has revealed itself in a human manifestation. He
   claims to have been an eye-witness of this self-revelation of the Life.
   The eternal Life itself, which as the Word was hidden with the Father,
   has appeared in a self-revelation in humanity;--such, and no other than
   this, was the appearing of Christ. John testifies of that eternal Life,
   which appeared in Christ in order to impart itself to men; to impart to
   them this life which constitutes His whole being, and whose fountain he
   himself is. This it was the object of John's testimony to make known.

   Ch. i. 3.] Resuming accordingly what he had begun, he now proceeds in
   the same form: "That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you,
   that ye also may have fellowship with us.".

   Having, therefore, been himself an eye and ear-witness of the
   self-revelation of that eternal Life which seeks to impart itself to
   man, John declares what he has seen and heard, that those who hear may
   be led by it into that divine fellowship of life in which all are to
   become one. By the "fellowship with us," which he represents as the
   object for which he declares this, he means fellowship with those who
   testified, as original eye-witnesses, of the eternal Life which had
   made its appearance in humanity; a fellowship therefore derived from
   that original fellowship with the divine life-fountain so revealed, a
   fellowship with the Apostles grounded in fellowship with Christ. All
   fellowship of believers with one another, in the Apostle's view,
   springs from that original fact of fellowship with Christ. Thus is
   formed his conception of the Church.

   This is of special importance as a guard against the tendency, which is
   ever reappearing, to externalize the idea of the church, to attach an
   undue value to a certain visible organization; while it is forgotten
   that fellowship with Christ is the main point, the essential element of
   the whole true church,--which, issuing from this source, grounded in
   this fellowship, may appear in a variety of outward forms. We must ever
   bear in mind that where this fellowship exists, there, whatever defects
   may still cleave to it, is a true church; as indeed there is no form of
   divine manifestation in sinful human nature wholly free from defect.

   In explanation of what he understands by this fellowship, the Apostle
   immediately adds; "And truly our fellowship is with the Father, and
   with his Son Jesus Christ."

   Ch. i. 4.] Fellowship with the Father, who can be truly known as Father
   only in this self-revelation through the Son, is here represented as
   effected through the medium of fellowship with the Son. And since in
   this fellowship is grounded that eternal divine life, in which alone
   true blessedness and joy can be found; John represents it as the object
   of his whole preaching, as likewise of this Letter (intended to revive
   in their hearts the contents of that preaching, in opposition to all
   the corruptions and impurities of which we have spoken) to promote that
   joy: "And these things write we unto you that your joy may be full."
   All impurities and corruptions of the christian's inward and outward
   life, must also introduce disturbance into the joy or blessedness
   grounded in the divine fellowship of life with Christ. In this pastoral
   Letter, designed to avert such a danger, what he seeks is this: that
   their joy may be full, that in fellowship with Christ they may find
   their full joy.

   Ch. i. 5.] In this Epistle, promises and the stipulated condition of
   their fulfilment, that which is to be performed on the part of those to
   whom the promises are addressed, are presented in constant interchange.
   With religious truth there is always connected a practical application
   to the moral conduct and course of life; and nothing is said in
   reference to the latter which is not deducible from the former. As in
   his opening words, where he speaks as an eye-witness of the appearing
   of Christ, John plainly has reference to that erroneous sublimation of
   the Idea of Christ; so here when he is speaking of the practical, we
   cannot fail to perceive an implied reprehension of that secularized
   Christianity of custom and habit. "This then is the message which we
   have heard of him, and declare unto you: That God is light, and in him
   is no darkness at all."

   First of all, he represents God under an image which they had doubtless
   often heard from his own m1outh, as he too had received it from the
   lips of Christ: "God is light, and in him is no darkness." His nature
   is light; from Him all darkness is excluded. He is the opposite of all
   darkness. Light, in the Holy Scriptures, and especially in the writings
   of John, is often used as the image of the Divine; darkness, on the
   other hand as the image of the Undivine. Truth, holiness, bliss, all
   these may be designated as light, since they all belong to the nature
   of the Divine; as falsehood, wickedness, and misery form the
   characteristics of the Undivine. What is particularly represented by
   the image of light in this passage, will appear from the exhortation
   which is founded on it. It enjoins a course of life contrary to all
   that is unholy, and the ground-thought must therefore be, that the
   nature of God is holiness; all that is unholy is alien to him.

   Ch. i. 6, 7.] From this view of the divine nature, the Apostle now
   deduces what is required as the condition of standing in fellowship
   with God; the signs by which this fellowship will manifest itself in
   the life; and on the other hand, by what signs it is to be known that
   no such fellowship exists. "If we say that we have fellowship with him
   and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in
   the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another,
   and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."

   The thought here lying at the basis is this: that since all spiritual
   fellowship presupposes an affinity of nature, and this inward
   fellowship of nature must also have an outward manifestation in the
   life; so no fellowship with God can exist without a life conformed to
   God. Since then God is light, fellowship with him must manifest itself
   through a life which is full of light; fellowship with the God whose
   nature is holiness, through a holy course of life. John does not here
   mean a quality of the life-walk required for the first attainment of
   fellowship with God; but assuming this divine fellowship of life,
   received through faith in the Redeemer, as already existing, his object
   is to point out the tests, whether the claim to such a fellowship be
   true or false,--whether the Christianity which is professed be a true,
   or merely a seeming and pretended one. This thought is expressed, in
   John's peculiar manner, both in the negative and affirmative form. Ile
   first says, in opposition to that mere seeming Christianity, that he
   who leads an ungodly life, and yet claims to be in fellowship with God,
   thereby makes himself guilty of a lie. Full of significance is the
   expression, "We do not the truth"; an expression belonging to the depth
   of conception peculiar to John. With him truth is not limited in its
   application to speech merely; it embraces the entire life. The entire
   life has its root either in falsehood or in truth. Truthfulness in
   speech is but one index of that truth which embraces, fills, vitalizes
   the whole inner and outer life. Hence, of one who makes claim to
   something which is contradicted by his course of life it is said, that
   his whole life is alien from the truth, that he does not practice the
   truth, that his life is chargeable with falsehood. Speech appears also
   as an action;--"We do not the truth."

   In contrast with this, John designates "Walking in the Light," in
   holiness, as a mark of fellowship with God who is in the light, who
   reveals himself in holiness. "If we walk in the light as He is in the
   light, then have we fellowship one with another." He does not speak
   here directly of fellowship with God, but of the fellowship of
   believers with one another; but in this is necessarily presupposed
   fellowship with God through Christ, as that from which the fellowship
   of believers with one another first proceeds. John thus distinguishes
   between those who belong, as true members, to the fellowship of
   Christians (in other words to the church, a designation never used by
   John) and those who belong to it only in appearance and not in truth,
   those whose pretensions are contradicted by their ungodly life.
   Fellowship with God, as effected through Christ, and the fellowship of
   believers with each other, is here one and the same thing.

   If now the life of believers while here on earth were already a perfect
   fellowship with God, if their course of life were a walking in the
   light free from darkness of every kind, and unstained by any farther
   act of sin, then John would have had no occasion to add anything more.
   But he was well aware that even in believers, although their life is in
   its determining tendency a walking in the light, yet the dark, the
   sinful, still mingle with it their disturbing influence; the former
   stand-point of darkness and sin, from which redemption has set them
   free, still remains in its effects. Hence, this "walking in the light"
   must be developed in a continuous conflict with the former darkness;
   from the light already received, the whole life must be gradually
   transformed into light. And hence, in reference to that sinfulness
   which still cleaves to the believer and opposes itself to the light, he
   says, that where that walking in the light exists as the determining
   tendency, the mark of fellowship with God, there the blood of Jesus
   Christ will make known its purifying efficacy, its power to cleanse
   from all still inhering sin.

   In the purification through the blood of Christ, we are obviously not
   to understand the blood of. Christ literally, nor an outward literal
   purification by it, anymore than the sprinkling of the conscience with
   the blood of Christ, spoken of in the Epistle to the Hebrews, is to be
   so understood. Only a spiritual cleansing can here be meant, and
   consequently only a spiritual means of cleansing. It is necessary to
   refer back the sensible imagery to the thought imaged therein. It is
   the language of the Holy Scriptures, the language of life; according to
   which one characteristic of the whole is put for the whole itself; and
   especially is that which appears as the crowning point put for the
   whole with all its characteristics, so that the single characteristic
   must be conceived of in that connection, in union with the sum of all
   the others, in order to be rightly understood. The blood of Christ,
   then, must be conceived of in its full significance, as it was present
   to the view of the Apostle, viz. as both a Doing and a Suffering; it
   being on the one hand a suffering for the guilt of humanity, and
   presenting on the other, in the perfect holiness of the life of Christ,
   an offset to the sin of humanity, a thought which we shall hereafter
   find still further developed in other expressions of John. Since now
   this suffering of Christ, once for all, possesses this redeeming and
   purifying significance, it continues to perform its work in all those
   who through faith enter into fellowship with Christ, till all in them
   that is sinful shall be cleansed away, and all be transformed into
   light. In this idea of purification two distinct things are included;
   namely, first, that the sin which yet remains shall no longer form a
   hindrance to fellowship with God, it shall be as if already done
   away,--the forgiveness of sins; and secondly, that the still operating
   sinful element shall actually be more and more cleansed away,--the
   progressive purification of the whole life. All this is an ever
   progressing appropriation of the once perfected redemption.

   So in what John here says, we find two different things expressed. It
   is assumed that there is sin yet cleaving to those who are walking in
   light; though in fellowship with Christ, they are still in constant
   need of redemption through him, in constant need of him as the
   Redeemer; that we who are walking in the light with Christ in us, have
   also still need of Christ for us. To those who, while walking uprightly
   in the light, are yet daily conscious to themselves of the still
   remaining influence of sin; who cannot but perceive in their own life
   much whereby the light which is in them is darkened, and who might be
   disquieted in conscience, when told that only those who walk in the
   light can stand in fellowship with God who is Light; to them is offered
   the consoling assurance of entire purification from their yet inhering
   sin. But the Apostle guards also against the self-deception of those,
   who trust to purification through the blood of Christ without a course
   of life corresponding to such an expectation, without the outward signs
   of an inward divine fellowship of life through Christ. Only those are
   to expect this purification, who, through the determining tendency of
   their lives, make it manifest that they stand in that divine fellowship
   and are sanctified thereby. Thus the close connection between the
   Christ in us and the Christ for us, is here indicated.

   Ch. i. 8.] But it is the Apostle's aim to meet the mistake on both
   sides; on the one hand, as held by who suppose they may trust to Christ
   those who suppose they may trust to Christ for us, without the Christ
   in us; and on the other, by those who think that with the Christ in us,
   there is no longer need of the Christ for us, and who look upon
   themselves as already free from sin. He therefore continues to urge, in
   opposition to the latter view, the still remaining need of redemption
   on the part of the sanctified: "If we say that we have no sin, we
   deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." If then those who are
   walking in the light, suppose themselves to be already entirely free
   from sin, feel not the perpetual consciousness of its still indwelling
   power; this to John is an indication of self-deception, a token that
   the truth has not yet become the ruling element in the inner and outer
   life. It is clear that he here makes no exception, that he includes
   himself also among those who are still defiled with sin.

   Ch. i. 9, 10.] The two succeeding verses have reference also to the
   believer's ever-continued need of redemption and purification. "If we
   confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and
   to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not
   sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us."

   The ground for the believer's confidence, under this consciousness of
   still inhering sin, is thus presented by the Apostle in the
   faithfulness and righteousness of God. For the faithfulness of God
   includes in itself his truthful fulfilment of the promises which he has
   given. It necessarily implies, that what he has promised he will
   certainly bestow, provided only that believers on their part meet the
   condition affixed to the fulfilment of the promise. By the faithfulness
   of God is meant, the harmony of his action with itself and with his own
   nature. It is implied therein, that Ile will certainly perform what his
   word, his promises, the wants implanted in the soul and waked into
   conscious life by his providence, have taught men to expect from Him;
   that his dealings with men will certainly be in accordance with the
   wants and expectations thus excited; that in his dealings all parts
   will correspond, beginning middle and end will be in harmony; no
   contradiction, no discord in any part. Since then God is truth, it must
   follow as a necessary consequence that, having through his word,
   through the sending of the Redeemer and his sufferings for humanity,
   through the influence of his spirit upon their hearts, promised
   forgiveness of sin to those who believe; he will assuredly suffer
   nothing of this to fail, he will fulfil the promise which he has given,
   if they will but conform to the conditions with which the promise is
   connected. But righteousness is here conjoined with faithfulness. This
   might at first seem strange. We should rather expect that forgiveness
   of sins would be represented as an act of divine love and mercy. But we
   must here seek for a relation, according to which forgiveness of sin
   can properly be ascribed to the divine righteousness. The true index to
   the Apostle's meaning is found in the union here of faithfulness with
   righteousness. Righteousness, then, must here be understood in a sense
   akin to faithfulness. Now we call him righteous who gives to each one
   his own, to each his due, what his position, the relation in which he
   stands to the other, give the right to expect. God's righteousness is
   manifested in the observance of the laws which he has himself
   established in the moral world. Its office is the administration of
   these laws. Redemption, the forgiveness of sin, is indeed primarily the
   work of divine love; yet, that provision being once brought about
   through his love and mercy, the divine righteousness now reveals itself
   in the observance of the laws, according to which redemption and
   forgiveness are to be bestowed on man,--in the administration of the
   order established in the work of redemption. God, the Righteous, gives
   to each what belongs to him; he truly performs what the redeemed, as
   such, have reason to expect of him under the given conditions. The
   original provision is the fruit of divine love; the administration of
   its established laws, the work of divine righteousness. Hence, in this
   view, the divine righteousness stands in close relation to the divine
   faithfulness; and is the pledge that if the redeemed fulfil the laws,
   the conditions, according to which and under which forgiveness is to be
   imparted, God will truly bestow on them the forgiveness promised, will
   complete what he has begun, that he will do his part if the redeemed do
   theirs.

   The condition to be fulfilled on the part of the believer, is expressed
   in the words: "If we confess our sins." Of course it is not an outward
   confession of sin which is here spoken of, but an inward act, grounded
   in the whole inward direction of the spirit; as that which is thereby
   to be appropriated and received, that for which man is thereby to be
   made meet, is also something purely inward. It is therefore that inward
   confession of sin before God,--the consciousness of sin both in,
   general, and in its manifestation in particular sinful acts,--whereby,
   in a spiritual sense, man draws near to God. In this it is necessarily
   implied, that he is deeply penetrated with the sense of still inhering
   sin; recognizes the sinful as such in all its single forms; and with a
   deep feeling of sorrow on account of it, begs of God forgiveness of sin
   and purification from all remaining sinful tendency. All communications
   of God to man,--man, to whom God imparts himself not after a law of
   natural necessity, not by a process of constraint, but as to a being
   gifted with freedom,--are conditioned on his own voluntary acceptance,
   the free surrender of himself to the divine communication. As in the
   words of our Lord, God is represented as giving only to those who pray
   (and prayer is nothing else than this direction of the spirit towards
   God in the feeling of personal want) so here, confession of sin is made
   the necessary condition of that gift of God, which consists in the
   forgiveness of sin, as evidence of the free appropriating acceptance of
   the blessing. With forgiveness of sin is here conjoined the cleansing
   from all unrighteousness. This would not have been added, unless
   something new, something additional, were to be designated by it; as
   indicated by the emphatic expression: "from all unrighteousness." We
   cannot but perceive that a distinction is here made between forgiveness
   of sin, and the progressive work of purification from all remaining
   sin. With the forgiveness of past sin, is necessarily connected
   purification from all the sin which still remains, as a security
   against relapse into like sins.

   To that affirmative proposition, the negative is now added. With the
   confession of sin is contrasted the boastful declaration, and of course
   the inward view and feeling which dictates it: "We have no sin." This
   implies first, that he who says it is wholly unconscious of still
   inhering sin, that he regards himself as sinless. In this again two
   things are included, viz. first, that he has no understanding of what
   is implied in a sinless state, of the true nature of that holiness for
   which man was created, and for which lie is to be new created, to be
   born again; and that he has not rightly compared himself with that
   standard which he is required to reach, has not examined and tested
   himself by the model of the divine word, in the mirror of the divine
   law, in the divine light. And secondly, it is implied that he does not
   recognize the sinful as such in its particular acts, but has learnt to
   palliate it to himself, to deceive his conscience in regard to it. The
   guilt and the perverseness of such a position is now represented by the
   Apostle as consisting in this, viz. that it makes God a liar; that is,
   by such a position we show that we regard God as a liar, we deny him as
   the God of truth. First, inasmuch as the word of God uniformly
   represents us as sinners, and seeks to awaken in us a consciousness of
   our sins; we, by declaring that we have no sin, accuse the word of God,
   and God himself speaking through it, of falsehood. Secondly, since God
   in sending to us Jesus as the Redeemer from sin, has thereby declared
   that we are ever in need of continued redemption; we make him guilty of
   a lie,--asserting by this position of ours, that although it is through
   Christ we have attained to our present state of religious development,
   yet as being now sinless, we are no longer in need of him as Redeemer.
   Hence the Apostle charges upon such, that the word of God is not in
   them; an expression equivalent to the former declaration, that the
   truth is not in them. By it is meant, that the word of God does not
   dwell in such as the animating principle of their inner life, or that
   they do not dwell in it; which is one with saying that the truth dwells
   not in them as their life-element, that their life is alienated from
   the truth. Though in their external profession they acknowledge the
   word of God, they have not given it an abode in their inner life and
   consciousness. Their judgment of themselves is in contradiction to it.
   The word of God is to them a merely external thing.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II.

   Ch. ii. 1.] THE Apostle now turns to those for whose sake he writes, as
   a father to his children. Addressing them personally as his children,
   he presses home upon their hearts a spiritual father's admonitory
   words: "My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
   not." The expression, "these things," glances back to that main topic
   which had been his starting-point, viz. that it is only while walking
   in the light, that we can be certain of that divine fellowship of life
   bestowed through Christ. But with this all that follows is connected,
   and to all this the expression has reference. All which he had said to
   them respecting the sin still cleaving to the christian, and of the
   progressive redemption from it for which they may hope, has had for its
   aim, not to make them lenient towards their own sins, but on the
   contrary to excite them to a continued and unwearied conflict with sin.
   In order to apprehend and apply the admonition to abstain from sin, as
   understood by the Apostle after the law of Christ, our conception of
   the nature of sin, of what sin is, must be very different from that
   derived from the superficial moral judgment of the world. For this it
   is requisite that, trying ourselves by that higher standard, we should
   learn to detect what is sinful in our own life in order that we may
   overcome and avoid it; and as the source of the needed resolution,
   confidence; and alacrity for this, is presupposed the sense of divine
   forgiveness, and reliance upon the divinely purifying power of the work
   of redemption. Thus we perceive how all that precedes, starting from
   that central thought, serves as a basis for the exhortation, "That we
   sin not."

   That connection, which we have noticed, is always present to the
   Apostle in the light of his christian self-knowledge and his knowledge
   of man. Hence, to the unconditional exhortation to sin not, he is
   constrained to add a ground of consolation to those, who, while
   honestly striving against sin have yet fallen under temptation, and who
   might thereby become wholly unsettled in regard to the work of their
   salvation, and be driven to despair. Another would have given this the
   adversative form: But if any one sin. In the style, however, of the
   undialectic and unrhetorical John, there is no occasion to change the
   connective word; as in many cases where another, Paul for instance,
   would have made this change, with him the simple "and" suffices for all
   the relations of his several propositions to one another.

   Ch. ii. 1, 2.] Accordingly he says: "And if any man sin, we have an
   advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the
   propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins
   of the whole world." To those who are weighed down by consciousness of
   the sin still cleaving to them, and of defeat in conflict with it, John
   thus extends the cheering assurance of a mediator with the Father in
   Heaven. This mediator is Jesus Christ the Righteous, that is, the Holy;
   righteousness here being taken in its highest and absolute sense,
   namely, as what is right, what is as it should be, what corresponds to
   the idea of moral perfectness. He bids them, after having once attained
   to repentance for that still inhering sin, not to abandon themselves to
   the fruitless anguish of despair, not to consume themselves in a
   perpetual brooding over their sins; but on the contrary, to turn with
   full confidence to Him who is their everlasting advocate with the
   Father, Jesus Christ the Holy.

   When man, having become conscious of the chasm, between himself in his
   sin and imperfection and the holy and perfect God, sinks under the
   feeling of separation and estrangement from that Being towards whom his
   higher nature strives to rise; there then awakens in him the want of a
   mediation, by which this chasm may be filled. Hence, in all religions,
   the founding of a priesthood, the recognition of a mediating agency
   between God and man, to whom he may address his prayers when he
   ventures not to turn immediately to God. There is, however, in every
   such human priesthood this inherent inconsistency, that they who are
   themselves sinful and in need of redemption like all other men, should
   undertake for others the mediation which they themselves need in common
   with them. Thus, the undeniable want which lies at the foundation of
   the priesthood universally, in connection with its insufficiency to
   meet that want, becomes a prophetic indication of Him who alone can
   truly satisfy it; of Him through whom the idea of a priesthood, so
   deeply grounded in the nature of man, found its realization, and with
   it all previous forms of priesthood their final end. This relation of
   Christ, to God and to humanity, is the especial object of the Epistle
   to the Hebrews. As man, he is in all respects akin to those who seek
   his aid, has partaken of their nature with all its necessities, all its
   infirmities, sin excepted; has himself experienced all their conflicts
   and temptations, and in all has approved himself as The Holy. Only as
   the Holy, as the realization of the holy archetype of humanity, can he
   stand as the substitute of sinners before the Father in Heaven.

   This is not to be so understood, as if the forgiveness of the sins of
   believers were something yet to be obtained by the intercession of
   Christ. There is presupposed here, as appears from the immediately
   following connection, that redemption, that reconciliation of man with
   God, which was effected once for all through the holy life and the
   sufferings of Christ. Jesus Christ, as The Holy, is here contemplated
   in connection with his whole work accomplished on earth, wherein he
   manifested himself especially as The Holy One,--in the connection of
   his present life with God and previous life on earth. There is also
   presupposed, as already existing, that entirely new relation to God
   into which those are brought who are reconciled to Him through Christ.
   It is not said: We have an advocate with God, but with the Father;
   indicating that filial relation of believers to God as their Father,
   whom they have first been taught through Christ to know and honor as
   such. In it is included the permanency of this once established
   relation, as something not again to be unsettled, so long as the
   believer abides in this fellowship with Christ, so long as his faith
   continues steadfast. Only where it has already suffered disturbance,
   must the direction of the eye to Christ, by whom it was established,
   revive again the living consciousness of this relation.

   There is thus presupposed, in this perpetual advocacy of Christ, that
   which he has once for all wrought out for the human race. But this too,
   is represented as something which shall continue working in divine
   power, until it has accomplished its final aim, the complete redemption
   and purification of man already reconciled to God through
   Christ,--until the consummation of the kingdom of God. It is clear that
   this divine agency in the ever-progressing work of redemption, is
   necessary even for those who have been thus reconciled to God through
   Christ, and who are conscious of a filial relation to Him as their
   Father. It is made necessary by the frequent disturbances of this
   relation, through the after-workings of that sin from which they have
   been made free. Their christian life can prosper, only when in a
   continued living connection with the original divine foundation on
   which it rests, that common foundation of all which belongs to the
   development of the kingdom of God on earth.

   But when we speak of the still operative power of the work of
   redemption, Awe are not to understand by this, merely the influence
   exerted by some past transaction upon the development of humanity, and
   of individuals who yield themselves to it, irrespective of the personal
   influence of him by whom that work was wrought; as though the sacred
   writer, when speaking, of Christ as the perpetual intercessor, ascribed
   to him by a figure of speech the influences belonging to his once
   completed work. So the still operating influence of any great work,
   once wrought in human history by some master spirit, might be ascribed
   to his continued personal agency; a lively and graphic form of
   conception representing such an one,--for a time at least, until the
   whole aim and purpose of the work shall reach its full completion,--as
   still working on in that which had its origin in him. Thus it might be
   said of Luther, that he still lives and works in that Reformation which
   bears the impress of his own spirit. We might indeed, in such a sense
   as this, speak of Christ the Holy as the intercessor of believers,
   without knowing anything farther of his personality; and even though
   this personality had been a mere transient phenomenon, as regarded by a
   Sabellius, and as it is presented by a certain school, which, though
   totally opposed to Christianity, sometimes assumes its likeness.

   But such a view is entirely at variance with the Apostle's meaning.
   Before his believing eye stands the Living Christ; approved by his
   victorious resurrection from the dead, as the Holy One, over whom death
   could have no power; risen and ascended to an eternal divine life in
   heaven, forever living with the Father in a glorified, divine-human
   personality. This living Christ he contemplates as still carrying on
   his work in person, and with the same holy love with which he labored
   on earth for the reconciliation of sinful man, still continuing to work
   in that glorified state with the Father. In his divine-human
   personality he forms the medium by which the human race, redeemed and
   reconciled to God through him, is brought into union with God as a
   Father. This connection between the living Christ and what he once
   wrought on earth, must therefore never be lost sight of. Thus Christ
   himself, in those last discourses transmitted to us by John, says on
   the one hand, that he will pray the Father in behalf of his disciples,
   and that in answer to his prayers the Father will bestow upon them what
   they need (John xiv. 16); and on the other hand, that he need not pray
   for them, since, by virtue of their connection with him, they are
   themselves already the objects of God's paternal love, already stand in
   a filial relation to Him (John xvi. 26, 27).

   With special emphasis it is here said that Jesus, as The Holy, is the
   advocate of the redeemed, who under the sense of still remaining sill
   direct to him the eye of faith. Christ being the Holy One, having in
   his life on earth given once for all a complete realization of the
   perfect holiness required by the divine Law; this his holiness stands
   forever the offset for all that is still sinful in those who have been
   redeemed by him, and are in fellowship with him. It is in this
   connection with him, as one with him, that they are presented to the
   eye of God. Herein lies the pledge that they also, by virtue of this
   union with him, shall one day be wholly purified from sin; shall be
   like him in perfect holiness, to whom even now, turning away from sin,
   they direct the eye of faith; shall be made holy as he is holy.

   What now is the practical significance of this truth, that Christ the
   Holy is our ever-abiding advocate with the Father? To this perpetual
   mediation through the living Christ, to his ever-abiding priesthood for
   those who are reconciled to God through him, corresponds the
   ever-remaining need of mediation in believers, their constant
   dependence upon the priesthood of Christ, in union with whom they are a
   generation consecrated to God. Under every feeling of sin and
   infirmity, in all their temptations and conflicts, they may securely
   trust in their indissoluble union with this divine-human Personage; who
   himself has felt all their necessities, and is near to them in the
   intimate sympathy of perfect love. Moreover, their whole inward and
   outward christian life, flowing as it does from this sense of continual
   need of redemption, will take its character from this ever-continuing
   mediation of Christ and their own conscious connection therewith.

   The whole christian life, as ordained for the glory of God, must be
   governed by its relation to him; and this relation must everywhere show
   itself to be the fruit of Christ's abiding mediation. To the christian
   consciousness, this will be an ever-present reality. As Christ the Holy
   can alone be, in an absolute sense, the object of divine love and
   complacency; so no other of the human race can be its object, except in
   connection with Christ as the perpetual mediator. Only that wherein
   Christ is found, only that which appears under his glorified image, can
   truly promote the glory of God. The glory, beaming from this heavenly
   relation, will throw its radiance over all the darkness that yet
   remains. Christian piety and all its fruits, must have their root in
   this relation to Christ as mediator. Thus Christ, in that last
   discourse to his disciples of which John has given us the record, says
   that God will bestow upon them the Holy Spirit in answer to his prayer
   (John xiv. 10); that the Father will send the Spirit in his name (John
   xiv. 26); both pointing to this perpetual mediation through Christ. To
   this also refers the prayer in his name, which he so earnestly presses
   upon their hearts in this discourse; the expression "through Christ"
   being, in general, equivalent to "in Christ." All this is thus placed
   in its proper light. In many apostolic expressions, the whole life of
   the church, and of each individual Christian, is represented under the
   figure of a sacrifice well-pleasing to God; a sacrifice which Christ,
   the perpetual mediator, the eternal Priest, offers to his heavenly
   Father. From this connection of christian truth we can also deduce the
   inference, that since everything in the christian life is comprehended
   in this mediation by Christ, and through it receives its consecration;
   so everything human is in like manner to be thereby consecrated and
   sanctified, to be brought into connection with the life of Christ.
   Hence the distinction between worldly and spiritual, holy and profane,
   no longer exists; all this is clone away by the perpetual mediation of
   Christ.

   History teaches us to estimate aright the deep significance of this
   christian truth, here developed from the words of the Apostle. The
   entire dependence of all Christians alike upon this one advocacy, to
   the exclusion of every other, being based upon this truth; we
   accordingly see that whenever it became obscured in the christian
   consciousness, that dependence was again, as in the ante-christian
   period, transferred to a human priesthood and to a multiplicity of
   mediations, and again the distinction between priests and laity,
   between spiritual and secular, found admission. And thus will it ever
   be, when this reference of the religious consciousness in all
   believers, to the one mediation through Christ, is cast into the
   background, is obscured or misunderstood.

   The Apostle has thus shown, that at the basis of the ever-continuing
   mediation by Christ, there lies the reference to what he once wrought
   for the reconciliation of man with God, to that one all-sufficient
   offering of himself. He accordingly now directs attention specially to
   the fact, that He is "the reconciliation for our sins,"--referring to
   that once-accomplished and still abiding and operative work of
   redemption. For he it is through whom man has been made free from sin;
   through whom that sin which pressed down humanity, separating it from
   God and his fellowship, and intercepting the communications of divine
   love, has been taken away, has become as if it were not; so that
   henceforth, all mankind should appear before God as freed from sin by
   this self-offering of Christ,--as in him pure in the sight of God.
   This,--which according to the divine plan, the purposes of divine
   grace, the yearning love of Christ who bore all mankind upon his heart,
   should embrace all,--is realized in those who open their hearts to its
   reception, who believingly appropriate the redeeming grace thus
   offered. It is so realized when they first enter into christian
   fellowship, renouncing the former standpoint of a life of worldliness
   and sin; it is this which marks the boundary between the old and the
   new life. But as John here shows, although this boundary has been once
   fixed, yet in the conflict with the remaining influence of that former
   state, there is still need of the ever-renewed appropriation of this
   reconciliation, which is Christ himself. When this reconciliation, as
   the all-sufficient agency for the progressive and ultimately complete
   sanctification of the redeemed, and the constant appropriation of it as
   such, have ceased to be recognized in their connection and become
   obscured in the christian consciousness,--new methods of atonement and
   purification have then been resorted to, as necessary for sins
   committed after baptism.

   But when John speaks of the reconciliation for our sins, he feels
   constrained to guard against every limitation of the universal
   reference of the work of redemption. He calls to mind such words of
   Christ as those respecting the one fold and the one shepherd, and his
   vision widens to embrace all humanity; to behold in Christ not alone
   the reconciliation for those who already believe, but for those also
   who as yet know nothing of Christ, who as yet belong to the world. The
   reconciliation of Christ has for its object all humanity in its
   estrangement from God; all which belongs to the world, as it stands
   opposed to the kingdom of God. Humanity as a whole is to be embraced in
   the reconciliation with Christ, is to be thereby separated from the
   world and incorporated into the kingdom of God. The reconciliation,
   once instituted by Christ, continues its uninterrupted work until it
   shall have achieved this its glorious consummation. [2]

   Ch. ii. 3.] The Apostle passes continually from one aspect of this
   truth to another. He exhorts them now to confidence in Christ; now
   warns them against discouragement and despair, and now against false
   confidence and carnal security. His admonitions always keep in view
   both directions in which they are liable to go astray. Accordingly he
   here comes back again, to warn them against the false confidence of a
   merely seeming christianity, and to fix attention upon the
   characteristic marks of the true. "And hereby we do know that we know
   him, if we keep his commandments."

   In contrast with a professed "knowing of Christ" which is contradicted
   by the life, John represents this as the sign of a true knowledge of
   Christ, viz. that we obey his commandments. There is indeed a knowledge
   which belongs only to the understanding, and has nothing to do with the
   life; but such, in reference to divine things, could not be admitted by
   John as real; he did not even allow it the name of knowledge. For as
   truth according to his modes of thought is not a mere abstraction,
   belonging solely to the understanding, but is something pertaining to
   the inner life, to the affections; so to him knowledge, in reference to
   divine things, is not merely a matter of speculation and of the
   understanding, but is something proceeding from the inner life, and as
   such must manifest itself in the outward course of conduct. The sum and
   substance of the knowledge must be actually present in the inner life.
   It presupposes an inward fellowship of life with that which is known;
   and this must stamp its own peculiar character upon the whole life. The
   knowledge of Christ, as the Holy One, can only exist where there is
   spiritual fellowship with him, the Holy One; where the soul has
   received into itself his holy image, and has been pervaded by its
   influence. And where this is the case, it must show itself in the whole
   conduct by the test here pointed out, obedience to the commands of
   Christ; for the commands of Christ are inseparable from his own nature,
   from himself. As in all which proceeds from him he but presents
   himself; so his commands are but single features of the new life
   proceeding from him. Thus each one, by subjecting his life to a
   comparison with the commands of Christ, may ascertain whether the
   knowledge of Christ, to which he makes claim, be truth or appearance
   merely. True indeed, John could not admit, as we have before shown,
   that the life of any believer could present an absolutely perfect
   fulfilment of the commands of Christ. He cannot, therefore, so
   understand this test of christian self-knowledge; otherwise the result
   must in every case be unfavorable. But with all the imperfections which
   still encumber the christian life, there yet remains a strongly marked
   distinction between those with whom obedience to Christ's commands is a
   matter of earnest purpose, the current of whose whole life sets in this
   direction; and those to whom the desire to obey him is in no sense the
   soul of their life. Moreover, as different degrees obtain in the true
   and living knowledge of Christ, there will be likewise corresponding
   grades of obedience to the commands of Christ. The touchstone of all
   true religious knowledge, according to this view of John, is the
   practice of it in the life. But as his manner is, he here merely
   contrasts opposites in respect to their essential nature, without
   taking into account any gradations in the outward manifestation. How
   entirely opposed is the standard of judgment here established by John,
   to a one-sided speculative orthodoxy, a conception of truth as
   something merely theoretical, an orthodoxy of the understanding, not of
   the life! Orthodoxy, in the sense of John, is something which belongs
   to the life. How different an aspect would it have given to doctrinal
   controversies, had this stand-point of the Apostle been rightly
   understood and firmly adhered to!

   Ch, ii. 4.] In order to impress the truth more strongly by exhibiting
   it on both sides, John now, in his own peculiar manner, expresses in a
   negative form what he had first presented affirmatively. "He that
   saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the
   truth is not in him."

   In John's view, therefore, there is an inherent inconsistency in
   professing to know Christ, and yet not obeying his commands. One who
   does this he regards as a liar; and declares, as the ground of the
   disposition from which such conduct proceeds, that the truth is not in
   him. We must here apply what we have previously remarked respecting
   John's conception of truth. Plainly he here speaks of truth as
   something which has to do with the disposition, the moral feelings.
   Such an one is represented by John as, in the determining tendency of
   his spirit, in his affections, estranged from the truth; as one in whom
   falsehood is the inwardly ruling principle. He is wanting in honest
   self-examination in relation to divine truth; hence, he does not
   consider what is requisite in order to make such a profession in truth,
   what is involved in the claim of knowing Christ. Thus arises first,
   self-deception, unconscious hypocrisy; and from this proceeds the
   conscious falsehood of seeking to appear more than lie really is.

   Ch. ii. 5.] From the proposition thus expressed in affirmative and
   negative form, John proceeds to draw the inference: "But whoso keepeth
   his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we
   that we are in him." The commands of Christ are here referred back to
   his word, his doctrine in general. For John is not here speaking of
   single isolated moral precepts, but of the word revealed through
   Christ, embracing faith and life in their whole extent; his commands
   being, as we have already remarked, only single features in which his
   life-transforming word is developed. Of one who thus observes this word
   and applies it in practice, the Apostle says that in him the love of
   God has reached its completion; that is, love to God, such as it must
   be to correspond to the idea of love, is existing in him. It forms the
   opposite of such a love to God as cannot be called genuine love; a love
   to God professed in words alone, giving no evidence of itself in
   practice, and contradicted by the course of life. Here also it is
   obvious, that although John only presents these opposites in their
   generic form, yet we are necessarily led to the idea of gradational
   differences in the actual life. Whilst genuine love can manifest itself
   only by obedience to the word of Christ, yet there being differences as
   to the degree in which this love has penetrated the whole life with its
   vitalizing influence, and eradicated whatever is selfish; there will be
   corresponding differences as to the manifestation of its power, in
   obedience to the word of Christ, in the fulfilment of his commands. We
   must constantly bear in mind, that it is not love to God in a merely
   general and indeterminate sense which is here presented, but love to
   God in the christian sense, with all which is necessarily presupposed
   in it as such. It is love to God in connection with the knowledge of
   Christ, and having its source therein; love to God as the Father,
   enkindled by the revelation of the redeeming love of God in Christ.
   John knows indeed of no other love to God. He beholds in man a being
   estranged from God; over whom impends the divine wrath, till succored
   by the redeeming love of God in the sending and sacrifice of his Son.
   It is through this alone that man becomes capable of loving God as a
   Father, and is constrained so to love Him. This love is now the new
   principle of life; is that which, if genuine, must of itself impel him
   who feels it to fulfil the word of Christ, to obey his commands. Thus
   with John, true knowledge of Christ and true love to God are in every
   respect coincident; and the actual life must furnish the test of both.

   Hence he says: "Hereby we know that we are in him." Here the Apostle
   brings to view a state of being, which has its foundation in Christ;
   just as Christ is by Paul represented, as himself the foundation on
   which the whole structure of the Christian life is built, whereon it
   rests. Thus each believer has his life in Christ; its root is spiritual
   fellowship with him. To be a christian and to be in Christ, to be in
   fellowship with him and to live, are in the view of John one and the
   same thing. Christ himself is here the vital principle from which all
   proceeds. Out of him unfolds itself the entire new life. To know
   Christ, to love God as self-revealed in Christ, to be in Christ, these
   are all indissolubly connected, are one and the same; one cannot be
   conceived separate from another. And thus also, as we see, obedience to
   the word, to the commands of Christ, is the test whether one is truly
   in a state of fellowship with Christ.

   Ch. ii. 6.] In the succeeding words, John now more particularly defines
   what is implied in obedience to the commands of Christ: "He that saith
   he abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked."
   To abide in Christ, designates something more than to be in Christ. It
   means, not merely to have entered through faith into fellowship with
   Christ, but also to persevere therein steadfastly; to hold fast, with a
   true heart, what has been once received. It is implied, that there are
   such as have already known Christ for a long time, in whom therefore
   fellowship with Christ must have received a fuller development as the
   animating principle of life And how then is this to make itself known?
   This abiding spiritual fellowship can only manifest itself, through a
   life conformed to him with whom the believer has thus entered into
   fellowship. We find here the confirmation of our previous remark, that
   not a multiplicity of single moral precepts by which one is to regulate
   his outward life is here intended; but the single commands are to be
   understood only as the development and application of an inward law,
   which is to embrace and transform the whole life. There is not meant
   here a law of the letter, like that of the Old Testament, which made
   its claims on men in single commands: "Do this and thou shalt live!"
   But here all refers itself to that new view of the life of holiness,
   whose model is presented to the believer in Christ himself. All single
   moral demands which he makes on men (as for instance, those
   ground-traits of Christianity developed in the sermon on the Mount,
   that Magna Charta of his kingdom) are nothing else than single features
   in which the life of holiness, whose perfect form he first revealed and
   actualized, is presented in contrast with what had been the standard of
   the world. Christ himself is in his commands; and they, on the other
   hand, are but single items of his self-revelation. He utters only that,
   testifies only of that, which he has himself actualized in his life.
   And thus also here, the Apostle speaks not of commands whose
   constraining force is from without, but of the spontaneous result of
   the process by which the new life in Christ is developed. There is
   implied an inward germinating power, which cannot but make itself known
   by such outward signs. If a man truly abide in Christ, then must Christ
   with whom he stands in fellowship, who dwells within him, be also
   reflected in his life which through Christ is formed anew. From the
   contemplation of the life of Christ, there must form itself a new
   course of life in conformity with that holy pattern, an unconstrained
   fulfilment of the commands of Christ. The life of each believer should
   be only a peculiar aspect of the image of Christ, as the great
   archetype of renewed and glorified humanity. Christ himself, assuming
   as his own all that is human, will glorify it in believers who live in
   fellowship with Him; the One Christ presenting himself in manifold
   forms of manifestation. And thus, on the conformity of the life to the
   model of Christ, must depend the proof whether the claim of being in
   fellowship with Christ is founded in truth.

   Ch. ii. 7.] As we have before seen, it is not John's object to propound
   anything new to the churches, but to awaken them to a living sense of
   that which had always constituted the burden of his instructions; to
   guide them in the right application of that which they already knew.
   What he had always held up before them as the one command of the Lord,
   the sum. and substance of all other commands; as the foundation whereon
   rested the essential nature of practical Christianity; this is what he
   would have them lay to heart anew, and this he introduces with a new
   personal address: "Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but
   an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment
   is the word which ye have heard from the beginning."

   We here find confirmation of what we have before remarked, viz. that
   although John speaks of commandments in the plural, yet he does not
   mean a number of single commands; for he here refers them all back to
   that One, which is itself no new commandment, but has been known to
   them from the first proclamation of the Gospel, and is here designated
   as the Word which they have heard from the beginning. We are not to
   understand by it merely the word as preached by John himself in these
   churches, but also as made known to them by the Apostle Paul. It was
   still, although in different forms, the same word which had ever been
   preached to them and received by them; and this preached word had for
   its central point that one command.

   We shall now be able, of ourselves, to perceive what John means by this
   one command. It is the command which Christ bequeathed as his last
   legacy to his disciples,--the token by which they should be recognized
   as such,--after he had instituted the holy supper as the pledge and the
   symbolic seal of his own ever-continued fellowship with them, and of
   their consequent mutual fellowship with one another; the command
   namely, that they should exercise towards each other the same
   self-sacrificing love which Christ had manifested for them, and would
   continue to manifest even unto the end. (John xiii. 34, 35). He himself
   (John xv. 10, ff.), sums up all single commands in this "new
   commandment," as he there terms it, in what sense we shall presently
   consider. From all this it is evident, that the Apostle cannot here be
   speaking of single isolated commands, in the sense in which they are so
   regarded from the standpoint of the Law. For this Love is not a thing
   to be enjoined by an outward law,--is not a thing to be placed as a
   single command side by side with others. Love is something which can be
   produced only from within, which manifests its presence in the living
   spirit as an inward necessity, which contains in itself the impulse to
   all good and makes all other commands superfluous. The aim of all
   others is embraced within the scope of this, and in it are they all
   fulfilled; in the words of Paul, "Love is the fulfilling of the Law."
   It springs unconstrained, from the inward experience of redemption,
   from fellowship with Christ, and from the new moral bent of life
   grounded therein.

   Ch. ii. 8.] Yet, after having designated it thus as the old command, he
   adds: "Again, a new commandment I write unto you." Thus, what he had
   just enjoined upon them as old, may now it seems to him, in another
   aspect, be presented as new. But in what sense both old and new? This
   might be explained from the relation of the new dispensation to the
   old, in which view Christ calls this the new command, the
   characteristic feature of the new dispensation, whose sealing was set
   forth in the Last Supper. It was the old command as standing already at
   the head of the ten commandments; it was the new command as actualized
   and made new by Christ's self-sacrificing love for his brethren,
   especially by the sacrifice of his life for them. Thus
   illustrated,--love after this pattern of Christ, ready to offer up all
   for a brother's sake,--as such it is the new command.

   True, nothing was enjoined by it which might not have been found in the
   old command: "Love thy neighbor as thyself." For the expression "as
   thyself," properly understood, can have reference only to the true
   Self, which, from the nature of the case, cannot be made an offering
   for others; which must, on the contrary, be the gainer by all the deeds
   of self-sacrificing love,--only in them, indeed, can find its own
   completion. And hence, in this love of our neighbor as ourself, might
   be included that unreserved, all-sacrificing love for others. But it
   lay therein only as a might-be, not yet expressed, not developed, not
   known as a living principle. Nor was this effected till Christ, by the
   devotion of his whole life crowned by that final act of his death, gave
   the example of such a love, and in anticipation of that closing act
   gave it expression in words. In such a sense it might be called new;
   new as having not before been so understood, and new in relation to the
   Old Testament. It might be called new, moreover, as being now freed
   from all which checked its development under the old dispensation, as
   being made henceforth the sum and centre of all. As belonging in the
   germ to the Old Testament, it could be designated as the old command;
   as developed into new glory by Christ, it might be called the new.

   But though such a distinction is in itself admissible, yet had it been
   what John intended to express here, it would certainly have been more
   clearly and definitely stated. There is, on the contrary, in the whole
   connection, no hint of such a distinction based upon the relation of
   the New to the Old Testament. It could only be so understood, if in
   what precedes, the designation, old' were applied to what believers had
   already learned from the Old Testament. But, as we have seen, it is
   here applied to what is old in respect to themselves and their present
   christian stand-point; old to them as being the same which they have
   heard from the first announcement of the Gospel. When, therefore, this
   same command is urged upon them as new, we may infer that it is to be
   taken in the same reference, viz. to the state of the church itself. In
   respect to the whole period since it was first made known to them, it
   might be called old; in another respect, that of the change supposed
   since then to have taken place in them, in respect to their having
   themselves become new, it might be called the new command. In respect
   to the religious development of the church itself, it might in one
   aspect be called old, in the other, new. This conclusion is confirmed
   by what follows, in which the Apostle's view is brought out still more
   clearly.

   The succeeding words refer to this fact, that the command can now be
   presented as something new: "Which thing is true in him and in you." He
   means to say: It is true in reference both to Christ and the
   church,--that is, in reference to their mutual relation to each
   other,--that the old command has become to them a new one, something
   new in their christian experience. In what respect this holds true, is
   explained by the words which follow: "For the darkness is past and the
   true light now shineth." John here makes a comparison between a
   present, new condition of the church and a former one; and from this we
   see how it is that the old command, the expression of what was peculiar
   in the nature of Christianity, should now be presented to them as new.
   It is a comparison of their present condition,--as they had already
   long been christians, and Christianity therefore should have become so
   much the more their life-element,--with that of their spiritual
   childhood when Christianity was as yet a new thing to them. Life, apart
   from Christianity, as it belongs to a world estranged from God, is in
   itself and with all its results regarded by the Apostle as the kingdom
   of darkness; its opposite being the divine light of Christianity, and
   all that flows from it. When he says "the true light," he means by
   "true," according to the import of the Greek term, what in the highest
   and fullest sense corresponds to the idea. With him "the true," when
   used with a word applicable both to what is divine and to objects of
   sense, means only and always the divine. It is implied, that the word
   is applicable to the physical only in a subordinate sense; and at that
   lower stage of being is but an imperfect symbol, a mere image of that.,
   which, in the highest and fullest sense with reference to the spirit of
   man, can be predicated only of the divine. Thus, for example, the true
   food for man is only that which nourishes the spirit to divine life,
   bearing the same relation to the true life of the spirit, as food in
   the lower realm of sense to the life of the body. Thus too, John
   contemplates Christ as himself the true light, holding the same
   relation to the spiritual as the sun to the natural life. What he here
   says then is this: With those who have been so long attached to
   Christianity, the darkness proceeding from their former heathen state
   is passing away, and the true light is now breaking. "Now," he
   says,--meaning their present in contrast with their former state of
   heathenism, or while still affected by its remaining influence. The
   light derived from Christ, the true light, was already banishing the
   former darkness, they were becoming constantly more and more
   enlightened. So Paul says to his readers (Rom. xiii. 11 ff.) that now
   their salvation is nearer than when they believed, that the end of the
   night approaches, the day of the Lord draws near. It is therefore
   true,--both with reference to Christ, the true light which has dawned
   upon their souls, and with reference to believers who have received
   this light and been illuminated thereby, that this fundamental law of
   Christianity now verifies its character as the new command. To those
   who live in the light of Christ, who have become at home in the new
   world of Christianity, the old command must now, in contrast with the
   former state of darkness, present itself in new glory as the new
   command. In new power must it be revealed to their hearts, that
   brotherly love constitutes the essence of the christian life, is the
   essential mark of fellowship with Christ.

   Ch. ii. 9.] That the injunction to christian brotherly love is here
   meant by the new command, is implied in the succeeding words, which
   indicate the close connection between that assumed state of the church,
   that living in the light, and the exercise of brotherly love; as, in
   like manner, by darkness is designated the opposite of this love, viz.
   selfishness, which excludes love, which begets hate,--the
   characteristic mark of the life of darkness. "He that saith he is in
   the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now."

   With John, as will readily be perceived, the expressions "being in the
   light," being in fellowship with Christ as the true light, being
   enlightened by him, and being a christian, all mean the same thing;
   just as, on the other hand, "being in darkness," being shut out from
   Christ the true light, and belonging to the ungodly world, all have the
   same meaning. He who claims to be a christian, and hates him whom he
   should love as a brother, proves thereby, that however long he may have
   professed Christianity, he is in truth as far from it as ever. That
   spirit of hatred towards his brother is a sure token, that he has never
   yet become a partaker of the divine light; that the darkness of the
   world, the same spirit which governs the God-estranged world, still
   reigns in him. Not inwardly, but only outwardly, seemingly, has he
   renounced the world. The light of Christ has not yet risen in his soul;
   for this cannot co-exist with such a temper of mind.

   Now it is worthy of note, that John makes but this one distinction: He
   that hateth his brother, and he that loveth his brother. He recognizes
   no intermediate state, which, while it is indeed far from
   self-sacrificing love, is far also from hatred of the brethren. This is
   John's peculiar manner; viz. without regarding intermediate steps and
   gradations in opposite moral states, to seize upon the radical point of
   difference, and thus contrast them in their essential nature and
   principle. And with full reason. For either love, to the exclusion of
   the selfish element, is the animating principle; or self is made the
   centre of all, and selfishness governs. Now in this selfishness, the
   opposite of brotherly love, inheres the tendency which, when
   consistently carried out, allows place to nothing that interferes with
   self-interest, and regards every one who comes in conflict therewith as
   an enemy, to be removed out of the way. Accordingly, in these opposite
   dispositions, viewed strictly with reference to their radical elements,
   we find only Love to the brethren, or Hatred of the brethren; love,
   which is ready for every sacrifice, or selfishness, which may also pass
   into hate. So Christ recognizes but two distinctions,--serving God, and
   serving the world.

   Ch. ii. 10.] Hence John says on the other hand: "He that loveth his
   brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in
   him." This characteristic token of brotherly love, must show whether we
   are abiding in the light. He who manifests in his life such a
   self-sacrificing love, reveals therein the power of divine light,
   whereby he has been made free from the former darkness of selfishness.
   As the life of Christ was the essence of all-sacrificing love, so
   fellowship with him is reflected in a similar life of love. We learn
   from the testimony of the Church Fathers, the Apologists of
   Christianity in the first centuries, that even the heathen saw in this
   fellowship of brotherly love the unmistakeable characteristic of the
   new christian life. "They love one another, even before they know each
   other!" were the words applied to christians, distinguishing them from
   the heathen world as governed by hate. Of one in whom. brotherly love
   thus prevails John says, that with him there is no stumbling. This
   might be understood as follows,--a view which seems clearly to be at
   the basis of Luther's translation,--"he who is so heavenly-minded,
   gives to another no cause of stumbling, no offence." And this is
   without doubt true, that the love which has only the best good of
   others in view, and is willing to sacrifice all rather than subject
   another to what is hurtful, will avoid everything which might in any
   way offend his moral feeling as a religious being, and thus become a
   means of spiritual injury to him. We need only call to mind what Paul,
   in the first Epistle to the Corinthians, says of christian love towards
   the weak. But although the words, taken by themselves, might be so
   understood, yet the consistency of the figurative representation, and
   the contrast with the following verse, requires another sense. The
   image is that of a man walking in the light, who is therefore safe from
   all danger of stumbling or falling. Accordingly it means: There is with
   him no stumbling, he himself stumbles not. As one who walks in the
   light of day sees his path clearly, and avoids everything over which he
   might stumble and fall; so does he who walks in the light of the
   spirit, pass with secure step along life's way. In this divine light he
   beholds the goal of his course, and the path which leads thither,
   clearly before him; and he is able to avoid everything which might be
   prejudicial to the interests of his christian life, to his salvation.
   Love, in John's view, is that which gives this security to the
   believer; Love is the soul of this walking in the light. Love bestows
   that true clearness of spiritual vision, by which the believer pursues
   his way securely to the goal; the circumspection, the true wisdom,
   necessary to shun every obstacle and danger in the accomplishment of
   the life-task which God has set before him. Love bestows that ready
   instinct, which knows at every instant how to turn circumstances to
   their right use, to distinguish in all cases between right and wrong.
   Love imparts true repose, wards off the influence of passion which
   would disturb the calm judgment of the spirit, keeps the soul steadily
   towards its one object, and secures it from all distracting influences.
   Thus, in every respect, is verified the Apostle's assertion, that he
   who loves his brother cannot stumble.

   Ch. ii. 11.] From this follows the opposite conclusion, in reference to
   those in whom not love but hate is the governing principle. Of such
   John says: " But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh
   in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness
   hath blinded his eyes."

   John here makes a distinction, between being in darkness and walking in
   darkness. The one respects the cause, the other the effect; the one the
   disposition, the other the course of life resulting from it. He who is
   wanting in the animating principle of brotherly love, and in whom
   hatred is the ruling power, being in a state of spiritual darkness can
   therefore only walk in darkness; as he to whom the illuminating light
   of the sun is wanting, or who from disease of the eyes cannot perceive
   it, wanders about in darkness, unable to distinguish the goal which he
   is seeking or the path which conducts to it. Just so it is with him who
   is under the dominion of selfishness, and of hatred. He cannot perceive
   the heavenly goal towards which the christian life is tending, nor the
   way thither. In respect to these he is as one who is blind. He can form
   no definite plan of life. Destitute of that clearness and collectedness
   of spirit, necessary in older to direct his course with steady purpose
   towards a well-ascertained end, he is every moment losing his way; his
   selfish impulses hurry him hither and thither; his whole course is an
   aimless, confused, inconstant effort he knows not why or whither.

   Love to christian brethren and its opposite is primarily intended here,
   as it is by Christ also in his last discourses. But while love is here
   conceived of at its highest point, and in its most immediate sphere
   where its full power and glory can best unfold; yet this by means
   excludes the universal love of man, which from the very nature of the
   case is included in christian love. It need not be specially mentioned;
   since in christian Brotherly love itself is imparted the yearning
   desire to draw all men within this fraternal sphere, to convert them
   all into brethren. For to this they are destined by virtue of their
   common origin, of the common image of God in all, and of the redemption
   provided for all; and Christ himself, he who gave his life for his
   enemies that he might make them brethren and children of God, is in
   this self-sacrificing love their model. It is the nature of love, in
   the christian sense, to efface all limitations and distinctions.

   Ch. ii. 12.] As exhortation and promise always go hand in hand in this
   epistle, John now, after having shown what belongs to the nature of the
   Christian life, addresses them again as their spiritual Father, in
   order to cheer their hearts under the sense of unlikeness to this life,
   under the sense of sin. lie calls to them all as his children: "I write
   unto you little children, because [that] your sins are forgiven you for
   his name's sake." He comforts them with the assurance of sins forgiven
   through the mediation of Christ. For the name of Christ are their sins
   forgiven; that is, for the sake of what Christ is as the Son of God and
   the Son of Man, the divine-human Redeemer,--it being as such that they
   invoke Him as their Mediator. There is reference here to what he had
   before said of the reconciliation effected by Christ.

   Ch. ii. 13.] He now proceeds to remind them of what belongs to their
   high estate as Christians. What he would say applies indeed to the
   whole church collectively. But turning with affectionate familiarity to
   the various ages in the church, he addresses to each exactly what is
   most appropriate to it. Thus the fathers, the young men, and the
   children, are each particularly addressed in the words: "I write unto
   you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I
   write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I
   write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father."

   The Gospel announcement, beginning with the appearance of Christ in
   time, proceeded on to the knowledge of the depths of his divine nature;
   rising above the temporal manifestation to him who was from the
   beginning, to the eternal, divine Word who had appeared in the Son of
   Man. This knowledge presupposes a higher stage of christian
   development, a longer intimacy with christianity, and this therefore is
   especially ascribed to the fathers in the church. But we must not
   forget, moreover, in what sense John uses knowledge. He means by it, as
   we have seen, no mere theoretical knowledge proceeding from the
   understanding, but a knowledge which has its origin in the life, which
   presupposes a fellowship of life with the object of knowledge, and
   which again re-acts upon the life. It is that higher and deeper
   knowledge of Christ, as He who was from the beginning, proceeding from
   a more intimate living union with the person of Christ. This is
   something more than the statement of a certain dogmatic formula
   respecting the person of Christ.

   Turning now to the young men of the church, John applies to them what
   is especially adapted to their age. Youth is formed for conflict; the
   bold champions are from its ranks. In childhood, the elements of inward
   conflict still lie hidden and undeveloped. It knows not, at that age of
   unconscious innocence, what germs of evil it carries in its bosom,
   slumbering yet in the depths of its undeveloped being, and the peace of
   a childish faith still rules in the heart. But in the transition from
   childhood to youth, these, hidden contrarieties burst forth. Desires
   and passions awake in their might, and strive against the higher law of
   the spirit. The natural reason, now becoming conscious of itself,
   asserts its claims, and calls in question what at first had been
   received with simple, childlike faith. On every hand breaks forth the
   hitherto unconscious and concealed discord in the twofold law of man's
   nature. Here now is need of conflict, in order that the divine seed,
   implanted during a childhood developed under the influence of
   christianity, (for John here supposes a church long established in
   christian truth) may be preserved uncorrupt, may be individually
   appropriated, and matured to fruit. But the christian youth must
   maintain the conflict; that through the conflict he may regain as a
   conscious personal possession that peace, which, in the period of early
   childhood, was imbibed unconsciously from the influence of
   christianity, in whose heavenly elements of life it had unfolded.
   Youth, called in the freshness of its power to conflict, must not shun
   the strife. In that divine seed implanted in a christian childhood,
   youth has that which renders victory in all those conflicts certain,
   provided only it is faithfully applied. Hence John does not say: Ye
   will overcome the evil one, that power in the evil one, which in all
   those respects arrays itself in opposition to the divine; but he says:
   Ye have overcome. He has in view such as, from childhood up, have been
   developed in fellowship with the Redeemer; and as He has triumphed once
   for all over the power of evil, his victory has thus become their own.
   Not with their own weak powers, not in reliance upon their own
   strength, do they maintain the warfare. Through faith in the Redeemer,
   who has overcome the power of evil, have they already conquered. And,
   in faith towards him their Redeemer, in fellowship with him, to
   appropriate through his strength his victory to themselves, this is to
   maintain the conflict. Christ, the victor over the power of Satan and
   of the world, strives and conquers in them; they strive and conquer as
   his instruments. The christian life, though in its nature always one
   and the same, yet develops itself in successive stages, each having its
   peculiar standpoint. John accordingly contemplates youth as especially
   the season of conflict. The entire christian life is, indeed, a copy of
   Christ's own unremitted and ever-deepening conflict till it closed in
   that last cry: "It is finished." It must therefore be an ever-renewed
   conflict, till its last death-struggle ends in eternal peace. Still he
   regarded youth as especially the season of conflict; a conflict,
   however, which to the christian is immediately transformed to victory.

   Finally, he turns to the age of childhood. The relationship of parent
   and child is the one most familiar to children; and filial love,
   therefore, furnishes the most easy and natural point of attachment for
   love to the eternal Father in Heaven. Accordingly, to the children of
   christian families, who from the first had learned in faith toward the
   Redeemer to know God as their Father; who had been nurtured into the
   filial relation to him as Father; to such he says, that they have known
   the Father. The term KNOW, we remark again, must of course be
   understood here in the sense peculiar to John.

   Ch. ii. 14.] As we naturally repeat what we earnestly desire to impress
   upon others, John now reiterates what he has just said, with some
   additions serving to illustrate and enforce it, and to prepare the way
   for the exhortation which is to follow. He had already said,--I write
   unto you; and he now repeats, emphatically, what he had just written.
   "I have written unto you," he adds, as much as to say: There let it
   stand! That which I write unto you, is now written. It is final.
   Nothing other have I to say to you; this you must receive, as said to
   you once for all. "I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have
   known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young
   men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye
   have overcome the wicked one."

   It must be for a special reason, that John satisfies himself with a
   single address to the children; while he feels it necessary to enforce
   by repetition what h he has said to those of maturer age, with whom
   more is depending upon their own personal agency. To what he had first
   said to the youth, he here adds something more; as in their case it
   might be needful to show How they had overcome the Evil One. It is
   superior strength by which victory is attained; and consciousness of
   strength is natural to youth. But this is apt to be connected with
   self-confidence, now first developed into activity, with a conscious
   ability to meet all dangers, to overcome all hindrances, to triumph
   over all enemies in one's own strength. But this self-confidence and
   self-reliance, will, if unsustained by strength from a higher source,
   soon fail in the conflicts of life and be put to shame. The Apostle
   directs them to another ground of confidence, another source of
   strength. While he reminds the young that they are strong, he at the
   same time indicates whence this strength is to be derived, wherein it
   must have its root, viz. that divine word already received by them and
   faithfully adhered to and applied by them; that word, fast rooted in
   their hearts and abiding there as an ineradicable principle. In the
   divine word, therefore, whose vitalizing power is the life of their
   spirit, lies their strength. Already, through the might of this divine
   word, have they virtually overcome the power of evil; in this word,
   which no other power can withstand, is the victory given them. We may
   translate, "abideth among you," or "abideth in you." The sense is the
   same. It cannot abide among them collectively, unless it has been
   received individually into the heart.

   Ch. ii. 15.] Having thus indicated all which believers need, in order
   to maintain successfully the conflict with the world, the Apostle
   concludes with the following exhortation: "Love not the world, neither
   the things that are in the world."

   These words have been often misunderstood, as if requiring for the
   perfection of the Christian life a withdrawal from the world, and from
   all worldly concerns. Manifold errors have arisen from this
   misapprehension, which is far from the meaning of the apostolic
   injunction. The New Testament assumes in all its teachings, that the
   world and all that is in it, as proceeding from God's creative hand
   exists only for his service and glory, which is the aim and end of the
   whole creation. Man, as the image of God, should have it for his
   highest his single aim, to actualize this purpose of the whole creation
   with a free and conscious will; to so use the world that all things,
   each in its own way, shall subserve this purpose. Through the
   redemption, and the new creation proceeding therefrom, man was to
   become competent thus to use all things; as Christ did not withdraw
   himself from the world and worldly things, but by his mastery over them
   glorified God in the most perfect manner. The Apostle requires only
   this: that God should be the single object of man's unconditional love.
   No other love may take place beside it; but this unconditional love
   must wholly rule the soul and. the life, must make all else subordinate
   to itself. As Christ says (Matt. vi. 21), "Where your treasure is,
   there will your heart be also." The object of man's unconditional love,
   whatever it may be, decides the whole direction and character of his
   life, and imparts its own peculiar stamp to all his actions. Now love
   to God must demonstrate its power, by giving to the world and all that
   is in it a reference to God, by using it to his glory. All other love
   is not thereby excluded, but on the contrary, is embraced in it. Every
   object of affection is to be regarded with, a love, proportioned to the
   place assigned it by God in the creation,--a love developing itself out
   of love to God. It is the nature of true love to God, not to withdraw
   from the world and worldly things; but in accordance with the purpose
   assigned to them by God, to use all to his glory. It is only a love to
   the world for its own sake, a love not proceeding from God and
   referring all to him, which the Apostle here forbids. It is the world,
   as the object of such a love, of which the Apostle here speaks; and it
   is this which he represents as standing opposed to the love of God.

   In this sense he says: "If any man love the world, the love of the
   Father is not in him." It is in this sense therefore we are to
   understand the assertion, that love to the world excludes the love of
   the Father. That God is truly known and loved as Father, can show
   itself only in this, viz. that our estimation and use of all worldly
   things is determined solely by this principle of filial love to God.
   Nothing can stand side by side with this love; all else must be
   subordinated to it, must be derived from it, must be grounded in it.
   Whatever claims to stand beside this love, must be opposed to it. It is
   of such an opposition the Apostle here speaks.

   Ch. ii. 16.] John now proceeds to exhibit that general contrariety,
   between the direction towards God and that towards the world, under
   three separate forms in which the love of the world manifests itself;
   and this he does in such a manner, that the particular appears as the
   confirmation of the more general. "For all that is in the world, the
   lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is
   not of the Father, but is of the world." When the Apostle here
   represents the world as opposed to the Father, that which is of the
   world to that which is of the Father; he does not mean the world in
   itself, which he regards as the work of God, but in a moral view, as
   connected in his mind with that tendency of the soul which cleaves to
   the world, seeking therein its own highest good. and sundering it from
   connection with God. "The world" here designates the ruling tendency of
   the spirit towards the world, the entire amalgamation of the spirit
   with it. So also, in particular, it is not the things of the world in
   themselves of which he speaks, but only as that general direction of
   the spirit attaches itself to them, manifests itself in them,
   identifies itself with them. This, therefore, is his meaning: all those
   single forms of worldly-mindedness, with whatever objects of the world
   they may stand connected, proceed from the same radical tendency, the
   amalgamation of the spirit with the world, and are opposed to that
   tendency which proceeds from the heavenly Father

   He now adduces three such forms, in which at that time the worldly
   spirit chiefly manifested itself, and against which christians needed
   to be put on their guard. First, he mentions the fleshly appetites;
   then whatever is an object of sensual pleasure to the eye. By the
   latter, many such sinful pleasures might be understood; as, at that
   time, especially the prevailing passion for heathen spectacles, with
   which even christians by intercourse with the heathen world were liable
   to be infected, as shown by examples in the second and third centuries.
   Many interpreters have regarded it as referring to avarice, inasmuch as
   the avaricious feeds his eye on the mere sight of his gold. What the
   Apostle here says is true, indeed, of him who makes of mammon his
   highest good. But this particular reference is so little suited to the
   words, that we are by no means justified in assuming it as the
   Apostle's meaning. Thirdly he mentions vanity, ostentation as exhibited
   in the life, state and pomp in worldly things, show and splendor as a
   means of gaining consequence. He means therefore that union of the
   spirit with the world, as manifested in the three forms of sensual
   appetite, of pleasure-seeking and frivolity, a vain love pomp and show.
   In the sense thus intended by the Apostle, we are to apply his language
   to all the appetites and passions which make this world their object,
   and of which he here gives only these three characteristic forms.

   Ch. ii. 17.] He then proceeds to contrast the opposite issues of the
   two radical tendencies, as illustrating the difference of their origin
   and nature. "And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he
   that doeth the will of God abideth forever." All that is in the world
   being perishable, so likewise is all the pleasure connected with it. He
   therefore who seeks his highest good in the perishable, will see that
   for which he has striven the prey of destruction, nothing left to him
   but bitter disappointment. But he who does the will of God, and on that
   fixes his love, will with his love survive all that is earthly. When
   all that is earthly has passed away, he will have attained to an
   eternal divine life of blessedness; living forever, with that which was
   the object and end of all his strivings, in a state beyond the fear of
   decay or death.

   Ch. ii. 18.] From these practical admonitions John now passes, with a
   personal address to the members of these churches as his children, to a
   warning against those false teachers of a corrupted christianity, of
   whom we have spoken in the Introduction. "Little children, it is the
   last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now
   are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time."
   The christian observer of the signs of the times, learns from the
   Apostle to apprehend these, not singly as mere isolated phenomena, but
   as links of a more extended chain. He learns to inquire what place the
   present holds, in relation to the whole progressive development of the
   kingdom of God, and from this to judge of each particular event. Thus
   Christ too requires us to watch the signs of the times, and to regulate
   our conduct accordingly. We should not, with a frivolous inattention,
   pass by the events of the present time; but should seek to recognize in
   them the finger of God, the leadings of divine wisdom, and apply them
   wisely for our own direction, and for our influence upon the age. We
   should hear in them the voice of God, calling us now in admonitory
   tones to repentance, to caution and watchfulness, and now cheering us
   on to the exercise of hope and trust. The word of God abounds with many
   such an index to the right understanding of the signs of the present
   time.

   The Apostle speaks of the period in which he was writing as the last
   time. So he designates the christian period. And it may always be so
   regarded as forming the epoch towards which all prior revelations of
   God tended, and in which they were consummated; the whole previous
   development of the kingdom of God being only preparative to that which
   is the aim and end of all, viz. the appearing of Jesus as the Redeemer
   of humanity. Henceforth all centres upon this one object,--that the,
   new element introduced by Christ into human history, as the leaven
   which is to penetrate all things, should develop and extend itself more
   and more, till the end shall be fully accomplished. Henceforth all may
   be regarded as one great connected period in the history of humanity;
   reaching to the final decision, which is to follow the personal return
   of Christ, to that last sifting, the final consummation of the kingdom
   of God on earth. This period may therefore, without reference to the
   question whether it be longer or shorter, ever be regarded as the LAST
   TIME in respect to the development of the kingdom of God.

   It is certain, however, that the Apostles connected with this
   designation of their own age, as the last time, another and more
   limited idea. The signs which they observed were ushering in, as they
   believed, the last time in the strictest sense that of the dissolution
   of all earthly things, and the second coming of the Lord. They were not
   able to survey and compute the extent of the intervening period yet to
   pass away. If in this respect the event did not answer to their
   expectation, we shall find in this no cause of stumbling, nothing
   inconsistent with the Spirit's promised illumination, by which they
   were to be guided into the whole truth made known by Christ, and
   perfectly understand it. Though Christ had indeed. promised them, that
   this Spirit should show them also things to come, yet this doubtless is
   not to be understood in an absolutely unconditional sense. It was to
   extend just so far, as was required for understandingwhat he had taught
   them of the divine kingdom, and was by no means a prophetic certainty
   respecting its whole future development. An error therefore in
   chronology, regarding "the last time" (properly meaning, in that
   general sense, the whole time subsequent to the appearing of Christ) as
   a period of brief duration, and the hour of final decision as near at
   hand; this is by no means inconsistent with that promised measure of
   illumination by the Holy Spirit. That they should "know the times or
   the seasons" (Acts i. 7) was not at all essential to their calling as
   divinely commissioned teachers. Christ has himself said, that the
   coming of that last period was something hidden from the angels, and
   from the Son of God himself. The Father had reserved it for his own
   decision. It is easy to see why this could not be otherwise. That
   closing period is to be ushered in by the whole preparatory development
   of human history, in connection with the series of concatenated free
   agencies, and its coming is dependent thereon. Hence the ability to fix
   its date, implies an entire survey of all the divine arrangements for
   the guidance of free beings in connection with their own free agency,
   from the beginning to the end of time. But this can be possible only to
   such a foreknowledge as is grounded in divine omniscience. Thus Christ
   also, to the inquiry of his disciples,--when the complete manifestation
   of his kingdom in the world should come,--replied: "It is not for you
   to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own
   power." (Acts i. 7.) Christ himself here teaches, that the ability to
   compute the time in that respect does not belong to the office of his
   disciples, and was not necessary to it. Thus was impressed upon their
   minds the limits of the divine and human; what they were to learn
   through the light of the Holy Spirit, and how far they were still to be
   left to their own guidance.

   Their longing desires hastened towards the reappearing of their Lord,
   the coming of His kingdom in its glory. It was with them as with the
   traveller, who beholds from afar the goal of his pilgrimage. His eye
   embraces at one glance the whole intermediate space; the windings of
   the intervening way are overlooked, and the distant boundary on which
   his gaze is fixed seems just at hand. It is only when he has traversed
   a part of the way, that he begins to perceive how widely he is still
   separated from the destined goal. So was it with the Prophets, when
   they looked forward to the appearing of the Messiah. So was it with the
   Apostles, when looking for the return of their Lord. As the traveller
   in space, looking away over the intervening distance, seems to behold
   the object of his wanderings close at hand; so is it with the
   travellers in time, as they glance over the intervening periods towards
   the object of their longing expectation. Christianity seemed only the
   transition, from the earthly and perishable order of things, to that
   which is heavenly. Hence, their gaze being fixed alone upon that
   heavenly state, they saw the earthly only as ready to vanish away,--as
   the point of transition to the heavenly and eternal, and therefore of
   very brief duration. True, Christ in his parables respecting the
   kingdom of God, as for example when he presents it under the figure of
   leaven, indicates a more slow, a gradual process of development. But
   these words, like many others spoken by him, could only then be
   comprehended in their whole scope and significance, when interpreted by
   the progressive developments of history. Not till then could it be
   understood, that what the first christian age supposed would be
   effected by Christ's personal intervention at his second appearing,
   required on the contrary a long preparatory process, in the gradual
   spread of the leaven of christianity among all races of men, whose
   extension could not then be known.

   Christ had, moreover, in his last discourses specified many signs,
   which should precede that final decision to be brought about by his
   second coming. But even these could not determine the exact date of its
   occurrence. For as the same law governs the whole development-process
   of the kingdom of God upon earth, so do the great periods in that
   process correspond to one another; the same law repeats itself in a
   constantly ascending scale. We find the succeeding periods prefigured
   in the earlier, as the earlier serve to prepare the way for those which
   follow. That last personal coming of Christ, for the establishment of
   his kingdom, is preceded by numerous manifestations of his spiritual
   coming, of a new and mighty revelation of Christ in the life of
   humanity,--of a new coming of the kingdom of God with power. These form
   the great epochs in the development of the kingdom of God. By these we
   may distinguish the several grand divisions in the historical
   development of the church. So too the signs, which are to announce the
   last personal coming of Christ, are prefigured in those which announce
   and prepare the way for the successive manifestations of his spiritual
   coming. Each great division of a new coming of Christ, in the progress
   of historical development, points to that last personal coming, serves
   as a type and preparation of that closing epoch. The same law repeats
   itself in an ascending scale, till at length it is fulfilled for the
   last time. Thus in Christ's own discourses (Matt. xxiv., xxv.), the
   signs of his first mighty spiritual manifestation in judgment on the
   corrupted Theocracy, and in the first entrance of his kingdom with
   power, freed from what had previously fettered and obscured it,--these
   signs are so mingled with those of his last personal coming to judge
   the world and to consummate the kingdom of God, that the different
   references can with difficulty be distinguished from each other. Hence
   it might the more easily happen, that at the coming in of those several
   great epochs in the historical development of the church, and
   especially in the first apostolic times, the signs of the present,
   which were to be repeated yet many times, should be taken as the signs
   of that more remote period, which in. a stricter sense is designated as
   "the last time."

   Here then, in the last discourses of Christ, we find a law for the
   historical development of the kingdom of God, the same to which the
   words of John now under consideration are to be referred, as are also
   those of Paul in his second Epistle to the Thessalonians (Ch. ii. 4).
   This is an ever-recurring law, in accordance with which the kingdom of
   God develops itself in an ascending conflict with the kingdom of evil;
   new manifestations of the latter kingdom preceding and preparing the
   way for new and more glorious manifestations of the former. Evil, by a
   gradual process of development attains to its highest point; the
   kingdom of Christ then develops itself in conflict with it; and, at
   length, through a new mighty coming of Christ, the kingdom of evil is
   once more subdued. Of this law the highest exemplification will be
   given at the final coming of Christ, and this is prefigured in each of
   the great decisive epochs of the church; they are all ushered in by a
   similar conflict. This is a view rich in consolation; but should serve
   also as an incitement to vigilance, when in any period we see the
   kingdom of evil pushing its encroachments with unwonted vigor. This
   law, derived from the word of God, teaches us what we are then to look
   for as about to come, and to perceive in the present the germinating
   future. The Apostle John, observing such signs in the conflicts at the
   close of the apostolic age, Therein the succeeding stage of development
   was then preparing, seemed already to behold the signs of that last
   time. He applied with propriety the law laid down for him by Christ
   himself, in reference to the conflict of the two kingdoms. But, as we
   have shown, he could not and he need not know, that these signs should
   be often repeated, till at length they should announce that final
   epoch; that this law should again and again find its fulfilment, till
   it should be perfectly and decisively fulfilled for the last time.

   John assumes it, as something already well known to those whom he
   addresses in this letter, that in the last time One should arise whom
   he calls Antichrist. He could assume this as known, partly from the
   instructions received by the churches from himself, partly from what
   they had previously learned through the preaching of Paul. Doubtless
   their attention had often been directed to the dangers and the
   significant signs of the last time, in order that they might be fully
   prepared, in all watchfulness of spirit, to meet the great impending
   conflict. But John speaks of many antichrists; and thence draws the
   conclusion that "the last time," which was to be known as such by the
   appearance of Antichrist, was now near at hand. Does he then mean, that
   by Antichrist is to be understood not some single personage, but only
   the collective sum of all antagonism to Christ; the name being merely a
   personification of that in its unity which was, in fact, distributed
   among many individuals? By no means. On the contrary, the many
   individuals rising up on every side, in whom opposition to Christ, the
   anti-christian principle, makes itself apparent,--these seem to him
   only precursors, prophetic omens of that One in whom this principle is
   to reach its culminating point; who is to appear as its peculiar
   representative, the incarnation as it were of the antichristian
   principle. Here too we shall find the workings of one uniform law, in
   the development-process of the kingdom of God: viz. that in good and
   evil, there are certain personalities forming the central point,
   standing as representatives of the conflicting principles; in whom that
   which exists as scattered fragments in many individuals unites as one
   great whole. On the one hand, those fragmentary workings of good and
   evil prepare the way for that one great personality, in whom they
   severally reach their culminating point; on the other, it is through
   the agency of these great personalities, that the principles which they
   represent are diffused through a multitude of others. Hence the
   Apostle, from the numerous individuals whom he saw rising up as the
   organs of anti-christianity, could justly infer the speedy appearance
   of that great personality, in whom the anti-christian principle should
   reach its highest manifestation.

   The question now arises,--what is to be understood by Antichrist and
   anti-christianity? Is it in general opposers of Christianity, of faith
   in Jesus as the Messiah; for example, such opposers from among the Jews
   and heathen? But were this the true meaning, John could not have spoken
   of the advent of these antichrists as something new; for the idea would
   then be entirely coincident with that of the world, as opposed to
   Christianity and in conflict with it; and in that case believers must
   have always lived among antichrists, and needed no such special warning
   against them. Just so certainly as they themselves believed in Jesus as
   the Messiah, must they be the opposers of those who resisted his
   recognition as such. There could be nothing in this open stand against
   the Messiahship of Jesus, to tempt them from their fidelity to him. We
   can, therefore, come to no other conclusion, than that these
   antichrists appeared under an assumed and deceitful garb, by means of
   which they might procure admission among christians; and if these were
   not firm in. their faith and clear in their christian knowledge, might
   by degrees gain an influence over them. We must regard it as rather a
   disguised than an open opposition to genuine Christianity. And hence
   too, we must regard Antichrist himself as an adversary of Christianity
   different from its previous opposers; as one possessing a peculiar
   power of deception, whereby even christians might be seduced into
   apostacy; as one who wins dominion over the souls of men by blinding
   and deceptive arts, putting himself in communication with their
   religious necessities in order thereby to delude and subjugate them; as
   one who knows how to instate himself, unperceived, in that relation to
   the human spirit which it should hold only to Christ and to God. Christ
   too, in his last discourses, points to such a power of delusion,
   exercised by those who set themselves up as prophets and Messiahs. Here
   also belongs what Paul says of the adversary, who with self-deification
   should establish himself in the temple of God. Hence, according to the
   different forms assumed by the antichristian principle at different
   periods, (when a new spiritual coming of Christ, for a new
   glorification of the church, was about to be evolved from the conflict
   of his kingdom with the kingdom of evil) might those signs specified in
   the Holy Scriptures receive a different interpretation. And this not
   without reason; since under these different forms was first revealed
   the antichristian principle, whose culminating point was to be finally
   reached in that representative personality. Thus in the times preceding
   the Reformation, when the secularized church, guided by the secularized
   Papacy, served under the christian name as an efficient instrument for
   obscuring and thwarting genuine Christianity,--one might believe that
   he saw in this the visible manifestation of Antichrist. And Matthias
   von Jarnow, the Bohemian reformer before Huss, might suppose that he
   saw the craft of Satan in this, viz. that believers instead of
   recognizing Antichrist in the present,--in the domination of the
   secularized church, in the triumph of superstition even to the
   deification of the human,--were beguiled into seeking it in some
   distant period. In our age, on the contrary, one would be disposed to
   recognize the preparatory signs of Antichrist in the self-deification
   of the natural reason; which, after having developed itself under the
   influence of Christianity, now arrays itself in arrogant
   self-consciousness and vain self-worship against that very
   Christianity, without whose aid it could never have attained to this
   self-consciousness. The question, "What is Antichrist?" will be
   interpreted, now from the stand-point of superstition and now from that
   of scepticism, according as the anti-christian principle manifests
   itself in the one or the other of these forms. Each of these
   interpretations will have its share of the common truth, which the
   light of the divine word imparts in the delineation of those signs.

   Ch. ii. 19.] Before designating these antichrists more particularly,
   John speaks of their rise and of their relation to the churches from
   which they had gone out. "They went out from us, but they were not of
   us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with
   us; but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were
   not all of us." From this we learn, that these antichrists were not
   such as had from the beginning stood in a hostile attitude to the
   church, but such as had gone out from the midst of the church itself.
   The church had therefore carried in her own bosom, that which now
   developed itself in conflict with the spirit which formed her vital
   principle. The propagators of these false doctrines, by which genuine
   christian truth was corrupted, and whom the Apostle was constrained to
   resist, had themselves once been numbered with those whom the church
   acknowledged as brethren. Now this was well adapted to unsettle
   christians in their faith; seeing as they did the very persons whom
   they had known as brethren in the faith, who had testified of the same
   christian consciousness, the same christian experiences, now turning
   against that which they had once acknowledged as truth, and inculcating
   as truth something entirely different. The thought might naturally
   arise: may not these persons have really found their former convictions
   to be erroneous, and attained to a clearer insight which they are now
   desirous to impart to others? The church needed, therefore, to be
   guarded against the prejudicial influence of such an example. What then
   does the Apostle say in explanation of this, and for the consolation of
   such of his readers as might be disturbed by it? He tells them that
   these persons, although they had once been connected with the church in
   an external relation, yet had never in heart and soul been really
   united with it in the exercise of genuine faith. He distinguishes
   between genuine and spurious members of the church; between a union
   merely with its outward and visible form,--apart from all share in that
   inward spiritual act which constitutes its vital essence, genuine faith
   in the Redeemer,--and that same outward union as connected also with a
   participation in its spiritual essence; a distinction between those in
   the visible church who belong also to the invisible, and those who by
   the governing direction of their hearts are excluded from the invisible
   church, and belong only to the outward form. And what does he adduce in
   proof that such is here the fact? The result,--that which has been made
   apparent by the apostacy of those persons from the genuine christian
   truth, on which rests the essential being of the church,--by their
   opposition to this truth.

   But does this imply, as supposed by many, that apostacy from christian
   truth in the case of such as have once made it their principle of life,
   a falling from the state of regeneration, is a thing impossible? This
   can by no means be deduced from these words. A false interpretation is
   given to them by those who stretch the sense so far; who make of the
   Apostle's declaration in regard to a particular case, a principle of
   universal application. The word of God guards us against such a view,
   by enjoining watchfulness, even upon hill who has made greatest
   advancement, so long as the conflict of the earthly life shall endure;
   and by warning him who is confident that he stands fast, to take heed
   lest he fall (1 Cor. x. 12). So too the Apostle Paul, that mature
   believer, speaks of his conflicts and strivings,--lest he, who had
   preached to others, should himself be found a castaway. Such an
   apostacy cannot, indeed, be supposed to take place suddenly. But it may
   happen, that through lack of true watchfulness over himself, or through
   false self-reliance, a lack of humility, he who has once attained to
   the christian state, may gradually fall again under the dominion of
   that sin, which though subdued by faith still cleaves to him; may sink
   down again from the height to which he had thus risen, and so lose the
   divine life once received, but not faithfully guarded and nurtured. The
   Apostle John by no means denies such a possibility; he is only
   asserting what was the fact in this particular case. He only states the
   grounds upon which this specific occurrence is to be explained; which
   by no means justifies us in deducing from it a universal law, for the
   development of the christian life. What he, says is no more than this:
   no such radical change has ever been experienced by these persons of
   whom he is speaking. What now appears, openly and visibly, had always
   really existed though under concealment and disguise. Even while still
   attached to the church, they had been strangers to the christian truth
   which is its vital principle. Under the mask of a christian profession,
   they had concealed the same views and feelings, which now manifest
   themselves in open opposition to the pure christian truth.

   By this explanation of the true grounds of an occurrence, which seemed
   likely to perplex the minds of many, the Apostle seeks to counteract
   its influence upon those whom he addresses in this Letter. He shows
   them that what so awakens their surprise is nothing new, but has
   already been long preparing. He teaches them, moreover, that although
   the causes from which it proceeded were indeed something to be
   deplored, yet that the occurrence is in itself a salutary necessity in
   the development-process of Christianity. It served to bring out in a
   clear and convincing manner the truth, that not all who seem to belong
   to the church, belong to it in reality; to separate the genuine and
   spurious members from one another; to discriminate between what is
   truly christian, and what under the christian name belongs strictly to
   another principle; to carry out a sifting process in the development of
   the church. With this is to be compared Paul's declaration, that there
   must be heresies, in order that it may be made manifest who are the
   genuine members of the church. (1 Cor. xi. 19.) That which produces
   heresies is indeed an evil, is something, to be deplored. But that,
   being present, it should thus develop itself; that the hidden should be
   brought to light, and what is kindred in spirit coalesce in one; this
   is a wholesome necessity, and is founded in the course of development
   ordained by divine wisdom: as in the diseased body, it may be necessary
   that the morbid elements should break forth in specific crises, in
   order that they may be cast out and subdued by the principle of
   healthful life. What the divine word here teaches, is a law which can
   be traced through the whole history of the church. By that divine word
   we are raised to a stand-point, for the contemplation of history and of
   life, whence we perceive in evil at once freedom of action, personal
   guilt, and that higher law of divine all-directing wisdom, to which
   evil itself, when it comes forth to light, is made subservient.

   What the Apostle here says, is susceptible of a manifold application to
   the moral phenomena of our own times, and may tranquillize us when
   disquieted and perplexed in view of them. We see the contrariety,
   between christian truth and the errors which oppose it, becoming more
   and more clearly defined; the Divine and the Undivine, Christianity and
   World-worship, encountering each other more and more openly in the
   avowed convictions of men. To many this seems to have broken forth
   suddenly; and they know not how to account for it, that darkness should
   be permitted to gain such an ascendency. But a deeper scrutiny shows
   us, that what the Apostle taught in regard to the moral phenomena of
   his own times is true also here; viz. that the cause of these
   inauspicious symptoms could have no sudden origin, but had long existed
   in the hidden germ. It is not strange that it should fill us with
   disquietude and grief, when we see those who have appeared to us
   zealous advocates of the same christian truth which we profess, whom we
   had with reason believed to be truly of us, suddenly go over to the
   camp of the enemy. Whence this change? How could they apostatize from
   the truth, after having received the same divine experiences of its
   power as we? How could the grace of God suffer them to fall? How could
   that faithfulness and truth of God deny itself? Should not He complete
   the work which he had himself begun in them? But the Apostle's words
   furnish the true solution of this difficulty, and relieve our
   perplexity. It is but bringing to light that which was concealed. Such,
   though seemingly of us, belonged not to us. Nor had they ever held the
   same ground of faith, the same divine truth with us, though making the
   same profession; and whatever zeal they might have shown for it, it was
   still a dead form under which they concealed another meaning. Their
   views had been always the same radically, though cloaked as yet under
   the christian garb, unrevealed to others, perhaps even to themselves.
   Such persons, living in a less active period, when these contrarieties
   had not yet broken out openly, might have gone on quietly in their
   natural course of development. Their profession would indeed, as now,
   have been mere pretence; they would have had the shell only without the
   kernel; not the pure element of christian truth, but its opposite,
   would still have been the vital element of their belief; but this would
   have been unobserved and unknown. Now, however, in this period filled
   and agitated by so many and openly manifested antichristian elements,
   the kindred element in them is attracted by this influence, and is
   impelled to throw off the disguise--to become conscious to itself, and
   to seek for itself an open expression.

   But there may be still another case. These persons who seemed to belong
   to us, may have been really affected by the influence of the same
   christian truth which we profess. They may have enjoyed experiences of
   its divine power. But with this, there co-existed in them the
   anti-christian principle predominant in the age; and hence a conflict
   of opposite tendencies. But that in them which was allied to the
   anti-christian spirit of the age, at length so gained the mastery as to
   overcome the genuine christian element. And thus they themselves became
   sceptical, in regard to their own former experiences of the higher
   life; and at length were carried so far, as to impugn that for which
   they had once been witnesses. They belong to that class, in the
   Saviour's parable of the sower, in whom the seed of the divine word
   springs up quickly,--all the more quickly because it takes no deep
   root,--and through the hostile agency of the adverse spirit is as soon
   destroyed. Of such also it may be said, "They went out from us, because
   they were not truly of us." Of this class Judas Iscariot stands as a
   fearful example. He, it may be, once experienced emotions of the higher
   life. He may, at times, have received divine impressions from
   intercourse with the Saviour. When Judas first numbered himself among
   the disciples, Christ had already perceived what was in him,--that
   carnal tendency which looked for a temporal Messiah. Yet he did not
   thrust him away, but drew him to himself with a love which sought to
   exert a saving influence upon him. The other disciples, surrendering
   themselves to the Lord, and to his purifying and sanctifying influence,
   were by degrees freed from the power of this carnal spirit of the age.
   With Judas, on the contrary, that false spirit gained more and more the
   preponderance, repressing more and more those higher impressions, till
   at length they were lost to him altogether. Thus it was that from a
   disciple of the Lord, he became his most malignant enemy and his
   betrayer.

   Thus enlightened by the words of John, in respect to the cause and the
   necessity of such occurrences, we shall be enabled to regard them,
   though not without grief yet without perplexity, and even to derive
   profit from them for the furtherance of our faith and of our salvation.
   We see that it is a needful sifting. We live in an age of sifting.
   Those who have the reality and those who have only the show, of
   Christianity, those who belong to God and those who belong to the
   world, must be more and more separated from each other. This time of
   sifting summons each one to decide for himself between these two
   contrary tendencies, no longer to be reconciled with each other, but
   standing out in a more and more sharply defined antagonism. Each one is
   summoned to put to himself the momentous and decisive question: Under
   which banner shall I fight? He will perceive the deep significance of
   the words of the Lord; "He that is not for me is against me." He will
   learn to watch vigilantly over himself, lest the bitter root in his own
   nature, furthered in its growth by the kindred but poisonous breath in
   the life of the age, shoot up and increase, and choke the good seed. It
   is plain that an encounter with the open manifestations of the
   antichristian spirit merely, will not here suffice; it is the hidden
   root from which they spring, against which above all we must turn the
   sword of the Spirit.

   Ch. ii. 20, 21.] Having thus removed the occasion of stumbling, thrown
   in the way of the weaker brethren by the apostacy of these errorists,
   he now leads them back into the depths of their own inward life
   pervaded by the Spirit of Christ, in order to show them that they had
   means enough for resisting these deceptive appearances, for
   distinguishing between the Christian and the Antichristian. "But ye
   have an unction [anointing] from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
   I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because
   ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth."

   The Apostle here presents, in contrast with those apostates, the whole
   body of true and steadfast believers. Such should have no occasion to
   fear the threatened danger from those falsifiers of christian truth.
   They should carry in their own hearts the touchstone, whereby to
   distinguish the Christian from the Anti-christian, the preservative
   against the infectious influence of error. And as for you,--this is
   what he would say, the emphasis being on "you,"--YE have the anointing
   from the Holy One, the anointing which proceeds from the holy God, the
   Father. He is here called the Holy One, as he through whom those who
   belong to him are made holy, filled with his holiness, and are thereby
   separated from the unholy, ungodly world, --the chosen from the midst
   of the corrupt world. The name Holy One is indeed also a designation of
   Christ; and it might be referred to him, as lie who imparts this spirit
   to believers. But the preposition here used in the original ("from")
   would naturally direct us rather to God, as the eternal source from
   which this spirit proceeds. (Comp. John xv. 26.) So might we judge,
   should we take this passage by itself; but since both views are
   possible, and both convey strict truth, a comparison of it with a
   subsequent passage is necessary to a reliable decision. In either case,
   the difference of conception makes no alteration in the sense. The
   anointing itself consists in that Holy Spirit which, proceeding from
   the holy God, is imparted to those only who are his. It places them in
   fellowship with him, and guards them from all the unholy influences
   inherent in the world, to which also belongs everything which threatens
   to falsify the pure christian truth.

   The word "anointing" suggests to us the ordinances of the old
   dispensation, from which it was borrowed. Kings, priests, prophets,
   received their consecration to the office appointed them by God,
   through an anointing,--the symbol of the power imparted to them by God
   through his Spirit for the fulfilment of their calling. By the outward
   and visible was signified that which, in its fulness and completion,
   was to be wrought inwardly upon the spirit. Now that which was
   expressed outwardly under the old dispensation, and by a single act, is
   in the New Testament converted wholly into the inward and spiritual,
   and working from within embraces the entire life. That which under the
   old dispensation was restricted to individuals, entrusted in some
   manner with the guidance of God's people,--individuals who were thereby
   separated from the body of the people,--now under the new dispensation
   belongs to the people of God universally. The limitations of the Old
   Testament are burst asunder by the spirit of the New. First of all, its
   founder himself,--the sovereign in God's kingdom, the Saviour,--is
   called the Anointed, the Christ, as having been consecrated to his work
   through the fulness of the indwelling Spirit of God; as possessing in
   himself the fulness, the sum of all those divine powers, which were
   only imparted singly as special gifts to the prophets of the Old
   Testament. So, by virtue of their fellowship with him, are all who are
   redeemed by him made partakers of the Holy Spirit which he imparts.
   From the fulness of the divine nature, the divine power dwelling in
   him, he imparts to all. This is the inward anointing, the inward
   consecration whereby they are inwardly set apart from the world, as
   those who belong to God through Christ. All are admitted without
   distinction to the same fellowship with him, and receive from him the
   same inward consecration to their divine mission through the Holy
   Spirit. Henceforth there exists no more among the people of God any
   such distinction, as under the Old Testament between kings, priests,
   prophets, and people; but all collectively are in like manner
   consecrated to God, have an equal part in that inward consecration, in
   the illuminating and sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit. It is
   one royal priestly generation, whose nobility and high office is alike
   the heritage of all; all are prophets, through that common illumination
   of the Holy Spirit. Such are the weighty thoughts contained in that
   single word, that honorable designation of believers.

   Believing himself justified in assuming this inward anointing in the
   case of those to whom he writes, he goes on to infer from this, that
   they already know all that he has to say to them,--all which is
   requisite to an insight into the nature of christian truth, to
   preservation from error. In that inner fountain all can be found, if
   they will only surrender themselves to that inward, heavenly teacher.
   He disclaims teaching any new doctrine, unknown to them hitherto. It is
   not as a missionary to those who are yet without the pale of
   christianity, and in whom the sense of the nature of christian truth is
   yet to be awakened, that lie speaks. This christian truth is already
   known; the Christian consciousness grounded in it, and a fellowship of
   christian consciousness between him and his leaders, already exist. But
   why then write to them if they already know all, if the truth which he
   would present is already familiar to them? It is to revivify the
   consciousness already rooted in their being; to awaken that which
   slumbers; to call forth new life, new activity; to unfold to their view
   what they carry in their own breasts; to bring them into a clear and
   conscious possession of what they already have. He says to them, what
   they should say to themselves. Often are we thus directed, through a
   word spoken by another, to something which has long had its dwelling in
   our inner life. It unlocks the depths of our own souls. We learn by it
   to understand ourselves, to perceive within ourselves the presence of
   God. All genuine instruction in the truth must aim only to direct to
   the One Teacher of truth, to God himself, and to serve as his organ.
   The genuine teacher of truth is himself fully aware that such is his
   appointed office, and he desires no other. It matters not whether the
   instruction have reference to those universal truths, which each must
   learn from the general revelation of God, of the Eternal Word as the
   light of the spiritual world; or to the peculiar truths of the kingdom
   of God, of the Gospel, the witness of the incarnate Word,--the very
   truths here brought to view, and experimentally known to all believers
   through that inward anointing of the Holy Spirit. Thus the Apostle is
   far from wishing to make believers dependent on himself as the teacher
   of truth, to assume that it was from him they were first to learn what
   is truth. On the contrary, he bases his appeal on the presence in them
   of the fountain of divine truth, not possessed by him as his peculiar
   property, but shared in common with those to whom his exhortation is
   addressed. He presents himself to them as a witness of that christian
   consciousness which they lad in common. It is to this very
   consciousness, this inward knowledge of christian truth, that he makes
   his appeal when warning them against the errors which are spreading all
   around them. They need no other proof; these errors must show
   themselves to be lies, through their contrariety with that truth which
   is experimentally known to their own hearts. By the test of an
   immediate consciousness they will at once perceive, that what gives
   itself out for truth is but a falsification of the original christian
   truth, which is to them of all things the most certain. This is the
   proof which they carry in their own souls, the inner witness to which
   the Apostle makes his appeal. It is on this very ground that he
   addresses them, viz. BECAUSE they know the truth; and can therefore
   accept nothing which is not the fruit of this truth, nothing which
   denies it, which stands in hostility to it,--since nothing that is
   false is of the truth. This he can properly presuppose; and he needs
   only to arouse this inward perception of christian truth, for the
   rejection of the falsehoods which oppose the truth.

   What now is the application to the present age, of the important truths
   thus deduced from these words of the Apostle? The Apostles stood in a
   peculiar relation to the churches of their own as of all succeeding
   ages, such a relation as no man could thereafter hold to christians.
   They were the instruments, through whom the true image of the Lord and
   of his word was to be transmitted to all. The christian consciousness
   of their own time and of all times has its source in their testimony,
   is developed by it and out of it. They form the necessary medium
   between Christ and all succeeding generations. If we would gain the
   knowledge of Christ and of the way of salvation, we must trust their
   testimony. In this respect the church must always remain dependent on
   them, always stand in need of their teachings. But although the Apostle
   John was fully aware of this relation to the church, he wished not to
   exercise any spiritual domination, to present himself to his brethren
   as the teacher by whom they were again to be instructed. The church,
   having been once established through the preaching of the divine word
   and its reception into the inward life, can and must hold fast and
   apply what has been thus received, as its own independent possession.
   Through that inward anointing from the Holy One, of which the Apostle
   has spoken, should all believers, independently of all other authority,
   stand in immediate fellowship with Christ as the only Master for all;
   and the christians of every age should be thereby united, both with
   that first apostolic church and with each other. It follows from this
   that no one, who claims to be a teacher in the church, is justified in
   making it dependent upon himself and his single teachings, but that all
   should regard themselves only as organs of this common inward
   anointing; that they should only lead the way to this inward fountain
   of illumination through the divine word which is its source,--should
   make this itself an object of conscious knowledge; that the only aim
   should be to conduct to that fountain in order to draw therefrom; that
   so all which they teach may approve itself as true by this inward
   witness. That all may be trained up, through this common inward
   anointing, to the maturity and independence of a personal christian
   consciousness--this only can be the aim of all instruction of others
   and all spiritual influence over them. It follows farther, that no
   believer is at liberty to forego this maturity and personal
   independence, bestowed in that inward anointing, or to place himself in
   a dependent relation, inconsistent with this birthright, to any teacher
   whatever among men. And should any one attempt, through the pretence of
   new divine revelations, to make the religious convictions of others
   dependent on himself, or to set the teachings of human wisdom in the
   place of the divine word; there will ever be found, in that inward
   anointing, an element of resistance to such arrogated authority.

   Another conclusion from the Apostle's words is this: that the
   multifarious forms, in which the anti-christian spirit manifests
   itself, should not perplex and disquiet the believer. He has in his own
   soul; in that christian consciousness, which unites him with the truly
   Christian in every age, and with the apostolic church itself; in that
   inward anointing of the Holy Spirit; the infallible instinct, the
   certain touchstone, to distinguish between what is of Christ and what
   is of Antichrist. It is only needful that, watching over himself, he
   adhere prayerfully to that inward divine voice, give faithful heed to
   that sure oracle, which guides the simple and humble-minded through all
   adversities and conflicts; so will he be secured against all the
   delusions of pretended higher truth, taught by a false conceited
   philosophy. He is convinced beforehand, that whatever stands in
   contradiction to that inward anointing, whatever would rob him of his
   Christ, however lofty may be, the words in which it speaks, cannot be
   true. Neither will he be persuaded to sacrifice that individual free
   consciousness, imparted in that inward anointing, to the plea that a
   higher church authority is needed, as guide and leader through these
   conflicts of the christian and anti-christian principles; or that, on
   this account, new prophets must arise to bring repose and confidence to
   wavering souls. He knows in himself, that he has in that, inward
   anointing all he needs; and he will permit himself to be deceived by no
   promise of something more certain, more reliable, or to be drawn away
   from listening to that inward divine voice, through whose teachings he
   knows all things.

   Ch. ii. 22, 23.] After these preparatory remarks, John proceeds to
   point out more particularly the errors which he is here opposing. "Who
   is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? HE is [the]
   Antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son. Whosoever denieth the
   Son, the same hath not the Father; but he that acknowledgeth the Son,
   hath the Father also."

   By the teachers of false doctrine then, whom John is here opposing, he
   means such as do not acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah. Now this might
   apply in general to all opponents of Christianity among the Jews, to
   all who indeed acknowledged God as the Father, God as revealed in the
   Old Testament, but not Jesus as the Messiah. But as we have already
   remarked in the Introduction, this would be too general a designation
   to correspond to the special characteristics given by John. We are
   necessarily led to look for new enemies of genuine Christianity of a
   peculiar stamp, such as might actually deceive those who did not hold
   fast to that inward anointing of the Spirit. But if such are meant, as
   actually denied that Jesus was the Messiah, how are we to understand
   this? The answer is at hand. One may profess himself in words a
   believer in Jesus as the Christ, and yet his conceptions of the person
   of Jesus, or of him as the Christ, may be at variance with this
   profession. Either he does not truly believe in Jesus of Nazareth, as
   lie really was and has exhibited himself in his life and history,--does
   not receive the true historical image of this Jesus as a matter of
   personal conviction, but has dreamed out for himself another Jesus; or
   he does not acknowledge him as in the true sense the Christ, does not
   ascribe to him all which belongs to him as such, does not assume the
   befitting relation towards him as such. In either of these cases it
   might be said, that one who holds such views denies that Jesus is the
   Messiah. That which stood before the eye of John, was the divine
   incarnate Word,--in the perfect union of the divine and human, as the
   veritable Jesus, the Christ. He who held this Jesus for a mere man, an
   enlightened man like the prophets, not acknowledging him as the Eternal
   Life manifesting itself in time, the fountain of divine life; or he who
   recognized in him the Son of God but not the Son of Man, denying the
   reality of his human manifestation, and changing his divine-human
   history into a misty phantom; lie who thus, with reckless self-will,
   separated the Son of God and the Son of Man, could not pass with John
   as one who truly acknowledged Jesus as the Christ, but must appear to
   him a denier of the truth. Hence, with reason, John accuses those
   falsifiers of evangelical truth, as described in our Introduction, with
   not acknowledging Jesus as the Messiah. And as these persons, under a
   pretended profession of belief in Jesus as the Christ, were yet
   inimical to him, and by their teachings might seduce believers from
   him; it was so much the more necessary to warn against such, as
   Antichrists.

   Thus explained, we can readily apply what John here says to our own
   times. It applies to those who do not acknowledge Jesus of Nazareth as,
   in the true sense, the Christ; to whom he is not that which he should
   be as the Christ, the Messiah, the Redeemer from sin, the Fountain of
   eternal divine life, the only Mediator between God and man, the Founder
   and sovereign Ruler of the kingdom of God. It applies also to such, as
   do not acknowledge Jesus of Nazareth in his true historical
   significance and reality, as presented to us in the gospel record;
   turning that whole record into doubt and uncertainty, sublimating him
   also into a form of mist, and leaving a mere phantom in his place; who,
   rending asunder the connection between Christ,--Christ in himself,--and
   the human historical appearing of Jesus, convert the Christ into a mere
   idea, and allow itonly an accidental connection with the historical
   Jesus thus unsubstantialized by their unbelief. Hence all such, in
   proportion as this may be affirmed, belong to those whom John
   designates as the representatives of the anti-christian spirit.

   The preaching of Jesus as the Christ being the fundamental article of
   faith in the apostolic church, the foundation upon which the whole
   christian life was to be built up, the one doctrine which contained in
   itself all that was necessary to salvation; only those errors,
   consequently, were regarded by John and his fellow-apostles as radical,
   as belonging in their essence to Anti-christianity, which in one way or
   another mutilated this one cardinal doctrine. This furnishes the clue
   by which we are now also to judge of truth and falsehood, of what is
   requisite to christian fellowship and what is irreconcilable with it,
   and by which we must learn to estimate everything according to its own
   intrinsic value.

   Not all erroneous conceptions of the person of Jesus, are included by
   John in what he terms antichristian; but, obviously, only such as do
   not admit a recognition of Jesus as the Christ in the true sense,--only
   such as involve a denial of this, though they may not directly avow it.
   This also teaches us to distinguish carefully between conceptions of
   Christ, and what is essential to the recognition of Jesus as the
   Christ,--what is requisite in order to present him in the true relation
   to the religious consciousness. These conceptions may correspond more
   or less to the truth; but the errors are not necessarily always such as
   to obscure or mutilate that which constitutes the essence of the
   preaching of Christ, viz. what Christ is in relation to the religious
   consciousness. In more recent times, christians have often erred
   through neglect of such discrimination; and have supposed themselves to
   differ in respect to faith in the one Jesus Christ, as the ground of
   salvation, from those with whom they were only at strife over such
   conceptions of his Person, as are of minor importance to the inward
   religious experience. Against this error also, we are guarded by the
   standard of christian judgment here followed by the Apostle.

   John develops still farther the great importance to religious belief,
   in its widest sense, of this doctrine of Jesus as the Christ. He shows
   the danger to religious faith in general from the denial of Christ; the
   close connection between the doctrine of Jesus as the Christ, which
   constitutes the peculiarity of christian faith, and the religious
   sentiment in general; how they stand or fall together. It is by no
   means implied that the champions of anti-christianity, whom he is
   opposing, expressly connected with their denial of Jesus as the Christ
   the denial also of God the Father. At a later period indeed we find a
   class, the Gnostics of the second century, of whom this might be said;
   who did not acknowledge the God revealed through Christ as the Father
   of all spirits, the Creator of the Universe, the God already made
   known. in1 the Old Testament. But it cannot be conclusively proved that
   John had any such in mind. The opposite is more naturally inferable
   from his words, viz. that those of whom he is speaking professed belief
   in the God of the Old Testament as the Father; and John's reproach is,
   that with them this profession has lost its full truth and
   significance. In renouncing their belief in Jesus as the Christ, they
   had renounced also their belief in God as the Father. The same relation
   holds good, in respect to belief, in either case. As John, upon. the
   grounds already explained, declares of some who professed belief in
   Jesus as the Christ that they were, notwithstanding, deniers of Christ;
   so also he declares of those who in words acknowledge God as the
   Father, that by denying Jesus as the Christ they do thereby deny God as
   the Father. It is this, the necessary and inseparable connection of
   these two articles of faith, which is here meant.

   How then is this to be understood? We must not fail to notice in the
   first place, that God is not here designated merely in general as God,
   but as the Father. Now as the Father,--He who with inexpressible
   father-love draws to himself the beings estranged from him by sin,--as
   such he has first revealed himself in Christ; giving his only-begotten
   Son as the means of reconciling to himself, and of restoring to his
   fellowship which is the eternal fountain of bliss, the alienated family
   of man. In him and through him do they first recognize God as their
   Father; only through him are they re-established in the filial relation
   to God. The whole life of Christ is a revelation of divine Father-love,
   towards the race estranged from God by sin. In him is first presented
   that endearing relation, into which, by sending his Son to appear on
   earth, he has entered with man. He, the Holy One, could alone be
   absolutely the object of the divine Father-love. It is in the Son that
   the Father first reveals himself. In the contemplation of his life we
   first perceive what God is, as Father; first learn to understand his
   paternal love. It is from him alone, the only absolutely worthy object
   of the divine complacency and love, that this love can be extended to
   all who are in fellowship with him, and in whom Christ,--whose they
   are, who dwells in them, and from whom their whole life
   issues,--presents himself, yea his own self, to the eye of the divine
   Father.

   But certainly it was not merely this John intended to express, viz.
   that the knowledge of God as the Father is dependent upon the knowledge
   of Jesus Christ his son,--faith in God as the Father upon faith in
   Jesus Christ as his son. He did not intend to say merely: that to deny
   the Son, is necessarily to deny the Father as such. In the Johannic
   sense, this has reference not merely to the special relation which God,
   as Father, holds to those who are justified in regarding themselves as
   his children; but to the knowledge of God as God, in its most general
   and unlimited sense. The knowledge of God is, in every view, based upon
   the knowledge of Christ. In proportion as Christ is known and
   understood, is known and understood the God who reveals himself in him;
   as John himself says (John i. 18): "No man hath seen God at any time;
   the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath
   declared [revealed] him." By seeing cannot here be meant bodily sight;
   for the Son of God is here represented as he who alone can behold the
   God whom no one hath seen. But God could be seen through the outward
   sense by no one, not even by the Son. As Spirit, he is forever the
   Invisible. It is not therefore the bodily sight, but a spiritual
   perception which is here intended; the perfect intuitive knowledge of
   God as the Invisible, that is, the Incomprehensible. The only-begotten
   Son of God could alone, by virtue of his being one with God, truly know
   him by direct intuition; and from this knowledge could, as man, reveal
   him in a form comprehensible by man. Though dimly revealed in the inner
   consciousness of man, who felt himself drawn to him by a mysterious
   influence; yet was God,--in his infinite exaltation, his unfathomable
   nature, his boundless perfection,--a God concealed from man, a God afar
   off. The Spirit, soaring on bold wing in search of God, sunk down
   exhausted to the earth. Often, during the ante-christian period, we
   find nothing remaining save a vague feeling of the Divine; or the idea
   of God, having become wholly earthly, had given place to the
   deification of nature. God was not recognized in his exaltation over
   the world, as He to whom the world is subject; the God of Heaven, who
   also fills the earth, who is at once near and afar off. His Being was
   brought down to a level with that of the world, and the conceptions of
   God and of the world were commingled into one. The consciousness of God
   was lost in the deification of the material world; or a mere empty
   notion, an abstract idea of perfection without actual existence, was
   substituted for the idea of the living God. The God who dwells in
   inaccessible light, into which no human spirit can penetrate, must, in
   order to be truly known by man, come down to the human and within its
   finite limits. First in the revelation of the incarnate God, could the
   God afar off come near to humanity. First in this image of God in human
   nature, could the idea of God enter as a living and substantial element
   into the moral and intellectual being of man. Man, created in the image
   of God, was through this image in himself to rise to the Spirit who is
   the Father of all spirits, the eternal archetype. As spirit he should
   thus recognize, in his essential being, that highest Spirit from whom
   all spirits emanate, and who images himself in them. But the image of
   God in man having been marred by sin, and the connection sundered
   between the archetypal Spirit and those who are formed in its image,
   man has thereby become incompetent for this knowledge. Hence the more
   he strives, while in this state of estrangement from God, to lift
   himself by the mere force of thought to him from whose living
   fellowship he is separated, the farther does he remove from him, the
   greater the errors into which he falls.

   Now that which had hitherto been wanting to man, the perfect image of
   God in human form, this is supplied by Christ,--the perfect man as the
   image of the perfect God. God, in his love and his holiness, gives a
   perfect reflection of himself as such in the life of Christ; for it is
   only in the union of these two attributes that he can be truly known as
   God. Now we can rise from the image to the original. In the mirror of
   Christ we perceive God. Here we attain to the idea of God, thus brought
   near and placed within the grasp of our spirits. The chasm which parted
   us from God is closed. The deeper we penetrate into the nature of
   Christ, the more deeply do we penetrate into the knowledge of God,
   whose perfect image he is. Hence, in this view also, as the confession
   of the Son involves the confession of the Father, the knowledge of the
   Son the knowledge of the Father; so also in the denial of the Son is
   involved the denial of the Father. Losing the real Christ, man sinks
   back again to that previous position, where an infinite gulf separated
   his spirit from God. The previous errors develop themselves the more
   powerfully, as through his apostasy from the truth he has incurred the
   greater guilt; the ground of these errors having formerly been mere
   ignorance of the truth, but now a wicked denial of it. Moreover, this
   same tendency of natural reason in opposition to the Divine,--though at
   first only mingling its sceptical and obscuring influence with the
   conception of what Christ is,--must yet, true to its own nature, go on
   in a progressive and more complete development and expression of
   itself, extending that influence over the religious sense in general.
   And thus, in every view, is sustained the truth of the Apostle's words,
   that he who denies the Son, the same has not the Father; but he who
   confesses the Son has the Father also.

   We must not overlook That is further implied in these words; viz. that
   with confession, in the true sense of the word, there must be connected
   also a HAVING of that which is presupposed as the object of confession,
   of faith, of knowledge. He who confesses the Son, in the true sense of
   the word, he who knows him and believes on him, also HATH him. He
   stands in the most intimate fellowship of life with Christ, and through
   him in the same fellowship with the Father. Through this fellowship he
   knows God, as He can only through this be known, through this his
   self-revelation ill the consciousness of such as in the Son have the
   Father also,--the Father, to whom none can ever rise by mere effort, of
   thought, apart from a union of the life with him. And thus, whoever
   detaches himself from this union with Christ and denies him, having him
   no longer present in his life, thereby renounces also union with the
   Father. He can no longer know him whom he no longer HAS, with whom he
   is no longer connected through fellowship with Christ.

   As these words of John are confirmed by the whole history of the human
   spirit, since the time they were written; so does the present age
   furnish a peculiarly emphatic witness of their truth. The study of
   passing events serves, in no small degree, to elucidate the deep
   meaning of these pregnant words; as they, on the other hand, become
   specially important to the higher interests of our own times, when we
   learn how to apply them. We see, that as those radical errors in the
   conception of Christ's person have reappeared in the same
   anti-christian tendencies which John opposed, and men have departed
   from the true Christ; the same radical tendency of the natural reason
   gradually led on to the misapprehension and denial of God, whom Christ
   has revealed to us as the Father. It was a tendency which at first,
   while thus limiting and mutilating the doctrine of Christ, yet sought
   to maintain its hold of the doctrine of God as the Father, to whom it
   ascribed the influence of Christianity. But, as we have seen, it was
   continually impelled by its own nature to overstep these boundaries.
   First, that intimate filial relation to God as Father was lost; only
   the general reference to God as the Unknown, the God afar off,
   remained. Then was the God of heaven, the living personal God, also
   lost. The deification of the world,--opposing itself to everything
   supernatural in the Divine, to everything which can be perceived only
   by faith, and cannot be apprehended by the senses, or by the natural
   reason confined as it is within the limits of the world,--widened its
   grasp continually, and developed more and more in denial and
   destruction its anti-christian power. What at first was professedly
   only a matter of knowledge, became more and more an element of life.
   And thus will the declaration of John forever continue to be verified.
   As Christ is the centre around which all turns, and in reference to the
   most vital contrarieties in opinion and life this only is of
   account,--what is the relation to Christ; as we have all, or lose all
   with him; so the distinction comes out with continually increasing
   clearness, between having Christ and with him having the Father, or
   losing the Son and with him the Father, and at the same time all that
   is divine, all wherein the God-related spirit can enjoy possession of
   itself, can find its true life.

   Ch. ii. 24, 25.] The Apostle concludes this warning by again enforcing
   the exhortation, that they hold fast and faithfully preserve what they
   have received; so should the gifts of grace also remain theirs. "Let
   that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If
   that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye
   also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father. And this is the
   promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life."

   Here again in the original Greek, the "Ye" is placed first ("Ye
   therefore," which we cannot imitate), in emphatic contrast with those
   heretical teachers. For as these, through their apostacy from the
   original truth, had again estranged themselves from that fellowship
   with God as the Father, which is received through Christ; so on the
   contrary, should the church be distinguished from them by a faithful
   adherence to that original teaching, and by so doing abide also in
   fellowship with the Son and with the Father. What they have received
   from the beginning is to remain IN them; being something abiding, not a
   mere external thing, which like an empty sound had passed by them. As
   they have received it into their inward life, so should it ever remain
   deeply imprinted in their spirits. And as it is through the preached
   word, received into their hearts, that they have attained to fellowship
   with the Father through the mediating Son; the indwelling of this truth
   in their hearts is made the condition, on which they should continue to
   abide in fellowship with the Son, and through him with the Father. This
   continuing IN the Soil and the Father, we must endeavor to apprehend in
   the full significance of the term. This IN can be exchanged for no
   other word. It declares that their life has its being in Jesus as the
   Son of God, and through this, in the Father whom he has revealed as
   such, and with whom he has brought them into fellowship. In the Gospel
   of John, the two things are always presented as connected with each
   other, as involved in each other; viz. the abiding of believers in
   Christ and his abiding in them. The communication of Christ to the
   believer,--wherein the whole christian life has its root,--and the
   continuance of this communication, appears therefore as something
   dependent upon their susceptibility for this divine gift, upon the free
   surrenders of themselves to Christ. So soon as they, through the bent
   of the will, abandon their original relation to Christ, will Christ
   also depart from them. All hangs upon the unconstrained susceptibility,
   the direction of the will in man. Hence, whatever may be the enjoyment
   of divine grace in the christian life, the requirement is still binding
   on man to watch unceasingly over himself, lest through his own fault he
   should again lose the heavenly gift which he has received. The means on
   their part for continuing in fellowship with Christ is, in John's view,
   holding fast the doctrines originally made known to them. By this he
   does not mean merely retaining them in the memory, in the
   understanding; but so holding them fast that this truth shall remain an
   indwelling and determining principle of their inner life. As an
   encouragement to fidelity, he shows them what on this condition they
   have a right to expect. He sums up the whole in one all-embracing
   promise,--the eternal life which Christ has promised to those who abide
   in fellowship with him; for, as he has before said, in Christ has this
   eternal life itself appeared personally in humanity. There is, for the
   God-related spirit, no other blessedness than this life for which he
   was created, and in which alone he can find satisfaction for all the
   wants implanted in his godlike nature. It is called The Life,
   absolutely, inasmuch as it is the participation in that which alone, in
   the truest and highest, in an unqualified sense, can be called life,
   the life of God himself; as to the God-related spirit, which can only
   find in God its true life, the want of it is Death. It is called
   eternal life, inasmuch as it is in its very nature exalted above all
   change of time, in its very nature eternal, belonging not to the
   transitory temporal existence, but to eternity. Where it has once taken
   up its abode, it can no more be disturbed and interrupted by death;
   but, victorious over all death, unfolds itself in progressive and
   glorious development forever. Hence Christ, in the Gospel of John,
   speaks of it as the fountain which gushes up into eternal life; a
   river, checked by no barriers, pouring along from the once imparted
   source, into the eternal and the infinite. And hence it is said, that
   he who believes in Christ has eternal life; in this Believing, it is
   his already. The future blessedness promised to the christian is not,
   therefore, something essentially different from what he has already
   received in the earthly life through faith, and to be added from
   without as something new. In its germ and essence, it is contained in
   what he already has. It needs only to burst from the imprisoning shell,
   in order to reveal itself in its own inherent glory.

   Ch. ii. 26, 27.] John concludes by a reference to the inward anointing
   of those whom he addresses, in contrast with those false teachers.
   "These things have I written unto you, concerning them that seduce you.
   But the anointing, which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and
   ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth
   you of all things, and is truth and is no lie, and even as it hath
   taught you, ye shall abide in him." The Apostle repeats the assurance
   of his belief, that he need add nothing new by way of guarding them
   against those false teachers; he need only refer, for adequate
   instruction in all things, to that inner fountain of divine
   illumination, that inward anointing. This anointing is here designated,
   as that which they have received from him; and the reference might be
   to the source in which it originates, to the Father by whom this spirit
   is bestowed. But as the pronoun here employed, without any more
   definite application, always refers in this connection to Christ, that
   reference is to be retained also in this passage. What is asserted is
   therefore this: the communication of this Spirit is procured through
   the mediating Christ; as imparted through Christ, it is said to have
   been received from him. Just so this Spirit is at one time designated
   as he who proceeds from the Father, whom Christ sends from the Father,
   whom the Father bestows for the sake of Christ; and at another, as the
   Spirit which Christ imparts to those who believe on him, as the Spirit
   of Christ, so that Christ's spiritual coming to believers is a coming
   in and with this Spirit. If now we proceed in accordance with Luther's
   version, it is here John's first and special object to say,--that what
   this inward anointing teaches respecting all things is the perfect
   truth without mixture of error, and they needed therefore only to
   adhere faithfully to it. In this view, the development of thought
   proceeds on regularly in what follows. Still it may be asked, whether
   John would have presented so prominently (as something of special
   importance in itself) the assertion that all, as this anointing teaches
   it, is true and there is nothing false in it; whether it is not
   probable, rather, that he throws in as an independent and accessory
   thought the words,--"and as it is truth and no falsehood,"--and then
   proceeds (repeating the previous clause in consequence of this
   interruption), "And even as it has been taught you, so shall ye abide
   in him." The in him'must be referred to him who is here the one object
   of reference, to Christ. In the assured trust that the church will ever
   continue to yield itself to the teachings of the Holy Spirit, and being
   guided by his illuminating grace will ever remain true to the doctrine
   which they have received, he feels assured also that they will ever
   abide in fellowship with Christ.

   Ch. ii. 28.] Pausing upon the thought thus suggested, the Apostle now
   turns to them again with a personal appeal. In a father's tone he
   exhorts them to steadfast perseverance in this direction of the life,
   till they attain the final goal. "And now, little children, abide in
   him; that when he shall appear we may have confidence, and not be
   ashamed before him at his coming."

   As the coming of Christ was, from causes already mentioned, then
   expected as something close at hand, and the eye, overleaping all that
   lay between, fixed itself upon that event; so the Apostle here
   overlooks all which is to follow immediately after death, and turns at
   once to the day of final decision. This he calls the appearing of
   Christ. In this it is necessarily implied that Christ now lives in his
   glory with the Father, he and his glory still hidden from the world and
   manifest only to believers; that, in his appearing, what is now thus
   hidden shall be revealed. Christ in his glory shall then become
   manifest to all, as now he is manifest, through the medium of faith, to
   the believer. Placing this goal before the eye of believers, the
   Apostle exhorts them to abide so faithfully, through the direction of
   their life, in that fellowship with Christ to which they have been
   admitted, that they may be able in that day to appear before him their
   Judge, with a quiet and assured conscience. The word here employed in
   the Greek, indicates an absolute unshaken confidence, as between friend
   and friend. In such a relation should believers stand to Christ.
   Conscious of remaining ever faithful to him, and standing in this
   relation, they will not need to be ashamed in the presence of him to
   whom their whole life is manifest. But the Apostle here passes from the
   second to the first person; for involved as he still is in the conflict
   of the earthly life, he feels himself the necessity of watchfulness.
   Hence, when speaking of the direction of the life towards this final
   goal, he does not exalt himself above other christians, but speaks as
   one who is on a level with them.

   Ch. ii. 29.] This faithful abiding in fellowship with Christ, by virtue
   of which believers will in that day stand with untroubled conscience
   before the Lord, in the sense of John embraces the entire life;
   including not merely opposition to radical errors in doctrine, but to
   all sin by which the christian life might be defiled. Thus a new
   division now commences, with reference to the shunning of everything
   sinful: "If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
   doeth righteousness is born of him."

   These words are more closely connected with what follows than with what
   precedes; and we must therefore here refer the pronoun, not to Christ,
   but to God. The close connection between the references to Christ and
   to God, renders this transition easy, without any formal designation of
   it. It here arises naturally out of the conception, which in all that
   follows underlies the Apostle's course of thought. The appellation
   "Righteous" admits indeed of a reference to Christ; and as the subject
   of remark now is a being of believers in Christ, and their whole life
   is contemplated as having its source in him, as derived from him and
   vitalized by him, so also it might be said that they were born of
   Christ. But the Apostle's uniform manner of conception and expression
   decides against this view. As he is accustomed to contemplate Christ in
   his human manifestation,--the incarnate Word; He through whom man is
   reinstated in fellowship with God, through whom he is raised again to
   the filial relation to God, and becomes the child of God; so does he
   contemplate God, as the eternal, original source of the new life
   imparted through Christ to the believer. It is in this view,
   accordingly, that he speaks of a birth from God, in contrast with the
   natural corporeal birth by which one becomes a member of the human
   family; inasmuch as by this he is lifted out of the customary current
   of the world, and incorporated with the kingdom of God, in which
   without divine life there can be no participation. Thus, by the
   Righteous, we are to understand God. Righteousness is here synonymous
   with perfect purity, with holiness. Accordingly, the inference is here
   made, that those who know God as the Holy One must also know, that
   being through the kindled life imparted by him born of him anew, and
   called in this sense his children, they must make themselves manifest
   as such through a righteous life-walk in harmony with him. Two things,
   an affirmative and a negative, are implied in this declaration. First,
   that where true righteousness exists, it can have been derived only
   from this source; that true righteousness can only be attained through
   a birth from God, as it is only through the power of God that the
   ruling power of sin can be overcome in man. So Christ asserts, that
   whatever is born of the flesh needs the moral transformation effected
   by the Spirit which God imparts. "That which is born of the flesh, is
   flesh;" it corresponds to its origin, to sinful human nature as
   estranged from God. Secondly it is implied, that he only who leads a
   life in harmony with righteousness is born of God; only by this sign
   can the birth from God make itself known. Where the opposite is found,
   it furnishes evidence that this birth from God has never yet taken
   place; that what the Holy Spirit calls the Flesh, comprehending under
   this name whatever both in the sensual and intellectual nature stands
   opposed to the divine influence, is still predominant in him. In this
   connection, as is shown by what follows, the special reference is to
   God.

CHAPTER III.

   Ch. iii. 1-3.] FROM the conviction that believers are born of God, and
   thus are children of God, the Apostle derives the motive necessarily
   growing out of it, to avoid all that is sinful. This leads him to speak
   more at large of the dignity of the children of God, and of what is
   involved in it: "Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed
   upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world
   knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons
   of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,
   when he [it] shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him
   as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself,
   even as he is pure."

   There can be no more intimate and endearing relation than that of
   children to their Father, when this fully answers to its nature. How
   much then must it imply, when creatures separated by an infinite chasm
   from their Creator, when men estranged by sin from a holy God, are
   taken into this relation to Him. How great the love he has manifested,
   by coming near and imparting himself to them, in order to close this
   chasm, to bring them into fellowship with himself! No higher evidence
   could be given of the love of God towards his apostate creatures. It
   pre-supposes the father-heart in God, towards those whom he adopts as
   his children. Far more is designated by it, in the sense of the Holy
   Scriptures, than the relation which God as Creator holds to his
   creatures. It is only in a more general sense that God is elsewhere
   called the Father of Spirits, from the peculiar relation of spirits as
   such to the supreme spirit, to Him who is called, absolutely,--The
   Spirit; being in their nature as spirits adapted to reflect the image
   of the eternal, the supreme spirit, and therefore akin to Him, and
   susceptible of a fellowship of life with Him. It is oneness of race, a
   kindred nature, that unites children with parents; so spirits as such
   enjoy the special right, over all the rest of creation, of standing in
   this relation to God, and hence he is called in that more general sense
   their Father. But the race of man had through sin fallen from this
   relation to God; had forfeited that claim founded in their original
   nature, created after the image of God; were no longer partakers in
   that life by which they were akin to the holy God, and by virtue of
   which they might have been worthy to be called his children. It was
   therefore necessary that He, who from his nature is in the absolute
   sense Son of God, and who alone is such, should appear in their flesh
   and blood; that he should impart himself wholly to them, give his life
   for them, make himself entirely their own and unite them as one with
   himself; that as lie is the Son of God, so they, in fellowship with him
   and for his sake, might also become the children of God.

   But the expression is here peculiar; not, they are children of
   God,--but shall be so called. It is an indication, how much is implied
   in the right to bear this name. The name is the sign of the thing, the
   outward expression of the inward reality. The name may be conferred in
   advance; the right to bear it may be given, before that which is
   indicated by the name attains its complete fulfilment and realization.
   The son, destined to succeed to his father's whole property, his
   offices and dignities, receives with the right to bear the name of son,
   the certain pledge that he shall one day come into possession of all.
   So also in the right of believers to be called the children of God,
   there is more involved than in what they now, to appearance, actually
   are. It is their title, given to them of God, to come one day into the
   full possession and use of all which is indicated by this name,--as
   assumed by the Apostle in what immediately follows. Since the outward
   condition of God's children does not here correspond to the dignity
   belonging to this name, to the glory indicated thereby; the Apostle
   therefore first directs the attention of believers to this incongruity,
   that when made aware of it by various painful experiences, they might
   not become unsettled in regard to what is thus conferred on them, but
   rightly understand that this must be so,--that it could not be
   otherwise. They are the object of hatred and persecution to the world;
   they are in perpetual conflict with it. Are they to be disquieted on
   this account? No! This is nothing less than one of the vouchers for the
   great right bestowed on them by the father-love of God, the right to be
   called his children. It is one of the required testimonials, that they
   are truly standing in this relation to God. The dignity to which they
   are appointed, the glory of which they are now the depositories, is one
   which is hidden from the world. The world is far from surmising the
   exalted stand-point in the universe, occupied by the christian. The
   world understands nothing of that by which he is influenced and
   animated, and bestows on it only hatred and contempt. And wherefore? As
   the feeling with which we regard the father is transferred to the son,
   who follows the example and principles of his father; as hatred to the
   father is thus transferred to the son; so the disposition of the world
   towards the children of God, is the same as that towards God himself.
   As the world estranged from God cannot know Him; as even when
   professing a zeal for Him, it honors only that, is zealous only for
   that, which it has made its God, its own self-created idols; as it
   knows nothing of the true God, being estranged from him in the temper
   of the heart; so neither can it recognize the Father in his children,
   the image of God in those who bear it. It misapprehends the divine, for
   the very reason that it is divine. This temper, which separates it from
   God, is the source also of its hostility to the children of God. When,
   therefore, these are misunderstood, hated and persecuted by the world,
   they must not be perplexed and cast down on this account; but,
   perceiving the causes whence such treatment proceeds, must feel
   themselves ennobled by it. They must draw, from this encounter with the
   world, a more deep and living consciousness of that endearing and
   intimate relation to God, which places them in this position towards
   the world.

   But how are we to reconcile with this the prayer offered by Christ as
   High Priest of his people (John xvii. 22, ff.), that the glory bestowed
   by the Father upon him and by him upon believers,--a glory consisting
   in the oneness of believers with him as he is one with the Father,--may
   reflect itself in their life, in their fellowship with one another;
   that they may so testify of Christ, of his divine dignity and mission,
   as to lead the world to the knowledge of him; that the manner in which
   God reveals himself in the living fellowship of believers, may lead the
   world to perceive how much they are the objects of divine love? How are
   the two things to be reconciled, that what is cause of misapprehension
   and persecution to the world, should at the same time be the means by
   which the world is to be led to recognize the revelation of God in his
   children, to awaken desire after a participation in it? In order to
   this, we must distinguish a twofold character in that which is called
   the world. That which makes it such, the source of its hostility to God
   and his kingdom,--this must be distinguished from that which forms in
   the world the transition-point to the kingdom of God, the still
   inherent capacity in man for receiving the divine image, the
   after-working of original relationship to the Divine. In virtue of the
   first, he is only repelled by the Divine in believers, and cannot
   recognize in it the Divine; while through the second, the divine glory,
   as mirrored in the fellowship of christians, exerts its attractive
   force to draw men to the Father, and to the Son who reveals him--the
   point of connection whereby the Father draws them to the Son.

   It is only in the first point of view that the Apostle here speaks of
   the world; and his words have a special reference to the then existing
   relations of Christians to the world. It was then as Jewish or as
   Heathen, that the world presented itself in opposition to Christianity
   and to the fellowship of believers,--to the church of God. Something
   wholly new had made its appearance among men, standing in direct
   contrariety to the spirit by which the world was governed, to its
   convictions, its principles, its morals, its tastes, and to the
   organizations and arrangements of life originating therein. It must
   therefore be misapprehended, hated, and persecuted by the world. The
   recurrence of this same thing is still witnessed in heathen countries,
   where Christianity is first introduced by missions. But it is otherwise
   with those nations which have already long borne the Christian name;
   whose whole history and life, developed under the influence of
   Christianity, are bound up and connected therewith in an unseen, and to
   many, unconscious manner; nations sustained by Christianity as the
   life-element from which the national development and culture, the form
   of national life, originally proceeded. Christianity, when first
   appearing among a people, stands distinctly opposed to the prevailing
   opinions, principles, manners, and social arrangements, which had
   sprung from the root of a totally different religion. But this is not
   so with nations which have, as we have said, long borne the Christian
   name. Much which had its origin in Christianity, has become a part of
   the common national life, entering into its social institutions,
   customs. and modes of thought. Such is that general, world-transforming
   power of Christianity, forever at work in human history, as seen in a
   comparison of nations bearing the Christian name with heathen countries
   whether savage or civilized, especially as represented to us in the
   history of modern missions.

   Do we now, in countries where Christianity has exerted its
   world-transforming power, find still existing this same opposition
   between Christianity and the world, and consequently an application
   here also of the Apostle's words? Or does that spirit, which fills and
   animates the children of God, here find a point of attachment in
   everything around them, thus developed from the all-transforming
   agencies of the Gospel? In regard to this it will forever remain true,
   that no one can become a child of God by natural birth, or in general,
   through anything performed externally, upon the body. On the contrary,
   this is a work which must be wrought from within, through personal
   faith, and the operations of the Holy Spirit. The saying of our Lord:
   "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of
   the spirit is spirit," declares a perpetual contrariety between the
   regenerate and the unregenerate; and consequently, the opposition
   between the children of God and the children of the world is one which
   will forever continue. It matters not whether the world arrays itself
   in open hostility against Christianity; or whether the latter has so
   far extended its all-transforming power, that the world itself has to a
   certain degree become affected by its influence, in many respects
   assimilated to it under the outward form of Christian culture, and now
   wages against it a more covert, unavowed, in part perhaps unconscious
   warfare. Those who belong to God as his children, in whom Christ has
   been truly formed, who in their whole life and being testify of him and
   reflect his image, whom he has chosen and consecrated through the Holy
   Spirit as his instruments in representing and extending his kingdom,
   these will ever feel constrained to maintain a conflict with all which
   is of the world and not from God, in order that they may make it
   subject to the kingdom of God, may through the sword of the Spirit
   subdue it to the obedience of Christ. Such cannot be deceived by that
   outward show of Christianity, in which the world, superficially
   affected by its all-transforming influence, has veiled its own true
   character. They will therefore have to contend with all that is
   unchristian here, not less than among a people never before brought in
   contact with Christianity. What then obtained when these words were
   written, when even externally the heathen world was distinguished from
   Christians dwelling in it, must ever continue even when that external
   distinction has been done away. Hence we see the genuine children of
   God, in all ages, involved in conflict with the world. In proportion as
   the Father is not recognized in his love and holiness, must the
   children, in whom that love and holiness are revealed, be
   misapprehended also. They cannot but be misunderstood. Often are they
   despised, or hated and persecuted; and they must then find their
   consolation in the words here spoken, pointing to that high dignity
   bestowed on them by the Father, as the true ground of this antagonism
   between them and the world.

   This relation of the world to the children of God may exhibit itself
   under two forms. Those who have been affected more or less by this
   general influence, diffused among a Christian people, may be clearly
   conscious of the source of that superiority by which they are
   distinguished from all who belong to pagan nations; or they may
   unconsciously imbibe this influence as an element once introduced into
   the national development, without acknowledging Christianity as its
   source. The former are indeed deeply penetrated by a sense of their
   obligations to Christianity. Though far from recognizing Christ in his
   divine dignity and glory as the Incarnate Word, they yet acknowledge
   him as author of the most salutary revolution in human society. They
   honor and are willing to promote Christianity, as the means of
   diffusing through the life of every people those general moral
   influences which they have themselves felt. But they are unable,
   notwithstanding, to recognize and comprehend those who attach so much
   importance to Christianity, as a whole, in its own peculiar nature; who
   claim for it the entire life, requiring that everything should give
   place to the holy condemnatory earnestness of the Gospel, that
   everything should bow before it. The animating and impelling principle
   by which such are governed, remains to them a mystery; it becomes to
   them a stone of stumbling. Hence arises an opposition between these two
   classes; an opposition all the more bitter for the very reason, that
   those who are conscious of that general influence of Christianity upon
   the formation of their character, suppose that with this they have all
   they need; resenting it as a heavy offence if more is required of them,
   if they are not regarded, on account of what they already have, as
   children of God. Those who confront them with the Gospel in all the
   earnestness of its demands, are accused of putting something else in
   its place, of making the way to the kingdom of God too narrow; just as
   the Jews, having received so much that was akin to Christianity from
   the Law and the Prophets, and deeming this all-sufficient, hated him in
   whom they were fulfilled, and reproached him as being himself an enemy
   to the Law and the Prophets.

   If now we turn to the second case, this too we shall find may assume a
   twofold form. It may be that those who share in spiritual blessings,
   which the people to whom they belong have attained only through the
   educating influence of Christianity, do indeed acknowledge this agency;
   but they suppose, the possession once secured, the nation needs this
   influence no longer. Though recognizing it as a means ordained by
   Providence for bringing humanity up to this stage of development, they
   believe that Christianity has now accomplished its work. Its highest
   mission was to make itself superfluous,--by cultivating the nations to
   that state of maturity and self-dependence which they have now
   attained. This is one case. In the other, not even so much as this is
   conceded to Christianity. It is not recognized as the source of those
   blessings, which through its world-transforming influence have become
   the property of the nations. Their connection with the agency of
   Christianity is regarded merely as accidental; and a release from its
   restrictive yoke would, in the view of such, be followed by a more
   complete and happy national development. But as the fruit of a tree can
   only prosper in connection with the trunk and root, and with the
   fruit-producing sap which diffuses itself from the root through the
   trunk and all its branches; so these fruits also will soon vanish, if
   connection with their root, which is Christianity, is no longer
   maintained and kept alive in the national consciousness. Here too will
   the words of the Lord be verified: "He that hath not, from him shall be
   taken that which he hath." What is thus torn asunder from the root of
   Christianity, having become thereby something wholly different, having
   been deprived of its true nature and significance, will run more and
   more into the form of decided opposition to Christianity. The world,
   not being led up from that general reformatory influence of
   Christianity to its true inward nature, will throw off more and more
   even its outward appearance, and the concealed hostility will become an
   open one,--a result which we see fast preparing in our own day. And
   thus, what is here taught of the warfare between the children of God
   and the children of the world, and should serve as a ground of
   consolation in this conflict, will again find its full application in
   the case of each individual, so soon as he has made his choice between
   these two adverse forces, which are every day coming into more direct
   conflict.

   While thus contemplating the children of God at their present
   stand-point of conflict with the world, the Apostle marks the
   distinction between the present and the future. He leads their thoughts
   to that still concealed and undeveloped future, which they bear within
   themselves. We have already, he says, the inward assurance of that
   which to us is above all else, of which no one can rob us, that we are
   the children of God. Herein is contained the germ of all which is to be
   developed in the future, in eternal life, even to the completion of the
   kingdom of God; but the whole extent of what is thus bestowed, the
   fulness of the glory of the children of God, is as yet veiled even from
   themselves, much more from the world which knows them not. We indeed
   know already, would the Apostle say, what we ARE; but it is not yet
   revealed what we shall be. As it is said to be a revelation of Christ,
   when he shall show himself openly in his yet hidden glory; so of the
   children of God, it is said that they shall be REVEALED, when their
   glory, now veiled and hidden from view, shall be brought forth to
   light. Of what shall then follow, the Apostle says: "We shall be like
   him, for we shall see him as he is."

   The question may arise, to whom is the pronoun here to be referred, to
   Christ or to God? What the Apostle says would be strictly true, and
   might be said with perfect propriety, in either case. The two stand in
   close connection also,--indeed each is necessarily involved in the
   other. For perfect likeness to God is inseparable from likeness to
   Christ, through which as a mediate agency it is produced; so also, to
   behold God stands in close connection with beholding Christ, through
   which in like manner it is effected. We must consider, however,--not
   what the Apostle might in any connection have said, not what is in
   itself a truly apostolic thought and in the spirit of John,--but what
   in this particular connection was present to his mind. The reference to
   God being here the predominant one, what is comprehended in the idea of
   his children being the subject of consideration, it is manifestly their
   relation to God which is here before the mind of the Apostle. To Him,
   therefore, the pronoun must be referred.

   As the image of the father is presented in the son, and the son is
   recognized by his likeness to the father; so the Apostle makes the full
   revelation of the children of God, as such, to consist in perfect
   likeness to their Father. It is implied, therefore, that the dignity of
   the children of God is still imperfect and obscured, because their
   likeness to God is not complete,--because they do not yet perfectly
   reflect the image of God their Father. This likeness to God as their
   Father, must indeed be gradually developed in their entire nature,
   after the model image of Christ, whereby everything human in them is to
   be transformed and glorified into a revelation of the divine nature, is
   to be made divine. All that has its origin in the old man, and is not
   yet wholly overcome and rooted out, stands ever opposed to this
   assimilation of believers to God. The perfected glory of the children
   of God is therefore identical with perfect likeness to God. That which
   obscures the one, stands opposed also to the complete realization of
   the other. In that one thing all is included. Complete likeness to God
   is, moreover, represented by the Apostle as the consequence of our
   seeing the Father as he is. We have here a promise, transcending all
   that the human spirit is able to conceive or hope; as that which is
   promised answers to the profoundest longings of the spirit thirsting
   and fainting after God. The immediate, perfect knowledge of God as he
   is,--this bewilders and confounds all finite conception. It seems
   irreconcilable with the infinitude of the divine nature, and the
   narrowness of finite creatures. Under the old dispensation, it had been
   said that no mortal could behold God; the vision of God was regarded as
   something, before which the elements of human nature must dissolve
   away. But now the Eternal Word,--He who was with God and was himself
   God, the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father and has
   alone known or could know him,--He having taken upon himself our
   nature, and God having thereby entered into this most intimate and
   endearing union with it; the chasm is now closed, which divided between
   God and the created spirit. Like Christ himself, shall they who stand
   in fellowship with him, attain through him to the immediate and perfect
   vision of God, to whom even here below they are united in faith and
   love.

   What we possess, in this glorious prospect, we best learn from contrast
   with two opposite errors of human opinion, between which Christianity
   alone shows us the proper medium. The one bearing the name of Deism, is
   seen in the vain effort to reach, through the idea of an unknown and
   far off God, the true conception of that felicity, a longing after
   which is so deeply implanted in the spirit of man. While allowing to
   the glorified soul progressive development in perfection, to move
   onward from world to world, it still leaves it forever at an infinite
   distance from God; the idea of such a perfect, immediate vision of God
   is far beyond its flight. The other error is that of Pantheism; which,
   knowing not the God who is at once near and afar off, the God
   everywhere present who is at the same time God in Heaven, mingles God
   and the universe into one (as does also a false mysticism);
   annihilating the personality of the created spirit, it resolves it
   wholly into God, thereby destroying likewise the idea of the living God
   himself, who is not a God of the dead but of the living.

   On the contrary, the promise of the Gospel presents to us, as the aim
   of the created spirit ripening to perfection, an immediate and perfect
   intuition of the Divine Being, with the removal of all those temporal
   bounds in which our present consciousness is yet confined. It will be a
   knowledge of God no longer fragmentary, no longer borrowed from the
   imperfect mirror and the broken rays of this our temporal
   consciousness, but as He is in himself, in his essential nature; a
   knowing of God so immediate that, as the Apostle Paul says, we shall
   know Him as we are known of Him, as He is known of himself. Still, we
   shall remain forever distinct from him, in a glorified personal
   existence; otherwise, it would not be eternal life, but mere
   annihilation. What John here certifies is this: that in the perfect
   intuition of God lies the ground of our own personal perfection; that
   as personal existences, created in the image of God, we are to become
   perfectly like him. The two are placed by John in the closest
   connection; the perfect intuition of God and, as proceeding therefrom,
   a perfect transformation into his image, the oneness of life between
   the beholder and the beheld. The beholding of God must react upon the
   beholder, transforming him into that which is the object of
   contemplation, assimilating him to that which he beholds,--and the
   perfect perception can proceed only from affinity of life. It implies
   the removal from the life as from the perception, of all which might
   separate, a perfect unity between the two. Life and perception are here
   entirely one. So in our Saviour's words: it is the pure in heart who
   shall see God; by which he too expresses the sum of all blessedness.
   And as progress in the knowledge of God, proceeding as it does from
   fellowship of life with God, is dependent upon the progressive
   purification and development of the christian life, the life of
   likeness to God; so at the last consummating point, are perfect
   intuition of God and perfect likeness to God made coincident with each
   other.

   Throughout this Epistle promise, and exhortation to that which is made
   the condition of the promise, engrafting themselves one upon the other,
   are found constantly in close connection. So also here, upon this
   highest promise follows the exhortation based on the condition of its
   fulfilment. The present and future, the beginning and end, are united
   by an indissoluble bond. All which is to be perfected in eternal life
   must already be possessed here in the germ; and by an ever-progressive
   development out of the germ, must it attain to that final limit of
   complete maturity. Since now perfect likeness to God consists in
   perfect holiness, it is through progressive sanctification in this life
   the way must be prepared for that final consummation, the unobstructed
   vision of God in perfect likeness to him. Hence John says: that he who
   has this hope towards Him, the Father,--the hope that through Christ's
   promised grace, he shall attain to that glory of the children of God,
   which consists in perfect likeness to the Father and in the perfect
   vision of Him as He is,--he will be impelled by such a hope to become
   holy as Christ is holy, after the model image of Christ which is ever
   before his eye. He will purify himself, more and more, from all that
   obscures the reflection of that holy image; that when made like to him
   who is the perfect likeness of the Father, he may attain in him,
   through him, and with him, to the vision of the Father as he is.

   Ch. iii. 4-7.] This exhortation is continued in the following words.
   "Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the
   transgression of the law. And ye know that he was manifested to take
   away our sins; and in him is no sin. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth
   not: whosoever sinneth, hath not seen him, neither known him. Little
   children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is
   righteous, even as he is righteous."

   It is obvious from the Apostle's mode of expression, when urging upon
   Christians this earnest striving for holiness, this shunning of all
   that is sinful,--that he must have had cause for it in the adverse
   influence which some were exerting, and from which there was reason to
   apprehend a diminution of moral earnestness, a laxity of moral judgment
   in the church. The Apostle is warning his brethren against certain
   seducers. These were the promoters of that externalized and formal
   Christianity, of which we have spoken in the Introduction. Already, at
   this early period, had such appeared in the churches. Unable to
   comprehend the full extent of what was included in separation from
   heathenism, they taught that no more was required, than the abandonment
   of idol worship with all that pertained to it, and a profession of
   faith in one God and in Jesus as the Messiah; without recognizing that
   the Christian life as a whole, in its entire consecration to God,
   belongs to this separation from heathenism. From the Jews, chiefly,
   proceeded these superficial and outward tendencies in religion, which
   rested in a mere external faith, external profession, and external
   fulfilment of the law. These are the vain words against which Paul
   warns his Ephesian brethren (Eph. v. 6), when declaring that the wrath
   of God comes upon the children of disobedience, not merely on account
   of idolatry, but also of all the sins connected with it. Here now the
   Apostle asserts with special emphasis, that all sin whatever is
   unrighteousness (as Luther translates it), or as it should be in
   accordance with the Greek original, contrariety to law, transgression
   of the divine law. We might naturally infer from this, that the Apostle
   was dealing with such as did not comprehend the idea of the divine law
   in its whole dignity and majesty, as embracing all which is requisite
   to the full realization of the divine will, as being the full
   revelation of God's holiness in the mirror of its demands on man; such
   as explained the commands of God in a gross and merely external manner,
   which rendered it easy to satisfy their demands without coming thereby
   any nearer to the true nature of holy living. Such a conception of the
   Law is condemned by Christ in the Sermon on the Mount. It was from the
   stand-point of such a superficial conception of the Law, that the rich
   young man in the Gospel (Matt. xix. 17, ff.) could suppose that from
   his youth he had fulfilled all its requirements; a conception which has
   often been reproduced in the church, and with the uniform effect of
   making obedience to the Law easy, of lowering the requirements of
   Christianity to each one's life, and thus enabling him the more readily
   to appease his conscience. In christian self-examination and
   self-knowledge, all depends upon a right understanding and clear view
   of the nature of the Law, which must be ever present before the eye of
   the believer, as the mirror in which to contemplate himself and his
   life. The careful daily study of that holy interpretation of the Law,
   contained in our Lord's Sermon on the Mount, will above all else aid us
   in this duty.

   Such, then, had made their appearance in John's sphere of labor, as
   thus externalized and degraded the conception of the divine Law;
   lowering the standard of moral judgment, and recognizing only in
   various outbreaking sins transgressions of that law. It was necessary,
   therefore, that John should oppose their influence by holding up sin in
   its character as sin,--all sin as equally transgression of the divine
   Law. In judging of the moral character of men, regard should indeed be
   had to differences of gradation in moral development; and of this the
   Apostle himself will by and by give us occasion to speak. Yet is it of
   the greatest importance to a right view of the true nature of
   sanctification, and for that strict self-examination which is the
   condition of all progress therein, that we first understand the equal
   dignity of the divine Law in all its commands; that the obedience it
   requires is absolute, and embraces the whole life. There is here no
   distinction between great and small; all sin, as proceeding from the
   same fountain the depraved creature-will, that which the Scriptures
   call the flesh in opposition to the spirit, as violation of the divine
   will, transgression of the divine law, is on the same level. This is
   the precise point of view established by John in these words.

   He then proceeds to show, how irreconcilable is the tendency here
   rebuked with the nature of faith in Jesus, as the Lord and Saviour;
   that this faith cannot maintain itself without the earnest striving for
   sanctification, without the shunning of all sin; what a contradiction
   in the very nature of things it would be, to desire still to remain in
   the service of any sin, while professing adherence to Jesus as the
   Saviour. He takes for his starting-point: Jesus has appeared to take
   away our sins. It is here represented as the highest aim of the
   appearing of Christ, to take away all sin from humanity, and (the same
   idea under the positive form) to found a kingdom of holiness in man.
   This thought is, in itself, a sufficient demonstration, that its origin
   is not of earth but of Heaven, the demonstration of its own divinity.
   It is a thought which could never have arisen in the sin-polluted mind
   of man. He who could conceive it, would thereby already have
   demonstrated his superhuman greatness. To be able to express such a
   thought, in the midst of a sinful race, involves the consciousness not
   only of its superhuman origin, but also of superhuman powers to achieve
   its realization. It marks a new era in history; that henceforth, for
   those who appropriate to themselves the work of Christ and enter into
   fellowship with him, Evil and Sin are as if they were not, as if wholly
   and forever taken away. Not only shall sin no longer have dominion over
   them, but former sin shall be as if it had not been, as if annihilated.
   In regard to the expression, "to take away our sins," a comparison with
   the original Greek, and with John's language elsewhere, leads us to
   refer the conception underlying it to Christ. It is He, who by entering
   into fellowship with man's sinful nature, and thus acquiring a living
   sympathy with all the misery brought upon it by sin, became conscious
   in his sufferings of a connection with the sin of humanity. Through his
   fellowship with that nature which he had adopted, he bore the guilt by
   which humanity was burdened, and felt it as his own; as indicated by
   those words upon the cross: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken
   me!" It was thus that he took upon himself and bore the sins of men,
   and therefore he is said to have taken away our sins. So the sin of the
   people was, in a symbolical and typical manner, laid as it were upon
   the sacrificial victim to be borne and expiated by it. But in order
   that Christ might thus take away the sins of man, it was requisite, as
   the Apostle subsequently indicates, that in himself there should be no
   sin. He must be the Sinless, the Holy One, in order as such to suffer
   for the sins in which he had himself no share; to take them away, and
   set over against them a life of perfect holiness answering to the
   divine law; to be able, in the fulfilment of that law, to do for all
   and in place of all, what all mankind should have done each for
   himself.

   Since then it is as the Holy One that Jesus has taken away the sins of
   men, the Apostle infers that none can stand in fellowship with him, who
   perseveres henceforward in the way of sin. He declares, in the most
   absolute manner, that he who abides in fellowship with him sinneth not.
   To sin, and to abide in fellowship with the Holy One, who appeared for
   the very purpose of taking away sin, are things irreconcilable. To
   belong to him, is to be separated from all sin. The life which exists
   in fellowship with him excludes all sin. This assertion is subsequently
   repeated by the Apostle, in order to enforce it with the strongest
   emphasis, in the negative form: "Whosoever sinneth hath not seen Him,
   neither known Him." This seeing indicates, as we have before noticed,
   not bodily sight which cannot here be meant, but inward vision, a
   seeing with the eye of the spirit. From the distinction here made
   between seeing and knowing, it is evident that something more is meant
   by seeing Christ than by knowing him; as indeed elsewhere John is
   accustomed to represent by sight a higher stage of knowledge, that
   immediate spiritual perception which rises above mediate knowledge. If
   through the preaching of the Gospel the knowledge of Christ has been
   attained, there will follow that higher spiritual intuition of Him, as
   manifested in his divine-human life, as He was and is. Such a living
   image of Christ, enchaining the soul, must be ever present to the
   spiritual gaze of the believer. But this can only be the case with him,
   whose life-walk is in harmony with this holy model. He who continues in
   sin, though he may outwardly have confessed Christ, can never truly
   have beheld this image; nay, he is still far even from knowing him as
   the Holy One who appeared to take away the sins of man. Such an one, in
   place of the true and living Christ, has devised for himself another
   and fictitious one.

   Accordingly, John adds a protest against the vain words of those who
   lower the demands of the Gospel upon the christian life, representing a
   mere outward profession as that whereby christians are separated from
   the sinful heathen world, and entitled to contrast themselves as
   righteous with the sinners of Heathenism. He asserts, on the contrary,
   that it is only through the practice of righteousness, through a
   life-walk conformed thereto, that one can prove himself a righteous
   man. This, however, by no means harmonizes with the doctrine, that only
   through the fulfilment of righteousness, only through a course of
   action, one can become righteous. In all that is here said, there is
   presupposed that righteousness which has its root in fellowship with
   Christ, the new life proceeding from him and formed after his holy
   image. What he would enforce is this: that this inward
   righteousness,--originating in fellowship with Christ, and
   distinguishing the new stand-point of life from the former one,--can
   not be present without revealing itself in the outward life; that as
   the image of Christ the Righteous, the Holy, is transferred to the
   inner life of the believer, no one can stand in fellowship with him
   without showing himself, in his life-walk, to be righteous even as
   Christ is righteous.

   It may appear strange, that the Apostle should so absolutely and
   unconditionally exclude all sin from the christian life; should seem to
   assert that it must correspond, in entire and unspotted righteousness,
   to the holy image of Christ. And yet, in what precedes he has given his
   readers to understand, that the christian life is one which still needs
   a purifying process. But it was here the Apostle's first object, in
   opposition to that laxness of moral views, that compromise with sin, to
   bring before the mind the full scope of what is involved in the
   essential nature and idea of Sin and of Righteousness; to exhibit, in
   its whole strictness and majesty, the claim upon the christian life
   arising from fellowship with Christ, from faith in him as the Redeemer.
   This is the same point of view which Christ takes in the Sermon on the
   Mount. The christian life, as such, in its essential nature and idea as
   a life of righteousness after the image of Christ, is in itself the
   opposite to all sin; and in this view, no difference of moral gradation
   can be made, although in the actual life such gradations are found to
   exist. It was the first object to bring out clearly, in the full import
   and extent of their contrariety, the stand-point of the old and that of
   the new man. From such a view it will always follow, that the
   determining tendency of the christian life, of the will in the
   christian, can be no other than holy and averse to sin; that only the
   after-workings of the former relation of sin, of the old man, oppose
   themselves to what is now his determining and controlling tendency.

   Ch. iii. 8.]It was here then the Apostle's object to draw the
   separating line between these two radical tendencies, in reference to
   holiness and sin, in its full breadth and force. Hence the
   unconditional contrast in which he presents those who abide in
   fellowship with Christ, those who are born of God, the children of
   God,--and those who are of the devil, who make themselves known by
   their lives as children of the devil. What then does he understand by
   the devil? He designates him as the one who sinneth "from the
   beginning." If we take the expression, from the beginning," in an
   absolute and unlimited sense, and follow it out to its necessary
   results, we must understand by Satan a spirit in his origin and essence
   the opposite to the holy God, evil in his very nature, in his whole
   being and essence the representative of evil; and consequently two
   original Principles of Being, a good and an evil, must be admitted. But
   from a comparison with the Apostle's whole mode of conception, and with
   his ideas of the creation, it is clear that such a view is wholly
   foreign to him; for he derives all existence simply from God and his
   Word, and consequently can recognize no Being co-existent with God.
   Since, moreover, he regards God as absolutely Light, to whom all
   darkness is alien,--as the Holy One from whom, nothing evil can
   proceed,--he must, while recognizing God as sole creator of all
   existing things assume that all things as they proceeded from Him were
   created good. He cannot, therefore, admit that, an originally evil
   spirit was, as such, created by God. And farther still, the Johannic
   conception of sin is inconsistent with such an idea of a sinner from
   the beginning, of a being originally evil. For the idea of sin implies
   transgression of the divine law, by a spirit created to fulfil the law,
   one in whose consciousness the divine law was, present as a law for
   himself. It is rebellion of the creature-will against the divine will
   to which it should be subject. All this is comprehended by John in the
   idea of sin when predicated of man. In all this there is implied a
   spirit created by God originally good, who through the misuse of his
   own free will rebelled against the divine will. And thus also the
   supposition of an originally evil Principle is seen to be inadmissible.
   We must accordingly understand by the expression, "sinneth from the
   beginning," not that the devil sins on evermore from the beginning of
   his existence as a spirit, but from the time when, through the apostacy
   of his will from God, he became what he is, the Devil; SINNING, through
   the steady persistence of his will in a course at variance with his
   original nature, a variance involved in the idea of sin, having become
   his second nature, his element of life. The expression, "from the
   beginning," is justified moreover on this ground: that the origin of
   all sin is from the devil; that through him sin first entered the
   universe, and the first beginning of sin in the human race also was
   brought about by his intervention. Hence all sin is an imitation of
   Satan, a reflection of his image, the work of the same spirit, of that
   selfish tendency in the creature by which it renounced its natural
   dependence on God, made itself law, end, centre to itself, instead of
   referring as its destiny required the whole life to God alone, and
   making him its law, end and centre. This tendency having first
   proceeded from the Devil, he is consequently regarded as its
   representative; all which is done from this disposition is referred
   back to him, and viewed as the work of the spirit which shows itself
   operative in him, which first came into being in him. But it is
   characteristic of John to seek only the practical-religious point of
   view, to apprehend everything in its bearing on the christian life, its
   influence upon sanctification,--and to refrain from questions relating
   merely to matters of knowledge without practical importance. He
   therefore pursues no farther the inquiry, what the devil originally was
   in relation to the rest of the spirit-world. He only exhibits what is
   here of practical weight, viz. the connection of all sin with him from
   whom sin first proceeded,--with that sinning of the devil from the
   beginning. It is no mere matter of speculation, it is something
   practical y important,--important in respect to the consciousness of
   sin--that we go beyond its present manifestation in man, and behold in
   Satan its essential nature. Thus while viewing sin as the act of a
   spirit gifted with higher powers, created originally good, we shall
   become more clearly aware of its true nature, as a revolt of the
   creature-will against the supreme will of God which all should obey, as
   a voluntary transgression of the holy law given by God to all rational
   beings. Learning thus to understand Evil in its whole fathomless depth,
   as guilty estrangement from God, we shall thereby be guarded against
   the error, so prejudicial to moral earnestness, of regarding evil as
   merely an infirmity, an overpowering of the Rational by the
   Sensual;--as nothing more than a product of the sensual nature in man.

   With this aim,--to show the incompatibility of all sin with the
   christian life, and arouse the christian to the conscious necessity of
   avoiding all contact with sin, as something diametrically opposed to
   the position of the child of God, to the life which is in him,--John
   refers every sin, without distinction between great and small, to the
   same origin, the one radical tendency expressed in all sins, to the
   devil who sinneth from the beginning. By sinning, one puts himself on
   an equality with the devil, shows himself to be one of his adherents,
   to be governed by his spirit. That which constitutes the characteristic
   of the devil is the operative principle in all sin, viz. this same
   radical tendency of self-will in the creature resisting the holy
   ordinance of God. Since now the Apostle derives all sin from the devil,
   and in all sin recognizes the kingdom of the devil; as in all the evil
   which reigned in the human race until Christ's appearing he sees the
   influence of that kingdom, the progressive working of the disorder
   introduced by the devil into the world; he therefore says, that the Son
   of God has appeared to undo, to destroy, the works of the devil. The
   expressions, "to take away the sins of men," and "to destroy the works
   of the devil," are employed by John with the same general import. After
   having exhibited sin in connection with the devil, these expressions
   could now be interchanged. As he here contemplates evil, not merely as
   manifested on earth, but in its more general connection with the
   development-history of the universe, of which indeed revelation unveils
   only such a fragment as is demanded for our practical religious
   necessities; so also does his designation of Christ's work of
   redemption, include that more general reference to the history of the
   universe, and of the kingdom of God in its widest sense. It is here
   represented as the highest aim of the appearing of Christ, to destroy
   all which is the work of Satan, all evil,--the triumphant establishment
   of the kingdom of God on the ruins of Satan's kingdom. Since then
   Christ appeared to do away all sin as the work of the devil; it clearly
   follows, that only he who renounces all sin as the work of the devil
   can share in the work of Christ, can receive in himself the fulfilment
   of the purpose for which Christ appeared.

   Ch. iii. 9.] Whilst he thus shows the total contrariety between the
   children of God and the children of the devil, between him that doeth
   righteousness and him that sinneth, the Apostle says: "Whosoever is
   born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him; and he
   cannot sin, because he is born of God." John here first certifies a
   matter of fact; he states a practical proposition, viz. that he who is
   born of God,--as being born of God,--sinneth not. The ground of this is
   stated in the declaration which follows, that in such the seed of God
   remaineth. The figure of seed, so often employed in the Scriptures, is
   usually taken from husbandry. Thus in the parables of our Lord, the
   word of God is compared to the seed, the soul to the ground in which
   the seed is scattered, the difference of susceptibility for receiving
   the word of God to varieties of soil. But this, obviously, is not the
   allusion here. It is not men represented as recipients of the seed, and
   deporting themselves variously in respect to its reception; it is the
   believer begotten from the seed. The allusion is manifestly to the seed
   in human generation, as in John i. 13. The seed of God is the divine
   life derived from God and imparted through Christ, from which proceeds
   the new birth, regeneration, and which constitutes those to whom it is
   imparted children of God. Having by the reception of this divine life
   been born of God and become children of God, so long as the divine
   seed, the new divine life abides and continues operative in them
   penetrating their whole nature, they cannot but remain children of God
   and manifest themselves as such. Since now this seed from God stands as
   the exact opposite of the life which is kindred to that of the devil,
   to all which is sin; it is obvious that the children of God sin not,
   since this new life, the very thing which constitutes them children of
   God, excludes from itself all sin. Having stated this practical
   proposition, he proceeds to prove that it must of necessity be so, that
   it cannot be otherwise. Such an one cannot sin. It is in the nature of
   the case impossible that he should sin, because he is born of God;
   because this being born of God stands in direct contradiction with sin.
   Sin cannot proceed from it, can find no point of connection in it. As
   nothing Undivine, but only what is Divine, can proceed from the divine
   life, so from those who are born of God, as such, there can proceed no
   sin.

   Ch. iii. 10.] John now places these two classes of men in contrast with
   each other: "Herein is manifest who are the children of God and who are
   the children of the devil." Thus he divides the whole human race
   between these two diametrically opposite classes, the children of God
   and the children of the devil. But is there, then, only this one
   distinction among men? Is there nothing intermediate, are there no
   points of transition, between the two classes? If so, it would be
   impossible to explain, how children of God could be formed from
   children of the devil, how a transition from the one class to the other
   could be effected. And yet John assumes such a possibility in the
   recognition of the fact, that such as served sin and belonged to the
   kingdom of Satan, to the kingdom of the world, have through faith in
   Jesus as the Saviour withdrawn therefrom, and have become children of
   God. By saying that the Son of God has appeared to destroy the works of
   the devil, he says virtually, that he appeared in order to make those
   children of God who hitherto were children of the devil. There must
   then exist a point of attachment, whereby those who are as yet children
   of the devil become susceptible to the influence of the Son of God.
   There must somewhere be a ground for the fact, that some remain
   children of the devil, while others receive the seed of God and thereby
   suffer themselves to be made children of God. Or are we to say, that
   this ground lies not in the previous differences of susceptibility in
   men, but only in the sovereign agency of God; that it is alone that it
   is alone the work of transforming grace whereby this difference is
   produced, and the children of the devil are re-created into children of
   God? But this is in contrariety with what John says, of the divine
   Father-love towards the whole human race which it seeks to redeem, of
   the scope of Christ's work of redemption which takes in all humanity;
   that the object of his appearing in humanity is to destroy all the
   works of the devil, to make an end of evil universally. It is not
   therefore in the divine purpose taken by itself, but in the treatment
   of it by men themselves, that we must look for the cause why some
   attain, while others do not, to a participation in that which the love
   of God has proffered to all. John could not, moreover, have spoken of a
   judgment everywhere connected with the preaching of the Gospel, and
   going side by side with it (as in John iii. 19), if all men deported
   themselves alike towards the preaching of the Gospel; if God himself,
   by his almighty agency, alone made the difference between them; if this
   difference had not its ground in themselves, being brought to light
   through the judicial power of the Gospel by means of the various
   positions taken by men in respect to it,--the sifting process effected
   by the Gospel. Thus we are led. by John himself,--though he only
   presents in general the contrast between children of the devil and
   children of God, the regenerate and the unregenerate,--to add to this
   radical contrariety still another distinction, whereby it becomes
   possible that from children of the devil can be formed children of God.
   The Gospel of John contains many an index to the clearer recognition of
   these differences, these intervening steps. From that being BORN OF GOD
   which can alone be effected through the agency of the Gospel, through
   faith in the Son of God, is to be distinguished a preliminary state
   which is designated as a BEING OF GOD,--a BEING OF THE TRUTH (John
   xviii. 37); whereby is meant that susceptibility for what is divine,
   for the truth, which leads those who possess it, before they are yet
   born of God in that higher sense, to follow the call of the Gospel when
   extended to them. To this addresses itself that DRAWING by the Father
   which takes place in their souls made thus susceptible through the bent
   of the will, and by which they are led to the Son. The judgment, the
   sifting attributed to the Gospel, is effected simply by the development
   through its agency of the already existing but hitherto concealed
   diversity among men, in respect to the bent of the will. This is
   exhibited in the difference of their bearing towards the Gospel,
   according to the difference of their susceptibility for it; some hating
   and resisting the dawning light, on account of its contrariety to the
   darkness which they love and do not desire to forsake, and to the works
   of darkness which thus exposed are brought into condemnation; while
   others joyfully accept the light after which, consciously or
   unconsciously, they had already longed. (John iii. 20, 21.)

   We have seen that in the children of God, although their determining
   tendency is that which has its origin in the birth from God, that of
   the divine life, yet all is not as yet in harmony with this tendency.
   From that which characterizes them as children of God,--that which
   belongs to the animating principle in them, to their new spiritual
   self, their new regenerated personality,--must be distinguished that
   which proceeds from the after-working of the former state. So also in
   those, who under that general classification still belong to the
   children of the devil, must be distinguished something which proceeds
   not from him; something which is to be ascribed to their original
   descent from God, the obscured but still underlying image of God, which
   darkened though it be has not ceased to exert its influence. And
   according as men, through that in them which is of the devil follow the
   spirit of the devil, or through that in them which still proceeds from
   the obscured image of God follow the leading of God, will result a
   division among those who seem collectively to belong to the children of
   the devil. But why then does John make only this general distinction?
   For this reason: that it is of practical importance, first of all, to
   show in the strongest possible light the contrariety between the new
   christian stand-point and the former one of the old man, that each may
   be fully aware how he is to distinguish himself from all others as a
   child of God. The obliteration of this distinction has uniformly
   exerted the most pernicious influence in respect to the demands upon
   the christian life, to the strictness of self-examination. It is all
   important that we learn first to separate light and darkness, the
   Divine and the Undivine, totally from each other; to repel all
   reconciliation and agreement between these fundamentally opposed
   directions, as viewed in the whole strength of their contrariety.
   Unconditional decision is here required. It is important that we learn
   to recognize, in all evil, this determining tendency by which the
   children of the devil are manifested as such, in order that we may be
   secured against the danger of yielding in any manner to the evil, even
   when disguised under seeming good; lest hurried along farther and
   farther we at length wholly succumb to the power, which when first
   approached we did not recognize, and which now over-masters us because
   we did not then sufficiently resist it. It is for this reason so
   important to our own security, as an incitement to constant
   watchfulness over ourselves, that the distinction here made between the
   children of God and the children of the devil,--and this distinction as
   manifested in the outward life,--be apprehended by us in its full force
   and ever borne in mind as a matter of living consciousness. If we
   contemplate history, not as developing itself in gradual manifestations
   and with its final decisions yet concealed, but as it is presented to
   the divine view; it may indeed be said, that those who are adapted and
   destined, through their still latent susceptibility, to become children
   of God when reached by the preaching of the Gospel, are already present
   to his omniscient eye as his children. Thus contemplating what is
   gradually developed to human view, by the judicial potency of the
   Gospel, as being ever open to the eye of God, we shall be able to
   explain those intervening and transitional points in that general
   contrariety, and to find in them a distinction plainly involved in the
   Apostle's view.

   To bring out this generic distinction still more strongly, John now
   adds a specific mark by which it may be recognized: "He that doeth not
   righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother."
   The Apostle here resumes the general distinction, in order to trace
   back righteousness in the abstract, to that concrete which is always
   contemplated by him as the soul of all righteousness,--that which is in
   itself the fulfilment of all righteousness, the one thing which
   suffices in place of all, viz. Brotherly-Love.

   Ch. iii. 11, 12.] This forms the transition to what follows, the
   representation of love as the distinguishing the characteristic mark of
   the christian relation: "For this is the message which ye have heard
   from the beginning, that we should love one another. Not as Cain, who
   was of that wicked one, and slew his brother."

   Here again, in his peculiar mode of conception, John passes over the
   manifold gradations in actual life, and apprehends the moral opposites
   in their most sharply defined contrariety, as it is founded in the
   essential nature of the inward disposition. With him, this root of the
   inward disposition is the all in all; and accordingly he contrasts
   hatred with the principle of brotherly love. He recognizes no
   intervening stand-point. Where love is wanting, selfishness is the
   governing principle, making the individual the centre of all, referring
   all to itself; and hence the effort to remove out of the way whatever
   stands opposed to its own selfish interests. It can tolerate no
   competitor, nothing which is not subservient to itself; and hence it
   becomes hatred towards another, when through him these selfish
   interests are endangered. Hatred too, he apprehends at the culminating
   point of manifestation, since out of hatred proceeds murder; and
   accordingly he names, as the representative of those motives of conduct
   which are opposed to love, him who first actualized such a disposition,
   and who is exhibited in the Scriptures as the first who shed another's
   blood. Thus the Apostle everywhere apprehends moral opposites in the
   deepest root of the disposition. To Love, ready to surrender life for
   another's good, he opposes Hate, which for itself would sacrifice the
   life of another. Where love is not the animating principle, there rules
   selfishness with hatred in its bosom; and hatred, at the culminating
   point of its manifestation, is murder. In the germ, the disposition,
   murder exists there already. The germ needs only to be fully developed
   in order to become murder. In the want of Brotherly-love, in hatred, we
   behold the root whose fruit is murder. Thus the highest moral tribunal
   regards not the act, but condemns in its first germ the disposition out
   of which the act proceeds. Before this tribunal every emotion of hatred
   appears as murder. John here follows the standard of moral judgment
   employed by Christ in the Sermon on the Mount. And thus the children of
   God, whose animating spirit is love, are set in contrast with those who
   are of the evil one, the children of the devil, in whom hate governs as
   in Cain their representative.

   Ch. iii. 12-15.] The Apostle is led by this to contemplate Christians
   in their contrariety to the to the world. The transition is suggested
   by the contrariety between Cain and Abel. "And wherefore slew he him?
   Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. Marvel
   not, my brethren, if the world hate you." As Abel is the type of the
   children of God, Cain the type of the children of the devil,, so in
   their relation to each other is exhibited the relation of Christians to
   the world. As Cain hated and murdered Abel on account of the
   contrariety between the godly and the ungodly disposition, so does the
   world hate and murder the children of God on account of the same
   contrariety. The world and the children of God are, like love and
   selfishness, in perpetual conflict with each other. Hence it need not
   surprise Christians to find themselves hated by the world; they must
   expect it beforehand, as a consequence of the contrariety of their
   spirit to that of the world. It is the stamp of the divine life, whose
   impress constitutes them the opposite of the world. Hence the words
   which follow: "We know that we have passed from death unto life,
   because we love the brethren. Whoso loveth not his brother abideth in
   death. Whoso hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no
   murderer bath eternal life abiding in him." To John, the love of God
   alone appears as life absolutely; and the true life of the God-allied
   spirit can consist only in fellowship with God, in participation in the
   divine life. All life apart from this fellowship,--the life of the
   spirit abandoned to itself, referring only to itself,--being an
   estrangement from that which is and can alone be the spirit's true
   life, and is for the spirit Death. The world, as estranged from God,
   has therefore fallen a prey to death. Christians also were once, as
   belonging to the world, subject to the same death. Being separated from
   the world by faith, and becoming partakers of fellowship with God
   through Christ, they have passed from death unto life. While yet here
   below, they possess in themselves this true divine life; and as the
   seeming life of the world, which is but death, makes itself known by
   the want of love, by the selfish nature, hatred; so on the other hand,
   love is the characteristic mark of the true divine life. Herein
   therefore must the contrariety, between those who have attained to the
   true life and those who are still in a state of death, make itself
   manifest. He who loves not his brother, says John, though he calls
   himself a Christian, belongs still to the world. Love is wanting, and
   therefore also the divine life whereby the children of God are
   distinguished from the world. Such an one has not passed from death
   unto life: he abides in death, like the world to which he belongs. What
   he calls faith, is not that direction of the spirit whereby one passes
   from death unto life, and is not therefore what in the true sense can
   bear the name of faith. In John's view, it is not by assent to certain
   articles of belief that genuine Christianity, the distinction between
   what is Christian and what is Unchristian must make itself known,--but
   in the life, in love. Here, however, must be borne in mind the
   connection of ideas peculiar to John's mode of conception,--viz. that
   love proceeds only from faith, is something spontaneously evolved. from
   personal experience of the redeeming love of God in Christ. Hie asserts
   that where there is not love, there can be no participation in that
   true life in its nature exalted above change and death, containing in
   itself the germ of a development for eternity and hence called eternal
   life. And this he proves by substituting for NOT TO LOVE its
   equivalent, HATE; and by applying to the germ of hatred in the heart,
   what is true of murder, which is only the highest expression of hate.
   He assumes, as already known and admitted, that no murderer hath
   eternal life; where this disposition exists, eternal life can have no
   place. Perhaps John here alludes to a spiritual conception of the
   divine sentence, that lie who sheds the blood of another shall die the
   death. To him, all life estranged from God is death,--is the opposite
   to that true divine life which already is eternal life. What is
   predicable of murder is, from the standpoint of that highest tribunal
   which takes cognizance of the intention, to be applied to the germ of
   murder already existing in hatred,--in the want of love.

   Ch. iii. 16.] Our attention is directed to that connection between
   faith and love, of which we have spoken, in the verse immediately
   following: "Herein perceive we the love of God, in that he has laid
   down his life for us, and we ought also to lay down our lives for the
   brethren." What John designates as love, is only that which springs
   from inward experience of the redeeming love of God; which feels itself
   constrained to imitate the redeeming love of Christ, as exhibited in
   his life; that love to God which pours itself out in brotherly love,
   after the example of Christ. By this example John brings to view the
   true inward nature of love, and the way in which it must manifest
   itself in the life. What love is, says he, we have already learned in
   the example of Christ who gave his life for us. So also with us, must
   love prove itself to be true by our readiness to give up all, to
   sacrifice life itself for the sake of the brethren.

   Ch. iii. 17, 18.] But since everything depends on keeping the
   distinction clearly marked between appearance and reality; since all
   which is genuine can be imitated in its outward aspect, and become mere
   appearance; John feels himself obliged to warn his brethren against
   this tendency, even in regard to that which is peculiarly opposed to
   all seeming, and is adapted above all else to demonstrate the true
   nature and the reality of the christian life, viz. Love. He contrasts
   that brotherly-love which proves its existence by act, by sacrifice of
   self, with that of which there is a mere show in words, and where the
   words are convicted of falsehood by the act. "But whoso hath this
   world's good, and seeth his brother hath need, and shutteth up his
   bowels of compassion from him; how dwelleth the love of God in him? My
   little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in
   deed and in truth." Where brotherly-love does not exist, and show
   itself by acts for the relief of others' necessities, there love to God
   is also wanting.

   Ch. iii. 19-22.] Having thus distinguished between truth and appearance
   in respect to love, requiring that love which is truth; he now connects
   this with the general fact, that the whole christian life must have its
   root in truth,--with the universal contrariety between truth and
   appearance. "And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall
   assure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is
   greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart
   condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. And whatsoever we
   ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those
   things that are pleasing in his sight." John has shown, by a single
   example, in what way the truth of the christian life whose essence is
   love, must approve itself. This Christ has also done in the Sermon on
   the Mount (Matt. xvii. 12): "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to
   you, do ye even so to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets."
   These words are by no means adapted to express the peculiar nature of
   christianity as a whole; nor should they be used for this purpose, as
   has been done by some through misapprehension of the nature of the
   Gospel, and of the import of these words in their connection. Were this
   all, then truly Christ needed not to have come. To enjoin the
   command,--this is an easy matter; but does not bring with it obedience
   to the command. The great point is, how to attain to a conformity with
   this command; and all turns upon the question, from what temper of mind
   does the fulfilment of it proceed. For even the wisdom of self-love
   could suggest, that we must be willing to do for others what they
   desire of us, in order that we may receive the like from them. Thus it
   would only be the course of prudent calculation, far from that which
   Christ established as a law for the life. But our Lord's design in this
   passage, as also that of John in the above example, is to contrast true
   righteousness whose essence is love, with a pretended righteousness;
   and accordingly he directs attention to the test, whereby the true
   nature of love is to make itself known, as opposed to a love merely
   assumed for show by such as are deceivers of themselves. The test is
   this: are we constrained by love to do for another, what we in like
   circumstances would desire that he should do for us? Such is also the
   test of love here presented by John. By this test, says he,--viz. when
   our conduct actually harmonizes with the disposition presupposed in us
   as christians,--we may know that we are of the truth. In the mode of
   conception peculiar to John, he regards truth not merely as a matter of
   knowledge, but as something pertaining to the moral temper and the
   life. Thus, as in the children of God he assumes a being of God, so
   does he also a being of the truth. Christ calls himself, absolutely,
   the truth; in him the truth has appeared in a personal form, and has
   entered into the life of humanity. His whole life is truth, the only
   life which is perfect truth, wholly one with itself as it is one with
   God. Thus believers also, in proportion as they have received him into
   themselves, are of the truth. In the world all is appearance; with
   christians all should be truth. And the touchstone here proposed,
   whereby they may know whether they are of the truth, is this: does
   their life, their conduct, really harmonize with what they acknowledge
   from the christian standpoint as the law of their conduct,--with what
   they have professed?

   If now, says the Apostle, our whole life in profession and conduct is
   thus of one piece, is in accord with itself, we shall be able to quiet
   our hearts before God. Under the name of heart, John comprehends all
   the various capacities and modes of action belonging to the spirit,
   without applying the particular designations coined by more cultivated
   languages for the separate faculties. These distinctions have indeed
   their propriety; and so has also the neglect of such a division, the
   indivisible conception and contemplation of the spirit in the totality
   of all its powers and actions. It indicates to us how closely all is
   connected together in the life of the spirit. This is important for the
   right conception and formation of the christian life, both as it
   directs the attention to the inmost and deepest root of the spiritual
   life, all being here determined by the moral basis, the bent towards
   God or the world, towards good or evil; and also as it is the
   christian's work, the task assigned him, from that highest principle
   the one determining tendency towards God, to mould the whole life in
   all its capacities and relations into an all-embracing unity. In this
   passage, by heart John understands that faculty of the spirit, which
   elsewhere is designated as the conscience. He speaks of a quieting of
   the conscience before God, inasmuch as in the conscience the voice of
   God our judge reveals itself; bringing us before the eye of God as the
   judge of our life, and making him present to the soul. It is that
   tribunal of conscience referred to by Paul (Rom. ii. 15), where he
   speaks of the thoughts of men as accusing or excusing their dealings
   one with another. And a condition of the inner life is here presented,
   wherein man can bring quiet to his conscience in view of God the holy
   judge; wherein he need not fear the accusings of conscience, through
   which speaks the judicial voice of God: inasmuch as conscience can
   convict him of no discord between his profession and his course of
   life, but he is conscious to himself of fulfilling the conditions of
   salvation ordained by God.

   The Apostle then illustrates by contrast the high value of such a
   possession, that of a quiet conscience in harmony with itself. If our
   conscience convicts us of inward falsehood, makes manifest to ourselves
   the contradiction between our life and our profession; we must be
   convinced, that as we cannot deceive our own hearts, cannot falsify, or
   silence the voice within us, still less is it in our power to deceive
   God. God is greater than our heart, is the Omniscient One; and what
   cannot be kept concealed from our own conscience, will certainly not
   remain hidden from his eye, whose all-penetrating glance nothing can
   escape. The accusings of our own conscience thus reveal to us the
   condemnatory sentence of God against us. Thus the Apostle directs us to
   something in our inward being, from which we can obtain the surest
   knowledge respecting ourselves and our relation to God; by which we may
   be guarded against all corruption through the praise of others, who
   look only upon the appearance, against all the deceptions of vanity and
   self-love; something which is ever present, teaching us to distinguish
   between being and seeming, between the real and the apparent character
   of our life. It summons us to collect ourselves from all the
   distracting influences of the world; to withdraw deep into our inward
   selves, and there before that holy incorruptible tribunal, to test
   ourselves, to judge, and to mould our lives accordingly.

   As then, says the Apostle, if our own heart condemn us, we thereby know
   that God so much the more condemns us; so on the other hand, if our
   heart condemn us not, this is a pledge that neither does God condemn
   us. We have the most assured and joyful confidence towards God as the
   witness of our integrity.

   A reliance upon human righteousness, as availing before God, can by no
   means be intended here. This would be in contrariety with the whole
   teaching of the Apostle in this Letter. So far from this, he assumes
   the filial relation to God grounded in fellowship with Christ as
   already existing, and as being the source of that joyful confiding
   trust, in which the believer rises to God as his Father. Ile is merely
   pointing out the conditions, under which alone believers can hold
   themselves entitled to appropriate all that is involved in that filial
   relation. It is then, and only then, when their life in truth accords
   with this relation to God as their Father, and so all in them is truth.

   The Apostle then dwells particularly upon one of the privileges
   belonging to that filial relation, and in which it is specially
   recognized, viz. the position towards God as their Father in which
   believers stand through prayer,--the filial relation in prayer. As
   sons, whose filial relation has suffered no interruption, can with
   childlike trust and confidence ask all from their father; so believers,
   whose life is of the truth, who are conscious of no disturbance of
   their filial relation to God through unfaithfulness on their part, can
   ask all with childlike trust and confidence from God their Father. And
   as the child knows beforehand, that the father will grant to him all
   that is conducive to his best good; so do believers also, while in this
   temper of heart asking God their Father, know that he grants all they
   desire, leaves no request unheard. It is all the same as if they
   already had what they ask. By such a certainty of being heard is their
   prayer accompanied. The ground of this certainty, according to the
   Apostle, is this: that they obey the commands of God, and,--as he more
   exactly defines it,--do those things which are well-pleasing in his
   sight; that is, what is truly good, what appears such in the sight of a
   holy God. This has reference not merely to the external act, but to
   that also from which alone the practice of righteousness in external
   acts derives its true significance, the disposition of heart from which
   the act proceeds. It must be a disposition corresponding to the divine
   law, such an one as God desires, well-pleasing in his sight; one which
   has God for its end and aim, which has no object but his glory. It is
   clear, therefore, that the connection of prayer with the christian life
   as a whole is here presupposed; that prayer is not something isolated
   and distinct from the rest of the life, but proceeds from the same holy
   disposition which governs the whole life, and expresses itself in every
   action. In order that the whole life may be of the truth, it is
   necessary moreover that this disposition, this direction of the spirit
   towards God, since it proceeds from fellowship with Christ, should in
   every work show itself as something derived through him.

   What we have now said removes an objection, which, without a more
   careful consideration of the words, might arise from the unconditional
   promise that every request shall be heard. For the object of prayer
   might be something, which would not really promote the salvation of him
   who desires it; something not in harmony with the councils of God's
   universal government. Shall aught therein be changed by the caprice of
   man? But this difficulty is at once relieved when we contemplate prayer
   in the connection here presented, prayer as proceeding from the whole
   filial relation to God, from the disposition which determines and
   controls the whole life. This is no other than the spirit of filial
   submission to God, of concord between the human and divine will. The
   condition, which is afterwards expressly insisted on by the Apostle,
   follows of itself from this connection. Prayer too can be reckoned
   among the things well-pleasing to God, only so far as submission to his
   will accompanies every request; and. hence the absolute promise that it
   shall be heard. Moreover, a relation so intimate of believers, to God
   as their Father is presupposed, that from the same fellowship with him
   in which their whole life has its root, proceed also their prayers. The
   believer prays, in fellowship with Christ, for that which Christ
   himself would have prayed for in his place; for that which the spirit
   of Christ, in moments of peculiar spiritual elevation, discovers to him
   as suitable, and impels him to ask. The same God, who through his
   Spirit inspires the prayer, grants also the fulfilment of it. All has
   its source in the same reference of the life to God. This is what
   Christ designates as prayer in his name; and the hearing of such prayer
   is therefore promised unconditionally.

   Ch. iii. 23.] Having previously spoken of obedience to commands in
   general, the Apostle now resolves the whole into obedience to that one
   command in which all is contained: "And this is his commandment; that
   we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one
   another, as he gave us commandment."

   The law of the Old Covenant began by instituting commands for the
   conduct. But the power so to conduct was wanting; and this no law could
   impart to man. Hence the Law could serve no other purpose than to bring
   man to the consciousness of his moral inability, of his discord with
   God and with his own better nature, to the consciousness of spiritual
   death. Here now, on the contrary, all commands are resolved into one;
   and this has reference not to a DOING, but to a BELIEVING,--the command
   of the Father that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus
   Christ; should believe on him in the relation in which he is presented
   to man by God as his only-begotten Son, as He through whom alone we can
   come to the Father, the Redeemer from sin, the Lord to whom henceforth
   should belong the whole life. So Christ, when asked by the Jews what
   they should do that they might work the works of God, gave no other
   answer than this: That they should believe on him whom God had sent;
   implying that in this was contained the source and sum of all. (John
   vi. 29.)

   Belief, however, is a matter of conviction. How then can it be
   commanded a man, to make this or that an object of conviction to
   himself? This stands not within his own power, it depends not on his
   own will; for conviction is an involuntary thing. God would have
   instituted no such requirement, had not He, who is to be the object of
   belief, so corresponded to the requirement in his appearing and his
   life, as necessarily to become the object of belief to every
   truth-loving, salvation-seeking spirit. In this command there is
   presupposed the impression, which the whole life of Christ must make
   upon him who contemplates it in the right spirit; the impression of
   Christ as designated and accredited by God himself, through the manner
   in which he dwelt in him and wrought in him. So also in the words of
   Christ just referred to, this is alleged as the ground on which God can
   require faith in him: "For him hath God the Father sealed;" the works
   which the Father had given him to perform being the tokens of that
   sealing. While it is here assumed on the one hand, that God has thus
   accredited him in whose name he requires belief, and therefore can
   require it; it is also presupposed that he has so formed the nature of
   men as that He cannot but make on them this divine impression,--cannot
   but reveal himself as He to whom their God-allied nature attracts them,
   and in whom alone they can find satisfaction for all their higher
   wants; of whom their God-related nature itself bears undeniable
   testimony, that to him they belong, that he alone can free them from
   sin and all their misery, can alone impart that true life which they
   need. There is presupposed the original and continued connection of the
   God-related soul with the God in whom it lives and moves and is; and
   hence that drawing of the Father by which the souls of men are led to
   the Son. This command of God is, consequently, no other than what
   arises of itself from the relation of Christ to the human soul. It is
   no arbitrary requisition. What is required by the truth itself, by
   those divine historical facts, according as they do with the capacities
   and laws of human nature, with its deep-implanted wants,--this here
   takes the outward form of a command of God. All this, however, whereby
   this command is shown to be the expression of an inward divine
   necessity, could be presupposed as already known, and needing no
   farther confirmation. For the Apostle was addressing churches already
   long established in Christianity; who had found, in their own
   experience, manifold evidences of the inward necessity of this belief.
   To such personal experience the Apostle makes his appeal in many
   passages of this Epistle. They had long known this as a command
   divinely enstamped upon their souls, constraining them to believe on
   the name of Jesus. Now as in this One command all others are included;
   so of necessity, as single commands to be enjoined each by itself, they
   are made superfluous. In that one command was bestowed, moreover, the
   ability to obey all others,--the motive-power for the fulfilment of all
   which the Law requires. Thereby had the Law been converted from an
   outward to an inward law, having its root in the inner life. The
   Apostle, therefore, expresses only that one command; which, having for
   its basis faith in Jesus who had offered up his life for the salvation
   of man, contains all others in itself and renders them
   superfluous,--the one command proceeding from Christ himself, LOVE ONE
   ANOTHER!

   Ch. iii. 24.] As it is by keeping the commands of Christ that faith in
   him must approve itself, so also is this the condition of abiding in
   fellowship with him. "And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in
   Him, and He in him: and hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the
   spirit which he hath given us." Thus it is by obedience to the commands
   of Christ as contained in that one command, we attest our voluntary
   abiding in fellowship with (Christ; this being the necessary condition
   on our part, in order that we may continue to enjoy the communication
   of Christ, and that he may abide in fellowship with us. This
   reciprocity is always presupposed; the keeping of the commands of
   Christ as depending upon that mutual fellowship, and as being also the
   condition and the evidence of this continued fellowship.

   The Apostle then appeals to that, whereby this continued fellowship
   manifests itself to the consciousness of each; to that internal fact,
   of a conscious divine life, imparted by Christ through the Holy Spirit.
   That we live in fellowship with him, we know by the spirit which he has
   given us,--that invisible pledge, manifesting itself to the inward
   experience, of uninterrupted union with. him. Thus when about to part
   from his disciples, no more to be with them in his personal bodily
   presence, he promised that he would be invisibly near and present among
   them, no less truly than during his earthly manifestation. The proof of
   this his actual presence among them, should be the communication to
   them of his Spirit. This should be the medium of union between
   believers and their Saviour, until vision takes the place of faith;
   till that immediate view of Christ, enjoyed by his disciples in the
   familiar intercourse of his earthly life, is restored in heightened
   glory to believers. It is to this inward experience that the Apostle
   makes his appeal with these churches, and to it the inward experience
   of believers in all ages bears witness. Here, then, are conjoined two
   characteristic marks of fellowship with Christ which cannot be
   dissevered from each other; the one inward, perceptible to the
   immediate inner consciousness,--the other belonging to the outward
   life, but presupposing the former, of which it is at once the outward
   expression, and the condition of its continuance. The first
   is,--Participation in the Spirit promised by Christ; the second,
   Obedience to his commands, which is the fruit of that Spirit's agency,
   and in which such participation makes itself apparent. This being the
   Spirit's work, is also, as the evidence of this work, the condition of
   its continuance; all divine gifts being conditioned upon the faithful
   use of what is bestowed, according to the words of Christ: Whoso hath,
   to him shall be given.

CHAPTERS IV. V.

   THROUGHOUT this Epistle, the exhibition of truth and the reprehension
   of opposing errors alternate the one with the other. Here the point of
   transition lies in what he had just said, viz. that in the case of all
   believers, participation in the influences of the. Holy Spirit is the
   pledge of continued fellowship with Christ. This leads him, since there
   was n1muche which falsely claimed to be from that spirit, to direct
   attention to the difference between its genuine operations and such as
   were only pretended, only a deceptive imitation. This connects itself
   with his previous warnings against false teachers.

   These teachers, as is clear from the traits subsequently ascribed to
   them, professed to enjoy the special illumination of that Holy Spirit
   who is the source of life to all christians. They spoke with an
   irresistible enthusiasm; they claimed the character of prophets. All
   who assume the office of teachers in the church, should be organs of
   that Holy Spirit who is the pervading vitalizing principle of the
   church. As it was this Spirit, whose vital influence is presupposed in
   all as christians, without which no one could testify of Christ; so
   all, who would be received as teachers in the church, could only speak
   as instruments of this Spirit, and they were fully entitled so to
   speak. What they taught, however, must approve itself as truth, by its
   harmony with that which the same Spirit revealed to all. John himself,
   in a passage which we have already considered, appeals to this inward
   test in every believer. In the operations of this Spirit, however,
   there were to be found many gradations. It might be more the divinely
   enlightened reason, with its calmly progressive development of truth,
   which predominated in the teacher's mode of instruction; or it might be
   more the immediate influence of sudden inspiration by the Holy Spirit,
   seizing upon the mind with irresistible power, or revealing to the
   inward christian sense, in moments of extraordinary activity, new and
   higher views of truth of which the recipient felt himself constrained
   to testify. This latter was the peculiar characteristic of the
   prophets, in distinction from the ordinary teachers in the church. A
   like difference in the various spheres of christian inspiration, in the
   gradations of the divine and human, obtains in all periods of the
   church. As it is the same Holy Spirit which governs the church in all
   ages, and the unity of this Spirit connects the church of all ages with
   that of the Apostles; as the relation of human nature in all its
   various powers to the Spirit which animates them, and the laws
   according to which that Spirit works, remain ever the same; so also
   will his influence at all times manifest itself in the same generic
   forms and with the same gradations. Hence, a careful observation of
   history will show, in other times, a similar distinction between
   prophets and ordinary teachers in the church, between the prophetic
   gift and the ordinary gift of teaching; a distinction between such as
   are to be compared with the teachers, and such as more resemble the
   prophets of the apostolic church. The apostolic church cannot indeed,
   nor was it intended to be, reproduced as a whole in exactly the same
   literal form. Yet since it must serve, as to its ruling spirit and its
   leading principles, for the model of all subsequent christian
   development, it were much to be desired that we could more closely
   follow its example, in distinguishing between these different gifts,
   and in the training and application of them to the various
   circumstances and wants of the church.

   Ch. iv. 1-3.] The apostolic age differed from later periods of the
   church only in this: that as Christianity then first made its
   appearance in humanity, as the divine world-transforming power, there
   was a greater predominance of that immediate divine impulse and
   inspiration; the appearing of prophets, and the various manifestations
   of the prophetic gift, belonged more to the ordinary phenomena of the
   church. But as, from the very first, corrupt human nature mingled its
   disturbing and adulterating influence in all the manifestations of the
   divine; so with this genuine inspiration there connected itself a false
   one, with the suggestions of the divine Spirit those of an undivine.
   Enthusiasm for the truth was counterfeited by enthusiasm for error;
   delusion and fanaticism had also their own prophets; false prophets
   mingled with the true. Error in doctrine, proclaimed with all the ardor
   of a false inspiration, wrought through the influence of that
   enthusiasm the more power fully upon the popular mind. Hence there was
   needed for christians some decisive test, whereby they might be secured
   against the influence of this deception, and be enabled to distinguish
   between true and false inspiration. This is furnished by the Apostle in
   the following words: "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the
   spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone
   out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that
   confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God: and every
   spirit that confesseth not Jesus, is not of God. And this is the spirit
   of Antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come, and even now
   is it already in the world."

   Under the term spirit, the Apostle here comprehends two things
   outwardly alike, but differing in their inward and essential
   nature,--viz. true and false inspiration, what originates in the
   suggestions of the divine spirit, as well as in those of the undivine.
   He who judged by no other test than appearance merely, must suppose he
   witnessed in all these outward manifestations the same power of
   inspiration, revealing itself in words of resistless fervor. And here a
   twofold error might be committed. Christians might either yield
   themselves credulously to all which claimed to be the revelation of a
   higher spirit, allowing themselves to be hurried away as the blind
   instruments of every influence; or, detecting the suggestions of the
   undivine spirit and seeking to avoid its delusions, might be thereby
   led to suspicion and distrust of all such manifestations, of every kind
   of inspiration. As there was a false confidence of unquestioning
   credulity, so might there arise also a morbid scepticism of mistrust,
   whereby the influences of the Holy Spirit might be obstructed in the
   church, and the kindling flame of inspiration be at once extinguished.
   Against both these errors, Paul thought it necessary to warn the church
   at Thessalonica. (1 Thess. v. 19, ff.)

   The same danger which then threatened the christian life, must, by
   virtue of the uniform law in christian development, be constantly
   repeated; and the healthful christian spirit, alike far from blind
   credulity and from suspicious and unloving distrust, must trace out for
   itself the right way between these two extremes. This finds a special
   application in times which resemble the apostolic age; viz. when
   Christianity,--though not indeed making its first entrance into the
   world, yet rising anew from victorious conflict with the hostile forces
   of superstition or of scepticism,--begins to work with a new power;
   when a new outpouring of the Holy Spirit is preparing the way for
   itself, and gives tokens of its coming; in all times of special
   religious awakening, or of a spiritual excitement which affects the
   religious sphere. In such times, there will always be found some who
   are caught by everything unusual; who give ear too readily to
   everything which assumes the language of religious zeal; who behold the
   Divine in everything which proceeds from a state of peculiar mental
   excitement, and claims to be the work of the Holy Spirit. Others, on
   the contrary, detecting this infusion of foreign elements, suffer
   themselves to be thereby made distrustful towards all religious
   awakening. Instead of trying the spirits, they class them all together
   and reject all; and thus, as far as in them lies, they extinguish also
   the divine flame, and prevent the growth of that new religious life
   from which a new creation was to be developed. The warning of the
   Apostle not to believe every spirit, his requirement to test the
   spirits, includes a caution against both these errors. In his caution
   not to believe every spirit, it is implied that we are not to reject
   all which claims to be the voice of the Holy Spirit; but should feel a
   confidence that here is in reality something divine. Hence he requires
   us to try the spirits, as a means of learning to distinguish the true
   from the false, what proceeds from a divine spirit and what from an
   undivine.

   But though the Apostle has in view both errors, it is here his special
   object to warn against the delusions of false prophets, and to furnish
   a test by which these should be recognized. What he here says tallies
   with his previous warning against the seductions of false teachers. So
   also the mark, for distinguishing between the true and the false, is in
   both cases the same. As we have before seen, the preaching of Jesus, as
   the divine-human Saviour and theocratic King, is the centre of all. To
   acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, this in John's view is synonymous with
   acknowledging him as He who appeared in the flesh,--the Son of God
   manifested in the flesh,--the eternal Word in his humanization,--the
   eternal divine life-fountain letting itself down into human nature, and
   revealing itself in visible human form,--the truly divine and human, in
   harmonious union. In this is involved the rejection of that spectral
   sublimation of the Idea of Christ, already mentioned; of all which
   tended to separate the only-begotten Son of God from Him who has
   appeared in the flesh,--to obscure the unity between the divine and its
   manifestation in the flesh. That one divine fact, John makes the centre
   of all. It was, as we before remarked, the grand point of controversy
   in that age, as it is the one around which gather all the vital
   questions of the present time. Here again there is no other test of
   true faith, no other law for christian union, than steadfast adherence
   to that one fundamental fact of the appearing of the Divine-human
   Redeemer. In all which proceeds from this belief, the influences of the
   divine Spirit should be acknowledged. Hence it follows, that provided
   faith in this one fundamental fact be the soul of the christian life,
   no minor differences of creed should be allowed to disturb christian
   unity; that mistakes and alloys of christian truth, which trench not on
   this one fundamental fact, should not hinder us from recognizing the
   divine stamp in him whose faith and profession have their root
   therein,--that the bonds of christian fellowship should not thereby be
   sundered or loosened. Steadfast adherence to this one foundation is the
   mark of being from God, of the spirit derived from God. Of course, he
   who adheres to it is in fellowship with God, is a partaker of the
   divine life, is animated and led by the Spirit of God; and from it will
   securely proceed the purification of the whole life, both in knowledge
   and practice. Thus the Saviour, comparing himself to the vine and
   believers to its branches (John xv. i ff.), says that these branches
   are to be more and more cleansed in order that they may bring forth the
   more fruit. That is: believers, abiding in fellowship with him, will
   thereby continue to partake of the divine life diffused from him
   through all his members; and being thus, in the divinely ordained and
   directed development of that life, more and more purified from the
   foreign and undivine which still obstructs it, will bring forth more
   and more of its fruits in their whole life and conduct. This then is
   applicable to all such, as through adherence to that one radical fact
   are branches of the true vine; and in them will be experienced, in
   their faith, views, and practice, the quickening energy of that divine
   life, which spreads from the vine-stock through all the branches,
   cleansing away all that is foreign.

   But while John presents both the affirmative and negative aspect of
   this characteristic mark, it is here his special object to enforce the
   negative; to warn against all manifestations of that spirit which does
   not acknowledge this radical fact, but either denies or mutilates it.
   Whoever so taught was to be at once rejected. No other mark for the
   designation of the undivine, the antichristian, the false, should be
   needed for the believer. In all such manifestations the Apostle
   recognizes the spirit of Antichrist, whose culminating point,
   self-deification, was to precede the triumphant revelation of Christ in
   the last time. In all which denies or mutilates this one ground-fact,
   he bids us discern the tokens of that approaching Antichrist, whose
   spirit is thus shown to be already in the world and preparing for his
   full manifestation. He calls upon believers to watch for, and at once
   and totally to reject, all such manifestations; lest, being gradually
   drawn aside from the one foundation, and yielding themselves to the
   delusions of that antichristian spirit, they might at length come
   wholly under its dominion.

   Ch. iv. 4-6.] Having thus taught how to distinguish the revelations of
   the spirit which is from God, and of that which is not from God; the
   Apostle holds out a solace for believers under their conflicts with the
   representatives of that ungodly spirit: "Ye are of God, little
   children, and have overcome them; because greater is he that is in you,
   than he that is in the world. They are of the world: therefore speak
   they of the world, and the world heareth them. We are of God: he that
   knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us. Hereby
   know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error."

   Truth and Error have each their peculiar history of development. As in
   the continued development of christian truth, the Holy Spirit is ever
   revealing itself in the inward consciousness of the believer,--that
   Anointing spoken of by John; so does Error, proceeding side by side
   with this revelation, mingle therewith its own disturbing and
   adulterating influence,--rending single truths from their connection
   with the whole system of truth, and giving them the stamp of error.
   These are the two currents, proceeding from the ever operative spirit
   of Christ and from the spirit of the world; the latter mingling with
   the revelations of the former its own disturbing element, and imitating
   them with a deceptive outward seeming. If we compare the Johannic with
   the Pauline age, we shall perceive, notwithstanding the common
   foundation on which the church rests and the common participation of
   the Holy Spirit, that each period had its own peculiar contrarieties of
   truth and error. So must we in every period seek to distinguish, by the
   light of the divine word, what proceeds from the Spirit of Christ and
   what from an unchristian Spirit of the Age, disguising itself under the
   outward appearance of Christianity. As then, the higher conception of
   the essential nature of our Lord Jesus Christ's person, the truth
   respecting the incarnate Word, received a special development through
   John, and a wider diffusion of light on this important subject of
   christian knowledge distinguished the Johannic age; so also was this
   development of christian truth accompanied and corrupted by the
   one-sided conception of the anti-christian spirit. Every form of error
   has its time; and it is owing to the peculiarity of the time, that
   certain errors especially predominate. Those who still adhere to the
   whole simple truth, may be perplexed at seeing these errors increasing
   with seemingly irresistible power, and perverting many from the pure
   truth. This was the case in the age of John. As the peculiarity of
   Paul's time was the judaistic tendency, mingling law and gospel
   together, and seeking to bind Christianity within the limits of the old
   dispensation; so in the Johannic age, it was this corruption of the
   pure doctrine of the person of Christ. Then were brewing the elements,
   which burst forth unrestrained in the agitations of the second century.
   John seeks to inspire those, who might be thus perplexed, with courage
   and confidence. He begins with reminding them that they are born of
   God, that the Spirit of God dwells and works in them, is their teacher,
   uses them as his instruments to testify of the truth which he has made
   known to them. Hence, comparing them with the teachers of error, he
   draws the conclusion: "Ye have overcome them." He does not say, Ye
   shall overcome; but represents this as a fact already realized.
   Inasmuch, namely, as they are the children of God and are led by him,
   they have thereby in fact already overcome those who are animated by
   the opposite spirit. It is that victory of the divine over all that is
   undivine, which is inherent in the very relation of the one to the
   other, as represented by the Apostle himself: For a Greater, a
   Mightier, is. he who dwells and works in you, than he that is working
   in the God-estranged world. God is mightier than the undivine spirit,
   and against him it cannot prevail. In the assurance of the victory of
   God's omnipotence, over all which arrays itself against him, they are
   assured that, virtually, they have already overcome their adversaries.
   This anticipated victory of christian truth over anti-christian error,
   requires indeed time for its realization. Their faith must outstrip the
   course of history; and in the assurance of faith, they even now possess
   the certain decision of the conflict. They may look into the future
   with cheerful confidence, since the final result is already present to
   their christian consciousness. The course of history only brings that
   to light, which is inherent in the very relation of the spirit, by
   which they are animated, to that which animates their adversaries.
   These adversaries they would never be able to overcome, had they not,
   by virtue of that inward relation, overcome them already. That they
   have already overcome,--this is the very thing which is to be made
   manifest. When Jesus bids his disciples be of good cheer, it is not
   because he will overcome the world, but because he has already
   overcome. (John xvi. 33.) By his redeeming life and sufferings he has,
   once for all, broken the might of Evil. Its kingdom is henceforth as if
   it were not. It may still prevail in many forms; yet this is but a
   passing show.

   Christ, then, having once for all overcome the world, believers are the
   witnesses of this his victory, the instruments by which it is to be
   spread throughout the world. Now in this assurance of having overcome
   their adversaries, it is implied that they are themselves assured in
   the truth; that unmoved by these assaults they stand firm, while all
   around them wavers; that they confidently look forward to the full and
   final triumph of truth in the world. But it by no means follows, that
   their adversaries will be so overcome, as that they themselves shall be
   convinced of their errors and abandon them. For this is something which
   cannot be forced upon man from without. It depends upon his own free
   susceptibility, his own free submission to that spirit which animates
   the preachers of the truth. Hence they are not unsettled and perplexed,
   when, for the moment, error prevails to an extraordinary degree in the
   world. The Apostle shows, that this cannot be otherwise. There is, he
   says, no agreement possible between them and their adversaries. What
   belongs to the inner nature cannot but come forth to light; the spirit,
   the temper of mind, cannot but express itself. As is the tree, so is
   its fruit. Those false prophets, says the Apostle, belong in their
   spirit, their inward temper, to the world. Hence they teach what
   corresponds to this worldly spirit and temper; their earthliness of
   mind is mirrored in their teaching. So long as they are thus minded, it
   cannot be otherwise; and all attempts to convince them of their errors,
   will be repelled by the adverse tendency of their spirit.

   By this he also explains, how it is that with so many they find
   admission. The world eagerly receives that which is kindred to its own
   spirit. Thus is brought to light the essential contrariety between
   those who are of God and those who are of the world. Those who in
   spirit and temper belong to the world have no susceptibility for the
   divine, and cannot receive what is made known by those who are animated
   by the Spirit of God, the teachers of divine truth. But, "he that
   knoweth God, heareth us." The knowing of God might here mean that
   general preparatory connection with him, of such as feel the drawing of
   the Father by which they are led to the Son, and thus show a
   susceptibility for the pure divine truth. But it may also apply to
   those who are already grounded in the christian faith, and remain true
   to the christian knowledge which they have received; and hence are able
   to recognize and to distinguish the genuine preachers of truth, by whom
   they are led on still farther in christian knowledge. The attitude thus
   taken, towards teachers of truth and teachers of error, becomes a
   sifting process among christians themselves; separating those who are
   truly born of God, who in spirit form the opposite to the world, and
   those who still belong to the world although externally united to the
   christian church. Thus, in this sifting process, is manifested the
   inherent essential contrariety between the spirit of truth and the
   spirit of error, between the undivine spirit and the spirit of God.

   Ch. iv. 7, 8.] From belief, the Apostle again turns to its practical
   application to the life; and here again he refers all back to Love, as
   the animating principle of the christian life. His language rises with
   this view to a loftier tone: "Beloved, let us love one another: for
   love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth
   God. He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love." This is not
   a command to love. It is not the Apostle's aim to bring before
   believers new motives to mutual love. His aim is this: to show them
   what must necessarily follow from a certain presupposed fact; the
   necessary mark of a certain existing state; the effect which cannot
   fail when the cause from which it proceeds is actually present. He
   would produce in them the conviction, that just so certainly as they
   are the children of God, as life from God exists in them; so certainly
   must this reveal itself in mutual love. The want of this love would
   show that they were not children of God,--that life from God was not in
   them. The proof he adduces, that as children of God they must love one
   another, is this: love is from God, and therefore every one who loves
   is born of God. Love is here represented as something divine, something
   which points back to the eternal fountain of love in God, a ray of
   divine life. It is love which constitutes the absolute opposite to the
   life, to the stand-point, of the natural man; to that which is supreme
   in him, when his whole nature has completely developed and expressed
   itself. The natural man makes Self the centre and end of all. Love
   impels man to go beyond self, to renounce self; to make the interests
   of others his own, to share with them all that he has, to give himself
   to them, to live for them.

   Where now something of this impulse is present in the soul, man thereby
   makes himself known as the image of God; it is a mark of that higher
   life which proceeds from God. Single instances of such love may be
   found, we admit, even where that life from God which John describes
   does not yet exist, where the birth from God has not yet taken place.
   Still, even these bear witness of a power which is foreign to the
   natural man as such,---a ray from the primeval Source, a mark of divine
   lineage. As such we cannot but recognize them, whether derived from the
   new divine life introduced by Christ into the world, from the general
   influence of society and education,---through which many divine
   impressions from Christ may have been received, by such as have never
   yet opened their hearts to his influence,--or whether we find them
   existing apart from all connection with Christianity. In either case,
   we cannot but discern in them the features of that image of God, which,
   though obscured by sin, still gleams out through darkness; the marks of
   that original divine lineage, of that general connection with the God
   in whom we live and move and have our being.

   In this passage, however, the apostle is not speaking of such emotions,
   breaking forth singly in opposition to the prevailing selfishness; but
   of a state, wherein this love is the governing principle of life. This
   is what he designates as the necessary mark of children of God, since
   love is from God; and hence, where this love is the ruling and
   animating principle, it is evidence that its possessor has this
   principle from God, is born of God. We have often observed, that in the
   Apostle's view all true knowledge of God proceeds from the life, the
   fellowship of life with God. So also here, "being born of God," and
   "knowing God," are classed together. To the affirmative declaration he
   immediately subjoins the negative, drawn from the same premises; viz.
   that he who loves not is far from knowing God, from being in union with
   him. He had before said, that love is from God; thereby referring to
   him as the primal source of all love. But he now goes farther and says:
   God is love. Love is his essential nature; God and Love are coincident
   terms. Love absolutely, whose essential nature is to love, whence
   therefore all love proceeds, is the designation of God himself.

   It is a thought full of meaning, which the Apostle here expresses. He
   indicates thereby, that Love is the clearest embodiment which we can
   vision to ourselves of the incomprehensible God. It is personal spirit
   only that is capable of love. To an impersonal existence love cannot be
   ascribed; unless something else is understood by the name, than what it
   is adapted to express. When God is represented as Love, we are led
   thereby to regard him as the Being, from whose nature it is inseparable
   to reveal and to impart himself, to diffuse beyond himself the bliss
   which he enjoys. Inasmuch as he is himself the sum of all excellence,
   the highest good, he must first be himself the object of his love.
   Thereby begat he the all-perfect likeness of himself, the only-begotten
   Son, who is the object of his absolute love. Such is the import of
   Christ's own language, in his prayer as High Priest of his people.
   (John xvii. 24.) Knowing himself to be one with that, Eternal Effluence
   of the divine glory; and feeling himself called as man to a share in
   that glory, because of the Eternal Word dwelling in and animating him;
   he speaks in that prayer of the glory which the Father's love had
   bestowed upon him, before the foundation of the world. This love moved
   him, for the purpose of revealing and imparting himself, to bring into
   existence the whole creation; in which every being is by itself a
   revelation of God as Love, while each enjoys its own appropriate
   measure of happiness. Hence too he created, as the aim and end of all
   creation beside, rational beings for whose sake he would thus reveal
   himself; who were themselves adapted in their nature to receive this
   his revelation from without, to become partakers of his
   self-communication, to enter into fellowship with him, to receive into
   themselves his image, and to reflect it in their conduct. Love moved
   him, when man had estranged himself from this his highest destiny, to
   send the dearest object of his love, the only-begotten Son himself, to
   appear in human nature; and to bestow him in whom he thus appeared,
   wholly upon man. He too, as being the all-perfect image of him in whom
   God had from eternity mirrored himself, now becomes the absolute object
   of his love in humanity; that love which extends itself from him who is
   the eternal Effluence of the divine glory, upon him who is the
   Effluence of that glory in time and in humanity. He is therefore
   called, absolutely, the beloved Son of the Father,---He in whom the
   Father is well-pleased. This can be said of no other; since only that
   which perfectly presents to the Father his own image, that wherein he
   beholds himself, can be absolutely the object of his complacency. And
   from him the love of God extends itself to all who stand in fellowship
   with him, who reflect his image as it is more and more actualized in
   them, and who to the Father's all-foreseeing eye appear as already
   bearing his image, as entirely one with him. In him we have the perfect
   revelation of God as Love; in his whole manifestation, in his life and
   death, we learn to know God as Love.

   Ch. iv. 9-10.] To the revelation thus made in humanity, of God as Love,
   the Apostle then refers in the succeeding words. "In this was
   manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his
   only-begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
   Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
   his Son to be the propitiation [reconciliation] for our sins."

   Here, overlooking all else, John fixes his eye upon that highest fact,
   in which the love of God reveals itself most gloriously; his love
   toward those, who after being by this love made capable of its highest
   communications, being created in its image, had rendered themselves
   unworthy of it. To a world of sin, thus alienated from the God of love,
   he gave that highest gift,---Him who is called, as no other can be, the
   Son of God,---that through him he might bestow on the sinful race of
   man that high destiny for which it was created, and which it had lost
   through its own guilt; to impart to the dead in sin that true blissful
   life, which should endure forever. In this fact, says John, we perceive
   the true nature of love. It was not our love to God, that called forth
   a return of love in him. His own love moved him to that highest proof
   of love, to send his Son into the world, that those who were alienated
   from him by sin, and through sin arrayed against him the Holy One,
   might be rescued from this state of ruin,--to send him to be the
   reconciliation for our sins. From these words it is evident, that we
   are not so to conceive of this reconciliation, as if God the hater of
   men as sinners had now, at this particular time, become reconciled to
   them through Christ. On the contrary, the work of reconciliation
   presupposes that love in God, which moved him to adopt this plan, to be
   actualized at an appointed period; the eternal love of God as the
   ground, not the result, of this reconciliation. Hence also, the New
   Testament never speaks of a reconciliation of God with man, but only of
   a reconciliation of man with God; indicating that God, as love, ever
   desires to impart himself to man, that the hindrance is in man himself.
   To those who are estranged from God by sin, he must, from the relation
   which they consciously hold to him, appear as the angry Judge, whose
   just vengeance they have incurred. Since then, no man was capable of
   raising himself out of himself into another relation to God, the
   hindrance must first be removed by God himself; and the medium, through
   which this was effected, is called by John the reconciliation for sin,
   the sin-offering for man.

   It is plain, therefore, that the changed relation to God of which man
   becomes conscious, presupposes a divine act independent of himself,
   whereby this has been made possible. To this also pointed the
   sin-offering in the Old Testament, to which John seems to allude. It
   was intended to awaken in the human spirit the conviction, that no man
   is of himself able to close that gulf, which separates the sinner from
   God. As God is love, so also is He holiness; as is taught by John when
   he says, that God is Light, excluding all darkness,--meaning that he is
   Holiness, excluding all evil. As The Holy, he reveals himself in a
   moral government of the world corresponding to his holiness. This
   requires a perfect actualization of the holy law by man; only on this
   condition, can the holy God impart himself to humanity in the
   revelations of his love, can come into fellowship with it, can become
   to it the fountain of bliss, of eternal life. But to this stands
   opposed the universal prevalence of sin in man. Hence Christ, the Holy,
   must perform for all what they cannot themselves perform; must restore
   harmony in God's moral government, by himself satisfying its demands on
   man. In the laws of this moral government, the connection of sin with
   misery as the punishment of sin, was forever fixed. Christ as man, in
   actualizing the holy law, submitted himself to its conditions in this
   respect also,--to this connection of sin and misery, which weighed down
   the human race. In his suffering, he took upon himself their guilt and
   made it his own; his all-devoting love entered into the whole feeling
   of man's guilt and wretchedness; as expressed in that cry, when, in the
   fulness of his sympathy for humanity, he felt himself one with it in
   its load of guilt: My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me! All which
   men had to bear he took upon himself, and in his holy life and
   sufferings, imparted to them all that was his. This it is which
   constitutes the turning point in the relation of man to God; that
   whereby sin ceases to be the separating wall between man and God,--the
   reconciliation (expiation) for sin, as it is termed by the Apostle.
   Herein we perceive the true nature of holy love.

   Ch. iv. 11.] Having thus spoken of the revelation of God's love in the
   reconciliation effected by Christ, the Apostle again makes a personal
   appeal to believers: "Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to
   love one another." Such love in God, the Apostle would say, must beget
   in those who have experienced it a return of love. But this love,
   enkindled by the revelation of the redeeming love of God, must manifest
   itself in mutual love, on the part of those who are conscious of being
   objects of God's love, of having experienced it in themselves. From the
   consciousness of this love of God to believers, must necessarily spring
   mutual love towards each other. It is one holy flame of love, passing
   over from God to man, and extending itself to their mutual relation to
   one another.

   Ch. iv. 12.] In connection with the declaration that God is himself
   love, the Apostle sets forth the high import of love as the bond of
   fellowship between God and man: "No man hath seen God at any time. If
   we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in
   us." In the words, "no one hath seen God," must be contained the
   reason, why it is only through love we can be certain of his dwelling
   in us. "Us," we may regard as meaning the whole body of the church.
   "Seeing," we may first take in the sense of bodily sight. We become
   conscious of the presence of a visible being, by seeing him among us.
   But the invisible God cannot be so united with us. He cannot dwell
   visibly among us; there can be no visible manifestation of deity, such
   as was expected by the Jews and was once desired by Philip. (John xiv.
   8.) What John would say, therefore, is this: No one has ever seen God
   by the bodily sense; a denial which, in John's mode of expression,
   involves the assertion that he cannot thus be seen.

   It follows, therefore, that the church can be united to the invisible
   God only by a spiritual bond; and only thereby can have the assurance
   that he abides with and in them, that he dwells in continued fellowship
   with them. And this spiritual bond is Love. As God is love itself, and
   all love radiates from him; so must the union of the church with him be
   manifested hereby, that he works in them as the spirit of love, that
   Love rules in them as the animating principle.

   If, however, we compare other expressions of John, it becomes a
   question whether the word "seeing" is to be taken here in the sense of
   bodily sight. He is accustomed, as we observed above, to express by the
   original Greek word, likewise a spiritual beholding, perfect, immediate
   knowledge. In this sense he says (John i. 18), "No man hath seen God at
   any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he
   hath declared him." If now we take the word "see" as it is plainly used
   in this passage, it involves still more than what we have said: viz.
   that no man has ever had an immediate perception of God, has ever
   attained to perfect knowledge of him, neither can he thus be known by
   men on earth. We cannot therefore be assured of union with him, by his
   having become to us an object of perfect knowledge. Did it depend on
   that, he would remain forever beyond our reach. The incomprehensible
   Essence, no one has known or can know. But as God is love, we are
   assured of union with him and of his dwelling in us, by his abiding
   self-revelation among us as love; through love we abide in union with
   him who is love. In love we have his true essence, so far as it can be
   the object of perception to man on earth. Union with God through love
   precedes that perfect vision of God, promised us for the life which is
   eternal. In this union with God through love, we have already more than
   we are able to develop in the form of knowledge.

   Herein, then, is contained the weighty truth: that only through love we
   can become conscious of God, can be convinced of the reality of his
   being and nature,--love being in itself the reflection and the product
   of his nature. And hence the more a man has shut his heart against
   love, the more he is sunk in selfishness, the less can he know of God.
   But genuine love to God, that which is enkindled by the revelation of
   God's love to believers, and has God for its source, can only attest
   itself as such by the mutual love of believers for each other, since
   this is its necessary working and effect.

   Ch. iv. 13.] That God, through his indwelling and vitalizing love,
   abides in union with believers, means the same as that his Spirit
   dwells in them: for his Spirit, imparted to believers through Christ,
   is itself the fountain of love which can originate only in God, the
   Spirit which dwells and works in God himself as love. They cannot be
   conscious of a fellowship of spirit with him, if love, the mark of that
   spirit, shows not its living agency among them. Hence the Apostle
   appeals to their experience of the influences of the Spirit imparted by
   God,--the token and pledge, that as they continue to surrender
   themselves to fellowship with God, God likewise abides in inseparable
   fellowship with them. "Hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in
   us, because he hath given us of his Spirit."

   Ch. iv. 14-16.] He now returns to that, which he ever contemplates as
   the ground of the whole Christian life and of salvation, the ground of
   the whole church and of all its divine inward experiences, since upon
   this depends all and with this is given all,--the testimony respecting
   the Son of God, whom the Father has sent as the Saviour of the world.
   Of this he bears testimony, with the confident assurance of an
   eye-witness: "And we have seen and do testify, that the Father sent the
   Son to be the Saviour of the world." But with those who had been so
   long acquainted with Christianity, he needed not to appeal merely to
   his own sight and experience. They were not to be dependent upon his
   personal testimony. The fact, to which he bore witness, must long since
   have fully attested itself, in their own conscious experience of
   fellowship with God attained thereby. But he would, again and again,
   impress it upon their hearts, that firm adherence to this fact must
   ever be the ground of all true fellowship with God. For faith he then
   substitutes confession; since faith must approve itself by an open
   confession of the Son of God, without fear or shame, in opposition to
   the world which ignores him and hates his followers. "Whosoever shall
   confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in
   God." Assuming in christians this fellowship with God, which is the
   fruit of true adherence to faith in Jesus as the Son of God, he speaks
   not merely from his own personal experience, but as if uttering the
   experience of all; "And we have known and believed the love that God
   hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God,
   and God in him." The Apostle recognizes a reciprocal relation between
   knowledge and faith. The divine fact, which is the object of faith,
   must be in a certain manner known in order to be believed. But it is by
   receiving through faith this divine fact into the heart and making it
   properly our own, that we first become truly acquainted, in the
   experiences of the inner life, with the object of faith; and therefrom
   develops itself the true knowledge of that object, not as something
   external to the spirit, but as being through this inward experience a
   part of itself. In the spirit enlightened by faith, knowledge is
   developed; and faith, through the knowledge derived from this inward
   experience, receives in turn a higher import. We believe in the love of
   God toward us, because we know it by this inward experience. This is
   the kind of knowledge here meant. But in thus knowing God's love for
   us, we come to know God himself; and in that way in which he can most
   perfectly be known, for his nature is love.

   Abiding in love is represented by the Apostle: as the condition and the
   token of abiding in fellowship with God. By love he doubtless means, as
   the connection shows, primarily the love of God as revealing itself in
   Christ the Saviour of the world, and making itself felt in the hearts
   of believers; and as then, by the light of faith becoming an object of
   knowledge. They attain to a conscious knowledge of that which is their
   life-element. But their hearts cannot be filled with this overflowing
   love of God, without producing in return that love to God, and to the
   brethren, which has its root therein.

   Ch. iv. 17, 18.] The Apostle then characterizes the habitual temper of
   mind, which exists where this abiding in the love of God has reached
   its maturity. "Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have
   boldness [joyfulness] in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are
   we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth
   out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth, is not made
   perfect in love." This fellowship of life with God has for its fruit, a
   confidence in him, undisturbed by fear. By the word which Luther here
   translates "joyfulness" is indicated such a relation to another, as
   allows us to walk with him in free familiar converse, to tell him
   without reserve all that is in our hearts, to turn to him in all our
   concerns with perfect confidence. Such a state of joyful assured
   confidence, disturbed by no fear no apprehension, in which under all
   circumstances and necessities we turn to God, is the one here
   indicated. Particularly is excluded fear in view of a future judgment
   of the holy God, before whom no sin can find allowance. To him who
   stands in this relation to God, the day of judgment is indeed ever
   present; and it is no false or light-minded security by which he is
   raised above it. But that final decision has for him no such terrors,
   as for those who have in God a stern judge to fear; who feel themselves
   estranged from him by sin, and are therefore conscious of the wrath of
   God. He looks towards that day with joyful confidence, for he knows
   that he has no judgment to fear; that through the love of God revealed
   to him in Christ, of which he has the assurance in his inner being, he
   is exempt from judgment. True, he is conscious of still inhering sin.
   He has a sharper eye to detect its presence, than those who have made
   less advancement in the development of the christian life. But even sin
   has for him lost its sting. He knows that God has forgiven him; and as
   he feels and knows himself to be united through love with the God who
   is love, he is certain also that this still inhering sin can no longer
   separate him from God; and that God, through the Spirit which he has
   given him, will purify him more and more, will carry on the begun work
   to its completion. It is not the believer's own worthiness, or
   perfectness, which John regards as the ground of this confidence. Were
   that the foundation of his trust, it would rest on a very frail
   support, soon betraying its worthessness under the temptations and
   conflicts of the earthly life. It has an immovable foundation,--the
   revelation of the love of God in Christ, through which the believer
   knows himself to be one with Christ. Christ is indeed in heaven, and
   the believer still belongs outwardly to earth. Yet, through his oneness
   with Christ, who is to him as present as if still living on earth, he
   is conscious that he stands in the same relation to God as Christ
   himself; that, belonging to Christ as a member of his body, he can no
   more be separated from God than Christ himself; that in him he has
   become the object of divine love, divine complacency. And thus, in
   Christ's relation to God, he has the pledge of his own. This is the
   immovable ground of his confidence.

   The Apostle here contrasts two religious states. The one is this
   fellowship of love, of sonship to God which has its root in Christ;
   when as a child of God, mall is conscious of holding the same relation
   to him, which Christ as Son bears to the Father. In the other, God is
   viewed as the stern judge, the object of fear; the apprehension of
   divine punishment weighs down the spirit. So elsewhere in the New
   Testament, the filial relation to God and the slavish relation are
   contrasted with each other. It is true, indeed, that where this
   fellowship of love has already commenced, doubts and apprehensions,
   arising from the former slavish relation, may still mingle in it their
   disturbing influence. But the Apostle points out a stage of the
   christian life so high, where love has so gained the preponderance,
   that fear is wholly banished. No terrors of impending punishment
   disturb the joyful confidence in God. He would, indeed, by no means
   banish that holy awe, which impels him who lives in the consciousness
   of still inhering sin, to watch continually over himself, to shun
   everything which might mar his fellowship with God. He will be led to
   do this, by the power of that very love in which his life has its root;
   and in this there is no "torment," at that high stage of the christian
   life, where all is possible to Love.

   Ch. iv. 19, 20.] In order to impress on christians the obligation of
   brotherly-love, John again reminds them, that through God's love to
   them their own love was first enkindled; and then goes on to show, that
   in love to God is necessarily involved love to the brethren. "We love
   him because he first loved us. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his
   brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath
   seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"

   The appeal thus founded on that conscious christian fellowship, to
   which both he and his readers have been admitted, presupposes this love
   to God as something possessed in common, originating as it does in
   their common experience of God's redeeming love. But so certainly as
   this love exists among them, will it reveal itself as such in its
   effects. It is easy to say, I love God; the point is, that this love
   should manifest itself by its unmistakable signs in the life. The
   witness to this presence of God's love in men, is Brotherly-love. He
   who says he loves God, and yet hates his brother, is called a liar,
   since his professions are proved by his acts to be lies; for in John's
   view, hatred of one's brother and love to God mutually exclude each
   other. We must here remember, that with John there is nothing
   intermediate between love and hate; it is either love to the brother,
   or hatred of the brother. With him therefore, "to hate the brother,"
   and "not to love," are one and the same; since where love is wanting,
   the selfish disposition already contains the germ of hate.

   But is it not strange that John should ask: How can he who loves not
   the visible brother, love the invisible God? For he always regards love
   to God as the primary, and love to the brother as the derived
   affection; self-sacrificing brotherly-love as originating in love to
   God, that alone being able to overcome the selfish principle in man.
   But if from the cause, we may deduce its necessary and spontaneous
   effect; so on the other hand, from the effect we may reason back to the
   cause, and regard the effect as evidence of the cause. Love to God is
   in itself an invisible act, seen only by him who looks upon the heart;
   but the effects of this love, as they appear outwardly, are seen by
   man. Whether there is true love to God must be determined, therefore,
   by the presence or absence of Brotherly-love. Hence John's conclusion:
   How can I believe that he truly loves God, in whom I see not the
   visible evidence of this love? The visible here bears witness of the
   want of the invisible. And moreover, man as a creature of sense, is
   more readily affected by the visible than by the invisible. If we
   conceive of love as a capacity inherent in the God-related nature of
   man, and pointing back to its primal Source in God who is Love; yet,
   for this capacity to raise itself to the Invisible One, more is
   required than to awaken it into action through the impression made by
   his visible image in man. How is the invisible object of love to exert
   an influence upon him, whom the visible leaves unaffected?

   Ch. iv. 21, v. 1.] Such being the necessary connection between these
   two relations of love, the Apostle adds: "And this commandment have we
   from him, That he who loveth God, love his brother also. Whosoever
   believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God: and every one that
   loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him."

   This necessary connection between love to God and Brotherly-love, John
   deduces from their common sonship to God, from the equal relation of
   all to God, and their inward relationship of life to one another. He
   begins with faith,--faith in its true import. By faith he understands,
   not what James calls a dead faith. It is not the mere admission of
   certain historical facts, as one believes any historical narration of
   the past, without being at all affected thereby in his inner life. It
   is not the tenacious adherence to certain articles of faith, received
   into the understanding and memory as a matter of custom; in regard to
   which the liability y to doubt is less, the less there is felt of a
   living interest in them, the less their influence penetrates below the
   mere surface of the spirit. Faith, in the Johannic sense, presupposes
   all that is involved in the acknowledgment of Jesus as the Christ, in
   knowing him for ourselves as such. It implies the recognition of the
   Crucified One, as Sovereign in the kingdom of God, as Redeemer from
   sin. There is, therefore, implied that deep conviction of sin and
   longing for deliverance from it, that deep feeling of the necessity of
   redemption, without which faith in the Redeemer is not possible. There
   is implied faith in his resurrection, as the divine attestation that
   Jesus the Crucified is the Redeemer of sinful man, and Sovereign in the
   kingdom of God; in his ascension to heaven, by virtue of that glorified
   divine life, exempt from the conditions of mortality, to which he has
   attained; in his continued fellowship, in this his glorified
   superearthly state, with believers on earth. In this faith there is
   presupposed true spiritual fellowship with Christ. For faith is nothing
   else than that conviction, which, having passed through every stage,
   from the sense of sin to the acknowledgment of Jesus in every revealed
   relation, embraces in itself the sum of all; the act whereby the soul,
   renouncing itself, and joyfully accepting the offered union with this
   Jesus as its Redeemer and Lord, gives itself wholly away to him, that
   it may belong no more to itself but to him alone. Hence, of every one
   who believes in this sense, John says, that he is BORN OF GOD. This he
   regards as something which cannot proceed from the life inherent in the
   spirit itself; which can only be the result of a divine power entering
   the heart, a work of God in man, a divine fact. Where this has taken
   place, there must exist a divine life; for it is that whereby the
   being, hitherto wholly centred in himself and sunk in earthliness,
   receives a new existence whose fountain and root is in God, becomes in
   the true sense a new man born of God. As man, by natural birth, enters
   the world and takes his place among the beings who belong to it; so by
   this fact is he raised to a wholly new, a higher existence. As by
   natural descent, the son derives from his father a being like his own
   and reflects his image; so the believer, by virtue of this new
   spiritual birth from God, by virtue of this new divine life which he
   has in common with God his Father, is called a son of God. And thus he
   reflects, by virtue of this divine life, the Father from whom it
   proceeds. Hence John says that he who loves God, from whom this divine
   life is derived, must, on the ground of this same descent, this
   relationship and likeness, love him also who is born of God, in whom
   exists this same divine life. In love to the Source of the divine life,
   is necessarily included love to all who are partakers with us in this
   life. All who are united in this fellowship as children of God, must
   for that reason feel drawn towards each other, must understand and love
   each other, as in no other relation among men.

   Ch. v. 2, 3.] "By this we know that we love the children of God, when
   we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the love of God,
   that we keep his commandments." As love to God must manifest itself in
   love to the brethren, so must it also in obedience to the divine
   commands. All these are, indeed, summed up by John in the one command
   whose requirement is love, which is the fulfilment of all.

   Ch. v. 3-5.] He then shows what it is which imparts to believers
   strength to fulfil all these commands. "And his commandments are not
   grievous [difficult]. For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the
   world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
   faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that
   Jesus is the Son of God?"

   These are the highest of all commands, those instituted by Christ
   himself, and by him alone perfectly fulfilled; the commands developed
   by him in the Sermon on the Mount, the ground-traits of an
   all-transcending holiness, such as has been reached by no system of
   human ethics, and before which every human spirit must bow in deep
   humility. And yet we hear John saying, that these commands are not
   difficult. But as the highest of all moral requirements, they should be
   the most difficult of all. How then are we to understand it, when John
   says that these commands are not difficult? He must himself have
   learned by experience, that they are not hard to obey. Not in the
   commands themselves, not in their relation to other moral commands,
   must lie the ground of his assertion; but in the changed position of
   man towards the divine law. What was once difficult, nay impossible;
   this has now, by virtue of his moral transformation, become easy. He
   himself assigns as the reason, that all which is born of God overcomes
   the world. From the fact then, that believers have received strength to
   overcome the world, he deduces the consequence that these commands are
   no longer difficult for them, difficult as they may be for him who has
   not received that strength. We can therefore infer from this, what is
   requisite for fulfilling these commands, which is the victory over the
   world. Only in conflict with the world can they be fulfilled. What
   makes their fulfilment difficult to man, is the entanglement of the
   spirit in the world; the power of the world over the spirit, the
   worldly bias, the earthliness of spirit, whereby is stifled the higher
   God-related nature of man, which accords with the divine law and for
   which that law exists. The power of the world, is the power of all that
   is not of God. To him whose spirit is ruled by the world, who feels
   himself drawn to the world and finds in it his highest good, to him the
   commands of God appear difficult. Since now, in the strength of that
   divine life which believers have received the power is given which
   overcomes the world John says that all which is born of God overcomes
   the world; and since, through this world-conquering power, all
   hindrances to the fulfilment of the commands are easily overcome, he
   says that for believers these commands are not difficult. They possess
   the power whereby the difficult is made easy. So Christ invites to
   himself those who feel weighed down, who cannot breathe freely, by
   reason of the burden of the Law, saying: "My yoke is easy and my burden
   is light;" made light by fellowship with him, by the power which he
   imparts.

   John then shows what it is, by which believers are freed from the power
   of the world, transformed from children of the world to children of
   God, made partakers of the divine life, and thus enabled to overcome
   the world. This is faith in Jesus as the Son of God. It is worthy of
   note that he does not say: faith is that whereby we attain the victory
   over the world; nor, faith is that which will overcome the world. He
   says: faith is itself the victory, which has overcome the world. In
   these words lies a deeper meaning, whose full import we must endeavor
   to unfold.

   Faith is itself a victory already achieved over the world; it has its
   being only as a victory attained in conflict with the world. For when
   the divine drawing in the heart of man, the drawing of the Father to
   the Son, incites him to the exercise of faith; the whole world then
   rises against him, to hinder him from attaining faith. What in man is
   of the world and is in union with the world, resists the incipient
   faith. Hence the manifold counter-influences, which make it at first so
   hard to believe. Hence the power of those doubts, which withstand
   faith. Thus faith itself is a victory over the, world. And having thus
   come into being through victory over the world, having once for all
   overcome the world; in it there resides the divine power, against which
   the world can effect nothing. Faith, once for all, has overcome the
   world; and therein is given the victory which in all succeeding
   conflicts with the world, attests itself by the fulfilment of the
   divine commands. The whole subsequent christian life, if it holds fast
   the faith in its quiet healthy process of development, is nothing else
   than a continuation of the victory over the world once attained in
   faith. As Christ, in the words already quoted, says not that he WILL
   but that he HAS overcome the world (John xvi. 33), and bids believers
   rejoice in this assurance; so faith, by virtue of fellowship with
   Christ, shares in this his victory over the world. Since now there
   exists no other power through which the world can be overcome, it
   necessarily follows, that only he overcomes the world, who believes
   that Jesus is the Son of God.

   From this we learn the important lesson, that all true reformation of
   the world can proceed only from this faith, from the energy of the
   divine life residing therein. We cannot, therefore, but be distrustful
   of all attempts to cure the evils of the world, which build not upon
   this one foundation. Even though they may accomplish many single
   reforms, yet a radical cure of the disease is not to be effected by
   such means. For that which is everywhere the obstacle to the fulfilment
   of the divine commands,--the world, which stands opposed to all that is
   of God,--that remains unweakened in its strength, the fountain whence
   all evil continually springs anew. Though at single points the world
   seems to be overcome, it avails nothing. The world may be overcome by
   the world, and its power remain as before; it has but assumed another
   form. The conquest of the world, as a whole, can be achieved only
   through faith in Jesus as the Son of God, only through the might of his
   Spirit; and this must first be effected before the world can truly be
   overcome in all its single forms of evil. So Christ himself represents
   all attempts to extirpate evil from humanity and from the individual
   man as futile, if the inward might of evil be not first broken by the
   power of the mightier, which is Christ,--by the finger of God. (Luke
   xi. 20, comp. Matt. xii. 28.) Hence he says of such attempts to subdue
   and banish evil otherwise than by his Spirit, that though apparently
   producing by other agencies effects similar to those of the Gospel,
   they are yet not for him but against him. So far from laboring with
   him, in the one divine work of founding the kingdom of God in its unity
   among men, their tendency is to lead men away from this unity, away
   from the kingdom of God. This is the most corrupting of all delusions,
   under the most dangerous of all disguises; professing, by apparently
   similar results which proceed from another spirit, to supply the place
   of that work which can be effected only by Christianity.

   Ch. v. 6-8.] John then adduces three tokens, by which Jesus as the Son
   of God has revealed himself; indicating the same time three combined
   relations, in which he presents himself to the christian consciousness,
   as the One incarnate Son of God. "This is he who came by water and
   blood, Jesus the Christ; not in water only, but in water and blood. And
   it is the Spirit which beareth witness, for the Spirit is the truth.
   For there are three that bear witness: the Spirit, and the water, and
   the blood; and the three have reference to the One." [3]

   While thus presenting the three tokens by which Jesus as the Son of God
   has revealed himself, it is at the same time his object to combat
   those, who (like that Cerinthus and others of whom we have spoken in
   the Introduction) did not rightly recognize the connection of the
   divine and human in the person of Christ, the unity of his divine-human
   person, of his life and of his work,--rending asunder that in him which
   should be conceived of as one. From the heavenly Christ, who descended
   from the higher spirit-world and was the true redeeming Spirit, they
   separated Jesus, who in their view was a mere man, and with whom as man
   this higher Spirit connected itself at his baptism. The dove, which
   then descended upon him, they regarded as a symbol or embodiment of
   this Spirit. Thenceforth this Spirit, through the man Jesus revealed
   the hidden God and announced divine truth; it bestowed on him the power
   of working miracles; but before his Suffering, it forsook him and
   withdrew again into its own higher regions. To them also, as to the
   Jews, The Crucified continued to be an offence. They could not
   understand the mystery of his sufferings; suffering had, in their
   conception, no place in the work of redemption. They could acknowledge
   a divinely teaching, a divinely working, but not a suffering Christ. To
   them, the life of Christ was not a divine-human life from its very
   beginning. On the contrary, the Divine, whereby Jesus was to be
   distinguished from all other messengers of God, had at that definite
   point of time suddenly taken up its temporary abode in him, and had
   again in a like manner departed from him. The Divine, in the
   servant-form of the incarnate Son, from his birth to the crowning point
   of self-abasement in his suffering,--the crowning point also of his
   moral glory,--was something which they could not comprehend. They
   sundered the high from the low, instead of recognizing the truly high
   in the low. In opposition to such, John now declares Jesus to be the
   Christ, as revealed not merely in water at his baptism, but also in his
   Suffering. By water we must not here understand, as some have done, the
   baptism instituted by him. It is the baptism to which he himself
   submitted; and at which the dignity of Jesus, as the Son of God, shone
   forth in the manner described by John in his Gospel. Since the blood
   has immediate reference to the person of Jesus, being the designation
   of his Suffering; the water also must designate something which has a
   personal reference to himself, viz. his baptism. Accordingly, there is
   here set forth the one reference of his baptism and his
   Suffering,--that it was the same Jesus, who in his baptism and in his
   Suffering manifested himself as the Son of God, the Christ. Both must
   combine in order to make him known as the Son of God; both belonged to
   his redemption-work.

   Still a third witness, a third token by which Jesus reveals himself as
   the Son of God, is introduced by John; the witness of the Spirit, the
   Spirit absolutely, the divine or holy Spirit.

   In accordance with the relation of the three ideas to each other,--as
   by the water we must understand something precedent to his Suffering,
   and by the blood the Suffering which followed his baptism,--so by the
   Spirit's witness must be understood something subsequent to both. It
   must be, therefore, those manifestations of the Holy Spirit, which
   followed the triumphant ascension of the suffering Christ, that
   continued working of this Spirit, which since its first outpouring has
   testified, wherever the Gospel is preached, of Jesus as the Son of God;
   that divine Witness, to which Jesus himself appeals in those last
   discourses recorded by John. Upon this testimony John lays special
   stress. It was indeed the witness which must be added to the two other
   tokens, in order that the Jesus who was baptized and had suffered,
   might be accredited, in a manner perceptible to all, as the Son of God.
   Hence he emphatically adds: "The Spirit is the truth." Truth itself, as
   revealed in the divine workings of the Spirit of God, of him who is The
   True,--this cannot lie. And these three bear witness. The Spirit (now
   placed first by John, since by it the two other witnesses are
   confirmed) the Water, and the Blood, all have reference to one and the
   same object, and all concur in revealing and accrediting Jesus as the
   Son of God.

   The reading, followed in the above translation and explanation, must
   certainly be regarded as the true one. It has the authority of the
   oldest manuscripts in its favor, while the commonly received reading
   has grown out of explanatory additions to the text. It is also favored
   by the connection, in which these additions appear as something wholly
   foreign and discordant; for in this connection, the writer is concerned
   only with facts occurring on the earth, as signs and evidences that
   Jesus has revealed himself as the Son of God,--not with witnesses in
   heaven. Such a reference to the latter would have wholly distracted the
   reader's attention, from that which it was the sole object of John to
   set forth in this passage.

   In our own age, as already remarked in the Introduction, are repeated
   those same tendencies, by which are sundered the divine and human in
   the person of Christ, and the one is exalted at the expense of the
   other. The divine-human Christ, as manifested from the beginning, in
   the words of eternal life uttered by him as a public teacher after his
   baptism, in his miracles, and in his sufferings, is not recognized in
   his undivided unity. To such tendencies, wherever found, these words of
   the Apostle are applicable. They apply also to the case of those, who
   do not recognize as actually true and real the harmonious image of this
   Christ presented in the Gospel record, and convert the true historical
   Christ into a vague form of mist. If his baptism and his sufferings are
   events of the past (though in their import and influence still making
   themselves ever present) yet it is otherwise with the witness of the
   Spirit. This is something belonging not merely to the past. True, in
   the wonderful period when John wrote this, it was manifested in an
   extraordinary manner. Yet in that unceasing, connected agency with
   which it continues to work through all time, it still remains a present
   witness for ourselves. The church being the perpetual organ for the
   operations of tile Spirit, the progress of its history has been
   continually adding, even down to our own time, a succession of new
   witnesses to those of the past, through which we as christians live in
   connection with that witness of the Spirit in the apostolic age. The
   more widely Christianity diffuses itself among the savage races of
   humanity; the more various the modes in which it reveals its
   all-subduing all-transforming power, and the forms which it calls into
   being from the moral putrescence of human life; the more often it goes
   forth victorious from the conflict with superstition and unbelief, to
   new and still more glorious conquests; so much the more is revealed the
   witness of this Spirit, which is the Truth. If the same Spirit, which
   then imparted to the preachers of the Gospel the power to testify of
   Christ through their word, their life, and their blood, is now working
   through them in a greater number of nations than at any period since
   the apostolic; if through this Spirit, martyrs have again been raised
   up among heathen nations to seal their faith with their blood, as seen
   of late in the Isle of Madagascar; this is but the continued and
   renewed witness of that Spirit. What is now being wrought, through
   foreign and domestic missions, is part of that same witness, and
   connects itself with all which had been testified by that Spirit, and
   which it continued to testify, when these words were written. And on
   this will we ever take our stand, in opposition to those who seek to
   veil the historical Christ in a cloud of mist: that the Spirit, which
   is the Truth, testifies of him whose image they would obscure, of that
   Jesus who, in water and in blood, revealed himself as the Son of God.

   Ch. v. 9.] He then shows how much is involved in this divine witness,
   in the emphatic words: "If we receive the witness of men, the witness
   of God is greater: for this is the witness of God, which he hath
   testified of his Son."

   That which he has called the witness of the Spirit, is here designated
   as testimony given by God himself; and this divine witness is
   contrasted with all human testimony, which is ever liable to mislead.
   If we receive anything as true, upon the testimony of men whom we have
   reason to believe, how can we but follow this unerring witness of God?
   So is this continuous divine witness, extending through all times,
   something more reliable than human testimony. This factual witness of
   God himself, everywhere seen in the practical workings of the Gospel,
   shows us the same image of his Son delineated in the Gospel narrative,
   and thus attests it to be true, beyond all reach of doubt. It testifies
   of the same Christ mirrored in the Gospel history. It is, as John says,
   the Father's witness of the Son. This, in the preceding passage, had
   been represented as belonging to the present. It is now spoken of as
   something completed, the witness which the Father has already given of
   the Son. Looking back upon the past, on these operations of the Spirit
   as a whole, he regards them as a testimony already closed. But as
   extending into his own time, they are a present witness. And thus we
   also, from the stand-point of our own age, may appeal to it as
   something at once past and present.

   Ch. v. 10.] The Apostle then shows that it depends on man himself, to
   receive or to reject this testimony; and that when received, it is
   necessarily converted from an outward to an inward witness. "He that
   believeth on the Son of God, hath the witness in himself: he that
   believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the
   record that God gave of his Son."

   For him, who through that outward witness of the Spirit has been led to
   believe on the Son of God, it is no longer mere outward testimony. It
   has become a part of his own inner life. What God first testified to
   him from without, is now by means of his faith testified inwardly to
   his own living consciousness. He bears the divine witness in himself.
   It is the Spirit's testimony in his heart. Through his own inward
   experience of the divine life is it certain to him, that Jesus is the
   Son of God.

   But he who believes not God in his testimony of his Son, has thereby
   made him a liar. By this very unbelief, he practically declares those
   divine facts, which testify of the Son of God, to be false witnesses,
   and in effect makes God a liar. If through the operations of his Spirit
   God thus testifies of his Son, and yet he is not received as the Son of
   God; what is this but saying, that God contradicts himself, while thus
   by these divine facts accrediting him as his Son who is not so?
   Unbelief cannot recognize God in his workings, as him that is true. It
   stamps the divine as the undivine. It can see in the ways of God
   nothing but contradiction.

   From these words of John we may deduce a truth most important for our
   own age. That Jesus is the Son of God, as he has declared himself in
   his history, is attested by no resistless proofs, for such as will not
   recognize the witness in what God has wrought through the Gospel; for
   such as, having no susceptibility in themselves for receiving it, do
   not yield themselves with an humble and receptive heart to the witness
   of the Spirit, that it may thereby become to them an inward witness. It
   is the individual character and disposition that must here make the
   decision. It belongs to the individual will to decide, whether one will
   yield himself to that witness of the Spirit. or rather than this, will
   account God in his workings a liar.

   Ch. v. 11, 12.] Having thus spoken of the testimony whereby Jesus is
   accredited as the Son of God, the Apostle now shows more particularly
   what is its import in reference to believers. what this attestation
   that he is the Son of God implies, and assures to them. "And this is
   the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in
   his Son. He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son
   of God hath not life."

   Through this witness, whereby Jesus is accredited as the Son of God, he
   is made known as the One who alone can impart a true, eternal, divine
   life of bliss to man. By sending to us his Son, God has in him bestowed
   on us the fountain of this eternal life. Hence this witness includes
   also that gift of eternal life. In the Son is grounded this eternal
   life; all life, apart from fellowship with him, being only death. It
   follows, that he who has received the Son, has in so doing experienced
   in himself that true life; while he, who through unbelief shuts himself
   out from Christ, shuts himself out from the fountain of true life, and
   from that life itself.

   Ch. v. 13.] To reawaken this in their consciousness, he repeats, is the
   object of his epistle. This is to him the first and the chief thing. In
   it is included all which is necessary for the inner man; since this
   true divine life comprehends in itself, all which man needs for time
   and eternity. It is the exhaustless source of satisfaction to the
   spirit, so formed, so constituted in its very nature, that it can
   satisfy itself with nothing less than God; can find its true life, its
   true happiness, only in that fellowship with him which is bestowed
   alone through his Son. "These things have I written unto you, that ye
   may know that ye have eternal life, who believe on the name of the Son
   of God." [4]

   This then was the Apostle's object, that believers might know how much
   has been bestowed upon them in their faith. True they must, as
   believers, have known this from the beginning; but then, in human life,
   all things slide so easily into the mechanical form of habit! The
   current of life sweeps us along; and though one may indeed abide in the
   faith, yet he may lose more and more the vivid consciousness of the
   treasure therein imparted to him. Hence he must ever draw anew from the
   divine life-fountain opened to him through faith; the consciousness of
   that which he has therein received, must be continually revived and
   invigorated; and from faith must the knowledge of that, which was first
   received in faith, continually develop itself anew. There can be no
   halting here. Unless the fountain of faith is itself dried up, there
   must proceed from it a progressive development. Hence he writes to
   those who have already long believed, as if they were now first to
   learn, that by believing in Jesus as the Son of God they became
   partakers of eternal life. Their joy in that divine possession was to
   be continually renewed and increased. They were again and again to be
   reminded, that no power of earth can bestow upon them anything higher,
   anything more; to be thus warned against the treacherous arts of those
   false teachers, who sought to unsettle them in their faith, commending
   to them something else as the truth or as a higher truth; to be thereby
   established in this faith, under all temptations and conflicts.

   Ch. v. 14, 15.] He then proceeds to remind them of one especial
   blessing, the fruit of this relation to God into which they have
   entered through faith. "And this is the confidence that we have in him,
   that if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us. And if we
   know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the
   petitions that we desired of him."

   Thus John regards it as the fruit of faith, that God is no longer to
   them a God afar off. The chasm is now closed which separated man from
   his Creator,--from Him who is over all worlds, God in his infinitude,
   in his incomprehensibility, in his holiness. They now hold a filial
   relation to him, enjoy continual intercourse with him, in all their
   necessities can turn to him with filial confidence as to a father and
   friend. In him they have ever at hand one in whom help, counsel, and
   comfort are to be found. It is this living relation to God as our
   Father,--continually mediated through faith in Christ as the Son of
   God, through conscious fellowship with him,--which constitutes true
   Christianity as a matter of the life. To this childlike confidence,
   leading us to prayer and enjoyed in prayer, the Apostle attaches a high
   import. Prayer he makes the soul of the whole christian life. Having
   previously said, that prayer in the name of Christ is ever heard by the
   Father; he now adds the condition, that we pray according to his will.
   The one is involved in the other, as we have already shown. He who
   prays in the name of Christ, is moved and guided by the Spirit of
   Christ in prayer. He can ask for nothing, but that which is in
   accordance with the will of God; can with assurance ask only that,
   which the Spirit of Christ makes known to him in prayer, as
   corresponding to the Father's will. When this certainty is wanting, his
   prayer will always be accompanied with the condition, that the desire
   arising in his soul and taking the form of prayer, may have for its
   object something which the Father approves.

   From this we are not to conclude, however, that prayer in itself can
   have no definite effect, since whatever is grounded in the will of God
   must happen in any case. Nor are we to suppose that prayer, by bringing
   man into this living relation to his Source of being and his Father,
   therein alone accomplishes its whole work upon the inner life; that its
   whole influence is seen in the holy temper of mind which it produces,
   and which naturally flows from the elevation of the soul above itself
   and the world to God, entering into living intercourse with him, and
   losing itself in him. It is true indeed, that herein consists one of
   the chief blessings of prayer; but this is not all which prayer
   effects. And even this effect would not be fully realized, if prayer
   were not something more than the mere objective contemplation of the
   Divine. For it presupposes the assured consciousness, that the relation
   to God into which we enter by prayer is a living personal relation, as
   of one individual person with another, in which both are mutually acted
   on; that he perceives that, which our spirit in directing to him its
   feelings and thoughts would have him perceive. In this it is
   necessarily implied, that our prayer for a definite object will not be
   in vain. This the Apostle indicates, when he speaks of a hearing of
   prayer. Prayer is the soul's necessity, breathed forth to God with
   filial confidence and submission, in the consciousness of that living
   relation to him as father; it must therefore, in rising to God, find
   satisfaction in reference to that which is the object of want. True
   indeed, prayer cannot in the proper sense constrain the will of God,--a
   thought which is excluded by the very nature of this filial relation to
   him. But the actualization of the divine will excludes not intermediate
   causes; and among the chief of these is prayer. Passing beyond the
   outward and finite of the earthly world, as presented in space and
   time; beyond the natural connection of phenomena; as an invisible
   spiritual force, it penetrates with its agency to the very heart of the
   invisible world. Itself the breath of love, its workings are in unison
   with the laws of the invisible kingdom of love. It belongs not to that
   which can be mechanically estimated,-- like all that is highest, and
   deepest, and innermost. Prayer is the highest act of the God-related
   spirit, entering into that living relation to God for which it was
   created. Prayer, grounded in fellowship with Christ as here represented
   by John, presupposes that power derived from God, whereby the soul is
   winged for this its loftiest flight, whence it receives this its
   highest energy of burning aspiration. This power tends back to the
   Primal Source from which it flows. It is a special gift, bestowed on
   man as a member of the invisible world, whereby he may lay hold on the
   invisible. It is one of his homeborn rights; enjoyed already here, as
   pertaining to that heaven -where he belongs, and which shall one day be
   his home. So certainly will prayer be heard, that christians, while
   they pray, should be inspired with the assurance that what they ask is
   virtually received already.

   Ch. v. 16.] From all for which as christians we may pray, John now
   selects a single object of prayer. This must, therefore, appear to him
   to be specially connected with the peculiar nature of the christian
   life. "If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he
   shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.
   There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it."

   True prayer as grounded in fellowship with Christ, must proceed from
   the christian life as a connected whole. That which is the animating
   principle of the whole christian life, must also be the animating
   principle of christian prayer. The prayer of love, is that which binds
   all christians together as brethren. Hence the Apostle singles out that
   sympathy of fraternal love, which expresses itself in prayer. As this
   sympathy must first respect the spiritual necessities, which to each
   are his own highest concern, and as the need arising from sin must seem
   to each his brother's greatest need; so will his sympathy expressed in
   prayer, his ardent desire to help, have special reference to this need,
   which he feels himself constrained to bear with his brother. It may
   indeed happen, that those who are strict toward themselves practise the
   same strictness toward others also, despising and repulsing them, when
   they see in them any sin. But this is not that zeal in sanctification,
   which is in harmony with the christian life. Conscious as he is
   himself, that he owes all to redeeming grace, that the divine life in
   himself is still mingled with much that is impure; the christian cannot
   but be lenient in his judgment when he sees others fall, while he thus
   feels his own weakness, his own continual need of redemption. And here,
   especially, is shown the power of that love, which feels as its own the
   brother's need. Accordingly, John calls upon christians first of all,
   to help with their prayers the brother who has fallen into sin. He
   assures them, that to the fallen brother,--in whom the divine life has
   been impaired through sin, who by yielding to temptation has fallen
   from the unity of this divine life,--that to such an one God will
   restore this divine life in its original vigor. They may thus, through
   the intercession prompted by love, become instruments in restoring to
   life a fallen brother. Could they render him a higher service of love!

   But how are we to understand John's limitation of this requirement, in
   the exception, emphatically repeated, of sins which are unto death?
   Should not then the claim for help be greater, the greater the
   brother's spiritual need? Should limits be set to that gushing love,
   which pours itself out in intercession? Should not prayer for the
   brother be so much the more required? To make this clear, it is only
   necessary to understand what kind of prayer John has in view; what he
   presupposes as the condition on which prayer is heard, and how he
   distinguishes from other sins the sin which is unto death.

   True, the divine life, in its essential nature, excludes all sin,--as
   John has already shown. Sin and death, according to the Holy
   Scriptures, are closely connected ideas. But the divine life in
   believers, as we have already seen, develops itself in continual
   conflict with the after-workings of the earlier life of sin. Numerous
   disturbances of the divine life may thereby ensue, interruptions of the
   christian development, which yet do not undermine this life itself as
   the controlling principle, but only repress it at particular times and
   in certain manifestations. The ruling tendency of the will is still
   directed towards holiness. Sin is hated and abhorred; and though its
   after-workings are still felt, it is only as something foreign cleaving
   to the true self, whose animating and controlling principle is love. In
   such a case it is only necessary, when one falls under single
   temptations, to call again into action the controlling element of the
   divine life existing in him, in order to overcome the principle of sin.
   It is of such cases the Apostle speaks, where there is true repentance
   and longing after continued sanctification; and hence, where the
   conditions and the susceptibility are not wanting, for that which is to
   be obtained through a brother's intercession. It is of such persons he
   speaks, who are in a state of grace, and have not apostatized from
   their christian calling; who still deserve the name of christian
   brethren, and hence have a claim upon all the aids of christian love,
   which one brother can render to another. An intercession is meant,
   which in the nature of the case can respect only such persons; and it
   is presupposed that all, who are connected by the bond of christian
   brotherhood, will mutually intercede for one another.

   It may be, however, that an individual has fallen into such a state, as
   absolutely excludes the presence of the divine life in him; an evidence
   that he who seemed to have passed from death unto life, has again
   fallen under the power of death. Such an one may never in reality have
   attained to the true life. The essence of living faith, as delineated
   by John, may have been ever wanting in him. He may have only seemed to
   be a christian, without being truly so; having received only the
   baptism of water, not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Christ may never
   have been actually formed in him; and at most, he may have experienced
   only transient emotions of the higher life. Or it may be that such an
   one, after having truly received through living faith a divine life and
   become a new man, has fallen from this state, has estranged himself
   from it, and sunk back again into his former position. This could not
   indeed happen at once; but yet,--through want of watchfulness over
   himself, through negligence and sluggishness in the conflict with
   after-working sin, through a false security, a presumptuous reliance
   upon grace or a false self-reliance,--it might be brought about
   gradually, and through many downward stages. Now where such a state
   existed, it showed itself in acts; in such sins as no one, who remained
   true to the christian relation and faithfully applied the imparted
   means of grace, could possibly have committed. Such persons were
   excluded from the fellowship of the church, in accordance with the
   principles of church relationship in that age; as is assumed to be
   necessary by the Apostle Paul, in a case like this occurring in the
   Corinthian church. John could not mean, that it was forbidden to pray
   for such as had thus fallen. For in regard to the first case,--there is
   no ground apparent, why those who had not yet been truly converted, and
   at most had felt only occasional impulses towards Christianity, might
   not become susceptible to the farther operations of grace and be
   brought under their influence. Or if we take the second case,--of such
   as had culpably lost the life imparted by grace; we can find no reason,
   why they might not have regained it through true repentance. It is true
   indeed, that this was rendered far more difficult by their misuse of
   the means of grace, and by the increased moral blindness induced
   through their own fault,--which is referred to in the sixth chapter of
   the Epistle to the Hebrews. When John calls Christ the Reconciliation
   and the Intercessor for the sins of the whole world, he certainly meant
   not to exclude one belonging to either of these two classes, provided
   only that repentance could be reawakened.

   In this connection, however, he is speaking of intercession for
   christians, for such as have not trifled away the forgiveness of sins
   through Christ. Hence, in this connection, those must be excepted who
   have fallen into what John calls "sin unto death," in the sense
   explained; for in their case such intercession would be inappropriate,
   since in them the conditions and the susceptibility for it were
   wanting. Had he not made this distinction, he would have given the
   false impression, that one who commits such sins may still abide in
   Christianity; as if christians and those who are not christians could
   be known, the one from the other, by no distinctive signs in their
   life-walk. He would thus have required the church to regard such
   persons as still christian brethren, since they were to be embraced in
   the common supplication for all christians. He would have made those
   persons themselves more secure in their sins, and led them to a false
   reliance on the intercession of others. With christian love, the
   unsparing condemnation of sin must go hand in hand. A love, which
   overlooked all distinction among sins, would have been no true love.

   How unlike John it would have been, to withhold from one ever so
   debased the consolation of forgiveness through Christ, and to withdraw
   from him the sympathy of his love, is seen in the beautiful tradition,
   (which there is no reason to discredit) of that fallen christian youth,
   who had become chief of a robber-band, and who by John's love was
   rescued and brought back to the Lord.

   Ch. v. l7, 18.] But while he thus demands even for the sins of brethren
   the offices of christian sympathy and love, he deems it important to
   avoid thereby effacing the essential contrariety between the christian
   life and sin, and to summon the christian to continued conflict with
   sin. "All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death. We
   know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: but he that is
   begotten of God, keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him
   not."

   He deems it necessary to add this warning, lest some might be led, by
   the distinction which he had made among sins, to think too lightly of
   any sin; lest christians should suppose they had done enough, if they
   only avoided such outbreaking sins. Here again he refers to the fact,
   that the Principle in all sin is the same. All transgression of the
   divine law, all which proceeds from the Selfish in man, as Sin, is in
   its radical principle one and the same thing. It is only in reference
   to the outward manifestation, that such a difference among sins can be
   made, that the sin unto death can be distinguished from other sins. To
   this end he reiterates the truth, that the divine life stands in
   contradiction with ALL sin; and that one, as born of God and possessing
   that divine life which is opposed to all sin, keeps himself separate
   from all sin. Such an one, faithfully cherishing the divine life which
   he has received, and watching over himself, has nothing to fear from
   temptations to evil: he has the power to withstand Satan in all his
   influences. There is nothing in such an one on which he can fix his
   hold. As he was compelled to retire from the Redeemer himself, finding
   no access to him with his temptations; so will he be compelled to leave
   unharmed, those who stand in fellowship with the Redeemer. Herein are
   included two things: first, the duty of all such as have become
   partakers of the divine life, to guard against all sin whatever,
   without regard to gradational differences; and secondly, the proof of
   the fact, that such as have fallen into sins which are unto death are
   not born of God. From this it is evident, that if they were actually
   born of God, they could only, by neglecting to watch over themselves,
   have again fallen a prey to the power of evil, which they must
   otherwise have withstood.

   Ch. v. 19, 20.] This leads the Apostle to exhibit yet once more, before
   he closes his epistle, the essential contrariety between christians as
   born of God, and the sinful world. " And we know that we are of God,
   and the whole world lieth in wickedness. And we know that the Son of
   God is come, and hath given us an understanding that we may know Him
   that is true: and we are in Him that is true, in his Son Jesus Christ."

   The Apostle, now about to take leave of his readers, once more
   impresses on their hearts what christians must ever hold in living
   remembrance, if they would not prove faithless to their calling,--their
   relation to the world. As born of God, as partakers of the divine life,
   they form the opposite to the world, of which John says, that it lies
   under the dominion of Evil. The divine life in them constitutes the
   entire and irreconcilable opposite to the evil which reigns in this
   world. Out of the fulness of the divine life in his own soul, the aged
   John looks back upon a long life, during which he had witnessed the
   constant progress of evil in the world, developing itself in an
   ever-ascending scale. He must now look to his near departure out of
   this world, whence he was to be called into the home of the Good, to
   Christ. But his spiritual children he left behind in this world of
   wickedness, exposed to the taint of its corruptions. He reminds them,
   that by virtue of the divine life within them, they should constitute
   the opposite to this wicked world. Hence they should be ever watchful
   over themselves, guarding against all inward contact with the
   wickedness which is in the world, and by the power of their inward
   divine life preserve themselves pure from its contaminating influence;
   ever bearing in mind their position and calling, to maintain a conflict
   with the evil of the world, to be themselves the salt of the world.

   As The True, John designates him who alone is to be called God. The
   world knows him not, is in a state of estrangement from him. It is
   included in the very idea of the world as such, that it gives to
   another the honor which belongs to God alone, that it serves false
   gods. But believers are, in their inward life and spirit, separated
   from the world by this,--that the Son of God has come, and has given to
   them the perception, whereby they know the true God. John here assumes
   that man, as he is by nature, in his natural tendencies, cannot by the
   natural understanding attain to the knowledge of God; that the spirit
   must first be freed from the worldliness in which it is ensnared, a new
   God-related sense must be awakened, in order that he may thereby, with
   the eyes of the spirit enlightened, know the true God. John himself,
   though he had been brought up in Judaism, and taught from early life
   the knowledge of God; yet ranks himself here with Gentile believers, as
   one to whom the Son of God first imparted that inward sense, whereby he
   might know God. He thus implies that he knew him not before; that the
   light of the knowledge of God first dawned upon him, when Christ called
   him from the world to himself. Here too is recognized the fundamental
   truth, that it is only through the Son the Father can be truly known.
   Hence it is evident, that one may acknowledge God, may think that he
   knows him, may have a kind of dead faith in him; while yet he is far
   from knowing him, wanting that God-related sense through which only he
   can be truly known. From him that hath not,' says our Lord, shall be
   taken even that which he seemeth to have.' So may those, who have only
   this dead knowledge of God, this form without life, find it wholly
   swept away by the overpowering force of the spirit of the world. And
   being thus made conscious of their lack of any principle superior to
   the world, whereby they can withstand its power, and of their
   wretchedness in this state of estrangement from God and subjection to
   the world; they may be led to seek for that new inward sense, which the
   Son of God can alone impart, and whereby alone they can attain to the
   knowledge of the true God.

   This true knowledge of God has its root in the life, in fellowship with
   God; and this can be mediated only through his Son. Hence John reminds
   his christian brethren, that they are in the true God; that they live
   in fellowship with him, by virtue of their union with his Son; that it
   is therefore only in this abiding union they can persevere in
   fellowship with God, and retain the knowledge of the true God. Thereby
   alone will they be kept separate from the world, and guarded against
   its influences. The Holy Scriptures do indeed recognize, even in this
   our fallen state, a certain BEING IN GOD, as the inalienable
   inheritance of the God-related, God-descended spirit. So Paul, in the
   seventeenth chapter of the Acts, says: In him we live, and move, and
   have our being.' But that consequent drawing from God and towards him,
   grounded in this moral relationship to him, leads not to that living,
   true knowledge of God, which can sustain itself in conflict with the
   world. Such a consciousness of the unknown God, of the God afar off,
   soon gives way before the overwhelming tide of the world; in the midst
   of a world lying in wickedness, it becomes blinded and confused through
   the influence of worldly temptations. Man cannot, by this dawn of a
   higher consciousness within him, maintain his faith in his own divine
   origin, and in the God of whose being it admonishes him. The scattered
   rays, whose light has penetrated the darkness of a world lying in
   wickedness, are again obscured; from the world ascends an impenetrable
   cloud, which enwraps his spirit, and forms a separating wall between
   him and the Divine. All else is unavailing, unless that divine drawing
   lead his submissive spirit to the Son, to be by him made free, and
   endowed with that inward sense whereby the true God is known.

   Ch. v. 20, 21.] John now closes this truly noble Epistle, with the
   admonition: that, persevering in union with Him the only true God,
   through his Son, and in that fellowship of eternal life received from
   him, they keep themselves pure from all contamination with Idol-gods.
   "This is the true God, and eternal Life. Little children, keep
   yourselves from Idols."

   It might be a question, whether the word This' refers here to God, or
   to the incarnate Son in whom he has revealed himself. In either case,
   the practical import of the words is the same. The connection, however,
   leads us to regard the reference to God as the prominent one, since God
   is afterwards contrasted with Idols. The Apostle has just been
   contemplating Christ as the Mediator of this fellowship with God. Hence
   we must suppose, that in conclusion he sets forth this one prominent
   thought: This God, with whom believers thus stand in fellowship through
   Christ, is the only true God, and hence is the primal source of eternal
   life; through him alone, therefore, we can become partakers of eternal
   life, in which is contained the Sum of all Good, as the highest good
   for the God-related spirit. In him, therefore, we have all which we
   need for time and eternity. It is true indeed as we have seen, that
   Christ as the only-begotten-Son of God, is called by John the eternal
   Life which was with the Father, and which has appeared on earth in
   order to impart itself to man. With these words he commenced this
   Epistle. But it is also appropriate, that in closing he should point to
   the Primal Source, to Him who is himself that eternal Life, which has
   poured itself forth into the only-begotten-Son, and through him into
   humanity.

   But in order to hold fast this highest possession, christians must
   guard themselves from all contam1nination with the idols worshipped by
   a world lying in wickedness. This admonition was, in its present form,
   intended for such as lived in a world devoted to Idol-worship. Was then
   this admonition intended only for that age? Has it no application to
   our own time? If we well consider what John understands by that
   knowledge of the true God, which can be attained only through the
   inward sense derived from him and imparted by the Son; it will thence
   be evident, that where this sense is wanting, and with it that true
   knowledge of God, the human spirit, though it may profess to believe in
   God and suppose itself his worshipper, is yet far from him, and is a
   worshipper of idols. The world as such ever has its idols, to whom it
   gives the honor due to the true God alone. In a world which lies in
   wickedness, the children of God will ever be surrounded with idols; and
   they can insure the possession of their highest good, only by remaining
   true to their God, by keeping themselves aloof from all contact with
   the idols of the world. Specially appropriate is the application to our
   own age, whose ruling tendency is deification of Self and deification
   of the World; an age of conscious apostacy from the only true God,--of
   a conscious idolatry of the World and Self. For us, especially, there
   is need of the warning with which John closes his Epistle: The God whom
   Christ has revealed, is the true God and eternal Life; beware of taking
   part in the Idol-worship of a world lying in wickedness!

  THE END.
