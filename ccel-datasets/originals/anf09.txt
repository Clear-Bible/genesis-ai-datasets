   Preface.

   ------------------------

   The Ante-Nicene Fathers, which seemed many years ago to have completed
   its task, now presents itself once more and ventures to solicit the
   renewal of the favour with which it was formerly received by the
   theological world.  The publishers and the editor, who now stands, he
   well knows how unworthily, in the place of Principal Donaldson and
   Professor Roberts, believe that the volume now added to the series will
   be found most interesting in itself and not unworthy to stand beside
   its predecessors.

   This volume consists of two distinct parts.  The first is a collection
   of recently discovered additions to early Christian literature.  The
   period which has elapsed since the last volumes of this series were
   published has been singularly rich in such discoveries.  A portion of a
   gospel has been recovered which was read in the latter part of the
   second century in certain Christian churches and purports to be the
   work of the Apostle Peter.  A harmony of the four canonical gospels has
   also been brought to our knowledge, which was made in the same century,
   and which, in a considerable district of Eastern Christendom,
   supplanted these gospels themselves.  Another work bearing the name of
   the Apostle Peter, his Apocalypse, which once appeared to have some
   claim to a place in the canon, has also been found.  The Epistles of
   Clement, which formerly broke off abruptly, have recovered their
   concluding portions, and the earliest public appeal to the head of the
   state on behalf of Christianity is also now in our possession.  The
   circumstances of these various discoveries, and also of others of a
   similar nature, are stated in the introductions prefixed by the writers
   in this volume to the various pieces, and it will be seen that scholars
   of many lands have taken part in them.  English scholarship, it is well
   known, has distinguished itself highly in this field.  Many of the
   pieces now given first saw the light in the Cambridge Texts and
   Studies, a publication of singular interest and enduring value, without
   which the present volume would not have come into existence.  The
   editor of the Texts and Studies, Professor Armitage Robinson, has taken
   a very kind interest in the present publication and has himself
   contributed translations of two pieces.

   The history of the discussions awakened by these discoveries cannot yet
   be written, but it is not too early to place the English reader in
   possession of the documents thus restored to the Christian community.
   The reader of former volumes of The Ante-Nicene Fathers has already
   become acquainted with a number of uncanonical gospels, of apocalypses,
   and of early Christian apologies.  In each of these classes of
   Christian literature he is now presented with pieces not less
   interesting than any known before.  A glance at the table of contents
   will show the principle according to which the various works have been
   arranged.  It may be stated that the Diatessaron of Tatian is here for
   the first time translated into English from the Arabic.

   The second part of this volume contains portions of two of the most
   important commentaries of Origen.  When The Ante-Nicene Fathers came to
   a close it was felt that more should have been done for a father who
   occupies a position of such singular importance in the history both of
   Scripture exegesis and of Christian thought.  It is believed that the
   present translations will be welcomed by many who feel that growing
   interest in Origen which now appears in many quarters, and that they
   will be acceptable to all who care to know the varieties of treatment
   the Scriptures have met with in the church.

   The Gospel of Peter.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The important fragment of which Mr. J. Armitage Robinson's translation
   here follows was discovered by the French Archæological Mission, Cairo,
   in a grave (supposed to be a monk's) in an ancient cemetery at Akhmîm
   (Panopolis), in Upper Egypt, in 1886.  It was published in 1892 under
   the care of M. Bouriant in vol. ix., fasc. i., of the Memoirs of the
   French Archæological Mission at Cairo.  The same parchment which
   contained this fragment also contained a fragment of the Revelation of
   Peter and a fragment of the Book of Enoch in Greek.  The parchment
   codex is assigned to a date between the eighth and the twelfth century.

   Before this discovery the following is all that was known of the Gospel
   of Peter:  1.  Serapion, Bishop of Antioch 190-203, writing to the
   church at Rhossus, says (Eusebius, H. E., vi., 12, 2):  "We, brethren,
   receive Peter and the other Apostles even as Christ; but the writings
   that go falsely by their names we, in our experience, reject, knowing
   that such things as these we never received.  When I was with you I
   supposed you all to be attached to the right faith; and so without
   going through the gospel put forward under Peter's name, I said, If
   this is all that makes your petty quarrel, [1] why then let it be
   read.'  But now that I have learned from information given me that
   their mind was lurking in some hole of heresy, I will make a point of
   coming to you again:  so, brethren, expect me speedily.  Knowing then,
   brethren, of what kind of heresy was Marcion--[Here follows a sentence
   where the text is faulty.]...From others who used this very gospel--I
   mean from the successors of those who started it, whom we call Docetæ;
   for most of its ideas are of their school--from them, I say, I borrowed
   it, and was able to go through it, and to find that most of it belonged
   to the right teaching of the Saviour, but some things were additions."
   From this we learn that a Gospel of Peter was in use in the church of
   Rhossus in the end of the second century, but that controversy had
   arisen as to its character, which, on a careful examination, Serapion
   condemned.

   2.  Origen ( 253 a.d.), in commenting on Matthew x. 17, says:  "But,
   proceeding on the tradition that is recorded in the Gospel according to
   Peter or in the Book of James, they say that there are certain brothers
   of Jesus, the sons of Joseph by a former wife, who lived with him
   before Mary."

   3.  Eusebius (H. E., iii., 3, 2) says:  "As to that work, however,
   which is ascribed to him, called The Acts,' and The Gospel according to
   Peter,' and that called The Preaching and the Revelations of Peter,'
   we know nothing of their being handed down as Catholic writings; since
   neither among the ancient nor the ecclesiastical writers of our own day
   has there been one that has appealed to testimony taken from them."
   And in H. E., iii., 25, 6 sq., he includes the Gospel of Peter among
   the forged heretical gospels--"those that are adduced by the heretics
   under the name of the apostles,...of which no one of those writers in
   the ecclesiastical succession has condescended to make any mention in
   his works; and, indeed, the character of the style itself is very
   different from that of the apostles; and the sentiments, and the
   purport of those things that are advanced in them, deviating as far as
   possible from sound orthodoxy, evidently proves they are the fictions
   of heretical men; whence they are not only to be ranked among the
   spurious writings, but are to be rejected as altogether absurd and
   impious."  It is, however, uncertain whether Eusebius himself was
   acquainted with the Gospel of Peter.

   4.  Theodoret ( c. 455), in his Religious History, ii., 2, says that
   the Nazarenes used "the gospel called according to Peter.'"  Later
   references in Western literature, e.g., Jerome, De vir. ill., i., and
   the Decretum Gelasianum, condemning the book, are based upon the
   judgement of Eusebius, and not upon direct knowledge (cf. Harnack,
   Geschichte der altchristl. Lit., I. Th., p. 11).

   This was all that was known of the Gospel of Peter till the publication
   of the Akhmîm fragment.  The latter extends to about 174 stichi,
   counting 32 words to the stichus.  It begins in the middle of the
   history of the Passion, just after Pilate has washed his hands of all
   responsibility, and ends in the middle of a sentence, with the
   departure of the disciples into Galilee at the end of the Feast of
   Unleavened Bread, exactly a week after the crucifixion, the ostensible
   author, Peter, and Andrew, his brother, taking their nets and going to
   the sea; "and there was with us Levi the son of Alphæus, whom the
   Lord..."

   The accompanying Synoptical Table shows where the Petrine narrative
   agrees with and where it varies from those supplied by the canonical
   gospels.  Of that part of the Passion history which it narrates, it
   gives an account which follows the main lines of the canonical
   tradition, but with important variations in detail.  Of the events
   between the burial and the resurrection of our Lord, its account is
   much more ample and detailed than anything in the canonical tradition.

   Harnack (Texte und Untersuchungen, ix., 2, 2d ed., p. 76) gives the
   following list of new traits contained in the Petrine account of the
   history of the Passion and burial:

   1.  Herod was the judge who condemned Jesus, and to him application had
   to be made for the body.

   2.  The Jews, Herod, and the judges would not wash their hands, and
   Pilate then raised the sitting.

   3.  Joseph was the friend of Pilate (sec. 2).

   4.  Joseph begged for the body before the crucifixion, and Pilate sent
   for permission from Herod.

   5.  The soldiers "pushed him as they ran," and their speech (sec. 3).

   6.  The mockery of the soldiers.

   7.  Mocking speech.

   8.  "As though having no pain" (sec. 4).

   9.  "Having placed his garments before him."

   10.  One of the malefactors blamed the multitude, and his speech.

   11.  The legs of either the malefactor or Jesus were not broken, in
   order that he might die in torment.

   12.  The gall and vinegar (sec. 5).

   13.  In the darkness many went about with lamps, and fell down.

   14.  The cry, "My power, my power."

   15.  The fact that when he had so cried Christ was taken up.

   16.  Mention of the nails in the hands at the taking down from the
   cross (sec. 6).

   17.  The earthquake when the body touched the ground.

   18.  The joy of the Jews when the sun shone again.

   19.  Joseph "had seen all the good things" that the Lord had done.

   20.  Joseph washed the body.

   21.  The cries of woe of the Jews and their leaders over their sins,
   and their expectation of the judgement on Jerusalem (sec. 7).

   22.  The disciples remained in concealment, full of grief, and fasted
   and wept till the Sabbath.

   23.  They were searched for as malefactors and as anxious to burn the
   temple.

   24.  The name of the centurion of the watch--Petronius (sec. 8).

   25.  The centurion, the soldiers, and the elders rolled up the stone.

   26.  The elders also watched at the grave.

   27.  Seven seals were placed on the stone.

   28.  A tent pitched for the watch.

   29.  The gathering of the multitude on the morning of the Sabbath to
   view the sealed grave (sec. 9).

   The whole narrative of the resurrection is so different from that of
   the canonical gospels that it would be useless to go into details; but
   it is important to notice the prominence assigned to Mary Magdalene,
   and:

   1.  That the women fled from the grave and did not see the Lord (sec.
   12).

   2.  That there is no account of any appearance of Christ for the first
   eight days after his death (sec. 13).

   3.  That the disciples, along with the rest of those who had taken part
   in the feast, returned home to Galilee on the seventh day of unleavened
   bread.

   4.  That they were then sad, and wept.

   5.  That the first appearance of Jesus must have taken place on the
   Lake of Gennesaret, either to Peter alone, or to Peter, Andrew, and
   Levi (Matthew), while fishing.

   Moreover, according to section 13 (see sec. 5), the author puts the
   resurrection and ascension on the same day, or, rather, did not know of
   the latter as a separate event.  He makes the angel say, "He is risen
   and gone away thither whence he was sent."

   Whether the author used any other sources than the canonical gospels is
   a matter still in doubt.  He is certainly influenced by views which are
   foreign to these gospels, and which are known from other quarters in
   early Christian literature.  As between the Synoptists and the Fourth
   Gospel, the narrator is generally more closely akin both in matter and
   in manner to the Synoptists, but he agrees with the author of the
   Fourth Gospel in regard to the chronology of the crucifixion and
   several of the events at the cross, and in his general attitude towards
   the Jews and Pilate.  With regard to the last two points, the Petrine
   Gospel seems to present a later and more exaggerated form of the
   tendency perceptible in the Johannine, and fully worked out in the Acts
   of Pilate, to blame the Jews and exculpate Pilate.

   Of the new features in this fragment some are at least liable to a
   Docetic interpretation, e.g., the silence on the cross "as though he
   had no pain" (sec. 4), the cry, "My power, my power" (sec. 5), and "he
   was taken up" (sec. 5).  This fact was recognised in subsequent times
   and condemned this gospel in the eye of the church.  The date of the
   work is variously fixed by different scholars; Harnack assigns it to
   the first quarter of the second century, while Mr. Armitage Robinson
   and other scholars place it later.

   The Gospel According to Peter. [2]

   ------------------------

   1  But of the Jews none washed his hands, neither Herod nor any one of
   his judges.  And when they had refused to wash them, Pilate rose up.
   And then Herod the king commandeth that the Lord be taken, [3] saying
   to them, What things soever I commanded you to do unto him, do.

   2  And there was standing there Joseph the friend of Pilate and of the
   Lord; and, knowing that they were about to crucify [4] him, he came to
   Pilate and asked the body of the Lord for burial.  And Pilate sent to
   Herod and asked his body.  And Herod said, Brother Pilate, even if no
   one had asked for him, we purposed to bury him, especially as the
   sabbath draweth on: [5]   for it is written in the law, that the sun
   set not upon one that hath been put to death.

   3  And he delivered him to the people on the day before the unleavened
   bread, their feast.  And they took the Lord and pushed him as they ran,
   and said, Let us drag away the Son of God, having obtained power over
   him.  And they clothed him with purple, and set him on the seat of
   judgment, saying, Judge righteously, O king of Israel.  And one of them
   brought a crown of thorns and put it on the head of the Lord.  And
   others stood and spat in his eyes, and others smote his cheeks:  others
   pricked him with a reed; and some scourged him, saying, With this
   honour let us honour the Son of God.

   4  And they brought two malefactors, and they crucified the Lord
   between them.  But he held his peace, as though having no pain.  And
   when they had raised the cross, they wrote the title:  This is the king
   of Israel.  And having set his garments before him they parted them
   among them, and cast lots for them.  And one of those malefactors
   reproached them, saying, We for the evils that we have done have
   suffered thus, but this man, who hath become the Saviour of men, what
   wrong hath he done to you?  And they, being angered at him, commanded
   that his legs should not be broken, that he might die in torment.

   5  And it was noon, and darkness came over all Judæa:  and they were
   troubled and distressed, lest the sun had set, whilst he was yet
   alive:  [for] it is written for them, that the sun set not on him that
   hath been put to death.  And one of them said, Give him to drink gall
   with vinegar.  And they mixed and gave him to drink, and fulfilled all
   things, and accomplished their sins against their own head.  And many
   went about with lamps, supposing that it was night, and fell down. [6]
     And the Lord cried out, saying, My power, my power, thou hast
   forsaken me.  And when he had said it he was taken up.  And in that
   hour the vail of the temple of Jerusalem was rent in twain. [7]

   6  And then they drew out the nails from the hands of the Lord, and
   laid him upon the earth, and the whole earth quaked, and great fear
   arose.  Then the sun shone, and it was found the ninth hour:  and the
   Jews rejoiced, and gave his body to Joseph that he might bury it, since
   he had seen what good things he had done.  And he took the Lord, and
   washed him, and rolled him in a linen cloth, and brought him into his
   own tomb, which was called the Garden of Joseph.

   7  Then the Jews and the elders and the priests, perceiving what evil
   they had done to themselves, began to lament and to say, Woe for our
   sins:  the judgement hath drawn nigh, and the end of Jerusalem.  And I
   with my companions was grieved; and being wounded in mind we hid
   ourselves:  for we were being sought for by them as malefactors, and as
   wishing to set fire to the temple.  And upon all these things we fasted
   and sat mourning and weeping night and day until the sabbath.

   8  But the scribes and Pharisees and elders being gathered together one
   with another, when they heard that all the people murmured and beat
   their breasts saying, If by his death these most mighty signs have come
   to pass, see how righteous he is,--the elders were afraid and came to
   Pilate, beseeching him and saying, Give us soldiers, that we may guard
   his sepulchre for three days, lest his disciples come and steal him
   away, and the people suppose that he is risen from the dead and do us
   evil.  And Pilate gave them Petronius the centurion with soldiers to
   guard the tomb.  And with them came elders and scribes to the
   sepulchre, and having rolled a great stone together with [8] the
   centurion and the soldiers, they all together who were there set it at
   the door of the sepulchre; and they affixed seven seals, and they
   pitched a tent there and guarded it.  And early in the morning as the
   sabbath was drawing on, there came a multitude from Jerusalem and the
   region round about, that they might see the sepulchre that was sealed.

   9  And in the night in which the Lord's day was drawing on, as the
   soldiers kept guard two by two in a watch, there was a great voice in
   the heaven; and they saw the heavens opened, and two men descend from
   thence with great light and approach the tomb.  And that stone which
   was put at the door rolled of itself and made way in part; and the tomb
   was opened, and both the young men entered in.

   10  When therefore those soldiers saw it, they awakened the centurion
   and the elders; for they too were hard by keeping guard.  And, as they
   declared what things they had seen, again they see three men come forth
   from the tomb, and two of them supporting one, and a cross following
   them:  and of the two the head reached unto the heaven, but the head of
   him that was led by them overpassed the heavens.  And they heard a
   voice from the heavens, saying, Thou hast preached to them that sleep.
   And a response was heard from the cross, Yea.

   11  They therefore considered one with another whether to go away and
   shew these things to Pilate.  And while they yet thought thereon, the
   heavens again are seen to open, and a certain man to descend and enter
   into the sepulchre.  When the centurion and they that were with him saw
   these things, they hastened in the night to Pilate, leaving the tomb
   which they were watching, and declared all things which they had seen,
   being greatly distressed and saying, Truly he was the Son of God.
   Pilate answered and said, I am pure from the blood of the Son of God:
   but it was ye who determined this.  Then they all drew near and
   besought him and entreated him to command the centurion and the
   soldiers to say nothing of the things which they had seen:  For it is
   better, say they, for us to be guilty of the greatest sin before God,
   and not to fall into the hands of the people of the Jews and to be
   stoned.  Pilate therefore commanded the centurion and the soldiers to
   say nothing.

   12  And at dawn upon the Lord's day Mary Magdalen, a disciple of the
   Lord, fearing because of the Jews, since they were burning with wrath,
   had not done at the Lord's sepulchre the things which women are wont to
   do for those that die and for those that are beloved by them--she took
   her friends with her and came to the sepulchre where he was laid.  And
   they feared lest the Jews should see them, and they said, Although on
   that day on which he was crucified we could not weep and lament, yet
   now let us do these things at his sepulchre.  But who shall roll away
   for us the stone that was laid at the door of the sepulchre, that we
   may enter in and sit by him and do the things that are due?  For the
   stone was great, and we fear lest some one see us.  And if we cannot,
   yet if we but set at the door the things which we bring for a memorial
   of him, we will weep and lament, until we come unto our home.

   13  And they went and found the tomb opened, and coming near they
   looked in there; and they see there a certain young man sitting in the
   midst of the tomb, beautiful and clothed in a robe exceeding bright:
   who said to them, Wherefore are ye come?  Whom seek ye?  Him that was
   crucified? [9]   He is risen and gone.  But if ye believe not, look in
   and see the place where he lay, that he is not [here]; for he is risen
   and gone thither, whence he was sent.  Then the women feared and fled.

   14  Now it was the last day of the unleavened bread, and many were
   going forth, returning to their homes, as the feast was ended.  But we,
   the twelve disciples of the Lord, wept and were grieved:  and each one,
   being grieved for that which was come to pass, departed to his home.
   But I Simon Peter and Andrew my brother took our nets and went to the
   sea; and there was with us Levi the son of Alphæus, whom the Lord...

   [cf. v. 38.]

   [cf. xix. 31.]

   16  Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified.  And
   they took Jesus, and led him away.

   Peter.

   1  But of the Jews [10] none washed his hands, neither Herod [11] nor
   any one of his judges. [12]   2  And when they had refused to wash
   them, Pilate rose up.  And Herod the king commandeth that the Lord be
   taken, saying to them, What things soever I commanded you to do unto
   them, do.

   3  And there was come there Joseph the friend of Pilate and of the
   Lord; and, knowing that they were about to crucify him, he came to
   Pilate and asked the body of the Lord for burial.  4  And Pilate sent
   to Herod and asked his body.  5  And Herod said, Brother [13] Pilate,
   even if no one had asked for him, we purposed to bury him, especially
   as the sabbath draweth on:  for it is written in the law, that the sun
   set not upon one that hath been put to death.  And he delivered him to
   the people on the day before the unleavened bread, their feast.

   6  And they took the Lord and pushed him as they ran, and said, Let us
   drag away the Son of God, having obtained power over him.

   7  And they clothed him with purple, and set him on the seat of
   judgement, saying, Judge righteously, O King of Israel.  8  And one of
   them brought a crown of thorns and put it on the head of the Lord.  9
   And others stood and spat in his eyes, and others smote his cheeks:
   others pricked him with a reed; and some scourged him, saying, With
   this honour let us honour the Son of God.

   Matthew.

   31  And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from
   him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.

   32  And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:
   him they compelled to bear his cross.

   33  And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to
   say, a place of a skull,

   Mark.

   20  And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him,
   and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

   21  And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of
   the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

   22  And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
   interpreted, The place of a skull.

   Luke.

   26  And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a
   Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross,
   that he might bear it after Jesus.

   27 ¶  And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
   which also bewailed and lamented him.

   28  But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not
   for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.

   29  For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
   Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps
   which never gave suck.

   30  Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to
   the hills, Cover us.

   31  For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in
   the dry?

   32  And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put
   to death.

   33  And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
   there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,
   and the other on the left.

   John.

   17  And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place
   of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:

   Peter.

   ------------------------

   Matthew.

   34  ¶  They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall:  and when he
   had tasted thereof, he would not drink.

   35  And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:
   that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted
   my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

   36  And sitting down they watched him there;

   37  And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE
   KING OF THE JEWS.

   38  Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
   hand, and another on the left.

   39  ¶  And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,

   Mark.

   23  And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh:  but he
   received it not.

   24  And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting
   lots upon them, what every man should take.

   25  And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

   26  And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING
   OF THE JEWS.

   27  And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand,
   and the other on his left.

   28  And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered
   with the transgressors.

   Luke.

   34  ¶  Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
   they do.  And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

   35  And the people stood beholding.  And the rulers also with them
   derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be
   Christ, the chosen of God.

   36  And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him
   vinegar,

   37  And saying, If thou be the King of the Jews, save thyself.

   38  And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek,
   and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

   John.

   18  Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side
   one, and Jesus in the midst.

   [cf. vv. 23, 24.]

   19  ¶  And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross.  And the
   writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

   20  This title then read many of the Jews:  for the place where Jesus
   was crucified was nigh to the city:  and it was written in Hebrew, and
   Greek, and Latin.

   Peter.

   10  And they brought two malefactors, and they crucified the Lord
   between them.

   But he held his peace, as though having no pain.

   11  And when they had raised the cross, they wrote upon it, This is the
   King of Israel.

   12  And having set his garments before him, they parted them among
   them, and cast lots for them.

   [cf. v. 11.]

   ------------------------

   Matthew.

   40  And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in
   three days, save thyself.  If thou be the Son of God, come down from
   the cross.

   41  Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and
   elders, said,

   42  He saved others; himself he cannot save.  If he be the King of
   Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.

   43  He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him:
   for he said, I am the Son of God.

   [cf. v. 35.]

   44  The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in
   his teeth.

   Mark.

   29  And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and
   saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
   days,

   30  Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

   31  Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with
   the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

   32  Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we
   may see and believe.

   [cf. v. 24.]

   And they that were crucified with him reviled him.

   Luke.

   39  ¶  And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
   saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

   40  But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear
   God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

   John.

   21  Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The
   King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

   22  Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

   23  ¶  Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
   garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his
   coat:  now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

   24  They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast
   lots for it, whose it shall be:  that the scripture might be fulfilled,
   which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they
   did cast lots.  These things therefore the soldiers did.

   Peter.

   [cf. v. 12.]

   13  And one of those malefactors reproached him, saying, We for the
   evils that we have done have suffered thus, but this man, who hath
   become the Saviour of men, what wrong hath he done to you?

   ------------------------

   Matthew.

   45  Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto
   the ninth hour.

   46  And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
   Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast
   thou forsaken me?

   Mark.

   33  And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole
   land until the ninth hour.

   34  And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi,
   Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God,
   why hast thou forsaken me?

   Luke.

   41  And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds:
   but this man hath done nothing amiss.

   42  And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
   kingdom.

   43  And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou
   be with me in paradise.

   44  And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all
   the earth until the ninth hour.

   45  And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in
   the midst.

   John.

   25  ¶  Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
   mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

   26  When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by,
   whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!

   27  Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother!  And from that
   hour that disciple took her unto his own home.

   Peter.

   14  And they, being angered at him, commanded that his legs should not
   be broken, that he might die in torment.

   15  And it was noon, and darkness came over all Judæa:

   and they were troubled and distressed, lest the sun had set, whilst he
   was yet alive:  [for] it is written for them, that the sun set not on
   him that hath been put to death.

   ------------------------

   Matthew.

   47  Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man
   calleth for Elias.

   48  And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it
   with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.

   49  The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save
   him.

   50  ¶  Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the
   ghost.

   51  And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top
   to the bottom;

   and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;

   52  And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which
   slept arose,

   53  And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into
   the holy city, and appeared unto many.

   Mark.

   35  And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold,
   he calleth Elias.

   36  And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a
   reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether
   Elias will come to take him down.

   37  And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

   38  And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the
   bottom.

   Luke.

   46  ¶  And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
   into thy hands I commend my spirit:  and having said thus, he gave up
   the ghost.

   John.

   28  ¶  After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished,
   that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.

   29  Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar:  and they filled a
   spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.

   30  When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
   finished:  and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

   31  The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies
   should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath
   day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken,
   and that they might be taken away.

   32  Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the
   other which was crucified with him.

   33  But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they
   brake not his legs:

   Peter.

   16  And one of them said, Give him to drink gall with vinegar.  And
   they mixed and gave him to drink, 17  and fulfilled all things, and
   accomplished their sins against their own head.

   18  And many went about with lamps, supposing that it was night, and
   fell down.  19  And the Lord cried out, saying, My power, my power,
   thou hast forsaken me.

   And when he had said it he was taken up.

   20  And in that hour the vail of the temple of Jerusalem was rent in
   twain.

   ------------------------

   Matthew.

   54  Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching
   Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared
   greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.

   55  And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus
   from Galilee, ministering unto him:

   56  Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and
   Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.

   57  When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathæa, named
   Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:

   Mark.

   39  ¶  And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
   he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the
   Son of God.

   40  There were also women looking on afar off:  among whom was Mary
   Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and
   Salome;

   41  (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered
   unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.

   42  ¶  And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,
   that is, the day before the sabbath,

   43  Joseph of Arimathæa, an honourable counsellor, which also waited
   for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and
   craved the body of Jesus.

   Luke.

   47  Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying,
   Certainly this was a righteous man.

   48  And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the
   things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

   49  And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
   Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

   50  ¶  And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he
   was a good man, and a just:

   51  (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he
   was of Arimathæa, a city of the Jews:  who also himself waited for the
   kingdom of God.

   John.

   34  But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and
   forthwith came there out blood and water.

   35  And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true:  and he
   knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.

   36  For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled,
   A bone of him shall not be broken.

   37  And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they
   pierced.

   38  ¶  And after this Joseph of Arimathæa, being a disciple of Jesus,
   but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take
   away the body of Jesus:  and Pilate gave him leave.  He came therefore,
   and took the body of Jesus.

   Peter.

   21  And then they drew out the nails from the hands of the Lord, and
   laid him upon the earth, and the whole earth quaked, and great fear
   arose.  22  Then the sun shone, and it was found the ninth hour:  23
   and the Jews rejoiced, and

   ------------------------

   Matthew.

   58  He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.  Then Pilate
   commanded the body to be delivered.

   59  And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen
   cloth,

   60  And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the
   rock:  and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and
   departed.

   61  And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
   against the sepulchre.

   Mark.

   44  And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead:  and calling unto him
   the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

   45  And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

   46  And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the
   linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and
   rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

   47  And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was
   laid.

   Luke.

   52  This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

   53  And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
   sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.

   54  And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

   55  And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed
   after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

   56  And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested
   the sabbath day according to the commandment.

   John.

   39  And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by
   night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound
   weight.

   40  Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes
   with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

   41  Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in
   the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.

   42  There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation
   day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

   Peter.

   gave his body to Joseph that he might bury it,

   since he had seen what good things he had done.

   24  And he took the Lord, and washed him, and wrapped him in a linen
   cloth, and brought him into his own tomb,

   which was called the Garden of Joseph.

   25  Then the Jews and the elders and the priests, perceiving what evil
   they had done to themselves, began to lament and to say, Woe for our
   sins:  the judgement hath drawn nigh, and the end of Jerusalem.

   26  And I with my companions was grieved; and being wounded in mind we
   hid ourselves:  for we were being sought for by them as malefactors,
   and as wishing to set fire to the temple.

   ------------------------

   Matthew.

   [^1cf. Mt. ix. 15.]

   62  ¶  Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the
   chief priests and Pharisees

   came together unto Pilate,

   63  Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet
   alive, After three days I will rise again.

   64  Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third
   day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto
   the people, He is risen from the dead:  so the last error shall be
   worse than the first.

   65  Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch:  go your way, make it as
   sure as ye can.

   66  So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and
   setting a watch.

   Mark.

   [^1cf. Mk. ii. 20.]

   [^2cf. Mk. xvi. 10.]

   Luke.

   John.

   Peter.

   27  And upon all these things we fasted [14] and sat mourning [15] and
   weeping [16] night and day until the sabbath.

   28  But the scribes and Pharisees and elders being gathered together
   one with another, when they heard that all the people murmured and beat
   their breasts, saying, If by his death these most mighty signs have
   come to pass, see how just he is,--29  the elders were afraid and

   came to Pilate, beseeching him and saying, 30  Give us soldiers, that
   we may guard his sepulchre for three days, lest his disciples come and
   steal him away, and the people suppose that he is risen from the dead
   and do us evil.

   31  And Pilate gave them Petronius the centurion with soldiers to guard
   the tomb.  And with them came the elders and scribes to the sepulchre,

   32  And having rolled a great stone together with the centurion and the
   soldiers, they all together who were there set it at the door of the
   sepulchre;

   33  And they affixed seven seals, and they pitched a tent there and
   guarded it.

   34  And early in the morning as the sabbath was drawing on, there came
   a multitude from Jerusalem and the region round about, that they might
   see the sepulchre that was sealed.

   35  And in the night in which the Lord's day was drawing on, as the
   soldiers kept guard two by two in a watch, there was a great voice in
   the heaven; 36 and they saw the heavens opened, and two men descend
   from thence with great light and approach the tomb.  37  And that stone
   which was put at the door rolled of itself and made way in part; and
   the tomb was opened, and both the young men entered in.

   38  When therefore those soldiers saw it, they awakened the centurion
   and the elders,--for they too were hard by keeping guard; 39  and, as
   they declared what things they had seen, again they see three men
   coming forth from the tomb, and two of them supporting one, and a cross
   following them.  40  And of the two the head reached unto the heaven,
   but the head of him that was led by them overpassed the heavens.  41
   And they heard a voice from the heavens, saying, Hast thou preached to
   them that sleep?  42  And a response was heard from the cross, Yea.

   43  They therefore considered one with another whether to go away and
   shew these things to Pilate.  44  And while they yet thought thereon,
   the heavens again are seen to open, and a certain man to descend and
   enter into the sepulchre.  45  When the centurion and they that were
   with him saw these things, they hastened in the night to Pilate,
   leaving the tomb which they were watching, and declared all things
   which they had seen, being greatly distressed and saying, Truly he was
   the Son of God.

   Matthew.

   [cf. Mt. xxvii. 24.]

   Chapter XXVIII.

   1  ¶  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
   day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the
   sepulchre.

   2  And, behold, there was a great earthquake:  for the angel of the
   Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the
   door, and sat upon it.

   3  His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:

   Mark.

   Chapter XVI.

   1  ¶  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
   mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might
   come and anoint him.

   2  And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came
   unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.

   3  And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone
   from the door of the sepulchre?

   4  And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away:  for
   it was very great.

   5  And entering into the sepulchre,

   they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white
   garment; and they were affrighted.

   Luke.

   Chapter XXIV.

   1  Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they
   came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared,
   and certain others with them.

   2  And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

   3  And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

   4  And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold,
   two men stood by them in shining garments:

   5  And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth,
   they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

   John.

   Chapter XX.

   1  ¶  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
   was yet dark, unto the sepulchre,

   and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.

   Peter.

   46  Pilate answered and said, I am pure from the blood of the Son of
   God:  but ye determined this.

   47  Then they all drew near and besought him and entreated him to
   command the centurion and the soldiers to say nothing of the things
   which they had seen:  48  For it is better, say they, for us to incur
   the greatest sin before God, and not to fall into the hands of the
   people of the Jews and to be stoned.  49  Pilate therefore commanded
   the centurion and the soldiers to say nothing.

   50  And at dawn upon the Lord's day, Mary Magdalen, a disciple of the
   Lord, fearing because of the Jews, since they were burning with wrath,
   had not done at the Lord's sepulchre the things which the women are
   wont to do for those that die and for those that are beloved by them--

   51  she took her friends with her and came to the sepulchre where he
   was laid.

   52  And they feared lest the Jews should see them, and they said,
   Although on the day on which he was crucified we could not weep and
   lament, yet now let us do these things at his sepulchre.

   53  But who shall roll away for us the stone that was laid at the door
   of the sepulchre, that we may enter in and sit by him and do the things
   that are due?  54  For the stone was great, and we fear lest some one
   see us.  And if we cannot, yet if we but set at the door the things
   which we bring for a memorial of him, we will weep and lament, until we
   come unto our home.

   55  And they went away and found the tomb opened,

   and coming near they looked in there;

   and they see there a certain young man sitting in the midst of the
   tomb, beautiful and clothed in a robe exceeding bright;

   Matthew.

   4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.

   5  And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:  for I
   know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

   6  He is not here:  for he is risen, as he said.  Come, see the place
   where the Lord lay.

   7  And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the
   dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see
   him:  lo, I have told you.

   8  And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great
   joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.

   Mark.

   6  And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted:  ye seek Jesus of
   Nazareth, which was crucified:  he is risen; he is not here:  behold
   the place where they laid him.

   7  But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before
   you into Galilee:  there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.

   8  And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for they
   trembled and were amazed:  neither said they any thing to any man; for
   they were afraid.

   Luke.

   6  He is not here, but is risen:  remember how he spake unto you when
   he was yet in Galilee,

   7  Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
   men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

   8  And they remembered his words,

   9  And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the
   eleven, and to all the rest.

   John.

   Peter.

   who said unto them, 56  Wherefore are ye come?  Whom seek ye?  Him that
   was crucified?  He is risen and gone.  But if ye believe not, look in
   and see the place where he lay, that he is not [here]; for he is risen
   and gone away thither, whence he was sent.

   57  Then the women feared and fled.

   58  Now it was the last day of the unleavened bread, and many were
   going forth, returning to their homes, as the feast was ended.  59  But
   we, the twelve disciples of the Lord, mourned and were grieved:  and
   each one, being grieved for that which was come to pass, departed to
   his home.  60  But I, Simon Peter and Andrew my brother, took our nets
   and went to the sea; and there was with us Levi the son of Alphæus,
   whom the Lord...

   The Diatessaron of Tatian

   By

   Rev. Hope W. Hogg, B.D.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The aim of the following introductory paragraphs is neither to furnish
   a detailed restatement of facts already known, nor to offer an
   independent contribution to the discussion of the problems that arise,
   although in other circumstances such an attempt might be made with
   advantage.  All that is needed and practicable here is to describe
   briefly, if possible, the nature of the connection between the English
   treatise forming the next part of this volume and the ancient work
   known as the Diatessaron of Tatian; and then to indicate in a few words
   some of the more important or interesting features of the work itself,
   and some of the historical and other problems that are in one way or
   another connected with it.

   1  The Text Translated.--What is offered to the reader is a translation
   into English of an Arabic text, published at Rome in 1888, in a volume
   entitled in Arabic Diatessaron, which Titianus Compiled from the Four
   Gospels, with the alternative Latin title, Tatiani Evangeliorum
   Harmoniæ, Arabice.  The Roman volume consists of two parts--the text,
   covering a little over 209 very clearly printed Arabic pages, and a
   Latin half, comprising a scholarly introduction (pp. v.-xv.), a Latin
   translation (pp. 1-99), and a table showing the order in which the
   passages taken from the gospels occur in the text.  The editor is P.
   Agostino Ciasca, a well known Orientalist, "scriptor" at the Vatican
   Library.

   2  Former Translations.--In his Introduction (p. xiv. f.) Ciasca
   explains that in his translation he aimed at preserving quantum, salva
   fidelitate, integrum fuit, indolem stylumque Clementinæ Vulgate.  This
   Latin version was in its turn translated into English by the Rev. J.
   Hamlyn Hill, B.D., and published in 1894 in a volume entitled The
   Earliest Life of Christ, with an interesting introduction and a number
   of valuable appendices.  The ms. of Mr. Hill's translation of the Latin
   of Ciasca was compared with the Arabic original by Mr. G. Buchanan
   Gray, M.A., lecturer in Hebrew and the Old Testament in Mansfield
   College, Oxford.

   3  The Present Translation.--The translation offered here is quite
   independent of either of these two.  Ciasca's Latin was seldom
   consulted, except when it was thought the Arabic might perhaps be
   obscured by a misprint.  After the translation was completed, Hill's
   English was compared with it to transfer Mr. Hill's valuable system of
   references to the margin of this work, and to lessen the risk of
   oversights passing the last revision unnoticed.  In two or three cases
   this process led to the adoption of a different construction, and in a
   few of the more awkward passages a word was borrowed as being less
   harsh than that which had originally been written.  Speaking generally,
   the present version appears to differ from Mr. Hill's in adhering more
   closely to the original. [17]

   4  The Arabic Text.--Only two Arabic mss. are known to exist.  Ciasca
   tells us (p. xiv.) that he took as the basis of his text that ms. which
   is more careful in its orthography, the Cod. Vat. Arab. No. 14.  He,
   however, printed at the foot of the page the variants of the other ms.,
   and supplied from it two lacunæ in the Cod. Vat., [18] substituted its
   readings for those of the Cod. Vat. where he thought them preferable,
   and followed its testimony in omitting two important passages. [19]
   Here and there Ciasca has emended the text, but he does not profess to
   have produced a critical edition. [20]

   5  The Arabic mss.--Unfortunately, the present writer has not had an
   opportunity of examining these two mss.; but they have been described
   at some length by Ciasca; Codex XIV. in Pitra's Analecta Sacra, iv.,
   465 ff., and the other codex in the volume with which we are dealing,
   p. vi. ff.  I. The former, which we shall call the Vatican ms. (in
   Ciasca's footnotes it is called A), was brought to the Vatican from the
   East by Joseph S. Assemani [21] about a.d. 1719.  It was described by
   Stephen E. Assemani, [22] Rosenmüller, and Akerblad, [23] and then at
   length by Ciasca, to whose account the reader must be referred for the
   details.  It consists of 123 folios, of which the first seven are
   somewhat spoiled, and of which two are missing, [24] and is supposed by
   Ciasca, from the character of the writing, and from the presence of
   certain Coptic letters [25] by the first hand, to have been written in
   Egypt.  S. Assemani assigned it to the twelfth century, and Ciasca
   accepts his verdict, while Akerblad says the thirteenth or fourteenth
   century.  The text of the ms. is pretty fully vocalised, but there are
   few diacritical points.  There are marginal notes, some of them by a
   later hand, [26] which Ciasca classifies as (1) emendations, (2)
   restorations, (3) explanations.  II. The second ms., which we shall
   call the Borgian (in Ciasca's footnotes it is called B), was brought to
   the Borgian Museum from Egypt in August, 1886.  It has at the end the
   following inscription in Arabic:  "A present from Halim Dos Ghali, the
   Copt, the Catholic, to the Apostolic See, in the year of Christ 1886."
   [27]   Antonius Morcos, Visitor Apostolic of the Catholic Copts, when,
   in the beginning of 1886, he was shown and informed about the Vatican
   ms., told of this other one and was the means of its being sent to
   Rome.  The Borgian ms., which Ciasca refers to the fourteenth century,
   consists of 355 folios.  Folios 1-85 [28] contain an anonymous preface
   on the gospels, briefly described by Ciasca, who, however, does not say
   whether it appears to have been originally written in Arabic or to have
   been translated into that language.  With folios 96b, 97a, which are
   reproduced in phototype in Ciasca's edition, begins the Introductory
   Note given in full at the beginning of the present translation.  The
   text of the Diatessaron ends on folio 353a, but is followed by certain
   appendices, for which see below, §55, 17, note.  This ms. is complete,
   and has, as we shall see, [29] in some respects a better text, though
   it is worse in its orthography than the Vatican ms.

   6  Condition of the Arabic Text.--Ciasca's text does not profess to be
   critically determined, for which purpose a more careful study of each
   of the mss. and an estimate of their respective texts would be
   indispensable.  Although the Borgian ms. is supposed by Ciasca to be a
   century or two later than the Vatican ms. it is clearly not a copy of
   the latter, for not only does it sometimes offer more original
   readings, but, as we shall see, its text in some points coincides more
   exactly in scope with the original work.  The list of various readings
   supplied by Ciasca, [30] which is equal to about a fifth or a quarter
   of the text itself, ought to yield, on being analysed, some canons of
   criticism.  The footnotes of the present edition are enough to show
   that a number of the peculiar features of Ciasca's text do not belong
   to the original Arabic ms.; and further study would dispose of still
   more.  On the other hand, there are unfortunately some indications [31]
   that the common ancestor of both mss., though perhaps less than two
   centuries removed from the original, was not the original itself, and
   therefore emendation may be necessary even where both mss. agree.  From
   first to last it has to be borne in mind that a great deal of work was
   done at Arabic versions of the gospels, [32] and the text of the copy
   from which our two mss. are descended may already have suffered from
   contact with other versions; while the special activity of the
   thirteenth century may have left its mark in some places on the text of
   the Borgian ms., supposing it to be chronologically the later.

   7  Origin of the Arabic Text.--If some of the uncouthness of the Arabic
   text is due to corruption in the course of transmission, much is also
   due to its being not an original work, but a translation.  That it is,
   in the main, a translation from Syriac is too obvious to need proof.
   [33]   The Introductory Notice and Subscription to the Borgian ms.,
   moreover, expressly state that the work was translated by one Abu'l
   Faraj Abdulla ibn-at-Tayyib, [34] an "excellent and learned priest,"
   and the inferiority of parts of the translation, [35] and entire
   absence of any confirmatory evidence, [36] hardly suffice to refute
   this assertion.  Still, the Borgian ms. is a late witness, and although
   it most probably preserves a genuine tradition as to the author of our
   work, its statement need not therefore necessarily be correct in every
   point.

   8  The Arabic Editor and his Method.--Ibn-at-Tayyib (d. 1043) is a well
   known man, a Nestorian monk and scholar, secretary to Elias I.,
   Patriarch of Nisibis (for references to sources see, e.g., Ciasca's
   Introduction, p. xi. f. and Steinschneider's long note in his
   Polemische und apologetische Lit. in Arabische Sprache, pp. 52-55).  As
   we are here concerned with him simply as a link in the chain connecting
   our present work with its original source, the only point of interest
   for us is the method he followed in producing it.  Did he prepare an
   independent translation or did he make use of existing Arabic versions,
   his own or others'?  Until this question which space forbids us to
   discuss here, has been more thoroughly investigated, [37] it must
   suffice to say that in view of the features in the present text that
   have not yet been shown to exist in any other Arabic version, it is
   still at least a tenable hypothesis that Ibn-at-Tayyib's ms.
   constituted to a considerable extent a real translation rather than a
   sort of Arabic parallel to the Codex Fuldensis (see below, 12).

   9  The Syriac Text Translated--The eleventh century ms. of
   Ibn-at-Tayyib, could we reach it, would bring us face to face with the
   more interesting question of the nature of his Syriac original.  The
   Subscription to the Borgian ms. states, probably copying the statement
   from its exemplar, that this was a. Syriac ms. in the handwriting of
   Isa ibn-Ali al Motatabbib, pupil of Honain ibn Ishak.  This Honain was
   a famous Arabic physician and medical writer of Bagdad (d. 873), whose
   school produced quite a number of translations and translators, among
   whom Ibn-Ali, supposed to be identical with the Syriac lexicographer of
   the same name, is known to have had a high place.  The Syriac ms.,
   therefore, that Ibn-at-Tayyib translated takes us back to about the
   year 900.  But the Subscription to each of our mss. [38] states that
   the work ended is the gospel called Diatessaron, compiled from the four
   gospels by Titianus; while the Introductory Note to the Borgian ms.
   adds that this Titianus was a Greek.  The next step, therefore, is to
   inquire whether any traces exist of such a Syriac work, or any
   statements by which we can check the account just given of it.

   10  Other Traces of a Syriac Text.--No copy of a Syriac Diatessaron has
   yet been shown to have survived. [39]   A number of quotations [40]
   from such a work have, however, been found in a Syriac commentary on
   the New Testament by Ishodad of Merv (circ. 852), a contemporary of
   Honain, Ibn-Ali's teacher. [41]   The value of these extracts is
   apparent, for they take us back one generation earlier than
   Ibn-at-Tayyib's Syriac exemplar.  More important still, they do not
   entirely agree with the text of our Arabic version.  To solve the
   problem thus raised, we must examine some of the statements about the
   Diatessaron to be found in ecclesiastical writers.

   11  Statements about the Diatessaron.--One of the most widely known is
   that of Ishodad himself, who, in his Preface to the Gospel of Mark,
   says:  "Tatian, disciple of Justin, the philosopher and martyr,
   selected from the four gospels, and combined and composed a gospel, and
   called it Diatessaron, i.e., the Combined,...and upon this gospel Mar
   Ephraem commented." [42]   Dionysius Bar Salibi (twelfth century)
   repeats each of these phrases, adding, "Its commencement was, In the
   beginning was the Word.'" [43]   These statements identify the author
   of the Diatessaron with a man otherwise known, and tell us that the
   great Syrian father Ephraem (d. 373) wrote a commentary on it.
   Unfortunately, no Syriac ms. of Ephraem's work is known to have
   survived; [44] but quotations from it, or allusions to it, are being
   found in other Syriac writers.  One further reference will suffice for
   the present.  Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrrhus, four hundred years before
   Ishodad, wrote thus in his book on Heresies (written in 453):  "Tatian
   the Syrian....This [writer] also composed the gospel which is called
   Diatessaron, cutting out the genealogies and whatever other passages
   show that the Lord was born of the seed of David according to the
   flesh." [45]   Before examining the testimonials we have now adduced,
   we must notice certain more remote sources of information.

   12  Non-Syriac Texts of the Diatessaron.--Although Ephraem's Syriac
   commentary on the Diatessaron is for the present lost, there is an
   Armenian version of it [46] extant in two mss. dating from about the
   time of Bar Salibi and our Vat. ms. [47]   A Latin translation of this
   work, published in 1876 by Moesinger, [48] formed the main basis of
   Zahn's attempt [49] to reconstruct the Diatessaron.  Appendix X in
   Hill's Diatessaron (pp. 334-377) contains an English translation of the
   texts commented on by Ephraem, made from Moesinger's Latin, but
   collated with the Armenian by Professor J. Armitage Robinson, of
   Cambridge.  A comparison of this document with our Arabic text shows a
   remarkable agreement in the order and contents, but just as remarkable
   a lack of agreement in the kind of text presented.  The same phenomenon
   is met with when we compare our Arabic text with a document that
   carries us back three hundred years before the time of Ishodad, and
   therefore more than six hundred years before the Armenian mss.--the
   Codex Fuldensis of the Vulgate. [50]   This ms. contains an arrangement
   of the gospel matter that its discoverer and publisher, Bishop Victor
   of Capua (d. 554), rightly concluded must represent the Diatessaron of
   Tatian, but for the text of which was apparently substituted that of
   the Vulgate. [51]   We are now ready to weigh the testimony we have
   gathered. [52]

   13  Accretions to the Diatessaron.--The statements we are to consider
   are:  (1) Bar Salibi's, that Tatian's Diatessaron began with "In the
   beginning was the Word"; [53] (2) Theodoret's, that Tatian cut out the
   genealogies; and (3) the same writer's, that Tatian also cut out
   "whatever other passages show that the Lord was born of the seed of
   David according to the flesh."  Of these statements 1 conflicts with
   the Arabic text, which begins with Mark, and the Codex Fuldensis, which
   begins with Luke, but agrees with the Ephraem source; the same is true
   of 2; while 3 conflicts with all three texts.  Our limits do not admit
   of our discussing these points in detail.  It must suffice to say (1)
   that, although a more careful examination at firsthand of the
   introductory notices in the two Arabic mss. seems needed before one can
   venture to propound a complete theory, a comparison of the two texts,
   and a consideration of the descriptions given by Ciasca and Lagarde,
   [54] make it almost certain that the genuine Arabic text of
   Ibn-at-Tayyib began with John i. 1.  Similarly the first four verses of
   Luke (on which see also below, § 1. 6, note) were probably not in the
   original text of the ms. that Victor found, for they are not mentioned
   in the (old) table of contents.  We seem thus to detect a process of
   gradual accretion of material drawn from the ordinary gospel text.  (2)
   The genealogies illustrate the same process.  In the Vatican ms. they
   form part of the text. [55]   But in the Borgian ms., although they
   precede the Subscription, and therefore may have been already in the
   ninth century Syriac ms. used by Ibn-at-Tayyib, they are still placed
   by themselves, after a blank space, at the end of the volume, with a
   title of their own. [56]   Here, therefore, we actually see stages of
   the process of accretion.  (3) It is therefore possible that the same
   account must also be given of 3, although in this case we have no
   direct proof.

   14  Passages Lost from the Diatessaron.--If the Diatessaron has thus
   been growing so as to represent the ordinary text of the canonical
   gospels more completely, we have also evidence that suggests that it
   has been at some time or times purged of certain features that are
   lacking in these canonical gospels.  For one case of this kind see
   below, §4, 36, note.

   15  Presentation of the Text of the Diatessaron.--We have observed
   already that the Latin, Armenian, and Arabic Diatessarons correspond
   pretty closely in subject matter and arrangement, but differ markedly
   in text.  The Codex Fuldensis is really a ms. of the Vulgate, although
   the text that Victor found was probably somewhat different.  The
   Armenian text differs materially from the ordinary Syriac version of
   the New Testament (the Peshitta), showing a marked connection with
   another type of Syriac text represented now by the Curetonian and
   Sinaitic (Lewis) mss.  The Arabic text, on the other hand, almost
   systematically represents the Peshitta.  The explanation of the
   condition of text in the Codex Fuldensis is obvious.  On the other
   hand, the relationship of the Armenian and Arabic texts to the original
   Diatessaron must be determined by weighing very multifarious evidence
   that cannot be even cited here (see above 6 ff.).  The two texts
   depend, as we have seen, on late mss. but all the earlier references
   and quotations go to show that the Armenian text [57] stands much more
   closely related to the original than does the Arabic.

   16  Checkered History of the Diatessaron.--What use the Arabic edition
   of Ibn-at-Tayyib was put to when made we do not know.  Abd Isho (d.
   1318) speaks in the highest terms of Tatian's work, saying, "...With
   all diligence he attended to the utmost degree to the right order of
   those things which were said and done by the Saviour; of his own he did
   not add a single saying." [58]   But the leaders of the Syrian church
   had not always thought so.  Theodoret (loc. cit.) some nine hundred
   years earlier had written thus:  "...Even those that follow the
   apostolic doctrines, not perceiving the mischief of the composition,"
   used "the book too simply as an abridgment."  A few years earlier
   Rabbula, Bishop of Edessa (d. 435), had said: [59]   "Let the
   presbyters and deacons give heed that in all the churches there be
   provided and read a copy of the Distinct Gospel," i.e., not the
   harmonized or mixed gospel.  But obviously these men were trying to
   suppress traditional practice due to very different views.  Theodoret
   (loc. cit.) found more than two hundred copies of the work "held in
   respect in the churches"; and the Doctrine of Addai (Edessa, third to
   fourth century) seems simply to identify the Diatessaron and the New
   Testament. [60]   Outside of the Syriac speaking churches we find no
   signs of any such use of the Diatessaron.  It would seem, therefore,
   that at a quite early stage the Diatessaron was very widely if not
   universally read in the Syriac churches, and commented on by scholars
   as the gospel; that in time it fell under the condemnation of some at
   least of the church leaders, who made violent efforts to suppress it;
   that it could not be suppressed; that a commentary on it was (perhaps
   in the fifth century [61] ) translated into Armenian; that it was still
   discussed by commentators, and new Syriac mss. of it made in the ninth
   century, and thought worth the labor of reproduction in Arabic in the
   beginning of the eleventh century; that mss. of the Armenian volume
   continued to be made down to the very end of the twelfth century, and
   of the Arabic edition down to the fourteenth century; but that this
   long life was secured at the expense of a more or less rapid
   assimilation of the text to that of the great Syriac Bible which from
   the fourth century onwards became more and more exclusively used--the
   Peshitta.

   17  The Author of the Diatessaron.--The Diatessaron is such an
   impersonal work that we do not need to know very much about its
   compiler. [62]   It will suffice here to say that he tells us himself
   that he was born "in the land of the Assyrians," and brought up a
   heathen.  After travelling in search of knowledge, he settled at Rome,
   where he became a pupil of Justin Martyr, professed Christianity, and
   wrote in Greek his Address to the Greeks, [63] translated in vol. iii.
   of the Ante-Nicene Christian Library.  He was too independent in his
   attitude to maintain a permanent popularity, and after Justin's death
   left Rome and returned to Mesopotamia.  It was probably here that he
   issued in Syriac his most important work, the Diatessaron, which won
   such a warm place in the heart of the Syrian church.  Among the Greek
   scholars, however, he became more and more regarded as a heretic,
   Encratite (ascetic), and Gnostic.

   18  The Diatessaron as a Harmony.--Not very much need be said on this
   subject, as every reader can collect the facts for himself.  In its
   present form the Harmony draws from all the four canonical gospels, and
   from very little else.  Opinions differ as to whether it originally
   indicated the gospel from which any given piece was drawn, and some
   uncertainty must remain in special cases as to what gospel actually has
   been drawn upon.  Professor G. F. Moore, in a very interesting article
   on the Diatessaron, [64] having counted the references in the Arabic
   mss., states that the Arabic text contains 50 percent of Mark, 66
   percent of Luke, 76.5 percent of Matthew, and 96 percent of John.  The
   summation of his figures gives the following result:  out of a total of
   3780 verses in the four gospels, the Diatessaron quotes 2769 and omits
   1011.  As to the order in which the whole is arranged, Moore thinks
   that Matthew has chiefly been followed; while Zahn regards the Fourth
   Gospel as normative.  For a specimen of the way in which words and
   phrases from the different gospels are woven together, we may refer to
   § 52, 35 ff., and the notes thereon.  In the Arabic mss., and probably
   in the Syriac exemplar, the work is divided into fifty-four almost
   equal chapters, followed by one short one--a feature that agrees well
   with what we have learned of the work as being of old the lectionary of
   the Syrian church.

   19  Problems Connected with the Diatessaron.--The Diatessaron opens up
   a very wide field of study.  A few points may be here enumerated (see
   also above, 8, and note there).  In what language was it written?  On
   the view favoured by an increasing majority of scholars, that it was
   written in Syriac, was it a translation or simply a compilation?  What
   precisely is its relation to the Syriac versions and the "Western" text
   generally?  Then there is its bearing on the date and formation of the
   canonical gospels; the phenomenon of its so long supplying the place of
   those gospels; the analogy it presents to the Pentateuch, according to
   the critical view of the origin of the latter.  These and other issues
   make the Diatessaron an important and interesting study.

   20  The Present Translation.--The work of translation has been found
   much more tedious than was anticipated, notwithstanding the fact that
   considerably more than half of it is the work of my wife, which I have
   simply revised with special attention to the many obscurities dealt
   with in the footnotes.  We have, however, worked so much together that
   it is very doubtful whether any one could assign the various parts to
   their respective sources.  My wife also verified the Arabic references
   to the gospels printed on the margin to the right of the text, [65] and
   prepared the Index to these references--an extremely laborious and
   perplexing piece of work.  This Index is inserted merely for the
   practical purpose of enabling the reader to find any given gospel piece
   in the Diatessaron.  When a verse is not found in the Index, an
   equivalent passage from some of the other gospels should be looked
   for.  On the margin to the left of the text are indicated the pages of
   the Arabic text and the sections and verses in Hill's version. [66]

   The aim has been to make a literal translation.  As two freer
   translations already exist, it seemed best to incline to the side of
   being overliteral.  If, however, features due simply to Arabic idiom
   have been preserved, this is an oversight.  Uniformity could only have
   been secured by devoting a much longer time to the work than the editor
   was able to allow.  The difficulties are due to the corrupt state of
   the Arabic text, [67] and to the awkward reproduction [68] or actual
   misunderstanding [69] of the Syriac original by the author or authors
   of the Arabic translation.  It has been impossible to maintain
   consistency in dealing with these phenomena.  If any rendering seem
   strange, it will be well to consult the Syriac versions before deciding
   that it is wrong.  A good deal of attention, too, has to be paid to the
   usage of the Arabic text, which, though it has many points of contact
   with other Arabic versions of the gospels, e.g., the ms. described by
   Gildemeister (De evangg. in arab. e simp. Syr., 1865), is as yet for us
   (see above, 8) a distinct version, possessed of an individuality of its
   own, one pronounced feature being its very close adherence to its
   Syriac original.  Another revision of the present translation, in the
   light of a fuller study of these features, would doubtless lead to
   changes both in the text and in the footnotes.  The latter aim at
   preventing misunderstanding and giving some examples of the
   peculiarities of the text, and of the differences between the mss.  To
   have dealt systematically with the text and various readings would have
   required much more time and space than was available.  The consequence
   of this incompleteness has been some uncertainty at times what text to
   translate.  As already stated (paragraphs 4 and 6), Ciasca's printed
   text neither represents any one ms. nor professes to be based in its
   eclecticism on any systematic critical principles.  On the whole Ciasca
   has here been followed somewhat mechanically in deciding what to
   exhibit in the text and what to relegate to the footnotes.  As a rule
   conjectural emendations have not been admitted into the text except
   where the ms. readings would hardly bear translation.  Italics in the
   text denote words supplied for the sake of English idiom; in the
   footnotes, quotations from the mss.  It is to be noted that many
   linguistic usages said, for shortness, in the footnotes to be
   characteristic of the present work, i.e., as compared with ordinary
   Arabic, are common in Arabic versions.  "Syriac versions" means the
   three (Pesh., Cur., Sin.), or as many of them as contain the passage in
   question; if the Peshitta alone is quoted, it may be assumed that Cur.
   and Sin. are missing or diverge.

   In conclusion we may say that an effort has been made to preserve even
   the order of words; but it must be emphasized that it is very doubtful
   whether it is wise for any one to use the Arabic Diatessaron for
   critical purposes who is not acquainted with Arabic and Syriac.  The
   tenses, e.g., are much vaguer in Arabic than in Greek and English, and
   are, moreover, in this work often accommodated to Syriac idiom.  The
   Greek and the Revised Version have been used to determine in almost
   every case how the vague Arabic tenses and conjunctions should be
   rendered.  It is therefore only where it differs from these that our
   translation can be quoted without investigation as giving positive
   evidence.

   This is not a final translation.  Few books have had a more remarkable
   literary history than the Diatessaron, and that history is by no means
   done.  Much careful argument will yet be devoted to it, and perhaps
   discoveries as important as any hitherto made are yet to shed light on
   the problems that encircle it.  If our work can help any one to take a
   step in advance, we shall not regret the toil.

   [36] The references to the readings of the Diatessaron in
   Ibn-at-Tayyib's own commentary on the gospels (see next note) are
   remarkably impersonal for one who had made or was to make a translation
   of it.

   [37] A specially important part of the general question is this, What
   are the mutual relations of the following:  (1) a supposed version of
   at least Matthew and John made from the Syriac by Ibn-at-Tayyib,
   mentioned by Ibn-al-Assal in the Preface to his scholarly recension of
   the gospels (ms. numbered Or. 3382 in Brit. Mus., folio 384b) and used
   by him in determining his text; (2) the gospel text interwoven with the
   commentary of Ibn-at-Tayyib on the gospels, a commentary which De Slane
   says the author wrote in Syriac and then translated into Arabic; (3)
   our present work.  Of mss. testifying to No. 1 we have some dating from
   the time of Ibn-al-Assal himself; of No. 2 we have, in addition to
   others, an eleventh-century ms. in Paris, described by De Slane
   (catalogue No. 85) as being "un volume dépareillé du ms. original de
   l'ouvrage"; of No. 3 we have of course the Vatican and Borgian mss.
   What is the mutual relation of these texts; were any two of them
   identical?  The Brit. Mus. ms. of the second has many points of contact
   with the third, but is dated 1805 a.d.  Does the older Paris ms. stand
   more or less closely related?  Did Ibn-at-Tayyib himself really
   translate any or all of these texts, or did he simply select or edit
   them?  Space does not permit us to point out, far less to discuss, the
   various possibilities.

   [38] The text is given below in full at its proper place.

   [39] Prof. Gottheil, indeed, announced in 1892 in the Journal of
   Biblical Literature (vol. xi., pt. i., p. 71) that he had been
   privately informed of the existence of a complete copy of the Syriac
   Diatessaron.  Unfortunately, however, as he has kindly informed me, he
   has reluctantly come to the conclusion that the ms. in question, which
   is not yet accessible, is "nothing more than the commentary of Ishodad"
   mentioned in the text.  A similar rumor lately circulated probably
   originated simply in the pamphlet of Goussen mentioned in the next
   note.  S. Bäumer, on the other hand, in his article, "Tatians
   Diatessaron, seine bisher. Lit. u. die Reconstruction des Textes nach
   einer neuentdeckten Handschrift" (Literarischer Handweiser, 1890,
   153-169) which the present writer has not been able to see, perhaps
   refers simply to the Borgian ms.

   [40] Attention was called to these by Profs. Isaac H. Hall and R. J. H.
   Gottheil (Journ. of Bibl. Lit., x., 153 ff.; xi., 68 ff.); then by
   Prof. J. R. Harris (Contemp. Rev., Aug., 1895, p. 271 ff., and, more
   fully, Fragments of the Com. of Ephr. Syr. on the Diatess., London,
   1895) and by Goussen (Studia Theologica, fasc. i., Lips., 1895).

   [41] Prof. Harris promises an edition of this commentary.

   Hebræus (d. 1286), although some confusion is produced by his
   interweaving some phrases from Eusebius of Cæsarea.  (Bib. Or., i., 57
   f., and a longer quotation in English in Contemp. Rev., Aug., 1895, p.
   274 f.)

   [44] Lagarde's statement (Nachrichten von der Königl. Gesellsch. der
   Wiss., etc., zu Göttingen, 1891, No. 4, p. 153) that a ms. had been
   discovered, appears to have been unfounded.  Prof. Rahlfs of Göttingen
   kindly tells me that he believes this is so.

   Introductory Notes.

   ------------------------

   1.  In the Borgian Ms.

   In the name of the one God, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy
   Spirit, to him be the glory forever.  We shall begin, with the help of
   God most high, the writing of the pure gospel, the blooming garden,
   called Diatessaron (a word meaning "fourfold"), the work compiled by
   Titianus the Greek out of the four evangelists--Matthew the elect,
   whose symbol is M, Mark the chosen, whose symbol is R, Luke the
   approved, whose symbol is K, and John the beloved, whose symbol is H.
   The work was translated from Syriac into Arabic by the excellent and
   learned priest Abu'l Faraj Abdulla ibn-at-Tayyib, [70] may God grant
   him his favour.  He began with the first of [71] And he said:  The
   Beginning [72] of the Gospel of Jesus the Son of the living God.  John:
   [73]   In the beginning, etc.

   2.  In the Vatican ms.

   In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, giver of
   life, the God that is one in substance in his essence, and three in
   persons in his attributes.  The first of his Gospel is He began the
   first of his Gospel with Mark.  And he said:  The Beginning [74] of the
   Gospel of Jesus the Son of the living God.  John:  In the beginning,
   etc.

   [70] The ms. here has Tabib, but the name is correctly given in the
   Subscription (q.v.).

   [71] i.e., simply He began with.

   [72] The vowel signs as printed by Ciasca imply some such construction
   asAnd he said as a beginning:  The Gospel, etc.  But the vocalisation
   is of course not authoritative, and a comparison with the preface in
   the Vatican ms. suggests the rendering given above.  The word
   translated Beginning in the two Introductory Notes is the very word
   (whichever spelling be adopted) used by Ibn-at-Tayyib himself in his
   comments on Mark i. (at least according to the Brit. Mus. ms.),
   although not in the gospel text prefixed to the Comments as it now
   stands, or indeed in any ms. Arabic gospel in the Brit. Mus.  This
   would seem to militate against our theory of the original form of this
   much-debated passage in the Introductory Notes, as indicated by the use
   of small type for the later inserted phrases; and the difficulty
   appears at first to be increased by the following words in
   Ibn-at-Tayyib's comments on Mark i. (Brit. Mus. ms., fol. 190a), and
   some say that the Greek citation and in the Diatessaron, which Tatianus
   the pupil of Justianus the philosopher wrote, the quotation is not
   written, "Isaiah," but, "as it is written in the prophet."  This is a
   remarkable statement about the Diatessaron.  But the sentence is hardly
   grammatical.  Perhaps the words printed in italics originally formed a
   complete sentence by themselves, possibly on the margin.  If this
   conjecture be correct we might emend, e.g., by restoring them to the
   margin, and repeating the last three words or some equivalent phrase in
   the text.  It would be interesting to know how the Paris ms. reads.

   The Text of the Diatessaron.

   ------------------------

   [Section I]

   [1] [75] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
   God is the [2,3] Word.  [76] This was in the beginning with God.  [77]
   Everything was by his hand, and [4] without him not even one existing
   thing was made.  [78] In him was life, and the life [5] is the light of
   men.  [79] And the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness
   apprehended it not.

   [6] [80] [81] There was in the days of Herod the king a priest whose
   name was Zacharias, of the family of Abijah; and his wife was of the
   daughters of Aaron, and her name [7] was Elizabeth.  [82] And they were
   both righteous before God, walking in all his commands, [8] and in the
   uprightness of God without reproach.  [83] And they had no son, for [9]
   Elizabeth was barren, and they had both advanced in age.  [84] And
   while he discharged [10] [Arabic, p. 2] the duties of priest in the
   order of his service before God, [85] according to the custom of the
   priesthood it was his turn to burn incense; so he entered the [11]
   temple of the Lord.  [86] And the whole gathering of the people were
   praying without at the [12] time of the incense.  [87] And there
   appeared unto Zacharias the angel of the Lord, standing [13] at the
   right of the altar of incense; [88] and Zacharias was troubled when he
   saw him, [14] and fear fell upon him.  [89] But the angel said unto
   him, Be not agitated, [90] Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard, and thy
   wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt [15] call his name
   John; [91] and thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice
   [16] at his birth.  [92] And he shall be great before the Lord, and
   shall not drink wine nor strong drink, and he shall be filled with the
   Holy Spirit [93] while he is in his mother's [17] womb.  [94] And he
   shall turn back many of the children of Israel to the Lord their [18]
   God.  [95] And he shall go before him in the spirit, and in the power
   of Elijah the prophet, to turn back the heart of the fathers to the
   sons, and those that obey not to the knowledge [96] of the righteous;
   and to prepare for the Lord a perfect people.  [19] [97] And Zacharias
   said unto the angel, How shall I know this, since I am an old man [20]
   and my wife is advanced in years?  [98] And the angel answered and said
   unto him, I am Gabriel, that standeth before God; and I was sent to
   speak unto thee, and give [21] thee tidings of this.  [99] Henceforth
   thou shalt be speechless, and shalt not be able to speak until the day
   in which this shall come to pass, because thou didst not trust [22]
   this my word, which shall be accomplished in its time.  [100] And the
   people were standing [Arabic, p. 3] awaiting Zacharias, and they were
   perplexed at his delaying in the temple.  [23] [101] And when Zacharias
   went out, he was not able to speak unto them:  so they knew that he had
   seen in the temple a vision; and he made signs unto them, and [24]
   continued dumb.  [102] And when the days of his service were completed,
   he departed to his dwelling.

   [25] [103] And after those days Elizabeth his wife conceived; and she
   hid herself five [26] months, and said, [104] This hath the Lord done
   unto me in the days when he looked upon me, to remove my reproach from
   among men.

   [27] [105] And [106] in the sixth month Gabriel the angel was sent from
   God to Galilee [107] to a [28] city called Nazareth, [108] to a virgin
   given in marriage to a man named Joseph, of the [29] house of David;
   and the virgin's name was Mary.  [109] And the angel entered unto her
   and said unto her, Peace be unto thee, thou who art filled with grace.
   Our Lord [30] is with thee, thou blessed amongst women.  [110] And she,
   when she beheld, was agitated [31] at his word, and pondered what this
   salutation could be.  [111] And the angel said unto [32] her, Fear not,
   Mary, for thou hast found favour with God.  [112] Thou shalt now
   conceive, [33] and bear a son, and call his name Jesus.  [113] This
   shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the
   Lord God will give him the throne of [34] David his father:  and he
   shall rule over the house of Jacob for ever; [114] and to his [35]
   kingdom there shall be no end.  [115] Mary said unto the angel, How
   shall this be to [36] me when no man hath known me?  [116] The angel
   answered and said unto her, The [Arabic, p. 4] Holy Spirit will come,
   and the power of the Most High shall rest upon thee, and therefore
   shall he that is born of thee be pure, and shall be called the Son [37]
   of God.  [117] And lo, Elizabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived
   a son in her old [38] age; and this is the sixth month with her, her
   that is called barren.  [118] For nothing is [39] difficult for God.
   [119] Mary said, Lo, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be unto me
   according unto thy word.  And the angel departed from her.

   [40] [120] And then Mary arose in those days and went in haste into the
   hill country, [121] to a [122] [41] city of Judah; [123] and entered
   into the house of Zacharias, and asked for the health of [42]
   Elizabeth.  [124] And when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the
   babe leaped in [43] her womb.  [125] And Elizabeth was filled with the
   Holy Spirit; and cried with a loud voice and said unto Mary, Blessed
   art thou amongst women, and blessed is the [44] fruit that is in thy
   womb.  [126] Whence have I this privilege, that the mother of my [45]
   Lord should come unto me?  [127] When the sound of thy salutation
   reached my ears, [46] with great joy rejoiced the babe in my womb.
   [128] And blessed is she who believed [47] that what was spoken to her
   from the Lord would be fulfilled.  [129] And Mary said,

   My soul doth magnify the Lord,

   [48] [130] And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour,

   [49] [131] Who hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaiden:

   Lo, henceforth, all generations [132] shall pronounce blessing on me.

   [50] [133] For [134] he hath done great things for me, who is mighty,

   And holy is his name.

   [51] [135] And his mercy embraceth them who fear him,

   Throughout the ages and the times.

   [52] [Arabic, p. 5] [136] He wrought the victory with his arm,

   And scattered them that prided themselves in their opinions.

   [53] [137] He overthrew them that acted haughtily from their thrones,

   And raised the lowly.

   [54] [138] He satisfied with good things the hungry,

   And left the rich without anything.

   [55] [139] He helped Israel his servant,

   And remembered his mercy

   [56] [140] (According as he spake with our fathers)

   Unto Abraham and unto his seed for ever.

   [57] [141] And Mary abode with Elizabeth about three months, and
   returned unto her house.

   [58, 59] [142] And Elizabeth's time of delivery was come; and she
   brought forth a son.  [143] And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that
   God had multiplied his mercy towards her; [60] and they rejoiced with
   her.  [144] And when [145] it was the eighth day, they came to
   circumcise the child, and called him Zacharias, calling him by the name
   of his father.  [61] [146] And his mother answered and said unto them,
   Not so; but he shall be called John.  [62] [147] And they said unto
   her, There is no man of thy kindred that is called by this name.  [63,
   64] [148] And they made signs to his father, saying, How dost thou wish
   to name him?  [149] And he asked for a tablet, and wrote and said, His
   name is John.  And every one wondered.  [65] [150] And immediately his
   mouth was opened, and his tongue, and he spake and [66] praised God.
   [151] And fear fell on all their neighbours:  and this was spoken of
   [152] in all [67] the mountains of Judah.  [153] And all who heard
   pondered in their hearts and said, What shall this child be?  And the
   hand of the Lord was with him.

   [68] [154] And Zacharias his father was filled with the Holy Spirit,
   and prophesied and said,

   [69] [155] Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,

   Who hath cared for his people, and wrought for it salvation;

   [70] [156] And hath raised for us the horn of salvation

   [Arabic, p. 6] In the house of David his servant

   [71] [157] (As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets from
   eternity),

   [72] [158] That he might save us from our enemies,

   And from the hand of all them that hate us.

   [73] [159] And he hath performed his mercy towards our fathers,

   And remembered his holy covenants,

   [74] [160] And the oath which he sware unto Abraham our father,

   [75] [161] That he would give us deliverance from the hand of our
   enemies,

   And without fear we shall [162] serve before him

   [76] [163] All our days with equity and righteousness.

   [77] [164] And as for thee, O child, prophet of the Most High shalt
   thou be called.

   Thou shalt go forth before the face of the Lord to prepare his way,

   [78] [165] To give the knowledge of salvation [166] unto his people,

   For the forgiveness of their sins,

   [79] [167] Through the mercy of [168] the compassion of our God,

   With which he careth for [169] us, to appear [170] from on high

   [80] [171] To give light to them that sit in darkness and under the
   shadow of death,

   And to set straight our feet in the way of peace.

   [81] [172] And the child grew and became strong in the spirit, and
   abode in the desert until the time of his appearing unto the children
   of Israel.

   Section II.

   [1] [Arabic, p. 7] [173] Now [174] the birth of Jesus the Messiah was
   on this wise:  In the time when his mother was given in marriage to
   Joseph, before they came together, [2] she was found with child of the
   Holy Spirit.  [175] And Joseph her husband was a just man and did not
   wish to expose her, and he purposed to put her away secretly.  [3]
   [176] But when he thought of this, the angel of the Lord appeared unto
   him in a dream, and said unto him, Joseph, son of David, fear not to
   take Mary thy wife, for that [4] which is begotten [177] in her is of
   the Holy Spirit.  [178] She shall bear a son, and thou shalt [5] call
   his name Jesus, and he shall save [179] his people from their sins.
   [180] And all this was that the saying from the Lord by the prophet
   might be fulfilled:

   [6] [181] Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,

   And they shall call his name Immanuel,

   [7] which is, being interpreted, With us is our God.  [182] And when
   Joseph arose from his [8] sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord
   commanded him, and took his wife; [183] and knew her not until she
   brought forth her firstborn son.

   [9] [184] And in those days there went forth a decree from Augustus
   Cæsar that all the [10] people of his dominion [185] should be
   enrolled. [186] This first enrolment was [187] while Quirinius [11, 12]
   was governor of Syria.  [188] And every man went to be enrolled in his
   city.  [189] And Joseph went up also from Nazareth, a city of Galilee,
   to Judæa, to the city of David [13] which is called Bethlehem (for he
   was of the house of David and of his tribe), [190] with [14] [Arabic,
   p. 8] Mary his betrothed, she being with child, to be enrolled there.
   [191] And while [15] she was there the days for her being delivered
   were accomplished.  [192] And she brought forth her firstborn son; and
   she wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because
   there was no place for them where they were staying.

   [16] [193] And there were in that region shepherds abiding, keeping
   their flock in the watch [17] of the night.  [194] And behold, the
   angel of God came unto them, and the glory of the [18] Lord shone upon
   them; and they were greatly terrified.  [195] And the angel said unto
   them, Be not terrified; for I bring you tidings of great joy which
   shall be to the [19] whole world; [196] there is born to you this day a
   Saviour, which is the Lord the Messiah, [20] in the city of David.
   [197] And this is a sign for you:  ye shall find a babe wrapped [21] in
   swaddling cloths and laid in a manger.  [198] And there appeared with
   the angels suddenly many heavenly forces praising [199] God and saying,

   [22] [200] Praise be to God in the highest,

   And on the earth peace, and good hope to men.

   [23] [201] And when the angels departed from them to heaven, the
   shepherds spake to one another and said, We will go to Bethlehem and
   see this word which hath been, as [24] the Lord made known unto us.
   [202] And they came with haste, and found Mary and [25] Joseph, and the
   babe laid in a manger.  [203] And when they saw, they reported the word
   [26] which was spoken to them about the child.  [204] And all that
   heard wondered at the [27] description which the shepherds described
   [205] to them.  [206] But Mary kept these [207] sayings [28] and
   discriminated [208] them in her heart.  [209] And those shepherds
   returned, magnifying and praising God for all that they had seen and
   heard, according as it was described unto them.

   [29] [Arabic, p. 9] [210] And when eight days were fulfilled that the
   child should be circumcised, his name was called Jesus, being that by
   which he was called by the angel before his conception in the womb.

   [30] [211] And when the days of their purification according to the law
   of Moses were [31] completed, they took him up to Jerusalem to present
   him before the Lord [212] (as it is written in the law of the Lord,
   Every male opening the womb shall be called the [32] holy thing of the
   Lord), [213] and to give a sacrificial victim as it is said in the law
   of [33] the Lord, A pair of doves or two young pigeons.  [214] And
   there was in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon; and this man was
   upright and pious, and expecting [34] the consolation of Israel; and
   the Holy Spirit was upon him.  [215] And it had been said unto him by
   the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death till he had seen with
   [35] his eyes the Messiah [216] of the Lord.  [217] And this man came
   by the Spirit to the temple; and at the time when his parents brought
   in the child Jesus, that they might [36] present for him a sacrifice,
   as it is written in the law, [218] he bare him in his arms and praised
   God and said,

   [37] [219] Now loosest thou the bonds of thy servant, O Lord, in peace,
   [220]

   According to thy saying;

   [38] [221] For mine eye hath witnessed thy mercy,

   [39] [222] Which thou hast made ready because of the whole world;

   [40] [223] A light for the unveiling [224] of the nations,

   And a glory to thy people Israel.

   [41] [225] And Joseph and his mother were marvelling at the things
   which were being said [42] concerning him.  [226] And Simeon blessed
   them and said to Mary his mother, Behold, he is set for the overthrow
   and rising of many in Israel; and for a sign of contention; [43] [227]
   and a spear [228] shall pierce [229] through thine own soul; that the
   thoughts of the [44] [Arabic, p. 10] hearts of many may be revealed.
   [230] And Anna the prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of
   Asher, was also advanced in years (and she dwelt [45] with her husband
   seven years from her virginity, [231] and she remained a widow about
   eighty-four years); and she left not the temple, and served night and
   day with [46] fasting and prayer.  [232] And she also rose in that hour
   and thanked the Lord, and she [47] spake of him with every one who was
   expecting the deliverance of Jerusalem.  [233] And when they had
   accomplished everything according to what is in the law of the Lord,
   they returned to Galilee, to Nazareth their city.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [173] Matt. i. 18.

   [174] This is preceded in Vat. ms. by the genealogy, Matt. i. 1-17 (see
   Introduction, 13), with the marginal note The Beginning of the Gospel
   of Matthew.  (Lagarde, op. cit., 1886, p. 154.)  The text presents
   nothing worthy of note in this place except that verse 16, construed on
   the same principle as the preceding verses, to which, except in the
   words printed in italics, it is strictly parallel in construction,
   reads thus:  "Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, who of her begat
   Jesus, the Messiah" (cf. the remarkable reading of Sin. Syriac).  As it
   stands, this is the only possible interpretation of the words, for who
   is masculine.  But a mistake in the gender of a relative pronoun is
   very common in Arabic among illiterate people, while in Syriac there
   is, to begin with, no distinction.  If then we correct the relative,
   who of her will become of whom (fem.), and begat will of course be
   construed as passive.  We thus get the text followed in Ibn-at-Tayyib's
   Commentary, the ordinary reading of the Peshitta, of whom was born
   Jesus.

   [175] Matt. i. 19.

   [176] Matt. i. 20.

   [177] The Arabic might even more naturally be rendered born, thus
   giving us the reading that Ishodad tells us was that of the Diatessaron
   (Harris, Fragments, p. 16 f.); but throughout the whole genealogy (see
   § 1, 81, note) this word has been used by the Vat. ms. in the sense of
   begat.  Here the Borg. ms. has of her for in her; but Ibn-at-Tayyib in
   his Commentary discusses why Matthew wrote in and not of.

   [207] Borg. ms. inserts all above the line, after these.  The meaning
   ought then to be, these things, namely, all the sayings.

   [208] The Arab. might mean set them apart; but the Syriac is against
   this.

   Section III.

   [1, 2] [234] And after that, [235] the Magi came from the east to
   Jerusalem, [236] and said, Where is the King of the Jews which was
   born?  We have seen his star in the east, and have [3] come to worship
   him.  [237] And Herod the king heard, and he was troubled, and all [4]
   Jerusalem with him.  [238] And he gathered all the chief priests and
   the scribes of the [5] people, and asked them in what place [239] the
   Messiah should be born.  [240] They said, In Bethlehem of Judæa:  thus
   it is written in the prophet,

   [6] [241] Thou also, Bethlehem of Judah,

   Art not contemptible among the kings of Judah:

   From thee shall go forth a king,

   And he shall be a shepherd to my people Israel.

   [7] [242] Then Herod called the Magi secretly, and inquired of them the
   time at which [8] the star appeared to them.  [243] And he sent them to
   Bethlehem, and said unto them, Go and search about the child
   diligently; and when ye have found him, come and [9] make known to me,
   that I also may go and worship him.  [244] And they, when they [Arabic,
   p. 11] heard the king, departed; and lo, the star which they had seen
   in the east went before them, until it came and stood above the place
   where the child [10, 11] was.  [245] And when they beheld the star,
   they rejoiced with very great joy.  [246] And they entered the house
   and beheld the child with Mary his mother, and fell down worshipping
   him, and opened their saddle-bags and offered to him offerings, gold
   and [12] myrrh and frankincense.  [247] And they saw in a dream [248]
   that they should not return to Herod, and they travelled by another way
   in going to their country.

   [13] [249] And when they had departed, the angel of the Lord appeared
   in a dream to Joseph, and said unto him, Rise, take the child and his
   mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I speak to thee;
   for Herod is determined to seek the child [14] to slay him.  [250] And
   Joseph arose and took the child and his mother in the night, and [15]
   fled into Egypt, [251] and remained in it until the time of the death
   of Herod:  that that might be fulfilled which was said by the Lord in
   the prophet, which said, From [16] Egypt did I call my son.  [252] And
   Herod then, when he saw that he was mocked of the Magi, was very angry,
   and sent and killed all the male children which were in Bethlehem and
   all its borders, from two years old and under, according to the time
   [17] which he had inquired from the Magi.  [253] Then was fulfilled the
   saying in Jeremiah the prophet, which said,

   [18] [254] A voice was heard in Ramah,

   Weeping and much lamentation;

   Rachel weeping [255] for her children,

   And not willing to be consoled for their loss.

   [19] [256] But when Herod the king died, the angel of the Lord appeared
   in a dream to [20] Joseph in Egypt, [257] and said unto him, Rise and
   take the child and his mother, and [Arabic, p. 12] go into the land of
   Israel; for they have died who sought the child's life.  [21] [258] And
   Joseph rose and took the child and his mother, and came to the land
   [22] of Israel.  [259] But when he heard that Archelaus had become king
   over Judæa instead of Herod his father, he feared to go thither; and he
   saw in a dream that he should [23] go into the land of Galilee, [260]
   and that he should abide in a city called Nazareth:  that the saying in
   the prophet might be fulfilled, that he should be called a Nazarene.

   [24] [261] And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, becoming
   filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him.

   [25] [262] And his kinsfolk [263] used to go every year to Jerusalem at
   the feast of the passover.  [26] [264] And when he was twelve years
   old, they went up according to their custom, [27] to the feast.  [265]
   And when the days were accomplished, they returned; and the child [28]
   Jesus remained in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother knew not:  [266]
   and they supposed that he was with the children of their company.  And
   when they had gone one day's journey, they sought him beside their
   people and those who knew them, [29] and they found him not; [267] so
   they returned to Jerusalem and sought him again.  [30] [268] And after
   three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the
   teachers, [31] hearing them and asking them questions; [269] and all
   who heard him wondered at [32] his wisdom and his words.  [270] And
   when they saw him they wondered, and his mother said unto him, My son,
   why hast thou dealt with us thus? behold, I and thy father [33] have
   been seeking for thee with much anxiety.  [271] And he said unto them,
   Why were [34] ye seeking me? know [272] ye not that I must be in the
   house of my Father?  [273] And they [35] understood not the word which
   he spake unto them.  [274] And he went down with them, and came to
   Nazareth; and he was obedient to them:  and his mother used to keep all
   these sayings in her heart.

   [36] [Arabic, p. 13] [275] And Jesus grew in his stature and wisdom,
   and in grace with God and men.

   [37] [276] And in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Cæsar,
   when Pontius Pilate was governor in Judæa, and one of the four rulers,
   Herod, in Galilee; and Philip his brother, one of the four rulers, in
   Ituræa and in the district of Trachonitis; and [38] Lysanias, one of
   the four rulers, in Abilene; [277] in the chief-priesthood of Annas and
   Caiaphas, the command [278] of God went forth to John the son of
   Zacharias in the [39] desert.  [279] And he came into all the region
   which is about Jordan, proclaiming the [40] baptism of repentance unto
   [280] the forgiveness of sins.  [281] And he was preaching in the [41]
   wilderness of Judæa, and saying, [282] Repent ye; the kingdom of heaven
   is come near.  [42] [283] This is he that was spoken of in Isaiah the
   prophet,

   The voice which crieth in the desert,

   [43] [284] Prepare ye the way of the Lord,

   And make straight in the plain, paths for our God.

   [44] [285] All the valleys shall become filled,

   And all the mountains and hills shall become low;

   And the rough shall become plain, And the difficult place, easy;

   [45] [286] And all flesh shall see the salvation [287] of God.

   [46] [288] This man came to bear witness, that he might bear witness to
   the light, that [47] every man might believe through his mediation.
   [289] He was not the light, but that he [48] might bear witness to the
   light, [290] which was the light of truth, that giveth light to [49]
   every man coming into the world.  [291] He was in the world, and the
   world was made [50] by him, and the world knew [51] him not.  [292] He
   came unto his own, and his own received him not.  [293] And those who
   received him, to them gave he the power [294] that they might [52] be
   sons of God,--those which believe in his name:  [295] which were born,
   not of blood, [53] nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a
   man, but of God.  [296] And the Word became flesh, and took up his
   abode among us; and we saw his glory as the glory [54] of the only Son
   from the Father, which is full of grace and equity. [297]   [298] John
   bare witness [Arabic, p. 14] of him, and cried, and said, This is he
   that I said cometh after me and [55] was before me, because he was
   before me. [299]   [300] And of his fullness received [56] we all grace
   for grace.  [301] For the law was given through the mediation of Moses,
   but truth and grace were [302] through Jesus Christ.

   Section IV.

   [1] [303] No man hath seen God at any time; the only Son, God, [304]
   which is in the bosom of his Father, he hath told of him.

   [2] [305] And this is the witness of John when the Jews sent to him
   from Jerusalem priests [3] and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?  [306]
   And he acknowledged, and denied not; [4] and he confessed that he was
   not the Messiah.  [307] And they asked him again, What then?  Art thou
   Elijah?  And he said, I am not he.  Art thou a prophet?  He [5] said,
   No.  [308] They said unto him, Then who art thou? that we may answer
   them that [6] sent us.  What sayest thou of thyself?  [309] And he
   said, I am the voice that crieth in [7] the desert, Repair ye the way
   of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.  [310] And they [8] that were
   sent were from [311] the Pharisees.  [312] And they asked him and said
   unto him, Why baptizest thou now, when thou art not the Messiah, nor
   Elijah, nor a prophet?  [9] [313] John answered and said unto them, I
   baptize with [314] water:  among you is standing [10] one whom ye know
   not:  [315] this is he who I said cometh after me and was before [11]
   me, the latchets of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.  [316] And
   that was in Bethany beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

   [12] [317] Now John's raiment was camel's hair, and he was girded with
   skins, and his food [13] [Arabic, p. 15] was of locusts and honey of
   the wilderness. [318]   ^  [319] Then went out unto him the people of
   Jerusalem, and all Judæa, and all the region which is about the [14,
   15] Jordan; [320] and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan,
   confessing their sins.  [321] But when he saw many of the Pharisees
   [322] and Sadducees [323] coming to be baptized, he said unto them, Ye
   children of vipers, who hath led you to flee from the wrath to come?
   [16, 17] [324] Do now the fruits which are worthy of repentance; [325]
   and think and say not within yourselves, We have a father, even
   Abraham; for I say unto you, that God is able to [18] raise up of these
   stones children unto Abraham.  [326] Behold, the axe hath been laid at
   the roots of the trees, and so every tree that beareth not good fruit
   shall be taken and [19] cast into the fire.  [327] And the multitudes
   were asking him and saying, What shall we do?  [20] [328] He answered
   and said unto them, He that hath two tunics shall [329] give to him
   that [21] hath not; and he that hath food shall [330] do likewise.
   [331] And the publicans also came [22] to be baptized, and they said
   unto him, Teacher, what shall we do?  [332] He said unto [23] them,
   Seek not more than what ye are commanded to seek.  [333] And the
   servants [334] of the guard asked him and said, And we also, what shall
   we do?  He said unto them, Do not violence to any man, nor wrong him;
   and let your allowances satisfy you.

   [24] [335] And when the people were conjecturing about John, and all of
   them thinking [25] in their hearts whether he were haply [336] the
   Messiah, [337] John answered and said unto them, I baptize you with
   water; there cometh one after me who is stronger than I, the latchets
   of whose shoes I am not worthy to loosen; he will baptize you with the
   [26] Holy Spirit and fire:  [338] who taketh the fan in his hand to
   cleanse his threshing-floors, [Arabic, p. 16] and the wheat he
   gathereth into his garners, while the straw he shall burn in fire which
   can [339] not be put out.

   [27] [340] And other things he taught and preached among the people.

   [28] [341] Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be
   baptized of him.  [29] [342] And Jesus was about thirty years old, and
   it was supposed that he was the son of [30] Joseph. [343]   [344] And
   John saw Jesus coming unto him, and said, This is the Lamb of [31] God,
   that taketh on itself the burden of the sins of the world!  [345] This
   is he concerning whom I said, There cometh after me a man who was
   before me, because he was [32] before me. [346]   [347] And I knew him
   not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, [33] for this cause
   came I to baptize with water.  [348] And John was hindering him and
   [34] saying, I have need of being baptized by thee, and comest thou to
   me?  [349] Jesus answered him and said, Suffer this now:  thus it is
   our duty to fulfill all righteousness.  [35] Then he suffered him.
   [350] And when all the people were baptized, Jesus also [36] was
   baptized.  [351] And immediately he went up out of the water, and
   heaven opened [37] [Arabic, p. 17] to him, [352] [353] and the Holy
   Spirit descended upon him in the similitude of the [38] body of a dove;
   [354] and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved [39] Son,
   in whom I am well pleased.  [355] And John bare witness and said, I
   beheld the [40] Spirit descend from heaven like a dove; and it abode
   upon him.  [356] But I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize
   with water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt behold the
   Spirit descending and lighting upon him, the same is he that [41]
   baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.  [357] And I have seen and borne
   witness that this is the Son of God.

   [42, 43] [358] And Jesus returned from the Jordan, filled with the Holy
   Spirit.  [359] And immediately the Spirit took him out into the
   wilderness, to be tried of the devil; [360] [361] and he [44] was with
   the beasts.  [362] And he fasted forty days and forty nights.  [363]
   And he ate nothing [45] in those days, and at the end of them he
   hungered.  [364] And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art
   the Son of God, speak, and these stones shall become [46] bread.  [365]
   He answered and said, It is written, Not by bread alone shall man live,
   but [47] by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.  [366]
   Then the devil [367] brought [48] him to the holy city, and set him on
   the pinnacle of the temple, [368] and said unto him, If thou art the
   Son of God, cast thyself down:  for it is written,

   He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:

   And they shall take thee on their arms,

   So that thy foot shall not stumble against a stone.

   [49] [369] Jesus said unto him, And [370] it is written also, Thou
   shalt not tempt the Lord thy [50] God.  [371] And the devil [372] took
   him up to a high mountain, and shewed him all the kingdoms [51]
   [Arabic, p. 18] of the earth, and their glory, in the least time; [373]
   and the devil [374] said unto him, To thee will I give all this
   dominion, and its glory, which is delivered to [52] me that I may give
   it to whomsoever I will.  [375] If then thou wilt worship before me,
   all of it shall be thine.

   Section V.

   [1] [376] Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee hence, Satan:  for
   it is written, Thou [2] shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him alone
   shalt thou serve.  [377] And when the [3] devil [378] had completed all
   his temptations, he departed from him for a season.  [379] And behold,
   the angels drew near and ministered unto him.

   [4, 5] [380] And next day John was standing, and two of his disciples;
   [381] and he saw Jesus as [6] he was walking, and said, Behold, the
   Lamb of God!  [382] And his two disciples heard [7] him saying this,
   [383] and they followed Jesus.  [384] And Jesus turned and saw them
   coming after him, and said unto them, What seek ye?  They said unto
   him, Our master, [8] where art thou staying?  [385] And he said unto
   them, Come and see.  And they came and saw his place, and abode with
   him that day:  and it was about the tenth hour.  [9] [386] One of the
   two which heard from [387] John, and followed Jesus, was Andrew the
   [10] brother of Simon.  [388] And he saw first Simon his brother, and
   said unto him, We have [11] found the Messiah.  [389] And he brought
   him unto Jesus.  And Jesus looked upon him and said, Thou art Simon,
   son of Jonah:  thou shalt be called Cephas. [390]

   [12] [391] And on the next day Jesus desired to go forth to Galilee,
   and he found Philip, [13] [Arabic, p. 19] and said unto him, Follow
   me.  [392] Now Philip was of Bethsaida, of the city [14] of Andrew and
   Simon.  [393] And Philip found Nathanael, and said unto him, He of whom
   Moses did write in the law and in the prophets, we have found that [15]
   he is Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth.  [394] Nathanael said unto
   him, Is it possible that there can be any good thing from Nazareth?
   Philip said unto him, Come and [16] see.  [395] And Jesus saw Nathanael
   coming to him, and said of him, This is indeed a [396] [17] son of
   Israel in whom is no guile.  [397] And Nathanael said unto him, Whence
   knowest thou me?  Jesus said unto him, Before Philip called thee, while
   thou wast under the [18] fig tree, I saw thee.  [398] Nathanael
   answered and said unto him, My Master, thou art [19] the Son of God;
   thou art the King of Israel.  [399] Jesus said unto him, Because I said
   unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, hast thou believed? thou
   shalt see what is [20] greater than this.  [400] And he said unto him,
   Verily, verily, I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the heavens
   opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
   man.

   [21] [401] And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee.

   [22] [402] And on the third day there was a feast in Cana, [403] a
   [404] city of Galilee; and the [23] mother of Jesus was there:  [405]
   and Jesus also and his disciples were invited to the [24] feast.  [406]
   And they lacked wine:  and his mother said unto Jesus, They have no
   wine.  [25] [407] And Jesus said unto her, What have I to do with thee,
   woman? hath not mine [26] hour come? [408]   [409] And his mother said
   unto the servants, What he saith unto you, do.  [27] [410] And there
   were there six vessels of stone, placed for the Jews' purification,
   such as [28] [Arabic, p. 20] would contain two or three jars.  [411]
   And Jesus said unto them, Fill the vessels [29] with water.  And they
   filled them to the top.  [412] He said unto them, Draw [30] out now,
   and present to the ruler of the feast. And they did so.  [413] And when
   the ruler of the company tasted that water which had become wine, and
   knew not whence it was (but the servants knew, because they filled up
   the water), the ruler of the company called [31] the bridegroom, [414]
   and said unto him, Every man presenteth first the good wine, and on
   intoxication he bringeth what is poor; but thou hast kept the good wine
   until [32] now.  [415] And this is the first sign [416] which Jesus did
   in Cana of Galilee, and manifested [33] his glory; and his disciples
   believed on him.  [417] And his fame spread in all the country [34]
   which was around them.  [418] And he taught in their synagogues, and
   was glorified [35] by [419] every man.  [420] And he came to Nazareth,
   where he had been brought up, and entered, according to his custom,
   into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood [36] up to read.
   [421] And he was given the book of Isaiah the prophet.  And Jesus
   opened the book and found the place where it was written,

   [37] [422] The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,

   And for this anointed he me, to preach good tidings to the poor;

   And he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted,

   And to proclaim forgiveness to the evil-doers, [423] and sight to the
   blind,

   And to bring the broken into forgiveness, [424]

   [38] [425] And to proclaim an acceptable year of the Lord.

   [39] [426] And he rolled up the book and gave it to the servant, and
   went and sat down:  [40] and the eyes of all that were in the synagogue
   were observing him.  [427] And he began to say unto them, To-day hath
   this scripture been fulfilled which ye have heard with [41] your ears.
   [428] And they all bare him witness, and wondered at the words of grace
   which were proceeding from his mouth.

   [42] [Arabic, p. 21] [429] And from that time began Jesus to proclaim
   the gospel of the kingdom [43] of God, and to say, Repent ye, and
   believe in the gospel.  [430] The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of
   heaven hath come near.

   [44] [431] And while he was walking on the shore of the sea of Galilee,
   he saw two brethren, Simon who was called Cephas, and Andrew his
   brother, casting their nets into [45] the sea; for they were fishers.
   [432] And Jesus said unto them, Follow me, and I will [46] make you
   fishers of men.  [433] And they immediately left their nets there and
   followed [47] him.  [434] And when he went on from thence, he saw other
   two brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the
   ship with Zebedee their father, mending [48] their nets; and Jesus
   called them.  [435] And they immediately forsook the ship and their
   father Zebedee, and followed him.

   [49] [436] And when the multitude gathered unto him to hear the word of
   God, while he [50] was standing on the shore of the sea of Gennesaret,
   [437] he saw two boats standing beside the sea, while [438] the two
   fishers which were gone out of them were washing their [51] nets.
   [439] And one of them belonged to Simon Cephas.  And Jesus went up and
   sat down in it, and commanded that they should move away a little from
   the land into [52] the water.  And he sat down and taught the
   multitudes from the boat.  [440] And when he had left off his speaking,
   he said unto Simon, Put out into the deep, and cast your [53] net for a
   draught.  [441] And Simon answered and said unto him, My Master, we
   toiled [54] all night and caught nothing; now [442] at thy word I will
   cast the net.  [443] And when they did this, there were enclosed [444]
   a great many fishes; and their net was on the [55] point of breaking.
   [445] And they beckoned to their comrades that were in the other boat,
   to come and help them.  And when they came, they filled both boats, so
   that they were on the point of sinking.

   Section VI.

   [1] [Arabic, p. 22] [446] But when Simon Cephas saw this he fell before
   the feet of Jesus, and said unto him, My Lord, I beseech of thee to
   depart from me, for I am [2] a sinful man.  [447] And amazement took
   possession of him, and of all who were with him, [3] because of the
   draught of the fishes which they had taken.  [448] And thus also were
   James and John the sons of Zebedee overtaken, [449] who were Simon's
   partners.  And Jesus said [4] unto Simon, Fear not; henceforth thou
   shalt be a fisher of men unto life.  [450] And they brought the boats
   to the land; and they left everything, and followed him.

   [5] [451] And after that came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
   Judæa; and he went [6] about there with them, and baptized.  [452] And
   John also was baptizing in Ænon, which is beside Salim, because there
   was much water there:  and they came, and were baptized.  [7, 8] [453]
   And John was not yet come into prison.  [454] And there was an inquiry
   between [9] one of John's disciples and one of the Jews about
   purifying.  [455] And they [456] came unto John, and said unto him, Our
   master, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom [10] thou hast
   borne witness, behold, he also baptizeth, and many come to him.  [457]
   John answered and said unto them, [458] A man can receive nothing of
   himself, except it be [11] given him [459] from heaven.  [460] Ye are
   they that bear witness unto me that I said, I am [12] not the Messiah,
   but I am one sent [461] before him.  [462] And he that hath a bride is
   a bridegroom:  and the friend of the bridegroom is he that standeth and
   listeneth to him, and rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's
   voice.  Lo now, [463] behold, [13, 14] [Arabic, p. 23] my joy becometh
   complete. [464]   [465] And he must increase and I decrease.  [466] For
   [467] he that is come from above is higher than everything; and he that
   is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh; and
   he that came down from heaven is [15] higher than all.  [468] And he
   beareth witness of what he hath seen and heard:  and no man [16]
   receiveth his witness.  [469] And he that hath received his witness
   hath asserted [470] that he is [17] truly God. [471]   [472] And he
   whom God hath sent speaketh the words [473] of God:  God gave [18] not
   the Spirit by measure.  [474] The Father loveth the Son, and hath put
   everything in [19] his hands.  [475] Whosoever believeth in the Son
   hath eternal [476] life; but whosoever obeyeth not the Son shall not
   see life, but the wrath of God cometh [477] upon him.

   [20] [478] And Jesus learned [479] that the Pharisees had heard that he
   had received many disciples, [21] and that he was baptizing more than
   John [480] (not that Jesus was himself baptizing, [22] but his
   disciples); [481] and so he left Judæa.

   [23] [482] And Herod the governor, because he used to be rebuked by
   John because of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, and for all
   the sins which he was committing, [24] added to all that also this,
   [483] that he shut up John in prison.

   [25] [484] And when Jesus heard that John was delivered up, he went
   away to Galilee.  [26] [485] And he entered again into Cana, where he
   had made the water wine.  And there [27] was at Capernaum a king's
   servant, whose son was sick.  [486] And this man heard that Jesus was
   come from Judæa to Galilee; and he went to him, and besought of him
   that he would come down and heal his son; for he had come near unto
   death.  [28, 29] [487] Jesus said unto him, Except ye see signs and
   wonders, ye do [488] not believe.  [489] The [Arabic, p. 24] king's
   servant said unto him, My Lord, come down, that the child die not.
   [30] [490] Jesus said unto him, Go; for thy son is alive.  And that man
   believed the [31] word which Jesus spake, and went.  [491] And when he
   went down, his servants met him [32] and told him, and [492] said unto
   him, Thy son is alive.  [493] And he asked them at what time he
   recovered.  They said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
   left [33] him.  [494] And his father knew that that was at that hour in
   which Jesus said unto him, [34] Thy son is alive.  [495] And he
   believed, he and the whole people of his house.  And this [35] is the
   second sign [496] which Jesus did when he returned from Judæa to
   Galilee.  [497] And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

   [36] [498] And he left Nazareth, and came and dwelt in Capernaum by the
   sea shore, in the [37] borders of Zebulun and Naphtali:  [499] that it
   might be fulfilled which was said in Isaiah the prophet, who said,

   [38] [500] The land of Zebulun, the land of Naphtali,

   The way of the sea, the passage of the Jordan,

   Galilee of the nations:

   [39] [501] The people sitting in darkness

   Saw a great light,

   And those sitting in the region and in the shadow of death,

   There appeared to them a light.

   [40] [502] And he taught them on the sabbaths.  [503] And they wondered
   because of his doctrine: [504]   [41] for his word was as if it were
   authoritative.  [505] And there was in the synagogue [42] a man with an
   unclean devil, and he cried out with a loud voice, and said, [506] Let
   me alone; what have I to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou
   come for our [43] destruction?  I know thee who thou art, thou Holy One
   of God.  [507] And Jesus rebuked him, and said, Stop up thy mouth, and
   come out of him.  And the demon threw him [44] in the midst and came
   out of him, having done him no harm.  [508] And great amazement
   [Arabic, p. 25] took hold upon every man.  And they talked one with
   another, and said, What is this word that orders the unclean spirits
   with power and [45] authority, and they come out?  [509] And the news
   of him spread abroad in all the region which was around them.

   [46] [510] And when Jesus went out of the synagogue, [511] he saw a man
   sitting among the publicans, [512] named Matthew:  and he said unto
   him, Come after me.  And he rose, and followed him.

   [47, 48] [513] And Jesus came to the house of Simon and Andrew with
   James and John.  [514] And Simon's wife's mother was oppressed with a
   great fever, and they besought him for [49] her.  [515] And he stood
   over her and rebuked her fever, and it left her, and immediately [50]
   she rose and ministered to them.  [516] And at even they brought to him
   many that had [51] demons:  and he cast out their devils with the [517]
   word.  [518] And all that had sick, their diseases being divers and
   malignant, brought them unto him.  And he laid his hand [52] on them
   one by one [519] and healed them:  [520] that that might be fulfilled
   which was said [53] in the prophet Isaiah, who said, He taketh our
   pains and beareth our diseases.  [521] And [54] all the city was
   gathered together unto the door of Jesus.  [522] And he cast out devils
   also from many, as they were crying out and saying, Thou art the
   Messiah, the Son of God; and he rebuked them.  And he suffered not the
   demons to speak, because they knew him that he was the Lord the
   Messiah.

   Section VII.

   [1] [Arabic, p. 26] [523] And in the morning of that day he went out
   very early, and went to a [2] desert place, and was there praying.
   [524] And Simon and those that were with [3] him sought him.  [525] And
   when they found him, they said unto him, All the people seek for [4]
   thee.  [526] He said unto them, Let us go into the adjacent villages
   and towns, that I may [5] preach there also; for to this end did I
   come.  [527] And the multitudes were seeking him, and came till they
   reached him; and they took hold of him, that he should not [6] go away
   from them.  [528] But Jesus said unto them, I must preach of the
   kingdom of [7] God in other cities also:  for because of this gospel
   was I sent.  [529] And Jesus was going about all the cities and the
   villages, and teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of
   the kingdom, and healing all the diseases and all the sicknesses, [8]
   [530] and casting out the devils.  [531] And his fame became known
   [532] that [533] he was teaching in [9] every place and being glorified
   by every man.  [534] And when he passed by, he saw Levi the son of
   Alphæus sitting among the tax-gatherers; [535] and he said unto him,
   Follow [10] me:  and he rose and followed him.  [536] And the news of
   him was heard of in all the land of Syria:  and they brought unto him
   all those whom grievous ills had befallen through divers diseases, and
   those that were enduring torment, and those that were possessed, and
   lunatics, [537] and paralytics; and he healed them.

   [11, 12] [538] And after some days Jesus entered into Capernaum again.
   [539] And when they heard that he was in the house, [540] many
   gathered, so that it could not hold them, even about [13] [Arabic, p.
   27] the door; and he made known to them the word of God.  [541] And
   there were there some of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law,
   sitting, come from all the villages of Galilee, and Judæa, and
   Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was [14] present to heal them.
   [542] And some men brought a bed with a man on it who was paralytic.
   [15] And they sought to bring him in and lay him before him.  [543] And
   when they found no way to bring him in because of the multitude of
   people, they went up to the roof, and let him down with his bed from
   the roofing, [544] into the midst before Jesus.  [16] [545] And when
   Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the paralytic, My son, thy sins are
   forgiven [17] thee.  [546] And the scribes and Pharisees began to think
   within their hearts, Why doth this man blaspheme? [547]   Who is it
   that is able to forgive sins, but God alone?  [18] [548] And Jesus knew
   by the spirit that they were thinking this within themselves, and he
   [19] said unto them, Why do ye think this within your heart?  [549]
   Which is better, [550] that it should be said to the paralytic, Thy
   sins are forgiven thee, or that it should be said [20] to him, Arise,
   and take thy bed, and walk?  [551] That ye may know that the Son of man
   [21] is empowered on earth to forgive sins (and he said to the
   paralytic), [552] I say unto thee, [22] Arise, take thy bed, and go to
   thine house.  [553] And he rose forthwith, and took his bed, and went
   out in the presence of all.  [554] And he went to his house praising
   God.  [23] [555] And when those multitudes saw, they feared; [556] and
   amazement took possession of [24] them, [557] and they praised God, who
   had given such power to men.  [558] And they said, We have seen
   marvellous things to-day, [559] of which we have never before seen the
   like.

   [25] [Arabic, p. 28] [560] And after that, Jesus went out, and saw a
   publican, named Levi, sitting [26] among the publicans: [561]   and he
   said unto him, Follow me.  [562] And he left [27] everything, and rose,
   and followed him.  [563] And Levi made him a great feast in his house.
   And there was a great multitude of the publicans and others sitting
   with him.  [28] [564] And the scribes and Pharisees murmured, and said
   unto his disciples, Why do ye eat [29] and drink with the publicans and
   sinners?  [565] Jesus answered and said unto them, The physician
   seeketh not those who are well, but those that are afflicted with
   grievous [30, 31] sickness. [566]   [567] I came not to call the
   righteous, but the sinners, to repentance.  [568] And they said unto
   him, Why do the disciples of John fast always, and pray, and the [32]
   Pharisees also, but thy disciples eat and drink?  [569] He said unto
   them, Ye cannot make [33] the sons of the marriage feast [570] fast,
   while the bridegroom is with them.  [571] Days will come, when the
   bridegroom is taken away from them; then will they fast in those [34]
   days.  [572] And he spake unto them a parable:  [573] No man inserteth
   a new patch and seweth it in a worn garment, lest the newness of the
   new take from the worn, and [35] there occur a great rent.  [574] And
   no man putteth fresh wine into old skins, lest the wine burst the
   skins, and the skins be destroyed, and the wine spilled; but they put
   [36] the fresh wine in the new skins, and both are preserved.  [575]
   And no man drinketh old wine and straightway desireth fresh; for he
   saith, The old is better.

   [37] [576] And while Jesus was walking on the sabbath day among the
   sown fields, his disciples [Arabic, p. 29] hungered.  And they were
   rubbing the ears with their hands, and [38] eating.  [577] But some of
   the Pharisees, when they saw them, [578] said unto him, See, [39] why
   [579] do thy disciples on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
   [580] But Jesus said unto them, Have ye not read in olden time what
   David did, when he had need and [40] hungered, he and those that were
   with him? [581] how he entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high
   priest, and ate the bread of the table of the Lord, which it was not
   lawful that any should eat, save the priests, and gave to them that
   were with him also?  [41] [582] And he said unto them, The sabbath was
   created because of man, and man was not [42] created because of the
   sabbath.  [583] Or have ye not read in the law, that the priests in
   [43] the temple profane the sabbath, and yet they are blameless?  [584]
   I say unto you now, [44] that here is what [585] is greater than the
   temple.  [586] If ye had known this: [587]   I love mercy, [45] not
   sacrifice, ye would not have condemned [588] those on whom is no
   blame.  [589] The [46] Lord of the sabbath is the Son of man.  [590]
   And his relatives heard, and went out to take him, and said, He hath
   gone out of his mind.

   [47] [591] And on the next [592] sabbath day he entered [593] into the
   synagogue and was teaching.  [48] [594] And there was there a man whose
   right hand was withered.  And the scribes and the Pharisees were
   watching him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day, [49] that they
   might find the means of accusing him.  [595] But he knew their
   thoughts, and said unto the man whose hand was withered, Rise and come
   near into the midst of [50] the synagogue.  [596] And when he came and
   stood, Jesus said unto them, I ask you, which is lawful to be done on
   the sabbath day, good or evil? shall lives be saved or [51] [Arabic, p.
   30] destroyed?  [597] But they were silent.  [598] Regarding [599] them
   with anger, being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts.  And
   he said unto the man, Stretch out thy hand.  And he stretched it out:
   and his hand became straight.  [52] [600] Then he said unto them, What
   man of you shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a [53] well on the
   sabbath day, will not take it and lift it out?  [601] And how much is
   man better than a sheep!  Wherefore it is lawful on the sabbath to do
   good.

   Section VIII.

   [1] [602] And the Pharisees went out, and consulted together concerning
   him, that they [2] might destroy him.  [603] And Jesus perceived, and
   removed thence:  and great multitudes [3] followed him; and he healed
   all of them:  [604] and he forbade them that they should [4] not make
   him known: [605]   [606] that the saying in Isaiah the prophet might be
   fulfilled, which said,

   [5] [607] Behold, my servant [608] with whom I am pleased;

   My beloved in whom my soul hath delighted: [609]

   My spirit have I put upon him,

   And he shall proclaim to the nations judgement.

   [6] [610] He shall not dispute, nor cry out;

   And no man shall hear his voice in the marketplace.

   [7] [611] And a bruised reed shall he not break,

   And a smoking lamp [612] shall he not extinguish,

   Until he shall bring forth judgement unto victory.

   [8] [613] And the nations shall rejoice in his name. [614]

   [9] [615] And in those days Jesus went out to the mountain that he
   might pray, and he [10] spent the night [616] there in prayer to God.
   [617] And when the morning was come, he called the disciples.  [618]
   And he went towards the sea:  and there followed him much people [11]
   from Galilee that he might pray, [619] [620] and from Judæa, and from
   Jerusalem, and from Idumæa, and from beyond Jordan, and from Tyre, and
   from Sidon, and from Decapolis; [12] and great multitudes came unto
   him, which had heard what he did.  [621] And he spake to his disciples
   to bring him the boat because of the multitudes, that they [13] might
   not throng him.  [622] And he healed many, so that they were almost
   falling on [Arabic, p. 31] him [623] on account of their seeking to get
   near him.  And [624] those that had [14] plagues and unclean spirits,
   [625] as soon as they beheld him, would fall, and [15] cry out, and
   say, Thou art the Son of God.  [626] And he rebuked them much, that
   they [16] should not make him known.  [627] And those that were under
   the constraint of [628] unclean [17] spirits were healed.  [629] And
   all of the crowd were seeking to come near [630] him; because power
   went out from him, and he healed them all.

   [18, 19] [631] And when Jesus saw the multitudes, he went up to the
   mountain.  [632] And he called his disciples, and chose from them
   twelve; and they are those whom he named [20] apostles:  [633] Simon,
   whom he named Cephas, and Andrew his brother, and James and [21] John,
   and Philip and Bartholomew, [634] and Matthew and Thomas, and James the
   son [22] of Alphæus, and Simon which was called the Zealot, [635] and
   Judas the son of James, [23] and Judas the Iscariot, being he that had
   betrayed him. [636]   [637] And Jesus went down with them and stood in
   the plain, and the company of his disciples, and the great [24]
   multitude of people.  [638] And these twelve he chose to be with him,
   and that he might [25] send them to preach, and to have power to heal
   the sick and to cast out devils.

   [26] [639] Then he lifted up his eyes unto them, and opened his mouth,
   [640] and taught them, and said,

   [27] [641] Blessed are the poor in spirit:  for the kingdom of heaven
   is theirs.

   [28] [642] Blessed are the sorrowful:  for they shall be comforted.

   [29] [643] Blessed are the humble:  for they shall inherit the earth.

   [30] [644] Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after
   righteousness:  for they shall be satisfied.

   [31] [645] Blessed are the merciful:  for on them shall be mercy.

   [32] [Arabic, p. 32] [646] Blessed are the pure in their hearts:  for
   they shall see God.

   [33] [647] Blessed are the peacemakers:  for they shall be called the
   sons of God.

   [34] [648] Blessed are they that were persecuted [649] for
   righteousness' sake:  for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

   [35] [650] Blessed are ye when men shall hate you, and separate you
   from them, and persecute you, and reproach you, [651] and shall speak
   against you with all evil talk, for my [36] sake, falsely.  [652] Then
   rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven:  for so
   persecuted they the prophets before you.

   [37] [653] But woe unto you rich! for ye have received your
   consolation.

   [38] [654] Woe unto you that are satisfied! ye shall hunger.

   Woe unto you that laugh now! ye shall weep and be sad.

   [39] [655] Woe unto you when men praise you! for so did their fathers
   use to do to the false prophets.

   [40] [656] Unto you do I say, ye which hear, [657] Ye are the salt of
   the earth:  if then the salt become tasteless, wherewith shall it be
   salted?  For any purpose it is of no use, but [41] is thrown outside,
   and men tread upon it.  [658] Ye are the light of the world.  It is
   [42] impossible that a city built on a mountain should be hid.  [659]
   Neither do they light a lamp and place it under a bushel, but on the
   lamp-stand, and it giveth light to all [43] who are in the house.
   [660] So shall [661] your light shine before men, that they may see
   [44] your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
   [662] There is nothing [45] secret that shall not be revealed, or
   hidden that shall not be known.  [663] Whoever hath ears that hear, let
   him hear.

   [46] [664] Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets; I
   came not to destroy, [47] but to complete.  [665] Verily I say unto
   you, Until heaven and earth shall pass, there [Arabic, p. 33] shall not
   pass one point or one letter of the law, until all of it shall be [48]
   accomplished.  [666] Every one who shall violate now one of these small
   commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called lacking in the
   kingdom of heaven:  every one that shall do and teach shall [667] be
   called great in the kingdom [49] of heaven.  [668] I say unto you now,
   unless your righteousness abound more than that of the scribes and
   Pharisees, ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.

   [50] [669] Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Do not kill;
   and every one that [51] killeth is worthy of the judgement.  [670] But
   I say unto you that every one who is angry with his brother without a
   cause is worthy of the judgement; and every one that saith to his
   brother, Thou foul one, is condemned [671] by the synagogue; and
   whosoever [52] saith to him, Thou fool, is worthy of the fire of
   Gehenna.  [672] If thou art now offering thy gift at the altar, and
   rememberest there that thy brother hath conceived [53] against thee any
   grudge, [673] leave thy gift at the altar, and go first and satisfy thy
   [54] brother, and then return and offer thy gift.  [674] Join [675]
   thine adversary quickly, [676] and while thou art still with him in the
   way, give a ransom and free thyself from him; [55] lest thine adversary
   deliver thee to the judge, [677] and the judge deliver thee to the
   tax-collector, [56] and thou fall into prison.  [678] And verily I say
   unto thee, Thou shalt not go out thence until thou payest the last
   farthing.

   [57, 58] [679] Ye have heard that it was said, Do not commit adultery:
   [680] but I now say unto you, that every one that looketh at a woman
   lusting after her hath forthwith already [59] [Arabic, p. 34] committed
   adultery with her in his heart.  [681] If thy right eye injure thee,
   put it out and cast it from thee; for it is preferable for thee that
   one of thy [60] members should perish, and not thy whole body go into
   the fire of hell.  [682] And if thy right hand injure thee, cut it off
   and cast it from thee; and it is better for thee that [61] one of thy
   members should perish, and not thy whole body fall into Gehenna.  [683]
   It was said that he that putteth away his wife should give her a
   writing of divorcement:  [62] [684] but I say unto you, that every one
   that putteth away his wife, except for the cause of adultery, hath made
   it lawful for [685] her to commit adultery:  and whosoever taketh one
   that is put away committeth adultery.

   [619] It must be remembered that we have here only one ms.  The Arabic
   words for Galilee and for mountain are very similar.  The words that he

   from § 8, 9, above.

   [623] So (with the Peshitta) by transposing two letters.  The Arabic
   text as it stands can hardly be translated.  Almost may be simply a
   corruption of the Arabic word were.

   [624] The syntax of the Arabic is ambiguous.  The alternative followed
   above, which seems the most natural, is that which agrees most nearly
   with the Peshitta.

   [630] This is the meaning of the Arabic word, as it is the primary
   meaning of the Syriac; but in this work a number of words meaning

   Section IX.

   [1] [686] Ye have heard also that it was said unto the ancients, Lie
   not, but perform unto [2] God in thy oaths:  [687] but I say unto you,
   Swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it [3] is God's throne; [688]
   nor by the earth, for it is a footstool under his feet; nor yet by [4]
   Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great [689] King.  [690] Neither
   shalt thou swear by thy [5] head, for thou canst not make in it one
   lock of hair black or white.  [691] But your word shall be either Yea
   or Nay, and what is in excess of this is of the evil one.

   [6, 7] [692] Ye have heard that it was said, Eye for eye, and tooth for
   tooth:  [693] but I say unto you, Stand not in opposition to the evil;
   [694] but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right [8] cheek, [695] turn to
   him also the other.  [696] And he that would sue thee, and take thy
   tunic, [9] leave to him also thy wrapper.  [697] And whosoever
   compelleth thee one mile, go with [10] [Arabic, p. 35] him twain.
   [698] And he that asketh thee, give unto him:  [699] and he that would
   borrow of thee, prevent him not.  And prosecute [700] not him that
   taketh thy [11] substance.  [701] And as ye desire that men should do
   to you, so do ye also to them.

   [12, 13] [702] Ye have heard that it was said, Love thy neighbour and
   hate thine enemy:  [703] but I say unto you, Love your enemies, and
   pray for those that curse you, and deal well with those that hate you,
   and pray for those who take you with violence and persecute you; [14]
   [704] that ye may be sons of your heavenly Father, who maketh his sun
   to rise on the good and the evil, and sendeth down his rain on the
   righteous and the [15] unrighteous.  [705] If ye love them that love
   you, what reward shall ye have? [706] for the publicans [16] and
   sinners also love those that love them.  [707] And if ye do a kindness
   to those [17] who treat you well, where is your superiority? for
   sinners also do likewise.  [708] And if ye lend to him of whom ye hope
   for a reward, [709] where is your superiority? for the [18] sinners
   also lend to sinners, seeking recompense from [710] them.  [711] But
   love your enemies, and do good to them, and lend, and cut not off the
   hope of any man; that your reward may be great, and ye may be the
   children of the Highest:  for he is lenient [19] towards the wicked and
   the ungrateful.  [712] Be ye merciful, even as your Father also is [20]
   merciful.  [713] And if ye inquire for the good of your brethren only,
   what more have [21] ye done than others? is not this the conduct of the
   publicans also?  [714] Be ye now [715] perfect, even as your Father
   which is in heaven is perfect.

   [22] [716] Consider your alms; do them not before men to let them see
   you:  and if it be not [23] so, [717] ye have no reward before your
   Father which is in the heavens.  [718] When then thou givest an alms
   now, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as do the people of hypocrisy,
   [Arabic, p. 36] in the synagogues and the marketplaces, that men may
   praise them.  And [24] verily say I unto you, They have received their
   reward.  [719] But thou, when [25] thou doest alms, let thy left hand
   not know what thy right hand doeth; [720] that thine alms may be
   concealed:  and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee
   openly.

   [26] [721] And whenever thou prayest, be not as the hypocrites, who
   love to stand in the synagogues and in the corners of the marketplaces
   for prayers, that men may behold [27] them.  [722] And verily say I
   unto you, They have received their reward.  But thou, when thou
   prayest, enter into thy closet, and fasten thy door, and pray to thy
   Father in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward
   thee openly.  [28] [723] And whenever ye pray, be not babblers, as the
   heathen; for they think that by the [29] abundance of their words they
   shall be heard.  [724] Then be not ye now like unto them:  [30] for
   your Father knoweth your request before ye ask him.  [725] One of his
   disciples said [31] unto him, Our Lord, teach us to pray, as John
   taught his disciples.  [726] Jesus said unto [32] them, Thus now pray
   ye now: [727]   [728] Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy
   [33, 34] name.  [729] Thy kingdom come.  Thy will be done, [730] as in
   heaven, so on earth. [731] Give us the [35] food of to-day.  [732] And
   forgive us our trespasses, as we forgave those that trespassed [36]
   against us.  [733] And bring us not into temptations, but deliver us
   from the evil one. For [37] thine is the kingdom, and the power, and
   the glory, for ever and ever. [734]   [735] If ye forgive [Arabic, p.
   37] men their wrong-doing, [736] your Father which is in heaven will
   forgive you.  [38] [737] But if ye forgive not men, neither will your
   Father pardon your wrong-doing.

   [39] [738] When ye fast, do not frown, as the hypocrites; for they make
   their faces austere, that they may be seen of [739] men that they are
   fasting.  Verily I say unto you, They [40] have received their reward.
   [740] But when thou fastest, wash thy face and anoint thy [41] head;
   [741] that thou make not an appearance to men of fasting, but to thy
   Father which is in secret:  and thy Father which seeth in secret shall
   reward thee.

   [42] [742] Be not agitated, little flock; for your Father hath
   delighted to give you the kingdom.  [43] [743] Sell your possessions,
   and give in alms; take to yourselves purses that wax [44] not old.
   [744] Lay not up treasure on earth, where moth and worm corrupt, and
   where [45] thieves break through and steal:  [745] but lay up for
   yourselves treasure in heaven, where [46] moth and worm do not corrupt,
   nor thieves break through nor steal:  [746] for where your [47]
   treasure is, there also will your heart be.  [747] The lamp of the body
   is the eye:  if then [748] [48] thine eye now be sound, thy whole body
   also shall be light.  [749] But if thine eye be evil, all thy body
   shall be dark.  And if the light which is in thee is darkness, how [49]
   great is [750] thy darkness!  [751] Be watchful that the light which is
   in thee be not darkness.  [50] [752] Because that, if thy whole body is
   light, and have no part dark, it shall all be light, as the lamp giveth
   light to thee with its flame.

   Section X.

   [1] [Arabic, p. 38] [753] No man can serve two masters; and that
   because it is necessary that he hate one of them and love the other,
   and honour one of them and despise the [2] other.  [754] Ye cannot
   serve God and possessions.  And because of this I say unto you, Be not
   anxious for yourselves, [755] what ye shall eat and what ye shall
   drink; neither for your bodies, what ye shall put on.  Is not the life
   better than the food, and the body [3] than the raiment?  [756]
   Consider the birds of the heaven, which sow not, nor reap, nor store in
   barns; and yet your Father which is in heaven feedeth them.  Are not ye
   [4] better than they?  [757] Who of you when he trieth is able to add
   to his stature one [5] cubit?  [758] If then ye are not able for a
   small thing, why are ye anxious about the [6, 7] rest?  [759] Consider
   the wild lily, how it grows, although it toils not, nor spins; [760]
   and I say unto you that Solomon in the greatness of his glory was not
   clothed like one of [8] them.  [761] And if God so clothe the grass of
   the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow [9] is cast [762] into the
   oven, how much more shall be unto you, O ye of little faith!  [763] Be
   not anxious, so as to say, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink?
   or, With [10] what shall we be clothed?  [764] Neither let your minds
   be perplexed in this:  [765] all these things the nations of the world
   seek; and your Father which is in heaven knoweth [11] your need of all
   these things.  [766] Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
   righteousness; [12] [Arabic, p. 39] and all these shall come to you as
   something additional for you.  [767] Be not anxious for the morrow; for
   the morrow shall be anxious for what belongs to it.  Sufficient unto
   the day is its evil.

   [13] [768] Judge not, that ye be not judged:  [769] condemn [770] not,
   that ye be not condemned: [14] [771] forgive, and it shall be forgiven
   you:  release, and ye shall be released:  give, that ye may be given
   unto; with good measure, abundant, full, they shall thrust [772] into
   your [15] bosoms.  [773] With what measure ye measure it shall be
   measured to you.  See to it what ye hear:  with what measure ye measure
   it shall be measured to you; and ye [16] shall be given more.  [774] I
   say unto those that hear, He that hath shall be given unto; and he that
   hath not, that which he regards [775] as his shall be taken from him.

   [17] [776] And he spake unto them a parable, Can a blind man haply
   guide a blind man? [18] shall [777] they not both fall into a hollow?
   [778] A disciple is not better than his master; [19] every perfect man
   shall be as his master.  [779] Why lookest thou at the mote which is in
   the eye of thy brother, but considerest not the column that is in thine
   own eye?  [20] [780] Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, I
   will take out the mote from thine eye; and the column which is in thine
   eye thou seest not?  Thou hypocrite, take out first the column from
   thine eye; and then shalt thou see to take out the mote from the eye of
   thy brother.

   [21] [781] Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your
   pearls before the swine, lest they trample them with their feet, and
   return and wound you.

   [22] [782] And he said unto them, Who of you, that hath a friend, goeth
   to him at midnight, [23] and saith unto him, My friend, lend me three
   loaves; [783] for a friend hath come [24] to me from a journey, and I
   have nothing to offer to him:  [784] and that friend shall [Arabic, p.
   40] answer him from within, and say unto him, Trouble me not; for the
   door is shut, and my children are with me in bed, and I cannot rise and
   give thee?  [25] [785] And verily I say unto you, If he will not give
   him because of friendship, yet because [26] of his importunity he will
   rise and give him what he seeketh.  [786] And I also say unto you, Ask,
   and ye shall be given unto; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
   shall be [27] opened unto you.  [787] Every one that asketh receiveth,
   and he that seeketh findeth, and [28] he that knocketh, it shall be
   opened to him.  [788] What father of you, shall his son ask for
   bread--will he, think you, give him a stone? [789] and if he ask of him
   a fish, will he, [29] think you, [790] instead of the fish give him a
   serpent? and if he ask him for an egg, will [30] he, think you, extend
   to him a scorpion?  [791] If ye then, although being evil, know the
   gifts which are good, and give them to your children, how much more
   shall your [31] Father which is in heaven give the Holy Spirit to them
   that ask him?  [792] Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do
   ye even so to them:  this is the law and the prophets.

   [32] [793] Enter [794] ye by the narrow gate; for the wide gate and the
   broad way lead to destruction, [33] and many they be which go therein.
   [795] How narrow is the gate and straitened the way leading to life!
   and few be they that find it.

   [34] [796] Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's [797]
   clothing, while within [35] they are ravening wolves.  [798] But by
   their fruits ye shall know them.  [799] For every tree is known by its
   fruit.  For figs are not gathered [800] of thorns, neither are grapes
   plucked of [36] briers.  [801] Even so every good tree bringeth forth
   good fruit, but the evil tree bringeth [37] [Arabic, p. 41] forth evil
   fruit.  [802] The good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can
   the [38] evil tree bring forth good fruit.  [803] The good man from the
   good treasures that are in his heart bringeth forth good things; and
   the evil man from the evil treasures that are in his heart bringeth
   forth evil things:  and from the overflowings of the [39] heart the
   lips speak.  [804] Every tree that beareth not good fruit is cut down
   and cast [40, 41] into the fire.  [805] Therefore by their fruits ye
   shall know them.  [806] Not all that say unto me, My Lord, my Lord,
   shall enter the kingdom of the heavens; but he that doeth [42] the will
   of my Father which is in heaven.  [807] Many shall say unto me in that
   day, My Lord, my Lord, did we not prophesy in thy name, and in thy name
   cast out [43] devils, and in thy name do many powers?  [808] Then shall
   I say unto them, I never [44] knew you:  depart from me, ye servants of
   iniquity.  [809] Every man that cometh unto [45] me, and heareth my
   sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to what he is like:  [810] he
   is like the wise man which built a house, and digged and went deep, and
   laid the [46] foundations on a rock:  [811] and the rain came down, and
   the rivers overflowed, and the winds blew, and shook that house, and it
   fell not:  for its foundation was laid on [47] rocks.  [812] And every
   one that heareth these my words, and doeth them not, is like [48] the
   foolish man which built his house on sand, without foundation:  [813]
   and the rain descended, and the rivers overflowed, and the winds blew,
   and smote upon that house, and it fell:  and the fall of it was great.

   Section XI.

   [1] [Arabic, p. 42] [814] And when Jesus finished these sayings, the
   multitudes were astonished [2] at his teaching; [815] and that because
   he was teaching them as one having authority, not as their scribes and
   the Pharisees.

   [3] [816] And when he descended from the mountain, great multitudes
   followed him.

   [4] [817] And when Jesus entered Capernaum, the servant of one of the
   chiefs was in an [5] evil case, and he was precious to him, and he was
   at the point of death.  [818] And he [6] heard of Jesus, and came to
   him with the elders of the Jews; [819] and he besought him, and said,
   My Lord, my boy is laid in the house paralysed, [820] and he is
   suffering grievous [7] torment.  [821] And the elders urgently
   requested of him, and said, He is worthy that [8] this should be done
   unto him:  [822] for he loveth our people, and he also built the
   synagogue [9, 10] for us.  [823] Jesus said unto him, I will come and
   heal him.  [824] That chief answered and said, My Lord, I am not worthy
   that my roof should shade thee; but it sufficeth [11] that thou speak a
   word, and my lad shall be healed.  [825] And I also am a man in
   obedience to authority, having under my hand soldiers: [826]   and I
   say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh;
   and to my servant that he do this, [12] and he doeth it.  [827] And
   when Jesus heard that, he marvelled at him, [828] and turned and said
   unto the multitude that were coming with him, [829] Verily I say unto
   you, I have [13] not found in Israel the like of this faith.  [830] I
   say unto you, that many shall come from the east and the west, and
   shall recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob [14] [Arabic, p. 43] in
   the kingdom of heaven:  [831] but the children of the kingdom shall be
   cast [15] forth into the outer darkness:  and there shall be weeping
   and gnashing of teeth.  [832] And Jesus said to that chief, Go thy way;
   as thou hast believed, so shall it be unto thee.  [16] [833] And his
   lad was healed in that hour.  And that chief returned to the house and
   found that sick servant healed.

   [17] [834] And the day after, he was going to a city called Nain, and
   his disciples with him, [18] and a great multitude.  [835] And when he
   was come near the gate of the city, he saw a crowd [836] accompanying
   one that was dead, the only son of his mother; and his mother was a
   widow:  and there was with her a great multitude of the people of the
   [19] city.  [837] And when Jesus saw her, he had compassion on her, and
   said unto her, Weep [20] not.  [838] And he went and advanced to the
   bier, and the bearers of it stood still; and [21] he said, Young man, I
   say unto thee, Arise.  [839] And that dead man sat up and began [22] to
   speak; and he gave him to his mother.  [840] And fear came on all the
   people:  and they praised God, and said, There hath risen among us a
   great prophet:  and, God [23] hath had regard to his people.  [841] And
   this news concerning him spread in all Judæa, and in all the region
   which was about them.

   [24] [842] And when Jesus saw great multitudes surrounding him, he
   commanded them to [25] depart to the other side.  [843] And while they
   were going in the way, there came one of the scribes and said unto him,
   My Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou [26] goest.  [844]
   Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven
   have [27] nests; but the Son of man hath not a place in which to lay
   his head.  [845] And he said unto another, Follow me.  And he said unto
   him, My Lord, suffer me first to go and [28] bury my father.  [846]
   Jesus said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their dead; but thou, [29]
   follow me and preach the kingdom of God.  [847] And another said unto
   him, I will follow [Arabic, p. 44] thee, my Lord; but first suffer me
   to go and salute my household and [30] come.  [848] Jesus said unto
   him, There is no one who putteth his hand to the plough [849] and
   looketh behind him, and yet is fit for the kingdom of God.

   [31] [850] And he said to them on that day in the evening, Let us go
   over to the other side [32] of the lake; and he left [851] the
   multitudes.  [852] And Jesus went up and sat in the ship, [33] he and
   his disciples, and there were with them other ships.  [853] And there
   occurred on the sea a great tempest [854] of whirlwind and wind, [855]
   and the ship was on the point of [34] sinking from the greatness [856]
   of the waves.  [857] But Jesus was sleeping on a cushion in the stern
   of the ship; [858] and his disciples came and awoke him, and said unto
   him, Our [35] Lord, save us; lo, we perish.  [859] And he rose, and
   rebuked the winds and the turbulence of the water, and said to the sea,
   Be still, for thou art rebuked; [860] and the wind [36] was still, and
   there was a great calm.  [861] And he said unto them, Why are ye thus
   [37] afraid? and why have ye no faith?  [862] And they feared greatly.
   [863]   And they marvelled, and said one to another, Who, think you, is
   this, who commandeth also the wind and the waves and the sea, and they
   obey him?

   [38] [864] And they departed and came to the country of the Gadarenes,
   which is on the [39] other side, opposite the land of Galilee.  [865]
   And when he went out of the ship to the land, [866] there met him from
   among the tombs a man who had a devil for a long time, [40] and wore no
   clothes, neither dwelt in a house, but among the tombs.  [867] And no
   man was [Arabic, p. 45] able to bind him with chains, [868] because any
   time that he was bound with chains [41] and fetters he cut the chains
   and loosened the fetters; [869] and he was snatched [870] [42] away of
   the devil into the desert, [871] and no man was able to quiet him; and
   at all times, in the night and in the day, he would be among the tombs
   and in the mountains; [872] and no man was able to pass by that way;
   [873] and he would cry out and wound himself [43] with stones.  [874]
   And when he saw Jesus at a distance, he hastened and worshipped [44]
   him, and cried with a loud voice and said, [875] What have we to do
   with thee, Jesus, [45] Son of the most high God?  [876] I adjure thee
   by God, torment me not.  And Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come
   out of the man:  and he had suffered [877] a long [46] time since the
   time when he came into captivity to it.  [878] And Jesus asked him,
   What is thy name?  He said unto him, Legion; for there had entered into
   him many [47] devils.  [879] And they besought him that he would not
   command them to depart into [48] the depths.  [880] And there was there
   a herd of many swine, feeding in the mountain, and those devils
   besought him to give them leave to enter the swine; and he gave [49]
   them leave.  [881] And the devils went out of the man and entered into
   the swine.  [882] And that herd hastened to the summit and fell down
   into the midst of the sea, about two [50] thousand, and they were
   choked in the water.  [883] And when the keepers saw what [51]
   happened, they fled, and told those in the cities and villages.  [884]
   And the people went out to see what had happened; and they came to
   Jesus, and found the man whose [Arabic, p. 46] devils had gone out,
   clothed, modest, [885] seated at the feet of Jesus; and they [52]
   feared.  [886] And they reported what they saw, and how the man was
   healed who had a devil, [887] and concerning those swine also.

   Section XII.

   [1] [888] And all the multitude of the Gadarenes entreated him to
   depart from them, because that great fear took hold upon them.

   [2, 3] [889] But Jesus went up into the ship, and crossed, and came to
   his city.  [890] And that man from whom the devils went out entreated
   that he might stay with him; but [4] Jesus sent him away, and said unto
   him, [891] Return to thy house, and make known what [5] God hath done
   for thee.  [892] And he went, and began to publish in Decapolis [893]
   what Jesus had done for him; and they all marvelled.

   [6] [894] And when Jesus had crossed in the ship to that side, a great
   multitude received [7] him; and they were all looking for him.  [895]
   And a man named Jairus, the chief of the [8] synagogue, fell before the
   feet of Jesus, [896] and besought him much, and said unto him, I have
   an only daughter, and she is come nigh unto death; [897] but come and
   lay thy [9] hand upon her, and she shall live.  [898] And Jesus rose,
   and his disciples, and they followed [10] him.  [899] And there joined
   him a great multitude, and they pressed him.

   [11, 12] [900] And a woman, which had a flow of blood for twelve years,
   [901] had suffered much of many physicians, and spent all that she had,
   and was not benefited at all, but her [13] trouble increased further.
   [902] And when she heard of Jesus, she came in the thronging of [14]
   [Arabic, p. 47] the crowd behind him, and touched [903] his garments;
   [904] and she thought within [15] herself, If I could reach to touch
   his garments, I should live.  [905] And immediately the fountain of her
   blood was dried; and she felt in her body that she was healed [16] of
   her plague.  [906] And Jesus straightway knew within himself that power
   had gone out of him; and he turned to the crowd, and said, Who
   approached unto my garments?  [17] [907] And on their denying, all of
   them, Simon Cephas and those with him said unto him, Our Master, the
   multitudes throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who approached
   [18] unto me?  [908] And he said, Some one approached unto me; and I
   knew that [19] power went forth from me.  [909] And that woman, when
   she saw that she was not hid [20] from him, came fearing and agitated
   (for she knew what had happened to her), [910] and fell down and
   worshipped him, and told, in the presence of all the people, for what
   [21] reason she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.  [911]
   And Jesus said unto her, Be of good courage, daughter; thy faith hath
   made thee alive; depart in peace, and be whole from thy plague.

   [22] [912] And while he was yet speaking, there came a man from the
   house of the chief of the synagogue, and said unto him, Thy daughter
   hath died; so trouble not the [23] teacher.  [913] But Jesus heard, and
   said unto the father of the maid, Fear not:  but believe [24] only, and
   she shall live.  [914] And he suffered no man to go with him, except
   [25] Simon Cephas, and James, and John the brother of James.  [915] And
   they reached the house of the chief of the synagogue; and he saw them
   agitated, weeping and wailing.  [26] [916] And he entered, and said
   unto them, Why are ye agitated and weeping? the [27] [Arabic, p. 48]
   maid hath not died, but she is sleeping.  [917] And they laughed at
   him, for [28] they knew that she had died.  [918] And he put every man
   forth without, and took the father of the maid, and her mother, and
   Simon, and James, and John, and [29] entered into the place where the
   maid was laid.  [919] And he took hold of the hand of the maid, and
   said unto her, Maid, arise.  [920] And her spirit returned, and
   straightway [30] she arose and walked:  [921] and she was about twelve
   years of age.  [922] And he commanded [31] that there should be given
   to her something to eat.  [923] And her father wondered greatly:  [32]
   and he warned them that they should tell no man what had happened.
   [924] And this report spread in all that land.

   [33] [925] And when Jesus crossed over from there, there joined him two
   blind men, crying [34] out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of
   David.  [926] And when he came to the house, those two blind men came
   to him:  and Jesus said unto them, Believe ye [35] that I am able to do
   this?  They said unto him, Yea, our Lord.  [927] Then he touched [928]
   [36] their eyes, and said, As ye have believed, it shall be unto you.
   [929] And immediately their eyes were opened.  And Jesus forbade them,
   and said, See that no man know.  [37] [930] But they went out and
   published the news in all that land.

   [38] [931] And when Jesus went out, they brought to him a dumb man
   having a devil.  [39] [932] And on the going out of the devil that dumb
   man spake.  And the multitudes marvelled, and said, It was never so
   seen in Israel

   [40] [933] And Jesus was going about in all the cities and in the
   villages, and teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good
   news of the kingdom, and healing every disease [41] [Arabic, p. 49] and
   sickness; and many followed him.  [934] And when Jesus saw the
   multitudes, he had compassion on them, for they were wearied and
   scattered, [935] as sheep [42] that have no shepherd.  [936] And he
   called his twelve disciples, and gave them power and [43] much
   authority over all devils and diseases; [937] and sent them two and
   two, that they [44] might proclaim the kingdom of God, and to heal the
   sick.  [938] And he charged them, and said, Walk not in the way of the
   heathen, nor enter into the cities of the Samaritans. [939]   [45, 46]
   [940] Go especially unto the sheep that are lost of the sons of
   Israel.  [941] And [47] when ye go, proclaim and say, The kingdom of
   heaven is come near.  [942] And heal the sick, and cleanse the lepers,
   and cast out the devils:  freely ye have received, freely [48, 49]
   give.  [943] Get you not gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
   [944] and take nothing for the way, except a staff only; nor bag, nor
   bread; neither shall ye have two tunics, [50] nor shoes, nor staff, but
   be shod with sandals; [945] for the labourer is worthy of his food.
   [51] [946] And whatever city or village ye enter, inquire who is worthy
   in it, and there be until [52, 53] ye go out.  [947] And when ye enter
   into the house, ask for the peace of the house:  and if the house is
   worthy, your peace shall come upon it; [948] but if it is not worthy,
   your [54] peace shall return unto you.  [949] And whosoever shall not
   receive you, nor hear your sayings, when ye go out from that house, or
   from that village, shake off the dust [55] [Arabic, p. 50] that is
   under your feet against them for a testimony.  [950] And verily I say
   unto you, To the land of Sodom and Gomorrah there shall be rest in the
   day of judgement, rather than to that city.

   Section XIII.

   [1] [951] I am sending you as lambs among wolves:  be ye now wise as
   serpents, and [2] harmless [952] as doves.  [953] Beware of men:  they
   shall deliver you to the councils of the [3] magistrates, and scourge
   you in their synagogues; [954] and shall bring you before governors and
   kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and against the
   nations.  [4] [955] And when they deliver you up, be not [956] anxious,
   nor consider beforehand, what ye [5] shall say; but ye shall be given
   [957] in that hour what ye ought to speak.  [958] Ye do not [6] speak,
   but the Spirit of your Father speaketh in you.  [959] The brother shall
   deliver up his brother to death, and the father his son; and the sons
   shall rise against their [7] parents, and put them to death.  [960] And
   ye shall be hated of every man because of [8] my name; but he that
   endureth unto the end of the matter shall be saved. [961]   [962] When
   they expel you from this city, flee to another.  Verily I say unto you,
   Ye shall not finish all the cities of the people of Israel, until the
   Son of man come.

   [9, 10] [963] A disciple is not superior to his lord, nor a servant to
   his master.  [964] For it is enough then for the disciple that he be as
   his lord, and the servant as his master.  If they have called the
   master of the house Beelzebul, how much more the people [11] of his
   house!  [965] Fear them not therefore: [966]   for there is nothing
   covered, that shall [12] [Arabic, p. 51] not be revealed; nor hid, that
   shall not be disclosed and published.  [967] What I say unto you in the
   darkness, speak ye in the light; and what ye have told [13] secretly in
   the ears in closets, let it be proclaimed on the housetops.  [968] I
   say unto you now, my beloved, Be not agitated at [969] those who kill
   the body, but have no power to [14] kill the soul.  I will inform you
   whom ye shall fear:  him [970] which is able to destroy [15] soul and
   body in hell.  [971] Yea, I say unto you, Be afraid of him especially.
   Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing in a bond? [972] and one of
   them shall not fall on the [16] ground without your Father.  [973] But
   what concerns you:  even the hair of your heads [17, 18] also is
   numbered.  [974] Fear not therefore; ye are better than many sparrows.
   [975] Every man who confesseth me now before men, I also will confess
   him before my Father [19] which is in heaven; [976] but whosoever
   denieth me before men, I also will deny him before my Father which is
   in heaven.

   [20] [977] Think ye that I am come to cast peace into the earth?  I
   came not to cast peace, [21] but to cast dissension.  [978] Henceforth
   there shall be five in one house, three of them [22] disagreeing with
   two, and the two with the three.  [979] The father shall become hostile
   to his son, and the son to his father; and the mother to her daughter,
   and the daughter to her mother; and the mother in law to her daughter
   in law, and the daughter [23] in law to her mother in law:  [980] and a
   man's enemies shall be the people of his house.  [24] [981] Whosoever
   loveth father or mother better than me is not worthy of me; and
   whosoever [Arabic, p. 52] loveth son or daughter more than his love of
   me is not worthy of me.  [25] [982] And every one that doth not take
   his cross and follow me is not worthy of [26] me.  [983] Whosoever
   findeth his life [984] shall lose it; and whosoever loseth his life
   [985] for my sake shall find it.

   [27] [986] And whosoever receiveth you receiveth me; and whosoever
   receiveth me receiveth [28] him that sent me.  [987] And whosoever
   receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall take [988] a
   prophet's reward; and whosoever shall receive a righteous man [29] in
   the name of a righteous man shall take [989] a righteous man's reward.
   [990] And every one that shall give to drink to one of these least ones
   a drink of water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto
   you, he shall not lose his reward.

   [30] [991] And when Jesus finished charging his twelve disciples, he
   removed thence to [31] teach and preach in their cities.  [992] And
   while they were going in the way they entered into a certain village;
   and a woman named Martha entertained him in her house.  [32] [993] And
   she had a sister named Mary, and she came and sat at the feet of our
   Lord, [33] and heard his sayings.  [994] But Martha was disquieted by
   much serving; and she came and said unto him, My Lord, givest thou no
   heed that my sister left me alone to [34] serve? speak to her that she
   help me.  [995] Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, [35] Martha,
   thou art solicitous and impatient [996] on account of many things:
   [997] but what is sought is one thing.  But Mary hath chosen for
   herself a good portion, and that which shall not be taken from her.

   [36] [998] And the apostles went forth, and preached to the people that
   they might repent.  [37] [999] And they cast out many devils, and
   anointed many sick with oil, and healed them.  [38, 39] [1000] And the
   disciples of John told him [1001] of all these things.  [1002] And when
   John heard in [Arabic, p. 53] the prison of the doings of the Messiah,
   he called two of his disciples, and sent them to Jesus, and said, Art
   thou he that cometh, or look we for [40] another?  [1003] And they came
   to Jesus, and said unto him, John the Baptist hath sent [41] us unto
   thee, and said, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another?
   [1004] And in that hour he cured many of diseases, and of plagues of an
   evil spirit; and he gave sight [42] to many blind.  [1005] Jesus
   answered and said unto them, Go and tell John everything ye have seen
   and heard:  the blind see, and the lame walk, and the lepers are
   cleansed, and the blind [1006] hear, and the dead rise, and the poor
   have the gospel preached to [43] them.  [1007] And blessed is he who
   doubteth not in me.

   [44] [1008] And when John's disciples departed, Jesus began to say to
   the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to
   see? a reed shaken with the [45] winds?  [1009] And if not, then what
   went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment?  Behold, they that
   are in magnificent garments and in voluptuousness are in the abode [46]
   of kings.  [1010] And if not, then what went ye out to see? a prophet?
   Yea, I say unto [47] you, and more than a prophet.  [1011] This is he
   of whom it is written,

   I am sending my messenger before thy face

   To prepare the way before thee.

   Section XIV.

   [1] [1012] Verily I say unto you, There hath not arisen among those
   whom women have borne a greater than John the Baptist; but he that is
   little now in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

   [2] [Arabic, p. 54] [1013] And all the people which heard, and the
   publicans, justified [1014] God, for [3] they had been baptized with
   the baptism of John.  [1015] But the Pharisees and the scribes wronged
   [1016] the purpose of God in themselves, in that they were not baptized
   of [4] him.  [1017] And from the days of John the Baptist until now the
   kingdom of heaven is [5] snatched away by violence.  [1018] The law and
   the prophets were until John; and after that, the kingdom of God is
   preached, and all press to enter it:  [1019] and they that exert
   themselves [6, 7] snatch it away.  [1020] All the prophets and the law
   until John prophesied.  [1021] And if ye [8] will, then receive it,
   that he is Elijah, which is to come.  [1022] Whosoever hath ears that
   hear [9] let him hear.  [1023] Easier is the perishing of heaven and
   earth, than the passing away of [10] one point of the law.  [1024] To
   whom then shall I liken the people of this generation, [1025] and [11]
   to whom are they like?  [1026] They are like the children sitting in
   the market, which call to their companions, and say, We sang to you,
   and ye danced not; we wailed to you, [12] and ye wept not.  [1027] John
   the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; [13] and ye
   said, He hath demons:  [1028] and the Son of man came eating and
   drinking; and ye said, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drinker of wine,
   and an associate of publicans [14, 15] and sinners!  [1029] And wisdom
   was justified of all her children.  [1030] And when he said that, they
   came to the house.  And there gathered unto him again multitudes, [16]
   so that they found not bread to eat.  [1031] And while he was casting
   out a devil which was dumb, when he cast out that devil, that dumb man
   spake.  And the multitudes [17] [Arabic, p. 55] marvelled.  [1032] And
   the Pharisees, when they heard, said, This man doth not cast out the
   devils, except by Beelzebul the chief of the demons, which is in him.
   [18, 19] [1033] And others requested of him a sign from heaven, to
   tempt him.  [1034] And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them in
   parables, Every kingdom that withstandeth itself shall become desolate;
   and every house or city that disagreeth with itself shall not [20]
   stand:  [1035] and if a devil cast out a devil, he withstandeth
   himself; neither shall he be [21] able to stand, but his end shall be.
   [1036] Then how now shall his kingdom stand? for ye [22] said that I
   cast out devils by Beelzebul.  [1037] And if I by Beelzebul cast out
   the devils, then your children, by what do they cast them out?  And for
   this cause they shall [23] be judges against you.  [1038] But if I by
   the Spirit of God cast out devils, then the kingdom [24] of God is come
   near unto you.  [1039] Or how can a man enter into the house of a
   valiant man, and seize his garments, [1040] if he do not beforehand
   secure himself [1041] from [25] that valiant man? and then will he cut
   off [1042] his house.  [1043] But when the valiant man is [26] armed,
   guarding his house, his possessions are in peace.  [1044] But if one
   come who is more valiant than he, he overcometh him, and taketh his
   whole armour, on which [27] he relieth, and divideth his spoil.  [1045]
   Whosoever is not with me is against me; and [28] whosoever gathereth
   not with me scattereth abroad.  [1046] For this reason I say unto you,
   [Arabic, p. 56] that all sins and blasphemies with which men blaspheme
   shall be forgiven [29] them:  [1047] but whosoever shall blaspheme
   against the Holy Spirit, there is no [30] forgiveness for him for ever,
   but he is deserving of eternal punishment:  [1048] because they [31]
   said that he had an unclean spirit.  [1049] And he said also, Every one
   that speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him;
   but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be
   forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to [32] come.
   [1050] Either ye must make a good tree [1051] and its fruit good; or ye
   must make an evil [33] tree [1052] and its fruit evil:  for the tree is
   known by its fruit.  [1053] Ye children of vipers, how can ye, being
   evil, speak good things? from the overflowings of the heart the mouth
   [34] speaketh.  [1054] The good man from the good treasures which are
   in his heart bringeth forth good things; and the wicked man from the
   evil treasures which are in his [35] heart bringeth forth evils.
   [1055] I say unto you, that every idle word which men shall [36] speak,
   they shall give an answer for in the day of judgement:  [1056] for by
   thy sayings thou shalt be justified, and by thy sayings thou shalt be
   judged.

   [37] [1057] And he said to the multitudes, When ye see the clouds
   appear from the west, [38] straightway ye say that there cometh rain;
   and so it cometh to pass.  [1058] And when [39] the south wind bloweth,
   ye say that there will be heat; and it cometh to pass.  [1059] And when
   the evening is come, ye say, It will be fair weather, for the heaven
   has become [40] red.  [1060] And in the morning ye say, To-day there
   will be severe weather, for the redness [Arabic, p. 57] of the heaven
   is paling.  [1061] Ye hypocrites, ye know to examine the face of the
   heaven and the earth; but the signs of this time ye know not to
   discern.

   [41] [1062] Then they brought to him one possessed of a demon, dumb and
   blind; and he [42] healed him, so that the dumb and blind began to
   speak and see.  [1063] And all the multitudes wondered, and said, Is
   this, think you, the son of David?

   [43] [1064] And the apostles returned unto Jesus, and told him
   everything that they had [44] done and wrought. [1065]   [1066] And he
   said unto them, Come, let us go into the desert alone, and rest ye a
   little.  And many were going and returning, and they had not leisure,
   not even to eat bread.

   [45] [1067] And after that, there came to him one of the Pharisees, and
   besought him that he would eat bread with him.  And he entered into the
   house of that Pharisee, and [46] reclined.  [1068] And there was in
   that city a woman that was a sinner; and when she knew that he was
   sitting in the house of that Pharisee, she took a box of sweet
   ointment, [47] and stood behind him, [1069] towards his feet, weeping,
   and began to wet his feet with her tears, and to wipe them with the
   hair of her head, and to kiss his feet, and [48] anoint them with the
   sweet ointment.  [1070] And when that [1071] Pharisee saw it, who
   invited him, he thought within himself, and said, This man, if he were
   a prophet, would know who she is and what is her history:  for the
   woman which touched him was a sinner.

   Section XV.

   [1] [1072] Jesus answered and said unto him, Simon, I have something to
   say unto thee.  And [2] he said unto him, Say on, my Master.   [1073]
   Jesus said unto him, There were two debtors [Arabic, p. 58] to one
   creditor; and one of them owed five hundred pence, and the other [3]
   owed fifty pence.  [1074] And because they had not wherewith to pay, he
   forgave [4] them both.  Which of them ought to love him more?  [1075]
   Simon answered and said, I suppose, he to whom he forgave most.  Jesus
   said unto him, Thou hast judged rightly.  [5] [1076] And he turned to
   that woman, and said to Simon, Dost thou see this woman?  I entered
   into thy dwelling, and thou gavest me not water to wash my feet:  but
   this [6] woman hath bathed [1077] my feet with her tears, and dried
   them with her hair.  [1078] And thou kissedst me not:  but this woman,
   since she [1079] entered, hath not ceased to kiss my [7] feet.  [1080]
   And thou anointedst not my head with oil: [1081]   but this woman hath
   anointed [8] my feet with sweet ointment. [1082]   [1083] And for this,
   I say unto thee, Her many sins are forgiven her, because she loved
   much; for he to whom little is forgiven loveth little.  [9, 10] [1084]
   And he said unto that woman, Thy sins are forgiven thee.  [1085] And
   those that were invited [11] began to say within themselves, Who is
   this that forgiveth sins also?  [1086] And Jesus said to that woman,
   Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

   [12] [1087] And many believed in him when they saw the signs which he
   was doing.  [13, 14] [1088] But Jesus did not trust [1089] himself to
   them, [1090] for he knew every man, and he needed not any man to
   testify to him concerning every man; for he knew what was in man.

   [15] [1091] And after that, Jesus set apart from his disciples other
   seventy, and sent them two and two before his face to every region and
   city whither he was purposing to [16] go.  [1092] And he said unto
   them, The harvest is abundant, and the labourers are few:  [17] entreat
   now the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth labourers into his
   harvest.  [1093] Go [18] [Arabic, p. 59] ye:  and lo, I am sending you
   as lambs among wolves.  [1094] Take not with you [19] purses, nor a
   wallet, nor shoes; neither salute any man in the way.  [1095] And [20]
   whatsoever house ye enter, first salute that house:  [1096] and if
   there be there a son of peace, [21] let your peace rest upon him; but
   if there be not, your peace shall return to you.  [1097] And be ye in
   that house eating and drinking what they have: [1098]   for the
   labourer is worthy of [22] his hire.  [1099] And remove not from house
   to house.  And into whatsoever city ye enter, [23] and they receive
   you, eat what is presented to you:  [1100] and heal the sick that are
   [24] therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come near unto
   you.  [1101] But whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go
   out into the market, and say, [25] [1102] Even the dust that clave to
   our feet from your city, we shake off against you; but [26] know [1103]
   this, [1104] that the kingdom of God is come near unto you.  [1105] I
   say unto you, that for Sodom there shall be quiet in the day of
   judgement, but there shall not be for [27] that city.  [1106] Then
   began Jesus to rebuke the cities in which there had been many [28]
   mighty works, [1107] and they repented not.  [1108] And he said, Woe
   unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! if there had been in
   Tyre and Sidon the signs which were in [29] thee, it may be that they
   would have repented in sackcloth and ashes.  [1109] Howbeit I say unto
   you, that for Tyre and Sidon there shall be rest in the day of
   judgement, [30] more than for you.  [1110] And thou, Capernaum, which
   art exalted unto heaven, shalt sink down unto Hades; for if there had
   been in Sodom the wonders [1111] which were [31] in thee, it would have
   remained until this day.  [1112] And now I say unto thee, that for the
   land of Sodom there shall be quiet in the day of judgement, more than
   for thee.

   [32] [Arabic, p. 60] [1113] And he said again unto his apostles,
   Whosoever heareth you heareth me; and whosoever heareth me heareth him
   that sent me:  and whosoever wrongeth [1114] you wrongeth me; and
   whosoever wrongeth me wrongeth him that sent me.

   [33] [1115] And those seventy returned with great joy, and said unto
   him, Our Lord, even [34] the devils also are subject unto us in thy
   name.  [1116] He said unto them, I beheld [35] Satan [1117] fallen like
   lightning from heaven.  [1118] Behold, I am giving you authority to
   tread upon serpents and scorpions, and the whole race [1119] of the
   enemy; and nothing shall [36] hurt you.  [1120] Only ye must not
   rejoice that the devils are subject unto you; but be glad that your
   names are written in heaven.

   [37] [1121] And in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and
   said, I acknowledge thee, my Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that
   thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst
   reveal them unto children:  yea, my Father; so [38] was thy will.
   [1122] And he turned to his disciples, [1123] and said unto them,
   Everything hath been delivered to me of my Father:  and no man knoweth
   who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son,
   and to whomsoever the Son willeth [39] to reveal him.  [1124] Come unto
   me, all of you, ye that are wearied and bearers of burdens, [40] and I
   will give you rest.  [1125] Bear my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for
   [1126] I [41] am gentle and lowly in my heart:  and ye shall find rest
   unto your souls.  [1127] For my yoke is pleasant, and my burden is
   light.

   [42] [1128] And while great multitudes were going with him, he turned,
   and said unto them, [43] [1129] Whosoever cometh unto me, and hateth
   not his father, and his mother, and his brethren, and his sisters, and
   his wife, and his children, and himself [1130] also, cannot [44]
   [Arabic, p. 61] be a disciple to me.  [1131] And whosoever doth not
   take his cross, and follow [45] me, cannot be a disciple to me.  [1132]
   Which of you desireth to build a tower, and doth not sit down first and
   reckon his expenses and whether he hath enough to [46] complete it?
   [1133] [1134] lest when he hath laid the foundations, and is not able
   to finish, all that [47] behold him [1135] laugh at him, and say,
   [1136] This man began to build, and was not able to [48] finish.
   [1137] Or what king goeth to the battle to fight with another king,
   [1138] and doth not consider first whether he is able with ten thousand
   to meet him that cometh to him [49] with twenty thousand?  [1139] And
   if he is not able, he sendeth unto him while he is afar [50] off, and
   seeketh peace.  [1140] So shall [1141] every man of you consider, that
   desireth to be a disciple to me; for if he renounceth not all that he
   hath, he cannot be a disciple to me.

   Section XVI.

   [1] [1142] Then answered certain of the scribes and Pharisees, that
   they might tempt him, [2] and said, Teacher, we desire to see a sign
   from thee.  [1143] He answered and said, This evil and adulterous
   generation [1144] seeketh a sign; and it shall not be given a sign, [3]
   except the sign of Jonah the prophet.  [1145] And as Jonah was a sign
   to the inhabitants [4] of Nineveh, so shall the Son of man also be to
   this generation.  [1146] And as Jonah was in the belly of the great
   fish three days and three nights, so shall the Son of man [5] be in the
   heart of the earth three days and three nights.  [1147] The queen of
   the south shall rise in the judgement with the people of this
   generation, and condemn [1148] them:  for she came from the ends of the
   earth that she might hear the wisdom of Solomon; [6] [Arabic, p. 62]
   and behold, here is a better than Solomon.  [1149] The men of Nineveh
   shall stand in the judgement with this generation, and condemn it:  for
   they repented at [7] the preaching of Jonah; and behold, here is a
   greater than Jonah.  [1150] The unclean spirit, when he goeth out of
   the man, departeth, and goeth about through places wherein are no
   waters, that he may find rest for himself; and when he findeth it not,
   he [8] saith, I will return to my house whence I came out.  [1151] And
   if he come and find it [9] adorned and set in order, [1152] then he
   goeth, and associateth with himself seven other spirits worse than
   himself; and they enter and dwell in it:  and the end of that man [10]
   shall be worse than his beginning.  [1153] Thus shall it be unto this
   evil generation.

   [11] [1154] And while he was saying that, a woman from the multitude
   lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare
   thee, and the breasts that nursed [12] thee.  [1155] But he said unto
   her, Blessed is he that heareth the word of God, and keepeth it.

   [13] [1156] And while he was speaking unto the multitude, there came
   unto him his mother [14] and his brethren, and sought to speak with
   him; [1157] and they were not able, because of [15] the multitude; and
   they stood without and sent, calling him unto them.  [1158] A man said
   unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, and
   seek to [16] speak with thee.  [1159] But he answered unto him that
   spake unto him, Who is my [17] mother? and who are my brethren?  [1160]
   And he beckoned with his hand, stretching it out towards his disciples,
   and said, Behold, my mother! and behold, my brethren!  [18] [1161] And
   every man that shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven is my
   brother, and my sister, and my mother.

   [19] [1162] And after that, Jesus was going about in the cities and in
   the villages, and proclaiming [Arabic, p. 63] and preaching the kingdom
   of God, and his [1163] twelve with him, [20] [1164] and the women which
   had been healed of diseases and of evil spirits, Mary [21] that was
   called Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven devils, [1165] and
   Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others,
   who were ministering to them of their substance.

   [22] [1166] And after that, Jesus went out of the house, and sat on the
   sea shore.  [1167] And there [23] gathered unto him great multitudes.
   And when the press of the people was great upon him, he went up and sat
   in the boat; and all the multitude was standing on the [24] shore of
   the sea.  [1168] And he spake to them much in parables, and said, The
   sower [25] went forth to sow:  and when he sowed, [1169] some fell on
   the beaten highway; and it was [26] trodden upon, and the birds ate
   it.  [1170] And other fell on the rocks:  and some, where there was not
   much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no depth in
   [27] the earth:  [1171] and when the sun rose, it withered; and because
   it had no root, it dried [28] up.  [1172] And some fell among thorns;
   and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it; [29] and it yielded no
   fruit.  [1173] And other fell into excellent and good [1174] ground;
   and it came up, and grew, and brought forth fruit, some thirty, and
   some sixty, and some [30] a hundred.   [1175] And when he said that, he
   cried, He that hath ears that hear, let him [31] hear.  [1176] And when
   they were alone, his disciples came, and asked him, and said unto [32]
   him, What is this parable? and why spakest thou unto them in parables?
   [1177] He [Arabic, p. 64] answered and said unto them, Unto you is
   given the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God; but it is not
   given unto them that are [33] without.  [1178] He that hath shall be
   given unto, and there shall be added; and he that [34] hath not, that
   which he hath shall be taken from him also.  [1179] For this cause
   therefore I speak unto them in parables; because they see, and see not;
   and hear, and hear [35] not, nor understand.  [1180] And in them is
   being fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, who said,

   Hearing they shall hear, and shall not understand;

   And seeing they shall see, and shall not perceive:

   [36] [1181] The heart of this people is waxed gross,

   And their hearing with their ears is become heavy,

   And they have closed their eyes;

   Lest they should see with their eyes,

   And hear with their ears,

   And understand with their hearts,

   And should return,

   And I should heal them.

   [37, 38] [1182] But ye, blessed are your eyes, which see; and your
   ears, which hear.  [1183] Blessed [39] are the eyes which see what ye
   see.  [1184] Verily I say unto you, Many of the prophets and the
   righteous longed to see what ye see, and saw not; and to hear what ye
   [40] hear, and heard not.  [1185] When ye know not this parable, how
   shall ye know all parables?  [41, 42] [1186] Hear ye the parable of the
   sower.  [1187] The sower which sowed, sowed the word [43] of God.
   [1188] Every one who heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth
   it not, the evil one cometh and snatcheth away the word that hath been
   sown in his [44] heart:  and this is that which was sown on the middle
   of the highway.  [1189] But that which was sown on the rocks is he that
   heareth the word, and straightway receiveth [45, 46] [Arabic, p. 65] it
   with joy; [1190] only, it hath no root in his soul, but his belief in
   it is for a time; [1191] and whenever there is distress or persecution
   because of a [1192] word, he [47] stumbleth [1193] quickly.  [1194] And
   that which was sown among the thorns is he that heareth the word;
   [1195] and the care of this world, and the error of riches, and the
   rest of the [48] other lusts enter, and choke the word, and it becometh
   without fruit.  [1196] And that which was sown in good ground is he
   that heareth my word in a pure and good heart, and understandeth it,
   and holdeth to it, and bringeth forth fruit with patience, [1197] and
   produceth either a hundredfold or sixtyfold or thirty.

   [49] [1198] And he said, So is the kingdom of God, like a man who
   casteth seed into the [50] earth, and sleepeth and riseth by night and
   day, [1199] and the seed groweth and cometh [51] up, whence [1200] he
   knoweth not.  [1201] And the earth bringeth it to the fruit; and first
   it [52] will be blade, and after it ear, and at last perfect wheat in
   the ear:  [1202] and whenever the fruit ripeneth, [1203] he bringeth
   immediately the sickle, for the harvest hath come.

   Section XVII.

   [1] [1204] And he set forth to them another parable, and said, The
   kingdom of heaven is [2] like a man who sowed good seed in his field;
   [1205] but when men slept, his enemy came [3] and sowed tares among the
   wheat, and went away.  [1206] And when the blade sprang up [4] and
   brought forth fruit, there were noticed the tares also.  [1207] And the
   servants of the master of the house came, and said unto him, Our lord,
   didst thou not sow good [5] [Arabic, p. 66] seed in thy field? whence
   are there tares in it?  [1208] He said unto them, An enemy hath done
   this.  His servants said unto him, Wilt thou that we go [6] and
   separate it?  [1209] He said unto them, Perhaps, [1210] when ye
   separate the tares, ye would [7] root up with them wheat also.  [1211]
   Leave them to grow both together until the harvest:  and in the time of
   the harvest I will say unto the reapers, Separate the tares first, and
   bind them in bundles to be burned with fire; and gather the wheat into
   my barns.

   [8, 9] [1212] And he set forth to them another parable, and said,
   [1213] To what is the kingdom of [10] God like? and to what shall I
   liken it? and in what parable shall I set it forth?  [1214] It [11] is
   like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and planted in his
   field:  [1215] and of the number of the things that are sown in the
   earth it is smaller than all of the things [12] which are sown, which
   are upon the earth; [1216] but when it is grown, it is greater than all
   the herbs, and produceth large branches, so that the birds of heaven
   make their nests in its branches.

   [13, 14] [1217] And he set forth to them another parable:  [1218] To
   what shall I liken the kingdom of [15] God?  [1219] It is like the
   leaven which a woman took, and kneaded into three measures of flour,
   until the whole of it was leavened.

   [16] [1220] And Jesus spake all that to the multitudes by way of
   parables, according as they [17] were able to hear.  [1221] And without
   parables spake he not unto them; that the saying of the Lord through
   the prophet might be fulfilled:

   I will open my mouth in parables;

   And I will utter secrets which were before the foundations [1222] of
   the world.

   [18] [1223] But he explained to his disciples privately everything.

   [19] [1224] Then Jesus left [1225] the multitudes, and came to the
   house.  And his disciples came unto him, and said unto him, Explain
   unto us that parable about the tares [20] [Arabic, p. 67] and the
   field.  [1226] He answered and said unto them, He that sowed good seed
   is [21] the Son of man; [1227] and the field is the world; and the good
   seed are the children of the [22] kingdom; [1228] and the tares are the
   children of the evil one; and the enemy that sowed them [1229] is
   Satan; and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the
   angels.  [23] [1230] And as the tares are separated and burned in the
   fire, so shall it be in the end of [24] this world.  [1231] The Son of
   man shall send his angels, and separate from his kingdom [25] all
   things that injure, [1232] and all the doers of iniquity, and they
   shall cast them into the [26] furnace of fire:  and there shall be
   weeping and gnashing of teeth.  [1233] Then the righteous shall shine
   as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.  Whosoever hath ears that
   hear, let him hear.

   [27] [1234] And again the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a
   field:  that which a man found and hid; and, for his pleasure in it,
   went and sold all that he had, and bought that field.

   [28] [1235] And again the kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a
   merchant seeking excellent [29] pearls; [1236] and when he found one
   pearl of great price, he went and sold everything that he had, and
   bought it.

   [30] [1237] And again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast
   [1238] into the sea, and [31] gathered of every kind:  [1239] and when
   it was filled, they drew it up on to the shore of the sea, and sat down
   to select; and the good of them they threw into the vessels, [32] and
   the bad they threw outside.  [1240] Thus shall it be in the end of the
   world:  the angels [33] shall go forth, [1241] and separate the wicked
   from among the good, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire:
   there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

   [34] [1242] Jesus said unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
   They said unto [35] [Arabic, p. 68] him, Yea, our Lord.  [1243] He said
   unto them, Therefore every scribe that becometh a disciple of the
   kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a householder, who bringeth out
   of his treasures the new and the old.

   [36, 37] [1244] And when Jesus had finished all these parables, he
   removed thence, and came to his city; [1245] and he taught them in
   their synagogues, so that they were perplexed.  [38] [1246] And when
   the sabbath came, Jesus began to teach in the synagogue; and many of
   [39] those that heard marvelled, and said, Whence came these things to
   this man?  And many envied him and gave no heed to him, but said, What
   is this wisdom that is given to this man, that there should happen at
   his hands such as these mighty works? [1247]   [40] [1248] Is not this
   a carpenter, son of a carpenter? and is not his mother called Mary? and
   [41] his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  [1249] And
   his sisters, all of them, [42] lo, are they not all with us?  [1250]
   Whence hath this man all these things?  And they were in doubt
   concerning him.  [1251] And Jesus knew their opinion, and said unto
   them, Will ye haply [1252] say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal
   first thyself:  and all that [43] we have heard that thou didst in
   Capernaum, do here also in thine own city?  [1253] And he said, Verily
   I say unto you, A prophet is not received in his own city, nor among
   [44] his brethren:  [1254] for a prophet is not despised, save in his
   own city, and among his own [45] kin, and in his own house.  [1255]
   Verily I say unto you, In the days of Elijah the prophet, there were
   many widows among the children of Israel, when the heaven held back
   [46] three years and six months, [1256] and there was a great famine in
   all the land; and Elijah [Arabic, p. 69] was not sent to one of them,
   save to Zarephath of Sidon, to a woman that was [47] a widow.  [1257]
   And many lepers were among the children of Israel in the days of Elisha
   the prophet; but not one of them was cleansed, save Naaman the
   Nabathæan. [1258]   [48] [1259] And he was not able to do there many
   mighty works, [1260] because of their unbelief; [49] except that he
   laid his hand upon a few of the sick, and healed them.  [1261] And he
   marvelled [50] at their lack of faith.  [1262] And when those who were
   in the synagogue heard, [51] they were all filled with wrath; and they
   rose up, [1263] and brought him forth outside the city, and brought him
   to the brow of the hill upon which their city was built, that [52] they
   might cast him from its summit:  [1264] but he passed through among
   them and went away.

   [53] [1265] And he went about in the villages which were around
   Nazareth, and taught in their synagogues.

   Section XVIII.

   [1] [1266] At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
   and all the things which came to pass at his hand; [1267] and he
   marvelled, for he had obtained excellent [2] information concerning
   him. [1268]   [1269] And some men said that John the Baptist was risen
   [3] from among the dead; [1270] and [1271] others said that Elijah had
   appeared; and others, Jeremiah; [4] and others, that a prophet of the
   old prophets was risen; [1272] and others said that he [5] was a
   prophet like one of the prophets.  [1273] Herod said to his servants,
   This is John the Baptist, he whom I beheaded; he is risen from among
   the dead:  therefore mighty [6] [Arabic, p. 70] works result from him.
   [1274] For Herod himself had sent and taken John, and cast him into
   prison, for the sake of Herodias his brother Philip's wife, whom he [7]
   had taken.  [1275] And John said to Herod, Thou hast no authority to
   take the wife of thy [8] brother.  [1276] And Herodias avoided him and
   wished to kill him; and she could not.  [9] [1277] But Herod feared
   John, for he knew that he was a righteous man and a holy; and [10] he
   guarded him, and heard him much, and did, and obeyed him with
   gladness.  [1278] And he wished to kill him; but he feared the people,
   for they adhered to him as the [11] prophet.  [1279] And there was a
   celebrated day, and Herod had made a feast for his great men on the day
   of his anniversary, [1280] and for the officers and for the chief men
   [12] of Galilee.  [1281] And the daughter of Herodias came in and
   danced in the midst of the company, and pleased Herod and those that
   sat with him.  And the king said to the [13] damsel, Ask of me what
   thou wilt, and I will give it thee.  [1282] And he sware unto her, [14]
   Whatsoever thou shalt ask, I will give it thee, to the half of my
   kingdom.  [1283] And she went out, and said unto her mother, What shall
   I ask him? [1284]   She said unto her, The [15] head of John the
   Baptist.  [1285] And immediately she came in hastily to the king, and
   said unto him, I desire in this hour that thou give me on a dish the
   head of John [16] the Baptist.  [1286] And the king was exceeding
   sorry; but because of the oath and the [17] guests he did not wish to
   refuse her.  [1287] But immediately the king sent an executioner, and
   commanded that he should bring the head of John:  and he went and cut
   off [18] the head of John in the prison, [1288] and brought it on a
   dish, and delivered it to the [19] damsel; and the damsel gave it to
   her mother.  [1289] And his disciples heard, and came [Arabic, p. 71]
   and took his body, and buried it.  [1290] And they came and told [1291]
   Jesus what [20] had happened.  [1292] And for this cause Herod said, I
   beheaded John:  who [21] is this, of whom I hear these things.  And he
   desired to see him.  [1293] And Jesus, when he heard, removed thence in
   a boat to a waste place alone, to the other side of the sea of the
   Galilee of Tiberias. [1294]

   [22] [1295] And many saw them going, and knew them, and hastened by
   land [1296] from all the cities, and came thither beforehand; [1297]
   for they saw the signs which he was doing on the [23, 24] sick.  [1298]
   And Jesus went up into the mountain, and sat there with his disciples.
   [1299] And [25] the feast of the passover of the Jews was near.  [1300]
   And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and saw great multitudes coming to him.
   [1301] And he was moved with compassion for them, for [26] they were
   like sheep that were without a shepherd.  [1302] And he received them,
   and spake to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those who
   had need of healing.

   [27] [1303] And when the evening approached, [1304] his disciples came
   to him, and said unto [28] him, [1305] The place is desert, and the
   time is past; send away the multitudes of the people, [1306] that they
   may go to the towns and villages which are around us, and buy for [29]
   themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.  [1307] But he said
   unto them, They have [30] no need to go away; give ye them what may be
   eaten.  [1308] They said unto him, We have not here enough.  [1309] He
   said unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread that these may eat?  [31,
   32] [1310] And he said that proving him; and he knew what he was
   resolved to do.  [1311] Philip said [Arabic, p. 72] unto him, Two
   hundred pennyworth of bread would not suffice them after [1312] [33]
   every one of them hath taken a small amount.  [1313] One of his
   disciples said unto [34] him (namely, Andrew the brother of Simon
   Cephas), [1314] Here is a lad having five loaves [35] of barley and two
   fishes:  but this amount, what is it for all these?  [1315] But wilt
   thou that we go and buy for all the people what may be eaten? for we
   have no more [36] than these five loaves and the two fishes.  [1316]
   And the grass was plentiful in that place.  Jesus said unto them,
   Arrange all the people that they may sit down on the grass, [37] fifty
   people in a company.  [1317] And the disciples did so.  And all the
   people sat down [38] by companies, by hundreds and fifties.  [1318]
   Then Jesus said unto them, Bring hither [39] those five loaves and the
   two fishes.  [1319] And when they brought him that, Jesus took the
   bread and the fish, and looked to heaven, and blessed, and divided, and
   gave to [40] his disciples to set before them; [1320] and the disciples
   set for the multitudes the bread [41] and the fish; and they ate, all
   of them, and were satisfied.  [1321] And when they were satisfied, he
   said unto his disciples, Gather the fragments that remain over, that
   nothing [42] be lost.  [1322] And they gathered, and filled twelve
   baskets with fragments, being those that remained over from those which
   ate of the five barley loaves and the two [43] fishes.  [1323] And
   those people who ate were five thousand, besides the women and
   children.  [44] [Arabic, p. 73] [1324] And straightway he pressed his
   disciples to go up into the ship, and that they should go before him
   unto the other side to Bethsaida, while he [45] himself should send
   away the multitudes.  [1325] And those people who saw the sign which
   [46] Jesus did, said, Of a truth this is a prophet who hath come into
   the world.  [1326] And Jesus knew their purpose to come and take him,
   and make him a king; and he left them, and went up into the mountain
   alone for prayer.

   [47, 48] [1327] And when the nightfall was near, his disciples went
   down unto the sea, and sat [1328] in a boat, and came to the side of
   Capernaum.  [1329] And the darkness came on, and Jesus [49] had not
   come to them.  [1330] And the sea was stirred up against them by reason
   of a violent [50] wind that blew.  [1331] And the boat was distant from
   the land many furlongs, and they were much damaged by the waves, and
   the wind was against them.

   Section XIX.

   [1] [1332] And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus came unto them,
   walking upon the [2] [1333] water, after they had rowed [1334] with
   difficulty about twenty-five or thirty furlongs.  [3] [1335] And when
   he drew near unto their boat, his disciples saw him walking on the
   water; and they were troubled, and supposed that it was a false
   appearance; and they cried [4] out from their fear.  [1336] But Jesus
   straightway spoke unto them, and said, Take courage, [5] for it is I;
   fear not.  [1337] Then Cephas answered and said unto him, My Lord, if
   it be thou, [6] bid me to come unto thee on the water.  [1338] And
   Jesus said unto him, Come.  And [7] Cephas went down out of the boat,
   and walked on the water to come unto Jesus.  [1339] But [Arabic, p. 74]
   when he saw the wind strong, he feared, and was on the point of
   sinking; [8] and he lifted up his voice, and said, My Lord, save me.
   [1340] And immediately our Lord stretched out his hand and took hold of
   him, and said unto him, [9] Thou of little faith, why didst thou
   doubt?  [1341] And when Jesus came near, he went up [10] unto them into
   the boat, he and Simon, and immediately the wind ceased.  [1342] And
   those that were in the ship came and worshipped him, and said, Truly
   thou art the [11] Son of God.  [1343] And straightway that ship arrived
   at the land which they made for.  [12] [1344] And when they came out of
   the ship to the land, they marvelled greatly and were [13] perplexed in
   themselves:  [1345] and they had not understood by means of [1346] that
   bread, because their heart was gross.

   [14] [1347] And when the people of that region knew of the arrival of
   Jesus, they made haste in all that land, and began to bring those that
   were diseased, [1348] borne in their [15] beds to the place where they
   heard that he was.  [1349] And wheresoever the place might be which he
   entered, of the villages or the cities, they laid the sick in the
   markets, and sought of him that they might touch [1350] were it only
   the edge of his garment:  and all that touched [1351] him were healed
   and lived. [1352]

   [16] [1353] And on the day after that, the multitude which was standing
   on the shore of the sea saw that there was there no other ship save
   that into which the disciples had [17] gone up, [1354] and that Jesus
   went not up into the ship with his disciples (but there were other
   ships from Tiberias near [1355] the place where they ate the bread when
   Jesus blessed [18] it):  [1356] and when that multitude saw that Jesus
   was not there, nor yet his disciples, they [19] [Arabic, p. 75] went up
   into those ships, and came to Capernaum, and sought Jesus.  [1357] And
   when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him,
   Our [20] Master, when camest thou hither?  [1358] Jesus answered and
   said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye have not sought me
   because of [1359] your seeing the signs, but because of [21] your
   eating the bread and being satisfied.  [1360] Serve not the food which
   perisheth, but the food which abideth in eternal life, [1361] which the
   Son of man will give unto you:  him [1362] [22] hath God the Father
   sealed.  [1363] They said unto him, What shall we do that we may [23]
   work the work of God?  [1364] Jesus answered and said unto them, This
   is the work of [24] God, that ye believe in him whom he hath sent.
   [1365] They said unto him, What sign hast thou done, that we may see,
   and believe in thee? what hast thou wrought?  [25] [1366] Our fathers
   ate the manna in the wilderness; as it was written, Bread from heaven
   [26] gave he them to eat.  [1367] Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily,
   I say unto you, Moses gave you not bread from [27] heaven; but my
   Father gave [1368] you the bread of truth [1369] from heaven.  [1370]
   The bread of God is that which came down from heaven and gave the [28,
   29] world life.  [1371] They said unto him, Our Lord, give us at all
   times this bread.  [1372] Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of
   life:  whosoever cometh unto me shall not hunger, [30] and whosoever
   believeth in me shall not thirst for ever.  [1373] But I said unto you,
   [31] Ye have seen me, and have not believed.  [1374] And all that my
   Father hath given to me cometh unto me; and whosoever cometh unto me I
   shall not cast him forth without.  [32] [1375] I came down from heaven,
   not to do my own will, but to do the will of him [33] that sent me;
   [1376] and this is the will of him that sent me, that I should lose
   nothing of [34] [Arabic, p. 76] that which he gave me, but raise it up
   in the last day.  [1377] This is the will of my Father, that every one
   that seeth the Son, and believeth in him, should have eternal life; and
   I will raise him up in the last day.

   [35] [1378] The Jews therefore murmured against him because of his
   saying, I am the bread [36] which came down from heaven.  [1379] And
   they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and
   mother we know? then how saith this man, I came down from [37, 38]
   heaven?  [1380] Jesus answered and said unto them, Murmur not one with
   another.  [1381] No man is able to come unto me, except the Father
   which sent me draw him; and I will [39] raise him up in the last day.
   [1382] It is written in the prophet, They shall all be the taught of
   God.  Every one who heareth from the Father now, [1383] and learneth of
   him, cometh [40] unto me.  [1384] No man now seeth the Father; but he
   that is from God, he it is that seeth [41] the Father.  [1385] Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, Whosoever believeth in me hath eternal [42, 43]
   life.  [1386] I am the bread of life.  [1387] Your fathers ate the
   manna in the wilderness, and [44] they died.  [1388] This is the bread
   which came down from heaven, that a man may eat [45] of it, and not
   die.  [1389] I am the bread of life which came down from heaven:  and
   if a man eat of this bread he shall live for ever:  [1390] and the
   bread which I shall give is my body, which I give for the life of the
   world.

   [46] [1391] The Jews therefore quarrelled one with another, and said,
   How can he give us [47] [Arabic, p. 77] his body that we may eat it?
   [1392] Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye do
   not eat the body of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye shall [48]
   not have life in yourselves.  [1393] Whosoever eateth of my body and
   drinketh of my blood [49] hath eternal life; and I will raise him up in
   the last day.  [1394] My body truly is meat, [1395] and [50] my blood
   truly is drink. [1396]   [1397] Whosoever eateth my body and drinketh
   my blood abideth [51] in me, and I in him-- [1398] as the living Father
   sent me, and I am alive because of the [52] Father; and whosoever
   eateth me, he also shall live because of me.  [1399] This is the bread
   which came down from heaven:  and not according as your fathers ate the
   [53] manna, and died:  whosoever eateth of this bread shall live for
   ever.  [1400] This he said in [54] the synagogue, when he was teaching
   in Capernaum.  [1401] And many of his disciples, when they heard, said,
   This word is hard; who is he that can hear it?

   Section XX.

   [1] [1402] And Jesus knew within himself that his disciples were
   murmuring because of [2] that, and he said unto them, Doth this trouble
   you?  [1403] What if ye should see the Son [3] of man then ascend to
   the place where he was of old?  [1404] It is the spirit that
   quickeneth, and the body profiteth nothing:  the words [1405] that I
   speak unto you are spirit [4] and life.  [1406] But there are some of
   you that do not believe.  And Jesus knew beforehand who they were who
   should [1407] not believe, and who it was that should betray [5] him.
   [1408] And he said unto them, Therefore I said unto you, No man can
   come unto me, if that hath not been given him by the Father.

   [6] [Arabic, p. 78] [1409] And because of this word many of his
   disciples turned back and walked [7] not with him.  [1410] And Jesus
   said unto the twelve, Do ye haply also wish to [8] go away?  [1411]
   Simon Cephas answered and said, My Lord, to whom shall we go? thou [9]
   hast the words of eternal life.  [1412] And we have believed and known
   that thou art the [10] Messiah, the Son of the living God.  [1413]
   Jesus said unto them, Did not I choose you, [11] ye company of the
   twelve, and of you one is a devil?  [1414] He said that because of
   Judas the son of Simon Iscariot; for he, being of the twelve, was
   purposed to [1415] betray him.

   [12] [1416] And while he was speaking, one of the Pharisees came asking
   of him that he [13] would eat with him:  and he went in, and reclined
   to meat.  [1417] And that Pharisee, when [14] he saw it, [1418]
   marvelled that he had not first cleansed himself before his eating.
   [1419] Jesus said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees wash the outside of the
   cup and the dish, and ye think that ye are cleansed; but your inside is
   full of injustice and wickedness.

   [15, 16] [1420] Ye of little mind, did not he that made the outside
   make the inside?  [1421] Now give what ye have [1422] in alms, and
   everything shall be clean unto you.

   [17, 18] [1423] And there came to him Pharisees and scribes, come from
   Jerusalem.  [1424] And when they saw some of his disciples eating bread
   while they had not washed their hands, [19] they found fault.  [1425]
   For all of the Jews and the Pharisees, if they wash not their [20]
   hands thoroughly, eat not; for they held [1426] to the ordinance [1427]
   of the elders.  [1428] And they ate not what was bought from the
   market, except they washed it; and many other things did they keep of
   what they had received, such as the washing of cups, and [21] measures,
   and vessels of brass, and couches.  [1429] And scribes [1430] and
   Pharisees asked him, [Arabic, p. 79] Why do thy disciples not walk
   according to the ordinances of the elders, but [22] eat bread without
   washing their hands?  [1431] Jesus answered and said unto them, Why do
   ye also overstep the command of God by reason of your ordinance?  [23]
   [1432] God said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whosoever
   revileth his father and [24] his mother shall surely die.  [1433] But
   ye say, If a man say to his father or to his mother, [25] What thou
   receivest [1434] from me is an offering,-- [1435] and ye [1436] suffer
   him not to do anything [26] for his father or his mother; [1437] and ye
   [1438] make void and reject the word of God by reason of the ordinance
   that ye have ordained and commanded, such as the washing [27] of cups
   and measures, and what resembles that ye do much.  [1439] And ye
   forsook [28] the command of God, and held to the ordinance of men.
   [1440] Do [1441] ye well to wrong [1442] [29] the command of God in
   order that ye may establish your ordinance?  [1443] Ye hypocrites, well
   did Isaiah the prophet prophesy concerning you, and say,

   [30] [1444] This people honoureth me with its [1445] lips;

   But their heart is very far from me.

   [31] [1446] But in vain do they fear me,

   In that they teach the commands of men.

   [32] [1447] And Jesus called all the multitude, and said unto them,
   Hear me, all of you, and [33] understand:  [1448] nothing without the
   man, which then enters him, is able to defile him; [34] but what goeth
   out of him, that it is which defileth the man.  [1449] He that hath
   ears [35] that hear, let him hear.  [1450] Then his disciples drew
   near, and said unto him, Knowest [36] thou that the Pharisees which
   heard this word were angry?  [1451] He answered and said unto them,
   Every plant which my Father which is in heaven planted not shall be
   [37] [Arabic, p. 80] uprooted.  [1452] Let them alone; for they are
   blind leading blind.  And if the blind lead [1453] the blind, both of
   them shall fall into a hollow.

   [38] [1454] And when Jesus entered the house from the multitude, Simon
   Cephas asked him, [39] and said unto him, My Lord, explain to us that
   parable.  [1455] He said unto them, Do ye also thus not understand?
   Know ye not that everything that entereth into the [40] man from
   without cannot defile him; [1456] because it entereth not into his
   heart; it entereth into his stomach only, and thence is cast forth in
   the cleansing which maketh [41] clean all the food? [1457]   [1458] The
   thing which goeth forth from the mouth of the man proceedeth [42] from
   his heart, and it is that which defileth the man.  [1459] From within
   [1460] the [43] heart of men proceed evil thoughts, [1461] fornication,
   adultery, theft, false witness, murder, injustice, wickedness, deceit,
   stupidity, evil eye, calumny, pride, foolishness:  [44] [1462] these
   evils all of them from within proceed from the heart, and they are the
   things [45] which defile the man:  [1463] but if a man eat while he
   washeth not his hands, he is not defiled.

   [46] [1464] And Jesus went out thence, and came to the borders of Tyre
   and Sidon.  And he entered into a certain house, and desired that no
   man should know it; [1465] and [47] he could not be hid.  [1466] But
   straightway a Canaanitish woman, whose daughter had an [48, 49] unclean
   spirit, heard of him.  [1467] And that woman was a Gentile of Emesa of
   Syria.  [1468] And she came out after him, crying out, and saying, Have
   mercy upon me, my Lord, thou [50] son of David; for my daughter is
   seized in an evil way by Satan. [1469]   [1470] And he answered
   [Arabic, p. 81] her not a word.  And his disciples came and besought
   him, and said, Send [51] her away:  for she crieth after us.  [1471] He
   answered and said unto them, I was [52] not sent except to the sheep
   that are gone astray of the house of Israel.  [1472] But she came and
   worshipped him, and said, My Lord, help me, have mercy upon me.

   [53] [1473] Jesus said unto her, It is not seemly that the children's
   bread should be taken and [54] thrown to the dogs.  [1474] But she
   said, Yea, my Lord:  the dogs also eat of the crumbs [55] that fall
   from their masters' tables, and live.  [1475] Then said Jesus unto her,
   O woman, [56] great is thy faith:  it shall be unto thee as thou hast
   desired.  [1476] Go then thy way; and [57] because of this word, the
   devil is gone out of thy daughter.  [1477] And her daughter was [58]
   healed in that hour.  [1478] And that woman went away to her house, and
   found her daughter laid upon the bed, and the devil gone out of her.

   Section XXI.

   [1] [1479] And Jesus went out again from the borders of Tyre and Sidon,
   and came to the [2] sea of Galilee, towards the borders of Decapolis.
   [1480] And they brought unto him one dumb and deaf, and entreated him
   that he would lay his hand upon him and heal [3] him.  [1481] And he
   drew him away from the multitude, and went away alone, and spat [4]
   upon his fingers, and thrust them into his ears, and touched his
   tongue; [1482] and looked [5] to heaven, and sighed, and said unto him,
   Be opened.  [1483] And in that hour his ears [6] were opened, and the
   bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake with ease.  [1484] And
   Jesus charged them much that they should not tell this to any man:  but
   the more [7] he charged them, the more they increased in publishing,
   and marvelled much, [1485] and [Arabic, p. 82] said, This man doeth
   everything well:  he made the deaf to hear, and those that lacked
   speech to speak.

   [8, 9] [1486] And while he was passing through the land of Samaria,
   [1487] he came to one of the cities of the Samaritans, called Sychar,
   beside the field which Jacob gave to Joseph to [10] his son.  [1488]
   And there was there a spring of water of Jacob's.  And Jesus was
   fatigued from the exertion of the way, and sat at the spring.  And the
   time was about the [11] sixth hour. [1489] ^  [1490] And a woman of
   Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said unto [12] her, Give me
   water, that I may drink.  [1491] And his disciples had entered into the
   city [13] to buy for themselves food.  [1492] And that Samaritan woman
   said unto him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask me to give thee to
   drink, while I am a Samaritan woman?  [14] [1493] (And the Jews mingle
   not with the Samaritans. [1494] )  Jesus answered and said unto her, If
   thou knewest the gift of God, and who this is that said unto thee, Give
   me [15] to drink; thou wouldest ask him, and he would give thee the
   water of life.  [1495] That woman said unto him, My Lord, thou hast no
   bucket, and the well is deep:  from [16] whence hast thou the water of
   life?  [1496] Can it be that thou art greater than our father Jacob,
   who gave us this well, and drank from it, and his children, and his
   sheep?  [17] [1497] Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that
   drinketh of this water shall thirst [18] again:  [1498] but whosoever
   drinketh of the water which I shall give him shall not thirst for
   ever:  but the water which I shall give him shall be in him a spring of
   water springing [19] up unto eternal life.  [1499] That woman said unto
   him, My Lord, give me of this water, that [20] I may not thirst again,
   neither come and draw water from here.  [1500] Jesus said unto her,
   [21] [Arabic, p. 83] Go and call thy husband, and come hither.  [1501]
   She said unto him, I have no [22] husband.  [1502] Jesus said unto her,
   Thou saidst well, I have no husband:  five husbands hast thou had, and
   this man whom thou hast now is not thy husband; and [23] in this thou
   saidst truly.  [1503] That woman said unto him, My Lord, I perceive
   thee to [24] be a prophet.  [1504] Our fathers worshipped in this
   mountain; and ye say that in Jerusalem [25] is the place in which
   worship must be.  [1505] Jesus said unto her, Woman, believe me, an
   hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor yet in Jerusalem, shall
   ye worship [26] the Father.  [1506] Ye worship that which ye know not:
   but we worship that which [27] we know:  for salvation is of the Jews.
   [1507] But an hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
   worship the Father in spirit and truth:  and the Father also [28]
   seeketh such as these worshippers.  [1508] For God is a Spirit:  and
   they that worship him [29] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
   [1509] That woman said unto him, I know that [30] the Messiah cometh:
   [1510] and when he is come, he will teach us everything.  Jesus said
   unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.

   [31] [1511] And while he was speaking, his disciples came; and they
   wondered how he would speak [1512] with a woman; but not one of them
   said unto him, What seekest thou? or, [32] What [1513] speakest thou
   with her?  [1514] And the woman left her waterpot, and went to the [33]
   city, and said to the people, [1515] Come, and see a man who told me
   all that ever I did:  [34] perhaps then he is the Messiah.  [1516] And
   people went out from the city, and came to [35] him.  [1517] And in the
   mean while his disciples besought him, and said unto him, Our [36, 37]
   master, eat.  [1518] And he said unto them, I have food to eat that ye
   know not.  [1519] And the disciples said amongst themselves, Can any
   one have brought him aught to eat? [1520]   [38] [1521] Jesus said unto
   them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish
   [39] [Arabic, p. 84] his work.  [1522] Said ye not that after four
   months cometh the harvest? behold, I therefore say unto you, Lift up
   your eyes, and behold the lands, [40] that they have become white, and
   the harvest is already come. [1523]   [1524] And he that reapeth
   receiveth his wages, and gathereth the fruit of eternal life; [1525]
   and the sower and [41] the reaper rejoice together.  [1526] For in this
   is found the word of truth, One soweth, and [42] another reapeth.
   [1527] And I sent you to reap that in which ye have not laboured:
   others laboured, and ye have entered on their labour.

   [43] [1528] And from that city many of the Samaritans believed in him
   because of the words [44] of that woman, who testified and said, He
   told me all that ever I did.  [1529] And when those Samaritans came
   unto him, they besought him to abide with them; and he [45, 46] abode
   with them two days.  [1530] And many believed in him because of his
   word; [1531] and they said to that woman, Now not because of thy saying
   have we believed in him:  we have heard and known that this truly is
   the Messiah, the Saviour of the world.

   [47, 48] [1532] And after two days Jesus went out thence and departed
   to Galilee.  [1533] And Jesus [49] testified that a prophet is not
   honoured in his own city.  [1534] And when he came to Galilee, the
   Galilæans received him.

   Section XXII.

   [1] [1535] And when Jesus came to a certain village, there drew near to
   him a leper, and fell at his feet, and besought him, and said unto him,
   If thou wilt, thou art able to [2] cleanse me.  [1536] And Jesus had
   mercy upon him, and stretched forth his hand, and [3] touched him, and
   said, I will cleanse [1537] thee.  [1538] And immediately his leprosy
   departed [4] from him, and he was cleansed.  [1539] And he sternly
   charged him, and sent him out, [5] [Arabic, p. 85] and said unto him,
   [1540] See that thou tell not any man:  but go and shew thyself to the
   priests, and offer an offering for thy cleansing as Moses commanded [6]
   for their testimony.  [1541] But he, when he went out, began to publish
   much, and spread abroad the news, so that Jesus could not enter into
   any of the cities openly, for the extent to which the report of him
   spread, but he remained without in a desert [7] place.  [1542] And much
   people came unto him from one place and another, [1543] to hear [8] his
   word, and that they might be healed of their pains.  [1544] And he used
   to withdraw from them into the desert, and pray.

   [9] [1545] And after that, was the feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up
   to Jerusalem.

   [10] [1546] And there was in Jerusalem a place prepared for bathing,
   [1547] which was called in [11] Hebrew the House of Mercy, having five
   porches.  [1548] And there were laid in them much people of the sick,
   and blind, and lame, and paralysed, waiting for the moving [12] of the
   water.  [1549] And the angel from time to time went down into the place
   of bathing, [1550] and moved the water; and the first that went down
   after the moving [13] of the water, every pain that he had was healed.
   [1551] And a man was there who had a [14] disease for thirty-eight
   years.  [1552] And Jesus saw this man laid, and knew [1553] that he had
   [15] been thus a long time; and he said unto him, Wouldest thou be made
   whole?  [1554] That diseased one answered and said, Yea, my Lord, I
   have no man, when the water moveth, to put me into the bathing-place;
   but when I come, another goeth down before [16, 17] me.  [1555] Jesus
   said unto him, Rise, take thy bed, and walk.  [1556] And immediately
   that man was healed; and he rose, and carried his bed, and walked.

   [18] [1557] And that day was a sabbath.  And when the Jews saw that
   healed one, they [1558] said [19] unto him, It is a sabbath:  thou hast
   no authority to carry thy bed.  [1559] And he answered and said unto
   them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take thy bed, [20]
   [Arabic, p. 86] and walk.  [1560] They asked him therefore, Who is this
   man that said unto thee, [21] Take thy bed, and walk?  [1561] But he
   that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had removed from that
   place to another, because of the press of the great multitude [22]
   which was in that place.  [1562] And after two days Jesus happened upon
   him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art whole:  sin not
   again, lest there come upon [23] thee what is worse than the first.
   [1563] And that man went, and said to the Jews that it [24] was Jesus
   that had healed him.  [1564] And because of that the Jews persecuted
   Jesus and [25] sought to kill him, because he was doing this on the
   sabbath.  [1565] And Jesus said unto [26] them, My Father worketh until
   now, and I also work.  [1566] And because of this especially the Jews
   sought to kill him, not because he profaned the sabbath only; but for
   his saying also that God was his Father, and his making himself equal
   with God.  [27] [1567] Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, The Son cannot do anything of himself, but what
   he seeth the Father do; what the Father doeth, [28] that the Son also
   doeth like him.  [1568] The Father loveth his Son, and everything that
   he doeth he sheweth him:  and more than these works will he shew him,
   that ye [29] may marvel.  [1569] And as the Father raiseth the dead and
   giveth them life, so the Son [30] also giveth life to whomsoever he
   will.  [1570] And the Father judgeth no man, but hath [31] given all
   judgement unto the Son; [1571] that every man may honour the Son, as he
   honoureth the Father.  And he that honoureth not the Son honoureth not
   the Father which [32] sent him.  [1572] Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Whosoever heareth my word, and believeth in him that sent me, hath
   eternal life, and cometh not into judgement, but passeth from [33]
   [Arabic, p. 87] death unto life.  [1573] Verily, verily, I say unto
   you, An hour shall come, and now is also, when the dead shall hear the
   voice of the Son of God; and those [34] which hear shall live.  [1574]
   And as the Father hath life in himself, [1575] likewise he gave to [35]
   the Son also that he might have life in himself, [1576]   [1577] and
   authority to do judgement also, [36] because [1578] he is the Son of
   man.  [1579] Marvel not then at that:  I mean the coming of the hour
   when all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall come
   forth:  [37] [1580] those that have done good, to the resurrection of
   life; and those that have done evil deeds, to the resurrection of
   judgement.

   [38] [1581] I am not able of myself to do anything; but as I hear, I
   judge:  and my judgement [39] is just; I seek not my own will, but the
   will of him that sent me.  [1582] I [1583] bear witness [40] of myself,
   and so [1584] my witness is not true.  [1585] It is another that
   beareth witness [41] of me; and I know that the witness which he
   beareth of me is true.  [1586] Ye have sent [42] unto John, and he hath
   borne witness of the truth.  [1587] But not from man do I seek [43]
   witness; but I say that ye may live. [1588]   [1589] That [1590] was a
   lamp which shineth and [44] giveth light:  and ye were pleased to glory
   now [1591] in his light.  [1592] But I have witness greater than that
   of John:  the works which my Father hath given me to accomplish, [45]
   those works which I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent
   me.  [1593] And the Father which sent me, he hath borne witness of me.
   Ye have neither heard his [46] voice at any time, nor seen his
   appearance.  [1594] And his word abideth not in you; because [47] in
   him whom he hath sent ye do not believe.  [1595] Search the scriptures,
   in which ye rejoice [1596] [48] that ye have eternal life; [1597] and
   they bear witness of me; and ye do not wish to come to [49, 50]
   [Arabic, p. 88] me, that ye may have eternal life.  [1598] I seek not
   praise of men.  [1599] But I know [51] you, that the love of God is not
   in you.  [1600] I am come in the name of my Father, and ye received me
   not; but if another come in his own name, that one will [52] ye
   receive.  [1601] And how can ye believe, while ye receive praise one
   from another, and [53] praise from God, the One, ye seek not?  [1602]
   Can it be that ye think that I will accuse you before the Father?  Ye
   have one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom ye have [54] rejoiced.
   [1603]   [1604] If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me also; Moses
   wrote of me.  [55] [1605] And if ye believed not his writings, how
   shall ye believe my words?

   Section XXIII.

   [1] [1606] And Jesus departed thence, and came to the side of the sea
   of Galilee, and went [2] up into the mountain, and sat there.  [1607]
   And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them lame, and
   blind, and dumb, and maimed, and many others, and [3] they cast them at
   the feet of Jesus:  [1608] for they had seen all the signs which he did
   in [4] Jerusalem, when they were gathered at the feast.  [1609] And he
   healed them all.  [1610] And those multitudes marvelled when they saw
   dumb men speak, and maimed men healed, and lame men walk, and blind men
   see; and they praised the God of Israel.

   [5] [1611] And Jesus called his disciples, and said unto them, I have
   compassion on this multitude, because of their continuing with me three
   days, having nothing to eat; and to send them away fasting I am not
   willing, lest they faint in the way, [1612] some of them having [6]
   [Arabic, p. 89] come from far.  [1613] His disciples said unto him,
   Whence have we in the desert [7] bread wherewith to satisfy all this
   multitude?  [1614] Jesus said unto them, How [8] many loaves have ye?
   [1615] They said unto him, Seven, and a few small fishes.  And he [9]
   commanded the multitudes to sit down upon the ground; [1616] and he
   took those seven loaves and the fish, and blessed, and brake, and gave
   to his disciples to set before [10] them; and the disciples set before
   the multitudes.  [1617] And they all ate, and were satisfied:  and they
   took that which remained over of the fragments, seven basketfuls.  [11]
   [1618] And the people that ate were four thousand men, besides the
   women and children.  [12] [1619] And when the multitudes departed, he
   went up into the boat, and came to the borders of Magada. [1620]

   [13] [1621] And the Pharisees and Sadducees came to him, and began to
   seek a discussion with him.  And they asked him to shew them a sign
   from heaven, tempting him.  [14] [1622] And Jesus sighed within
   himself, and said, What sign seeketh this evil and adulterous
   generation?  It seeketh a sign, and it shall not be given a sign,
   except the sign [15] of Jonah the prophet.  [1623] Verily I say unto
   you, This generation shall not be given a [16] sign.  [1624] And he
   left [1625] them, and went up into the boat, and went away to that
   side.

   [17] [1626] And his disciples forgot to take with them bread, and there
   was not with them [18] in the boat, not even [1627] one loaf.  [1628]
   And Jesus charged them, and said, Take heed, and guard yourselves from
   the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, and from the [19] leaven of
   Herod.  [1629] And they reflected within themselves that they had taken
   with them [20] no bread.  [1630] And Jesus knew, and said unto them,
   Why [1631] think ye within yourselves, O ye of little faith, and are
   anxious, because ye have no bread? [1632] until now do ye not perceive,
   [21] neither understand? is your heart yet hard?  [1633] And have ye
   eyes, and yet see not? [22] [Arabic, p. 90] and have ye ears, and yet
   hear not? [1634] and do ye not remember when I brake those five loaves
   for five thousand? and how many baskets full of broken [23] pieces took
   ye [1635] up?  They said, Twelve.  [1636] He said unto them, And the
   seven also for four thousand:  how many baskets full of broken pieces
   took ye [1637] up?  They [24] said, Seven.  [1638] He said unto them,
   How have ye not understood that I spake not to you because of [1639]
   the bread, but that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
   [25] and Sadducees?  [1640] Then they understood that he spake, not
   that they should beware of the leaven of the bread, but of the doctrine
   of the Pharisees and Sadducees, which he called leaven.

   [26] [1641] And after that, he came to Bethsaida.  And they brought to
   him a certain [1642] blind [27] man, and besought him that he would
   touch him.  [1643] And he took the hand of that blind man, and led him
   out without the village, and spat in his eyes, and laid his [28] hand
   on him, [1644] and asked him, What seest thou?  [1645] And that blind
   man looked intently, [29] and said unto him, I see men as trees
   walking.  [1646] And he placed his hand [30] again on his eyes; and
   they were restored, [1647] and he saw everything clearly.  [1648] And
   he sent him to his house, and said, Do not enter even into the village,
   nor tell any man in the village.

   [31] [1649] And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, to the villages of
   Cæsarea Philippi.  [32] [1650] And while he was going in the way, and
   his disciples alone, [1651] he asked his disciples, [33] and said, What
   do men say of me that I am, the Son of man? [1652]   [1653] They said
   unto him, Some say, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others,
   Jeremiah, or one of the [34, 35] prophets.  [1654] He said unto them,
   And ye, what say ye that I am?  [1655] Simon Cephas answered [36]
   [Arabic, p. 91] and said, Thou art the Messiah, the Son of the living
   God.  [1656] Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
   son of Jonah:  flesh and [37] blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but
   my Father which is in heaven.  [1657] And I say unto thee also, that
   thou art Cephas, [1658] and on this rock will I build my church; and
   the [38] gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.  [1659] To thee
   will I give the keys of the kingdom of heaven:  and whatsoever thou
   shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and [39] whatsoever thou
   shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  [1660] And he sternly
   charged his disciples, and warned them that they should not tell any
   man concerning him, [40] that he was the Messiah.  [1661] And
   henceforth began Jesus to shew to his disciples [41] that he was
   determined [1662] to go to Jerusalem, [1663] and suffer much, and be
   rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and of the scribes,
   and be killed, and on the [42] third day rise.  [1664] And he was
   speaking [1665] plainly.  [1666] And Simon Cephas, as one grieved [43]
   for him, said, Far be thou, my Lord, from that.  [1667] And he turned,
   and looked upon [44] his disciples, and rebuked Simon, and said, [1668]
   Get thee behind me, Satan:  for thou art a stumblingblock unto me:  for
   thou thinkest not of what pertains to God, but of what pertains to men.

   [45] [1669] And Jesus called the multitudes with his disciples, and
   said unto them, Whosoever would come after me, let him deny himself,
   and take his cross every day, and [46] come after me.  [1670] And
   whosoever would save his life shall lose it; and whosoever [47] loseth
   his life for my sake, and for the sake of my gospel, shall save it.
   [1671] What shall [48] a man profit, if he gain all the world, and
   destroy [1672] his own life, [1673] or lose it? [1674] or what [49]
   [Arabic, p. 92] will a man give in ransom for his life? [1675]   [1676]
   Whosoever shall deny me and my sayings in this sinful and adulterous
   generation, the Son of man also will [50] deny him, when he cometh in
   the glory of his Father with his holy angels.  [1677] For the Son of
   man is about to [1678] come in the glory of his Father with his holy
   angels; and then shall he reward each man according to his works.

   Section XXIV.

   [1] [1679] And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There be here
   now some standing that shall not taste death, until they see the
   kingdom of God come [1680] with strength, [1681] and the Son of man who
   cometh in his kingdom.

   [2] [1682] And after six days Jesus took Simon Cephas, and James, and
   John his brother, [3] and brought them up into a high mountain, the
   three of them only.  [1683] And while they [4] were praying, Jesus
   changed, and became after the fashion of another person; [1684] and his
   face shone like the sun, and his raiment was very white like the snow,
   and as [5] the light of lightning, so that nothing on earth can whiten
   [1685] like it.  [1686] And there appeared [6] unto him Moses and
   Elijah talking to Jesus.  [1687] And they thought that the time [7] of
   his decease which was to be accomplished at Jerusalem was come.  [1688]
   And Simon and those that were with him were heavy in the drowsiness of
   sleep; and with effort they roused themselves, and saw his glory, and
   those two men that were standing with him.  [8] [Arabic, p. 93] [1689]
   And when they began to depart from him, Simon said unto Jesus, My [9]
   Master, it is good for us to be here:  [1690] and if thou wilt, we will
   make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one
   for Elijah; [1691] not knowing [10] what he said, because of the fear
   which took possession of them.  [1692] And while he [11] was yet saying
   that, a bright cloud overshadowed them.  [1693] And when they saw Moses
   [12] and Elijah that they had entered into that cloud, they feared
   again.  [1694] And a voice was heard out of the cloud, saying, This is
   my beloved Son, whom I have chosen; [13] hear ye therefore him.  [1695]
   And when this voice was heard, Jesus was found alone.  [14] [1696] And
   the disciples, when they heard the voice, fell on their faces from the
   fear which [15] took hold of them.  [1697] And Jesus came and touched
   them and said, Arise, be not [16] afraid.  [1698] And they lifted up
   their eyes, and saw Jesus as he was.

   [17] [1699] And when they went down from the mountain, Jesus charged
   them, and said unto them, Tell not what ye have seen to any man, until
   the Son of man rise from [18] among the dead.  [1700] And they kept the
   word within themselves, and told no man in [19] those days what they
   had seen.  [1701] And they reflected among themselves, What is this
   [20] word which he spake unto us, I, when I am risen from among the
   dead?  [1702] And his disciples asked him, and said, What is that which
   the scribes say, then, that Elijah [21] must first come?  [1703] He
   said unto them, Elijah cometh first to set in order everything,
   [Arabic, p. 94] and as it was written of the Son of man, that he should
   suffer many things, [22] and be rejected.  [1704] But I say unto you,
   that Elijah is come, and they knew him not, and have done unto him
   whatsoever they desired, as it was written of him.  [23, 24] [1705] In
   like manner the Son of man is to suffer of them.  [1706] Then
   understood the disciples that he spake unto them concerning John the
   Baptist.

   [25] [1707] And on that day whereon they came down from the mountain,
   there met him a multitude of many people standing with his disciples,
   and the scribes were discussing [26] with them.  [1708] And the people,
   when they saw Jesus, were perplexed, [1709] and in the [27] midst of
   their joy hastened [1710] and saluted him.  [1711] And on that day came
   certain of the Pharisees, and said unto him, Get thee out, and go
   hence; for Herod seeketh [28] to kill thee.  [1712] Jesus said unto
   them, Go ye and say to this fox, Behold, I am casting out demons, and I
   heal to-day and to-morrow, and on the third day I am perfected.  [29]
   [1713] Nevertheless I must be watchful [1714] to-day and to-morrow, and
   on the last day I shall depart; for it cannot be that a prophet perish
   outside of Jerusalem.

   [30] [1715] And after that, there came to him a man from that
   multitude, and fell upon his knees, and said unto him, I beseech thee,
   my Lord, look upon my son; [1716] he is my [31] only child:  and the
   spirit cometh upon him suddenly.  [1717] A lunacy [1718] hath come upon
   [32] him, and he meeteth with evils.  [1719] And when it cometh upon
   him, it beateth him about; [1720] [33] and he foameth, and gnasheth his
   teeth, and wasteth; [1721]   [1722] and many times it hath thrown him
   into the water and into the fire to destroy him, and it hardly leaveth
   him after [34] [Arabic, p. 95] bruising him.  [1723] And I brought him
   near to thy disciples, and they could [35] not heal him.  [1724] Jesus
   answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, till when shall
   I be with you? and till when shall I bear with you? bring thy son [36]
   hither.  [1725] And he brought him unto him:  and when the spirit saw
   him, immediately [37] it beat him about; and he fell upon the ground,
   and was raging and foaming.  [1726] And Jesus asked his father, How
   long is the time during which he hath been thus?  He [38] said unto
   him, From his youth until now.  [1727] But, my Lord, help me wherein
   thou [39] canst, and have mercy upon me.  [1728] Jesus said unto him,
   If thou canst believe!  All [40] things are possible to him that
   believeth.  [1729] And immediately the father of the child [41] cried
   out, weeping, and said, I believe, my Lord; help my lack of faith.
   [1730] And when Jesus saw the hastening of the people, and their coming
   at the sound, he rebuked that unclean spirit, and said to it, Thou dumb
   [1731] spirit that speakest not, I command [42] thee, [1732] come out
   of him, and enter not again into him.  [1733] And that spirit, devil,
   [1734] cried out much, and bruised him, and came out; and that child
   fell as one dead, and [43] many thought that he had died.  [1735] But
   Jesus took him by his hand, and raised him [44] up, and gave him to his
   father; and that child was healed from that hour.  [1736] And the
   people all marvelled at the greatness of God.

   [45] [1737] And when Jesus entered into the house, his disciples came,
   and asked him [46] privately, [1738] and said unto him, Why were we not
   able to heal him?  [1739] Jesus said unto [Arabic, p. 96] them, Because
   of your unbelief.  Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain
   of mustard seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove hence; [47] and
   it shall remove; and nothing shall overcome you.  [1740] But it is
   impossible to cast out this kind by anything except by fasting and
   prayer.

   [48] [1741] And when he went forth thence, they passed through
   Galilee:  and he would not [49] that any man should know it. [1742]
   [1743] And he taught his disciples, and said unto them, [50] [1744]
   Keep ye these sayings in your ears and your hearts:  for the Son of man
   is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and
   when he is killed, he [51] shall rise on the third day.  [1745] But
   they knew not the word which he spake unto them, for it was concealed
   from them, that they should not perceive it; and they feared to [52]
   ask him about this word.  [1746] And they were exceeding sorrowful.

   Section XXV.

   [1] [1747] And in that day this thought presented itself to his
   disciples, and they said, which [2] haply should be the greatest among
   them. [1748]   [1749] And when they came to Capernaum, and entered into
   the house, Jesus said unto them, What were ye considering in the [3]
   way among yourselves?  [1750] And they were silent because they had
   considered that matter.

   [4] [1751] And when Simon went forth without, those that received two
   dirhams for the tribute came to Cephas, and said unto him, Doth your
   master not give his two [5] dirhams?  He said unto them, Yea.  [1752]
   And when Cephas entered the house, Jesus anticipated him, and said unto
   him, What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do
   they receive custom and tribute? from their sons, or from [6] [Arabic,
   p. 97] strangers?  [1753] Simon said unto him, From strangers.  Jesus
   said unto him, Children then are free.  Simon said unto him, Yea.
   Jesus said unto him, [7] Give thou also unto them, like the stranger.
   [1754] But, lest it trouble them, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook;
   and the first fish that cometh up, open its mouth, and thou shalt find
   a stater:  take therefore that, and give for me and thee.

   [8] [1755] And in that hour came the disciples to Jesus, and said unto
   him, Who, thinkest [9] thou, is greater in the kingdom of heaven?
   [1756] And Jesus knew the thought of their heart, and called a [1757]
   child, and set him in the midst, and took him in his arms, and [10]
   said unto them, [1758] Verily I say unto you, If ye do not return, and
   become as children, [11] ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.
   [1759] Every one that shall receive in my name such as this child hath
   received me:  [1760] and whosoever receiveth me receiveth [12] not me,
   but him that sent me.  [1761] And he who is little in your company,
   [1762] the same [13] shall be great.  [1763] But whosoever shall injure
   one of these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him
   that a great millstone [1764] should be hanged about his neck, and he
   should be drowned in the depths of the sea.

   [14] [1765] John answered and said, Our Master, we saw one casting out
   devils in thy name; [15] and we prevented him, because he followed not
   thee with us.  [1766] Jesus said unto them, Prevent him not; for no man
   doeth powers in my name, and can hasten to speak evil [16, 17] of me.
   [1767] Every one who is not in opposition to you is with you.  [1768]
   Woe unto the world [Arabic, p. 98] because of trials! [1769] but woe
   unto that man by whose hand the trials come!  [18] [1770] If thy hand
   or thy foot injure thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee; for it is
   better for thee to enter into life being halt or maimed, and not that
   thou shouldest have two hands or two feet, and fall into the hell of
   fire that burneth [1771] for ever; [19, 20] [1772] where their worm
   dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.  [1773] And if thine eye
   seduce [1774] [21] thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; [1775]
   for it is better for thee to enter the kingdom of God with one eye,
   than that thou shouldest have two eyes, and fall into the [22, 23] fire
   of Gehenna; [1776] where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not
   quenched.  [1777] Every [24] one shall be salted with fire, and every
   sacrifice shall be salted with salt.  [1778] How good [25] is salt! but
   if the salt also be tasteless, wherewith shall it be salted?  [1779] It
   is fit neither for the land nor for dung, but they cast it out.  He
   that hath ears to hear, let him [26] hear.  [1780] Have ye salt in
   yourselves, and be in peace one with another.

   [27] [1781] And he arose from thence, and came to the borders of Judæa
   beyond Jordan:  and there went unto him thither great multitudes, and
   he healed them; and he taught [28] them also, according to his custom.
   [1782] And the Pharisees came unto him, tempting [29] him, and asking
   him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife?  [1783] He said, What
   [30] did Moses command you?  [1784] They said, Moses made it allowable
   for us, saying, Whosoever [31] will, let him write a writing of
   divorcement, and put away his wife.  [1785] Jesus answered and said
   unto them, [1786] Have ye not read, He that made them from the
   beginning [32] made them male and female, and said, [1787] For this
   reason shall the man leave his father [Arabic, p. 99] and his mother,
   and cleave to his wife; and they both shall be one body?  [33] [1788]
   So then they are not twain, but one body; the thing, then, which God
   hath [34] joined together, let no man put asunder.  [1789] And those
   Pharisees said unto him, Why did Moses consent [1790] that a man should
   give a writing of divorcement and put her away?  [35] [1791] Jesus said
   unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts gave you leave
   [36] to divorce your wives; but in the beginning it was not so.  [1792]
   I say unto you, Whosoever putteth away [1793] his wife without
   fornication, and marrieth another, hath exposed [37] her to adultery.
   [1794] And his disciples, when he entered the house, asked him again
   [38] about that.  [1795] And he said unto them, Every one who putteth
   away his wife, and [39] marrieth another, hath exposed her to
   adultery.  [1796] And any woman that leaveth her husband, and becometh
   another's, hath committed adultery.  [1797] And whosoever marrieth [40]
   her that is divorced hath committed adultery.  [1798] And his disciples
   said unto him, If there be between the man and the woman such a case
   [1799] as this, it is not good for [41] a man to marry.  [1800] He said
   unto them, Not every man can endure this saying, except [42] him to
   whom it is given.  [1801] There are eunuchs which from their mother's
   womb [1802] were born so; and there are eunuchs which through men
   became eunuchs; and there are eunuchs which made themselves eunuchs for
   the sake of the kingdom of heaven.  He that is able to be content, let
   him be content.

   [43] [1803] Then they brought to him children, that he should lay his
   hand upon them, and [44] pray:  and his disciples were rebuking those
   that were bringing them.  [1804] And Jesus saw, and it was distressing
   to him; and he said unto them, Suffer the children to [Arabic, p. 100]
   come unto me, and prevent them not; for those that are like these have
   [45] the kingdom of God.  [1805] Verily I say unto you, Whosoever
   receiveth not the [46] kingdom of God as this child, shall not enter
   it.  [1806] And he took them in his arms, and laid his hand upon them,
   and blessed them.

   Section XXVI.

   [1, 2] [1807] And there came unto him publicans and sinners to hear his
   word.  [1808] And the scribes and the Pharisees murmured, and said,
   This man receiveth sinners, and [3] eateth with them.  [1809] And
   Jesus, when he beheld their murmuring, spake unto them [4] this
   parable:  [1810] What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if one of
   them were lost, would not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and
   go and seek the straying one [5] till he found it?  [1811] Verily I say
   unto you, When he findeth it, he will rejoice over it [6] more than
   over the ninety-nine that went not astray; [1812] and bear it on his
   shoulders, and bring it to his house, and call his friends and
   neighbours, [1813] and say unto them, [7] Rejoice with me, since I have
   found my straying sheep.  [1814] So your Father which is in heaven
   willeth [1815] not that one of these little ones that have strayed
   should perish, [8] and he seeketh for them repentance.  [1816] I say
   unto you, Thus there shall be rejoicing in heaven over one sinner that
   repenteth, more than over ninety-nine righteous persons that do not
   need repentance.

   [9] [1817] And what woman having ten drachmas would lose one of them,
   and not light a [10] lamp, and sweep the house, and seek it with care
   till she found it; [1818] and when she found it, call her friends and
   neighbours, and say unto them, Rejoice with me, as I [11] have found my
   drachma that was lost?  [1819] I say unto you, Thus there shall be joy
   [Arabic, p. 101] before the angels of God over the one sinner that
   repenteth, more than over the ninety-nine righteous persons that do not
   need repentance.

   [12, 13] [1820] And Jesus spake unto them also another parable:  [1821]
   A man had two sons:  and the younger son said unto him, My father, give
   me my portion that belongeth to [14] me of thy goods.  [1822] And he
   divided between them his property.  And after a few days the younger
   son gathered everything that belonged to him, and went into a [15] far
   country, and there squandered his property by living prodigally.
   [1823] And when he had exhausted everything he had, there occurred a
   great dearth in that country.  [16] [1824] And when he was in want, he
   went and joined himself to one of the people of a city [17] of that
   country; and that man sent him into the field [1825] to feed the
   swine.  [1826] And he used to long to fill his belly with the carob
   that those swine were eating:  and no man [18] gave him.  [1827] And
   when he returned unto himself, he said, How many hired servants now in
   my father's house have bread enough and to spare, while I here perish
   with [19] hunger!  [1828] I will arise and go to my father's house, and
   say unto him, My father, [1829] I [20] have sinned in heaven and before
   thee, and am not worthy now to be called thy [21] son:  make me as one
   of thy hired servants.  [1830] And he arose, and came to his father.
   But his father saw him while he was at a distance, and was moved with
   compassion [22] for him, and ran, [1831] and fell on his breast, [1832]
   and kissed him.  [1833] And his son said unto him, My father, I have
   sinned in heaven and before thee, and am not worthy to be [23] called
   thy son.  [1834] His father said unto his servants, Bring forth a
   stately robe, and put [24] it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and
   put on him shoes on his feet:  [1835] and bring and [25] slay a fatted
   ox, that we may eat and make merry:  [1836] for this my son was dead,
   and is [26] [Arabic, p. 102] alive; and was lost, and is found.  [1837]
   And they began to be merry. [1838]   Now his elder son was in the
   field; and when he came and drew near to the house, [27] he heard the
   sound of many singing. [1839]   [1840] And he called one of the lads,
   and asked him [28] what this was.  [1841] He said unto him, Thy brother
   hath arrived; and thy father hath [29] slain a fatted ox, since he hath
   received him safe and sound. [1842]   [1843] And he was angry, [30] and
   would not enter; so his father went out, and besought him to enter.
   [1844] And he said to his father, How many years do I serve thee in
   bondage, and I never transgressed a commandment of thine; and thou hast
   never given me a kid, that I might [31] make merry with my friends?
   [1845] but this thy son, when he had squandered thy [32] property with
   harlots, and come, thou hast slain for him a fatted ox.  [1846] His
   father said unto him, My son, thou art at all times with me, and
   everything I have is [33] thine.  [1847] It behoveth thee to rejoice
   and make merry, since this thy brother was dead, and is alive; and was
   lost, and is found.

   [34] [1848] And he spake a parable unto his disciples:  There was a
   rich man, and he had [35] a steward; and he was accused to him that he
   had squandered his property.  [1849] So his lord called him, and said
   unto him, What is this that I hear regarding thee?  Give me the account
   of thy stewardship; for it is now impossible that thou shouldest [36]
   be a steward for me.  [1850] The steward said within himself, What
   shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh from me the stewardship?  To dig
   I am not able; and to beg [1851] I [37] am ashamed.  [1852] I know what
   I will do, that, when I go out of the stewardship, they [38] may
   receive me into their houses.  [1853] And he called one after another
   of his lord's [39] debtors, and said to the first, How much owest thou
   my lord?  [1854] He said unto him, An hundred portions [1855] of oil.
   He said unto him, Take thy writing, and sit down, and write [40]
   quickly fifty portions. [1856]   [1857] And he said to the next, And
   thou, how much owest thou my lord?  He said unto him, An hundred cors
   of wheat.  He said unto him, Take [41] [Arabic, p. 103] thy writing,
   and sit down, and write eighty cors.  [1858] And our [1859] lord
   commended the sinful steward [1860] because he had done a wise deed;
   for the children [42] of this world are wiser than the children of the
   light in this their age.  [1861] And I also say unto you, Make unto
   yourselves friends with the wealth of this unrighteousness; [1862] [43]
   so that, when it is exhausted, they may receive you into their tents
   for ever.  [1863] He who is faithful in [1864] a little is faithful
   also in much:  and he who is unrighteous in a [44] little is
   unrighteous also in much.  [1865] If then in the wealth of
   unrighteousness ye were [45] not trustworthy, who will intrust you with
   the truth? [1866]   [1867] If ye are not found faithful in what does
   not belong to you, who will give you what belongeth to you?

   Section XXVII.

   [1] [1868] Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king, who
   would make a [2] reckoning with his servants.  [1869] And when he began
   to make it, they brought to him one who [3] owed him ten talents.
   [1870]   [1871] And because he had not wherewith to pay, his lord
   ordered that he should be sold, he, and his wife, and children, and all
   that he [4] had, and payment be made.  [1872] So that servant fell down
   and worshipped him, and said unto him, My lord, have patience with me,
   and I shall pay thee everything.  [5] [1873] And the lord of that
   servant had compassion, and released him, and forgave him his [6]
   debt.  [1874] And that servant went out, and found one of his
   fellow-servants, who owed him [Arabic, p. 104] a hundred pence; [1875]
   and he took him, and dealt severely with him, and said [7] unto him,
   Give me what thou owest.  [1876] So the fellow-servant fell down at his
   [8] feet, and besought him, and said, Grant me respite, and I will pay
   thee.  [1877] And he would not; but took him, and cast him into prison,
   till he should give him his debt.  [9] [1878] And when their
   fellow-servants saw what happened, it distressed them much; and [10]
   they came and told their lord of all that had taken place.  [1879] Then
   his lord called him, and said unto him, Thou wicked servant, all that
   debt I forgave thee, because [11] thou besoughtest me:  [1880] was it
   not then incumbent on thee also to have mercy on thy [12]
   fellow-servant, as I had mercy on thee? [1881]   [1882] And his lord
   became wroth, and delivered [13] him to the scourgers, till he should
   pay all that he owed.  [1883] So shall my Father which is in heaven do
   unto you, if one forgive not his brother his wrong conduct [1884] from
   [14] his heart.  [1885] Take heed within [1886] yourselves:  if thy
   brother sin, rebuke him; and if he [15] repent, forgive him.  [1887]
   And if he act wrongly towards thee seven times in a day, and on that
   day return seven times unto thee, and say, I repent towards thee;
   forgive him.  [16] [1888] And if thy brother act wrongly towards thee,
   go and reprove him between thee and [17] him alone:  if he hear thee,
   thou hast gained thy brother.  [1889] But if he hear thee not, take
   with thee one or two, and so [1890] at the mouth of two or three every
   saying shall [18] be established.  [1891] And if he listen not to these
   also, tell the congregation; [1892] and if he listen not even to the
   congregation, let him be unto thee as a publican and a Gentile. [1893]
     [19] [1894] Verily I say unto you, All that ye bind on earth shall be
   bound in heaven:  [20] and what ye loose on earth shall be loosed in
   heaven.  [1895] I say unto you also, If two of you agree on earth to
   ask, everything shall [1896] be granted them from my Father [21]
   [Arabic, p. 105] which is in heaven.  [1897] For where two or three are
   gathered in my name, there [22] am I amongst them.  [1898] Then Cephas
   drew near to him, and said unto him, My Lord, how many times, if my
   brother act wrongly towards me, should I forgive him? [23] until seven
   times?  [1899] Jesus said unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven;
   but, Until seventy [24] times seven, seven. [1900]   [1901] And the
   servant that knoweth his lord's will, and maketh not [25] ready for him
   according to his will, shall meet with much punishment; [1902] but he
   that knoweth not, and doeth something for which he meriteth punishment,
   shall meet with slight punishment.  Every one to whom much hath been
   given, much shall be asked of him; and he that hath had much committed
   to him, much shall be [26] required at his hand.  [1903] I came to cast
   fire upon the earth; and I would that it had [27] been kindled already.
   [1904]   [1905] And I have a baptism to be baptized with, and greatly
   am [28] I straitened till it be accomplished.  [1906] See that ye
   despise not [1907] one of these little ones that believe in me.  Verily
   I say unto you, Their angels at all times see the [29] face of my
   Father which is in heaven.  [1908] The Son of man came to save the
   thing which was lost.

   [30] [1909] And after that, Jesus walked in Galilee; and he did not
   like to walk in Judæa, [31] because the Jews sought to kill him.
   [1910] And there came people who told him of [32] the Galilæans, those
   whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.  [1911] Jesus
   answered and said unto them, Do ye imagine that those Galilæans were
   sinners [33] more than all the Galilæans, so that this thing has come
   upon them?  [1912] Nay.  Verily I say unto you now, [1913] that ye
   shall all also, if ye repent not, likewise perish.  [34] [1914] Or
   perchance those eighteen on whom the palace fell in Siloam, and slew
   them, do ye imagine that they were to be condemned [1915] more than all
   the people that dwell [35] [Arabic, p. 106] in Jerusalem?  Nay.  [1916]
   Verily I say unto you, If ye do not all repent, ye shall perish like
   them.

   [36] [1917] And he spake unto them this parable:  A man had a fig tree
   planted in his vineyard; [37] and he came and sought fruit thereon, and
   found none.  [1918] So he said to the husbandman, Lo, three years do I
   come and seek fruit on this fig tree, and find [38] none:  cut it down;
   why doth it render the ground unoccupied?  [1919] The husbandman said
   unto him, My lord, leave it this year also, that I may dig about it,
   and dung [39] it; [1920] then if it bear fruit--! and if not, then cut
   it down in the coming year.

   [40] [1921] And when Jesus was teaching on the sabbath day in one of
   the synagogues, [41] there was there a woman that had a spirit of
   disease eighteen years; [1922] and she was [42] bowed down, and could
   not straighten herself at all.  [1923] And Jesus saw her, and called
   [43] her, and said unto her, Woman, be loosed from thy disease.  [1924]
   And he put his hand [44] upon her; and immediately she was
   straightened, and praised God.  [1925] And the chief [1926] of the
   synagogue answered with anger, because Jesus had healed on a sabbath,
   and said unto the multitudes, There are six days in which work ought to
   be done; [45] come in them and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
   [1927] But Jesus answered and said unto him, Ye hypocrites, doth not
   each of you on the sabbath day loose [46] his ox or his ass from the
   manger, and go and water it?  [1928] Ought not this woman, who is a
   daughter of Abraham, and whom the devil [1929] hath bound eighteen
   years, [47] to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?  [1930] And
   when he said this, they were all put to shame, those standing, who were
   opposing him: [1931]   and all the people were pleased with all the
   wonders that proceeded from his hand.

   Section XXVIII. [1932]

   [1, 2] [Arabic, p. 107] [1933] And at that time the feast of
   tabernacles of the Jews drew near.  [1934] So the brethren of Jesus
   said unto him, Remove now hence, and go to Judæa, that [3] thy
   disciples may see the deeds that thou doest.  [1935] For no man doeth a
   thing secretly [4] and wisheth to be apparent.  [1936] If thou doest
   this, shew thyself to the world.  For [5] up to this time not even the
   brethren of Jesus believed on him.  [1937] Jesus said unto them, My
   time till now has not arrived; but as for you, your time is alway
   ready.  [6] [1938] It is not possible for the world to hate you; but me
   it hateth, for I bear witness [7] against it, that its deeds are evil.
   [1939] As for you, go ye up unto this feast:  but I go [8] not up now
   to this feast; for my time has not yet been completed.  [1940] He said
   this, and remained behind in Galilee.

   [9] [1941] But when his brethren went up unto the feast, he journeyed
   from Galilee, and [10] came to the borders of Judæa, to the country
   beyond Jordan; [1942] and there came after [11] him great multitudes,
   and he healed them all there.  [1943] And he went out, and proceeded
   [12] to the feast, not openly, but as one that conceals himself.
   [1944] And the Jews sought him [13] at the feast, and said, In what
   place is this man?  [1945] And there occurred much murmuring there in
   the great multitude that came to the feast, on his account.  For [14]
   some said, He is good:  and others said, Nay, but he leadeth the people
   astray.  [1946] But no man spake of him openly for fear of the Jews.

   [15] [Arabic, p. 108] [1947] But when the days of the feast of
   tabernacles were half over, Jesus went [16] up to the temple, and
   taught.  [1948] And the Jews wondered, and said, How doth [17] this man
   know writing, [1949] seeing he hath not learned?  [1950] Jesus answered
   and said, My doctrine [1951] [18] is not mine, but his that sent me.
   [1952] Whoever wisheth to do his will understandeth my doctrine, [1953]
   whether it be from God, or whether I speak of mine own accord.  [19]
   [1954] Whosoever speaketh of his own accord seeketh praise for himself;
   but whosoever seeketh praise for him that sent him, he is true, and
   unrighteousness in his heart [20] there is none.  [1955] Did not Moses
   give you the law, and no man of you keepeth the [21] law?  [1956] Why
   seek ye to kill me?  The multitude answered and said unto him, Thou
   [22] hast demons: [1957]   who seeketh to kill thee?  [1958] Jesus
   answered and said unto them, I did [23] one deed, and ye all marvel
   because of this.  [1959] Moses hath given you circumcision (not because
   it is from Moses, but it is from the fathers); and ye on the sabbath
   [24] circumcise a man.  [1960] And if a man is circumcised on the
   sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye angry at
   me, because I healed on the sabbath [25] day the whole man?  [1961]
   Judge not with hypocrisy, but judge righteous judgement.

   [26] [1962] And some people from Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom
   they seek to slay?  [27] [1963] And lo, he discourseth with them
   openly, and they say nothing unto him.  Think [28] you that our elders
   have learned that this is the Messiah indeed?  [1964] But this man is
   [1965] known whence he is; and the Messiah, when he cometh, no man
   knoweth whence [29] he is.  [1966] So Jesus lifted up his voice as he
   taught in the temple, and said, Ye both know me, and know whence I am;
   and of my own accord am I not come, but he [30] [Arabic, p. 109] that
   sent me is true, he whom ye know not:  [1967] but I know him; for I am
   [31] from him, and he sent me.  [1968] And they sought to seize him:
   and no man [32] laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
   [1969] But many of the multitude believed on him; and they said, The
   Messiah, when he cometh, can it be that he will do more than these
   signs that this man doeth?

   [33] [1970] And a man of that multitude said unto our Lord, Teacher,
   say to my brother [34] that he divide with me the inheritance.  [1971]
   Jesus said unto him, Man, who is it that [35] appointed me over you as
   a judge and divider?  [1972] And he said unto his disciples, Take heed
   within yourselves of all inordinate desire; for it is not in abundance
   of [36] possessions that life shall be.  [1973] And he gave them this
   parable:  The ground of a [37] rich man brought forth abundant
   produce:  [1974] and he pondered within himself, and [38] said, What
   shall I do, since I have no place to store my produce?  [1975] And he
   said, I will do this:  I will pull down the buildings of my barns, and
   build them, and make [39] them greater; and store there all my wheat
   and my goods.  [1976] And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much
   goods laid by for many years; take thine ease, eat, [40] drink, enjoy
   thyself.  [1977] God said unto him, O thou of little intelligence, this
   night shall thy soul be taken from thee; and this that thou hast
   prepared, whose shall it [41] be?  [1978] So is he that layeth up
   treasures for himself, and is not rich in God.

   [42] [1979] And while Jesus was going in the way, there came near to
   him a young man [1980] of the rulers, [1981] and fell on his knees, and
   asked him, and said, Good Teacher, what is [43] it that I must do that
   I may have eternal life?  [1982] Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou
   [44] me good, while there is none good but the one, even God? [1983]
   [1984] Thou knowest the commandments. [1985]   [45] [1986] If thou
   wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments. [1987]   The young
   [Arabic, p. 110] man said unto him, Which of the commandments? [1988]
   Jesus said unto him, [46] [1989] Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou
   shalt not steal, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not bear false
   witness, Thou shalt not do injury, Honour thy father [47] and thy
   mother:  and, Love thy neighbour as thyself.  [1990] That young man
   said unto [48] him, All these have I kept from my youth:  what then is
   it that I lack?  [1991] And Jesus [49] looked intently at him, and
   loved him, and said unto him, [1992] If thou wouldest be perfect, what
   thou lackest is one thing: [1993]   go away and sell everything that
   thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
   heaven:  and take thy [50] cross, and follow me.  [1994] And that young
   man frowned at this word, and went away [51] feeling sad; for he was
   very rich.   [1995] And when Jesus saw his sadness, he looked towards
   his disciples, and said unto them, How hard it is for them that have
   possessions to enter the kingdom of God!

   Section XXIX.

   [1] [1996] Verily I say unto you, It is difficult for a rich man to
   enter the kingdom of [2] heaven.  [1997] And I say unto you also, that
   it is easier for a camel to enter the eye of [3] a needle, than for a
   rich man to enter the kingdom of God.  [1998] And the disciples were
   wondering at these sayings.  And Jesus answered and said unto them
   again, My children, how hard it is for those that rely on their
   possessions to enter the [4] kingdom of God!  [1999] And those that
   were listening wondered more, and said amongst [5] themselves, being
   agitated, [2000] Who, thinkest thou, can be saved?  [2001] And Jesus
   looked at them intently, and said unto them, With men this is not
   possible, but with God it is:  [6] [Arabic, p. 111] it is possible for
   God to do everything.  [2002] Simon Cephas said unto him, Lo, we have
   left everything, and followed thee; what is it, thinkest thou, that we
   [7] shall have?  [2003] Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, Ye
   that have followed me, in the new world, when the Son of man shall sit
   on the throne of his glory, ye also [8] shall sit on twelve thrones,
   and shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel.  [2004] Verily I say unto
   you, No man leaveth houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or
   mother, or wife, or children, or kinsfolk, or lands, because of the
   kingdom of God, or for [9] my sake, and the sake of my gospel, [2005]
   who shall not obtain [2006] many times as much in this [10] time, and
   in the world to come inherit eternal life:  [2007] and now in this
   time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and
   lands, with persecution; [11] and in the world to come everlasting
   life.  [2008] Many that are first shall be last, [2009] and that are
   last shall be first.

   [12] [2010] And when the Pharisees heard all this, because of their
   love for wealth they [13] scoffed at him.  [2011] And Jesus knew what
   was in their hearts, and said unto them, Ye are they that justify
   yourselves before men; while God knows your hearts:  the thing that is
   lofty with men is base before God.

   [14] [2012] And he began to say, A certain man was rich, and wore silk
   and purple, and enjoyed [15] himself every day in splendour:  [2013]
   and there was a poor man named Lazarus, and [16] he was cast down at
   the door of the rich man, [2014] afflicted with sores, and he longed to
   fill [Arabic, p. 112] his belly with the crumbs that fell from the
   table of that rich man; yea, [17] even [2015] the dogs used to come and
   lick his sores.  [2016] And it happened that that poor man died, and
   the angels conveyed him into the bosom of Abraham:  and the [18] rich
   man also died, and was buried.  [2017] And while he was being tormented
   in Hades, [19] he lifted up his eyes from afar, and saw Abraham with
   [2018] Lazarus in his bosom.  [2019] And he called with a loud voice,
   and said, My father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to
   wet the tip of his finger with water, and moisten my tongue [20] for
   me; for, behold, I am burned in this flame.  [2020] Abraham said unto
   him, My son, remember that thou receivedst thy good things in thy life,
   and Lazarus his afflictions:  [21] but now, behold, he is at rest here,
   and thou art tormented.  [2021] And in addition to all this, there is
   between us and you a great abyss placed, so that they that would cross
   unto you from hence cannot, nor yet from thence do they cross unto [22]
   us.  [2022] He said unto him, Then I beseech thee, my father, to send
   him to my father's [23] house; [2023] for I have five brethren; let him
   go, that they also sin not, [2024] and come to [24] the abode of this
   torment. [2025]   [2026] Abraham said unto him, They have Moses and the
   [25] prophets; let them hear them.  [2027] He said unto him, Nay,
   [2028] my father Abraham:  but [26] let a man from the dead go unto
   them, and they will repent.  [2029] Abraham said unto him, If they
   listen neither to Moses nor to the prophets, neither if a man from the
   dead rose would they believe him.

   [27] [2030] The kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a householder,
   which went out early [28] in the morning to hire labourers for his
   vineyard.  [2031] And he agreed with the labourers on [29] one penny a
   day for each labourer, and he sent them into his vineyard.  [2032] And
   he went [30] [Arabic, p. 113] out in three hours, and saw others
   standing in the market idle.  [2033] He said unto them, Go ye also into
   my vineyard, and what is right I will pay you.  [31] [2034] And they
   went.  And he went out also at the sixth and the ninth hour, and did
   likewise, [32] and sent them.  [2035] And about the eleventh hour he
   went out, and found others standing idle.  He said unto them, Why are
   ye standing the whole day idle?  [33] [2036] They said unto him,
   Because no one hath hired us.  He said unto them, Go ye [34] also into
   the vineyard, and what is right ye shall receive.  [2037] So when
   evening came, the lord of the vineyard said unto his steward, Call the
   labourers, and pay them [35] their wages; and begin with the later
   ones, and end with the former ones.  [2038] And [36] those of eleven
   hours [2039] came, and received each a penny.  [2040] When therefore
   the first came, they supposed that they should receive something more;
   and they also [37] received each a penny.  [2041] And when they
   received it, they spake angrily against the [38] householder, and said,
   [2042] These last worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal [39]
   with us, who have suffered the heat of the day, and its burden.  [2043]
   He answered and said unto one of them, My friend, I do thee no wrong:
   was it not for a penny that [40] thou didst bargain with me?  [2044]
   Take what is thine, and go thy way; for I wish to [41] give this last
   as I have given thee.  [2045] Or am I not entitled to do with what is
   mine [2046] [42] what I choose?  [2047] Or is thine eye perchance evil,
   because I am good?  Thus shall the last ones be first, and the first
   last.  The called are many, and the chosen are few.

   [43] [2048] And when Jesus entered into the house of one of the chiefs
   of the Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, and they were
   watching him to see what he would [44, 45] do, [2049] and there was
   before him a man which had the dropsy, [2050] Jesus answered and [46]
   said unto the scribes and the Pharisees, Is it lawful on the sabbath to
   heal?  [2051] But [Arabic, p. 114] they were silent.  So he took him,
   and healed him, and sent him away.  [47] [2052] And he said unto them,
   Which of you shall have his son or his ox fall on the sabbath day into
   a well, and not lift him up straightway, and draw water for [48] him?
   [2053] And they were not able to answer him a word to that.

   Section XXX.

   [1] [2054] And he spake a parable unto those which were bidden there,
   because he saw [2] them choose the places that were in the highest part
   of the sitting room:  [2055] When a man invites thee to a feast, do not
   go and sit at the head of the room; lest there [3] be there a man more
   honourable than thou, [2056] and he that invited you come and say unto
   thee, Give the place to this man:  and thou be ashamed when thou risest
   and [4] takest [2057] another place.  [2058] But when thou art invited,
   go and sit last; so that when he that invited thee cometh, he may say
   unto thee, My friend, go up higher:  and [5] thou shalt have praise
   before all that were invited with thee.  [2059] For every one that
   exalteth himself shall be abased; and every one that abaseth himself
   shall be exalted.

   [6] [2060] And he said also to him that had invited him, When thou
   makest a feast [2061] or a banquet, [2062] do not invite thy friends,
   nor even thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, nor thy [7] rich neighbours;
   lest haply they also invite thee, and thou have this reward.  [2063]
   But when thou makest a feast, invite the poor, and those with withered
   hand, and the [8] lame, and the blind:  [2064] and blessed art thou,
   since they have not the means to reward [9] thee; that thy reward may
   be at the rising of the righteous.  [2065] And when one of them that
   were invited heard that, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat
   bread in the kingdom of God.

   [10, 11] [2066] Jesus answered again in parables, and said, [2067] The
   kingdom of heaven hath been likened [Arabic, p. 115] to [2068] a
   certain king, which made a feast [2069] for his son, and prepared a
   [12] great banquet, [2070] and invited many:  and he sent his servants
   at the time of the feast to inform them that were invited, [2071]
   Everything is made ready for you; come.  And [13] they would not come,
   but began all of them with one voice to make excuse.  [2072] And the
   first said unto them, Say to him, I have bought a field, and I must
   needs go out [14] to see it:  [2073] I pray thee to release [2074] me,
   for I ask to be excused.  And another said, I have bought five yoke of
   oxen, and I am going to examine them:  I pray thee [15] to release me,
   for I ask to be excused.  [2075] And another said, I have married a
   wife, [16] and therefore I cannot come.  [2076] And the king sent also
   other servants, and said, Say to those that were invited, that my feast
   is ready, and my oxen and my fatlings are [17] slain, and everything is
   ready:  come to the feast.  [2077] But they made light of it, and [18]
   went, one to his field, and another to his merchandise:  [2078] and the
   rest took his [19] servants, and entreated them shamefully, and killed
   them.  [2079] And one of the servants [20] came, and informed his lord
   of what had happened.  [2080] And when the king heard, he became angry,
   and sent his armies; and they destroyed those murderers, and [21]
   burned their cities.  [2081] Then he said to his servants, The feast is
   prepared, but those [22] that were invited were not worthy.  [2082] Go
   out quickly into the markets and into the partings of the ways of the
   city, and bring in hither the poor, and those with pains, and the lame,
   and the blind.  And the servants did as the king commanded them.  [23]
   [2083] And they came, and said unto him, Our lord, we have done all
   that thou commandedst [24] us, and there is here still room.  [2084] So
   the lord said unto his servants, Go out into the roads, and the ways,
   and the paths, and every one that ye find, invite [25] [Arabic, p. 116]
   to the feast, and constrain them to enter, till my house is [2085]
   filled.  [2086] I say unto you, that no one of those people that were
   invited shall taste of my feast.  [26] [2087] And those servants went
   out into the roads, and gathered all that they found, good and [27]
   bad:  and the banquet-house was filled with guests.  [2088] And the
   king entered to see those [28] who were seated, and he saw there a man
   not wearing a festive garment:  [2089] and he said unto him, My friend,
   how didst thou come in here not having on festive garments?  [29]
   [2090] And he was silent.  Then the king said to the servants, Bind his
   hands and his feet, and put him forth into the outer darkness; there
   shall be weeping and [30] gnashing of teeth.  [2091] The called are
   many; and the chosen, few.

   [31] [2092] And after that, the time of the feast of unleavened bread
   of the Jews arrived, [32] and Jesus went out to go to Jerusalem.
   [2093] And as he went in the way, there met him [33] ten persons who
   were lepers, and stood afar off:  [2094] and they lifted up their
   voice, and [34] said, Our Master, Jesus, have mercy upon us.  [2095]
   And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and shew yourselves unto
   the priests.  And when they went, they [35] were cleansed.  [2096] And
   one of them, when he saw himself cleansed, returned, and [36] was
   praising God with a loud voice; [2097] and he fell on his face before
   the feet of [37] Jesus, giving him thanks:  and this man was a
   Samaritan.  [2098] Jesus answered and said, [38] Were not those that
   were cleansed ten? where then are the nine?  [2099] Not one of them
   turned aside to come and praise God, but this man who is of a strange
   [39] people.  [2100] He said unto him, Arise, and go thy way; for thy
   faith hath given thee life. [2101]

   [40] [2102] And while they were going up in the way to Jerusalem, Jesus
   went in front of them; and they wondered, and followed him fearing.
   And he took his twelve disciples apart, [41] and began to tell them
   privately [2103] what was about to befall him.  [2104] And he said unto
   [Arabic, p. 117] them, We are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things
   shall be fulfilled [42] that are written in the prophets concerning the
   Son of man.  [2105] He shall be delivered to the chief priests and the
   scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, [43] and deliver him to
   the peoples; [2106]   [2107] and they shall treat him shamefully, and
   scourge [44] him, and spit in his face, and humble him, [2108] and
   crucify him, and slay him:  [2109] and on [45] the third day he shall
   rise.  [2110] But they understood not one thing of this; but this word
   was hidden from them, and they did not perceive these things that were
   addressed to them.

   [46] [2111] Then came near to him the mother of the (two) sons of
   Zebedee, she and her (two) sons, and worshipped him, and asked of him a
   certain thing.  [2112] And he said [47] unto her, What wouldest thou?
   [2113] And James and John, her two sons, came forward, and said unto
   him, Teacher, we would that all that we ask thou wouldest [48] do unto
   us.  [2114] He said unto them, [2115] What would ye that I should do
   unto you?  [49] [2116] They said unto him, Grant us that we may sit,
   the one on thy right, and the other [50] on thy left, in thy kingdom
   and thy glory.  [2117] And Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye
   ask.  Are ye able to drink the cup that I am to drink? and with the
   [51] baptism that I am to be baptized with, will ye be baptized?
   [2118] And they said unto him, We are able.  Jesus said unto them, The
   cup that I drink ye shall drink; and [52] with the baptism wherewith I
   am baptized ye shall be baptized:  [2119] but that ye should sit on my
   right and on my left is not mine to give; but it is for him for whom my
   Father hath prepared it.

   [1] [2120] And when the ten heard, they were moved with anger against
   James and John.  [2] [2121] And Jesus called them, and said unto them,
   Ye know that the rulers of the nations [3] are their lords; and their
   great men are set in authority over them.  [2122] Not thus shall it
   [Arabic, p. 118] be amongst you:  but he amongst you that would be
   great, let him be to you a [4] servant; [2123] and whoever of you would
   be first, [2124] let him be to every man a [5] bond-servant:  [2125]
   even as the Son of man also came not to be served, but to serve, and
   [6] to give himself a ransom in place of the many.  [2126] He said
   this, and was going about [7] the villages and the cities, and
   teaching; and he went to Jerusalem.  [2127] And a man asked him, Are
   those that shall be saved few?  Jesus answered and said unto [8] them,
   Strive ye to enter at the narrow door:  [2128] I say unto you now, that
   many shall [9] seek to enter, and shall not be able [2129] -- [2130]
   from the time when the master of the house riseth, and closeth the
   door, and ye shall be standing without, and shall knock at the door,
   and shall begin to say, Our lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and
   [10] say, I say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:  [2131] and ye
   shall begin to say, [11] Before thee we did eat and drink, and in our
   markets didst thou teach; [2132] and he shall say unto you, I know you
   not whence ye are; depart [2133] from me, ye servants [12] of untruth.
   [2134] There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye see
   Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of
   God, while ye are [13] put forth without.  [2135] And they shall come
   from the east and the west, and from the [14] north and the south, and
   shall sit down in the kingdom of God.  [2136] And there shall then be
   last that have become first, and first that have become last.

   [15, 16] [2137] And when Jesus entered and passed through Jericho,
   [2138] there was a man named Zacchæus, [17] rich, and chief of the
   publicans.  [2139] And he desired to see Jesus who he was; and he was
   not able for the pressure of the crowd, because Zacchæus was little of
   stature.  [18] [Arabic, p. 119] [2140] And he hastened, and went before
   Jesus, and went up into an unripe fig [19] tree [2141] to see Jesus:
   for he was to pass thus.  [2142] And when Jesus came to that place, he
   saw him, and said unto him, Make haste, and come down, Zacchæus:  [20]
   to-day I must be in thy house.  [2143] And he hastened, and came down,
   and received [21] him joyfully.  [2144] And when they all saw, they
   murmured, and said, He hath gone in [22] and lodged with a man that is
   a sinner.  [2145] So Zacchæus stood, and said unto Jesus, My Lord, now
   half of my possessions I give to the poor, and what I have unjustly
   [23] taken [2146] from every man I give him fourfold.  [2147] Jesus
   said unto him, Today is salvation [24] come to this house, because this
   man also is a [2148] son of Abraham.  [2149] For the Son of man came to
   seek and save the thing that was lost.

   [25] [2150] And when Jesus went out of Jericho, he and his disciples,
   there came after him [26] a great multitude.  [2151] And there was a
   blind man sitting by the way side begging.  [27] [2152] And his name
   was Timæus, the son of Timæus.  And he heard the sound of the [28]
   multitude passing, and asked, Who is this?  [2153] They said unto him,
   Jesus the Nazarene [29] passeth by.  [2154] And when he heard that it
   was Jesus, he called out with a loud [30] voice, and said, Jesus, son
   of David, have mercy on me.  [2155] And those that went before Jesus
   were rebuking him, that he should hold his peace:  [2156] but he cried
   the [31] more, and said, Son of David, have mercy on me.  [2157] And
   Jesus stood, and commanded that they should call him.  And they called
   the blind man, and said unto [32] him, Be of good courage, and rise;
   for, behold, he calleth thee.  [2158] And the blind [33] man threw away
   his garment, and rose, and came to Jesus.  [2159] Jesus said unto him,
   What dost thou wish that I should do unto thee?  And that blind man
   said unto him, My Lord and Master, that my eyes may be opened, so that
   I may see thee. [2160]   [34] [Arabic, p. 120] [2161] And Jesus had
   compassion on him, and touched his eyes, and said unto [35] him, See;
   for thy faith hath saved thee.  [2162] And immediately he received his
   sight, [2163] and came after him, and praised God; and all the people
   that saw praised God.

   [36] [2164] And he spake a parable because he was nearing [2165]
   Jerusalem, and they supposed [37] that at that time the kingdom of God
   was about to appear.  [2166] He said unto them, A man, a son of a great
   race, went into a far country, to receive a kingdom, and [38] return.
   [2167] And he called his ten servants, and gave them ten shares, and
   said unto [39] them, Trade till the time of my coming.  [2168] But the
   people of his city hated him, and [40] sent messengers after him, and
   said, We will not that this man reign over us.  [2169] And when he had
   received a [2170] kingdom, and returned, he said that the servants to
   whom he had given the money should be called unto him, that he might
   know what each [41] of them had traded.  [2171] And the first came, and
   said, My lord, thy share hath gained [42] ten shares. [2172]   The king
   said unto him, Thou good and faithful servant, who hast [43] been found
   faithful in a little, be thou set over ten districts.  [2173] And the
   second came, [44] and said, My lord, thy portion hath gained five
   portions.  [2174] And he said unto him [45] also, And thou shalt be set
   over five districts.  [2175] And another came, and said, My [46] lord,
   here is thy portion, which was with me laid by in a napkin:  [2176] I
   feared thee, because thou art a hard man, and takest what thou didst
   not leave, and seekest [47] what thou didst not give, and reapest what
   thou didst not sow.  [2177] His lord said unto him, From thy mouth
   shall I judge thee, thou wicked and idle servant, who wast
   untrustworthy.  Thou knewest that I am a hard man, and take what I did
   not [48] leave, and reap what I did not sow:  [2178] why didst thou not
   put my money at usury, [49] and so I might come and seek it, with its
   gains?  [2179] And he said unto those that were standing in front of
   him, Take from him the share, and give it to him that hath [50, 51]
   [Arabic, p. 121] ten shares.  [2180] They said unto him, Our lord, he
   hath ten shares.  [2181] He said unto them, I say unto you, Every one
   that hath shall be given unto; and [52] he that hath not, that which he
   hath also shall be taken from him.  [2182] And those mine enemies who
   would not that I should reign over them, bring them, and slay them
   before me.

   Section XXXII.

   [1] [2183] And when Jesus entered Jerusalem, he went up to the temple
   of God, and found [2] there oxen and sheep and doves.  [2184] And when
   he beheld those that sold and those that bought, and the money-changers
   sitting, [2185] he made for himself a scourge of rope, and drove them
   all out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and the
   money-changers; [2186] and he threw down their money, and upset their
   tables, and the seats of [3] them that sold the doves; [2187] and he
   was teaching, and saying unto them, Is it not written, My house is a
   house of prayer for all peoples? and ye have made it a den [4] for
   robbers.  [2188] And he said unto those that sold the doves, Take this
   hence, and [5] make not my Father's house a house of merchandise.
   [2189] And he suffered not any [6] one to carry vessels inside the
   temple.  [2190] And his disciples remembered the scripture, [7] The
   zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.  [2191] The Jews answered and said
   unto him, [8] What sign hast thou shewn us, that thou doest this?
   [2192] Jesus answered and said unto [9] them, Destroy this temple, and
   I shall raise it in three days.  [2193] The Jews said unto him, This
   temple was built in forty-six years, and wilt thou raise it in three
   days?  [10] [2194] But he spake unto them of the temple of his body,
   that when [2195] they destroyed it, he [11] [Arabic, p. 122] would
   raise it in three days.  [2196] When therefore he rose from among the
   dead, his disciples remembered that he said this; and they believed the
   scriptures, and the word that Jesus spake.

   [12] [2197] And when Jesus sat down over against the treasury, he
   observed how the multitudes were casting their offerings into the
   treasury:  and many rich men were [13, 14] throwing in much.  [2198]
   And there came a poor widow, and cast in two mites.  [2199] And Jesus
   called his disciples, and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, This
   poor [15] widow cast into the treasury more than all the people:
   [2200] and all of these cast into the place of the offering of God
   [2201] of the superfluity of their wealth; while this woman of her want
   threw in all that she possessed.

   [16] [2202] And he spake unto them this parable, concerning people who
   trusted in themselves [17] that they are righteous, and despised every
   man:  [2203] Two men went up to the [18] temple to pray; one of them a
   Pharisee, and the other a publican.  [2204] And the Pharisee stood
   apart, [2205] and prayed thus, O Lord, I thank thee, since I am not
   like the rest of men, the unjust, the profligate, the extortioners, or
   even like this publican; [19] [2206] but I fast two days a week, and
   tithe all my possessions. [2207]   [2208] And the publican was [20]
   standing at a distance, and he would not even lift up his eyes to
   heaven, but was [21] beating upon his breast, and saying, O Lord, have
   mercy on me, me the sinner.  [2209] I say unto you, that this man went
   down justified to his house more than the Pharisee.  Every one that
   exalteth himself shall be abased; and every one that abaseth himself
   shall be exalted.

   [22] [Arabic, p. 123] [2210] And when eventide was come, he left all
   the people, and went outside the [23] city to Bethany, he and his
   twelve, and he remained there.  [2211] And all the people, because they
   knew the place, came to him, and he received them; and them that [24]
   had need of healing he healed.  [2212] And on the morning of the next
   day, when he returned [25] to the city from Bethany, he hungered.
   [2213] And he saw a [2214] fig tree at a distance on the beaten
   highway, having on it leaves.  And he came unto it, expecting to find
   something on it; and when he came, he found nothing on it but the
   leaves--it [2215] was not [26] the season of figs-- [2216] and he said
   unto it, Henceforward for ever let no man eat fruit of thee. And his
   disciples heard.

   [27] [2217] And they came to Jerusalem.  And there was there a man of
   the Pharisees, [28] named Nicodemus, ruler of the Jews.  [2218] This
   man came unto Jesus by night, and said unto him, My Master, we know
   that thou hast been sent from God as a teacher; and no man can do these
   signs that thou doest, except him whom God is [29] with.  [2219] Jesus
   answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, If a man
   [30] be not born a second time, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
   [2220] Nicodemus said unto him, How can a man who is old be born? can
   he, think you, return again to [31] his mother's womb a second time, to
   enter and be born?  [2221] Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily,
   verily, I say unto thee, If a man be not born of water and the Spirit,
   [32] he cannot enter the kingdom of God.  [2222] For he that is born of
   flesh is flesh; and he that [33] is born of Spirit is spirit.  [2223]
   Wonder not that I said unto thee that ye must be born a [34] [Arabic,
   p. 124] second time.  [2224] The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
   thou hearest its voice, but thou knowest not from what place it cometh,
   nor whither it goeth:  so [35] is every man that is born of the
   Spirit.  [2225] Nicodemus answered and said unto him, [36] How can that
   be?  [2226] Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou teaching [2227]
   Israel, [37] and yet knowest not these things?  [2228] Verily, verily,
   I say unto thee, What we know [38] we say, and what we have seen we
   witness:  and ye receive not our witness.  [2229] If I said unto you
   what is on earth, and ye believed not, how then, if I say unto you [39]
   what is in heaven, will ye believe?  [2230] And no man hath ascended up
   into heaven, except him that descended from heaven, the Son of man,
   which is in heaven.  [40] [2231] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in
   the wilderness, so is the Son of man to be [41] lifted up; [2232] so
   that every man who may believe in him may not perish, but have [42]
   eternal life.  [2233] God so loved the world, that [2234] he should
   give his only Son; and so every one that believeth on him should not
   perish, but should have eternal life.  [43] [2235] God sent not his Son
   into the world to judge the world; but that the world might [44] be
   saved by his hand.  [2236] He that believeth in him shall not be
   judged:  but he that believeth not is condemned beforehand, because he
   hath not believed in the name [45] of the only Son, the Son of God.
   [2237]   [2238] This is the judgement, that the light came into the
   world, and men loved the darkness more than the light; because their
   deeds [46] were evil.  [2239] Whosoever doeth evil deeds hateth the
   light, and cometh not to the [47] light, lest his deeds be reproved.
   [2240] But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his deeds
   may be known, that they have been done in God.

   Section XXXIII.

   [1] [Arabic, p. 125] [2241] And when evening came, Jesus went forth
   outside of the city, he and his [2] disciples.  [2242] And as they
   passed in the morning, the disciples saw that fig tree [3] withered
   away from its root.  [2243] And they passed by, and said, How did the
   fig tree dry [4] up immediately?  [2244] And Simon remembered, and said
   unto him, My Master, behold, [5] that fig tree which thou didst curse
   hath dried up.  [2245] And Jesus answered and said [6] unto them, Let
   there be in you the faith of God.  [2246] Verily I say unto you, if ye
   believe, and doubt not in your hearts, and assure yourselves that that
   will be which [7] ye say, ye shall have what ye say.  [2247] And if ye
   say to this mountain, Remove, and [8] fall [2248] into the sea, it
   shall be.  [2249] And all that ye ask God in prayer, and believe, he
   [9, 10] will give you.  [2250] And the apostles [2251] said unto our
   Lord, Increase our [2252] faith.  [2253] He said unto them, If there be
   in you faith like a grain of mustard, ye shall say to this fig tree, Be
   thou torn up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it will obey you.
   [11] [2254] Who of you hath a servant driving a yoke of oxen or tending
   sheep, and if he [12] come from the field, will say unto him
   straightway, Go and sit down?  [2255] Nay, [2256] he will say unto him,
   Make ready for me wherewith I may sup, and gird thy waist, and serve
   me, till I eat and drink; and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink
   also.  [13] [2257] Doth that servant haply, who did what he was bid,
   receive his praise?  I think [14] not.  [2258] So ye also, when ye have
   done all that ye were bid, say, We are idle servants; what it was our
   duty to do, we have done.

   [15] [2259] For this reason I say unto you, Whatever ye pray and ask,
   believe that ye [16] [Arabic, p. 126] receive, and ye shall have.
   [2260] And when ye stand to pray, forgive what is in your heart against
   any man; and your Father which is in heaven will [17] forgive you also
   your wrong-doings.  [2261] But if ye forgive not men their
   wrong-doings, neither will your Father forgive you also your
   wrong-doings.

   [18] [2262] And he spake unto them a parable also, that they should
   pray at all times, and [19] not be slothful:  [2263] There was a judge
   in a city, who feared not God, nor was ashamed [20] for men:  [2264]
   and there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, and said,
   [21] Avenge me of mine adversary.  [2265] And he would not for a long
   time:  but afterwards he said within himself, If of God I have no fear,
   and before men I have no shame; [22] [2266] yet because this widow
   vexeth me, I will avenge her, that she come not at all times [23, 24]
   and annoy me.  [2267] And our Lord said, Hear ye what the judge of
   injustice said.  [2268] And shall not God still more do vengeance for
   his elect, who call upon him in the night [25] and in the day, and
   grant them respite?  [2269] I say unto you, He will do vengeance for
   them speedily. Thinkest thou the Son of man will come and find faith on
   the earth?

   [26, 27] [2270] And they came again to Jerusalem.  [2271] And it came
   to pass, on one of the days, as Jesus was walking in the temple, and
   teaching the people, and preaching the [28] gospel, [2272] that the
   chief priests and the scribes with the elders came upon him, and said
   unto him, Tell us:  [2273] By what power doest thou this? and who gave
   thee this [29] power to do that?  [2274] And Jesus said unto them, I
   also will ask you one word, and if [30] ye tell me, I also shall tell
   you by what power I do that.  [2275] The baptism of John, from [31]
   what place is it? from heaven or of men?  [2276] Tell me.  [2277] And
   they reflected within themselves, [Arabic, p. 127] and said, If we
   shall say unto him, From heaven; he will say unto [32] us, For what
   reason did ye not believe him?  [2278] But [2279] if we shall say, Of
   men; [33] we fear [2280] that the people will stone us, all of them.
   [2281] And all of them were holding [2282] [34] to John, that he was a
   true prophet.  [2283] They answered and said unto him, We know [35]
   not.  [2284] Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you also by what
   power I work.  What think ye?  A man had two sons; and he went to the
   first, and said unto him, My [36] son, go to-day, and till in the
   vineyard.  [2285] And he answered and said, I do not wish [37] to:  but
   finally he repented, and went.  [2286] And he went to the other, and
   said unto [38] him likewise.  [2287] And he answered and said, Yea, my
   lord:  and went not.  Which of these two did the will of his father?
   They said unto him, The first.  Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto
   you, The publicans and harlots go before you into [39] the kingdom of
   God.  [2288] John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
   believed him not; but the publicans and harlots believed him; and ye,
   not even when ye saw, did ye repent at last, that ye might believe in
   him.

   [40] [2289] Hear another parable:  A man was a householder, and planted
   a vineyard, and surrounded it with a hedge, and digged in it a
   winepress, and built in it a tower, [41, 42] [2290] and gave it to
   husbandmen, and went to a distance for a long time.  [2291] So when the
   time of the fruits came, he sent his servants [2292] unto the
   husbandmen, that they might [43] send him of the produce [2293] of his
   vineyard.  [2294] And those husbandmen beat him, and [44] sent him away
   empty.  [2295] And he sent unto them another servant also; and they
   [45] stoned him, and wounded [2296] him, and sent him away with
   shameful handling.  [2297] And he sent again another; and they slew
   him.  And he sent many other servants unto [46] them.  [2298] And the
   husbandmen took his servants, and one they beat, and another they [47]
   stoned, and another they slew.  [2299] So he sent again other servants
   more than the first; and [48] [Arabic, p. 128] they did likewise with
   them.  [2300] So the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do?  I
   will send my beloved son:  it may be they will see him and be [49, 50]
   ashamed.  [2301] So at last he sent unto them his beloved son that he
   had.  [2302] But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said amongst
   themselves, This is the heir.  [51, 52] [2303] And they said, We will
   slay him, and so the inheritance will be ours.  [2304] So they took
   [53] him, and put him forth without the vineyard, and slew him.  [2305]
   When then the lord [54] of the vineyard shall come, what will he do
   with those husbandmen?  [2306] They said unto him, He will destroy them
   in the worst of ways, [2307] and give the vineyard to [55] other
   husbandmen, who will give him fruit in its season.  [2308] Jesus said
   unto them, Have ye never read in the scripture,

   The stone which the builders declared to be base,

   [2309] The same came to be at the head of the corner:

   [56] [2310] From God was this,

   And it is wonderful in our eyes?

   [57] [2311] Therefore I say unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
   from you, and [58] given to a people that will produce fruit.  [2312]
   And whosoever falleth on this stone shall be broken in pieces:  but on
   whomsoever it falleth, it will grind him to [59] powder.  [2313] And
   when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they [60]
   perceived that it was concerning them he spake.  [2314] And they sought
   to seize him; and they feared the multitude, because they were holding
   to him as the prophet.

   Section XXXIV.

   [1] [2315] Then went the Pharisees and considered how they might
   ensnare him in a word, [2] and deliver him into the power of the judge,
   [2316] and into the power of the ruler.  [2317] And they sent unto him
   their disciples, with the kinsfolk of Herod; and they said unto him,
   [Arabic, p. 129] Teacher, we know that thou speakest the truth, and
   teachest the way of God with equity, [2318] and art not lifted up
   [2319] by any man:  for thou actest not so as to [3] be seen of any
   man.  [2320] Tell us now, What is thy opinion?  Is it lawful that we
   should [4] pay the tribute to Cæsar, or not? shall we give, or shall we
   not give?  [2321] But Jesus knew [5] their deceit, and said unto them,
   [2322] Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?  Shew me the [6] penny of the
   tribute.  [2323] So they brought unto him a penny.  Jesus said unto
   them, To whom belongeth this image and inscription?  They said unto
   him, To Cæsar.  [7, 8] [2324] He said unto them, Give what is Cæsar's
   to Cæsar, and what is God's to God.  [2325] And they could not make him
   slip in a single word before the people; and they marvelled at his
   word, and refrained.

   [9] [2326] And on that day came the Sadducees, and said unto him,
   [2327] There is no life for [10] the dead.  [2328] And they asked him,
   and said unto him, Teacher, Moses said unto us, If a man die, not
   having children, let his brother take his wife, and raise up seed [11]
   for his brother.  [2329] Now there were with us seven brethren:  and
   the first took a wife, [12] and died without children; [2330] and the
   second took his wife, and died without children; [13] [2331] and the
   third also took her; and in like manner the seven of them also, and
   they [14, 15] died without leaving children.  [2332] And last of them
   all the woman died also.  [2333] At the resurrection, then, which of
   these seven shall have this woman? for all of them took [16] her.
   [2334] Jesus answered and said unto them, Is it not for this that ye
   have erred, [17] because ye know not the scriptures, nor the power of
   God?  [2335] And the sons of this [18] world take wives, and the women
   become the men's; [2336] [2337] but those that have become worthy of
   that world, and the resurrection from among the dead, do [2338] not
   take [19] [Arabic, p. 130] wives, and the women also do [2339] not
   become the men's.  [2340] Nor is it possible that they should die; but
   they [2341] are like the angels, and are the children of [20] God,
   because they have become the children of the resurrection.  [2342] For
   in [2343] the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read in the book of
   Moses, how from the bush God said unto him, I am the God of Abraham,
   and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  [21] [2344] And God is not
   the God of the dead, but of the living:  for all of them are alive with
   him.  And ye have erred greatly.

   [22, 23] [2345] And when the multitudes heard, they were wondering at
   his teaching.  [2346] And [24] some of the scribes answered and said
   unto him, Teacher, thou hast well said.  [2347] But the rest of the
   Pharisees, when they saw his silencing the Sadducees on this point,
   gathered against him to contend with him.

   [25] [2348] And one of the scribes, of those that knew the law, when he
   saw the excellence [26] of his answer to them, desired to try him, and
   said unto him, [2349] What shall I do to inherit eternal life? and,
   [2350] Which of the commandments is greater, and has precedence [27] in
   the law?  [2351] Jesus said unto him, The first of all the commandments
   is, Hear, O [28] Israel; The Lord our God, the Lord is one:  [2352] and
   thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
   soul, and with all thy thought, and with all thy [29, 30] strength.
   [2353] This is the great and preëminent [2354] commandment.  [2355] And
   the second, which is like it, is, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
   thyself.  And another commandment [31] greater than these two there is
   not.  [2356] On these two commandments, then, are hung the [32]
   [Arabic, p. 131] law and the prophets.  [2357] That scribe said unto
   him, Excellent! my Master; [2358] thou hast said truly that he is one,
   and there is no other outside of him:  [33] [2359] and that a man
   should love him with all his heart, and with all his thought, and with
   all his soul, and with all his strength, and that he should love his
   neighbour as [34] himself, is better than all savours and sacrifices.
   [2360] And Jesus saw him that he had answered wisely; and he answered
   and said unto him, Thou art not far from the [35, 36] kingdom of God.
   [2361] Thou hast spoken rightly:  do this, and thou shalt live.  [2362]
   And he, as his desire was to justify himself, said unto him, And who is
   my neighbour?  [37] [2363] Jesus said unto him, A man went down from
   Jerusalem to Jericho; and the robbers fell upon him, and stripped
   [2364] him, and beat him, his life remaining in him but little, [2365]
   [38] and went away.  [2366] And it happened that there came down a
   certain priest that way; [39] and he saw him, and passed by.  [2367]
   And likewise a Levite also came and reached [40] that place, and saw
   him, and passed by.  [2368] And a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed,
   [41] came to [2369] the place where he was, and saw him, and had
   compassion on him, [2370] and came near, and bound up his strokes,
   [2371] and poured on them wine and oil; and he set [2372] him on the
   ass, and brought him to the inn, and expended his care upon him.  [42]
   [2373] And on the morrow of that day he took out two pence, and gave
   them to the innkeeper, and said unto him, Care for him; and if thou
   spendest upon him more, [43] when I return, I shall give thee.  [2374]
   Who of these three now, thinkest thou, is nearest [44] to him that fell
   among the robbers?  [2375] And he said unto him, He that had compassion
   [45] [Arabic, p. 132] on him.  [2376] Jesus said unto him, Go, and do
   thou also likewise.  And no man dared afterwards to ask him anything.

   [46] [2377] And he was teaching every day in the temple.  But the chief
   priests and scribes and the elders of the people sought to destroy
   him:  [2378] and they could [2379] not find what [47] they should do
   with him; and all the people were hanging upon him to hear him.  [48]
   [2380] And many of the multitude believed on him, and said, The
   Messiah, when he [49] cometh, can it be that he will do more than these
   signs that this man doeth?  [2381] And the Pharisees heard the
   multitudes say that of him; and the chief priests sent [50] officers
   [2382] to seize him.  [2383] And Jesus said unto them, I am with you
   but a short time [51] yet, and I go to him that sent me.  [2384] And ye
   shall seek me, and shall not find me:  [52] and where I shall be, ye
   shall not be able to come.  [2385] The Jews said within themselves,
   Whither hath this man determined to go that we shall not be able [2386]
   to find him? can it be that he is determined to go to the regions of
   the nations, [2387] and teach [53] the heathen?  [2388] What is this
   word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me:  and where
   I am, ye cannot come?

   Section XXXV.

   [1] [2389] And on the great day, which is the last of the feast, Jesus
   stood, crying out and [2] saying, If any man is thirsty, let him come
   unto me, and drink.  [2390] Every one that believeth in me, as the
   scriptures said, there shall flow from his belly rivers of pure [3]
   water.  [2391] He said that referring to the Spirit, which those who
   believed in him were to receive:  for the Spirit was not yet granted;
   and because Jesus had not yet been [4] [Arabic, p. 133] glorified.
   [2392] And many of the multitude that heard his words said, This is [5]
   in truth the prophet.  [2393] And others said, This is the Messiah.
   But others [6] said, Can it be that the Messiah will come from
   Galilee?  [2394] Hath not the scripture said that from the seed of
   David, and from Bethlehem, the village of David, the [7] Messiah
   cometh?  [2395] And there occurred a dissension in the multitude
   because of him.  [8] [2396] And some of them were wishing to seize him;
   but no man laid a hand upon him.

   [9] [2397] And those officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees:
   and the priests said [10] unto them, Why did ye not bring him?  [2398]
   The officers said, Never spake man thus [11] as speaketh this man.
   [2399] The Pharisees said unto them, Perhaps ye also have gone [12, 13]
   astray?  [2400] Hath any of the rulers or the Pharisees haply believed
   in him? [2401] except [14] this people which knows not the law; they
   are accursed.  [2402] Nicodemus, one of them, [15] he that had come to
   Jesus by night, [2403] said unto them, Doth our law haply condemn [16]
   a man, except it hear him first and know what he hath done?  [2404]
   They answered and said unto him, Art thou also haply from Galilee?
   Search, and see that a prophet riseth not from Galilee.

   [17, 18] [2405] And when the Pharisees assembled, Jesus asked them, and
   said, [2406] What say ye of [19] the Messiah? whose son is he?  They
   said unto him, The son of David.  [2407] He said unto them, And how
   doth David in the Holy Spirit call him Lord? for he said,

   [20] [2408] The Lord said unto my Lord,

   Sit on my right hand,

   That I may put thine enemies under thy feet.

   [21, 22] [2409] If then David calleth him Lord, how is he his son?
   [2410] And no one was able to answer him; and no man dared from that
   day again to ask him of anything.

   [23] [2411] And Jesus addressed them again, and said, I am the light of
   the world; and he that [24] followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
   but shall find the light of life.  [2412] The Pharisees [Arabic, p.
   134] said unto him, Thou bearest witness to thyself; thy witness is not
   true.  [2413] Jesus [25] answered and said unto them, If I bear witness
   to myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I
   go; but ye know not whence I came, or [26, 27] whither I go.  [2414]
   And ye judge after the flesh; and I judge no man.  [2415] And even if I
   judge, my judgement is true; because I am not alone, but I and my
   Father which [28, 29] sent me.  [2416] And in your law it is written,
   that the witness of two men is true.  [2417] I am he that beareth
   witness to myself, and my Father which sent me beareth witness to [30]
   me.  [2418] They said unto him, Where is thy Father?  Jesus answered
   and said unto them, Ye know not me, nor my Father:  for did ye know me,
   ye would know my [31] Father.  [2419] He said these sayings in the
   treasury, where he was teaching in the [32] temple:  [2420] and no man
   seized him; because his hour had not yet come.  Jesus said unto them
   again, I go truly, and ye shall seek me and not find me, and ye shall
   die [33] in your sins:  and where I go, ye cannot come.  [2421] The
   Jews said, Will he haply kill [34] himself, that he saith, Where I go,
   ye cannot come?  [2422] He said unto them, Ye are from below; and I am
   from above:  ye are of this world; and I am not of this [35] world.
   [2423] I said unto you, that ye shall die in your sins:  if ye believe
   not that I am [36] he, ye shall die in your sins.  [2424] The Jews
   said, And thou, who art thou?  Jesus said [37] unto them, If I should
   begin to speak unto you, [2425] I have concerning you many words and
   judgement:  but he that sent me is true; and I, what I heard from him
   is what [38, 39] I say in the world.  [2426] And they knew not that he
   meant by that the Father.  [2427] Jesus [Arabic, p. 135] said unto them
   again, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I
   am he:  and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father [40] taught me, so
   I speak.  [2428] And he that sent me is with me; and my Father hath not
   [41] left me alone; because I do what is pleasing to him at all times.
   [2429] And while he was saying that, many believed in him.

   [42] [2430] And Jesus said to those Jews that believed in him, If ye
   abide in my words, truly [43] ye are my disciples; [2431] and ye shall
   know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  [44] [2432] They
   said unto him, We are the seed of Abraham, and have never served any
   man [45] in the way of slavery:  how then sayest thou, Ye shall be free
   children?  [2433] Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Every one that doeth a sin is a slave of [46] sin.  [2434] And the
   slave doth not remain for ever in the house; but the son remaineth [47,
   48] for ever.  [2435] And if the Son set you free, truly ye shall be
   free children.  I know that ye are the seed of Abraham; but ye seek to
   slay me, because ye are unable for my [49] word.  [2436] And what I saw
   with my Father, I say:  and what ye saw with your father, [50] ye do.
   [2437] They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham.  Jesus
   said unto them, If ye were the children of Abraham, ye would do the
   deeds of Abraham.  [51] [2438] Now, behold, ye seek to kill me, a man
   that speak [2439] with you [2440] the truth, that I [52] heard from
   God:  this did Abraham not do.  [2441] And ye do the deeds of your
   father.  They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; [2442] we
   have one Father, who is [53] God.  [2443] Jesus said unto them, If God
   were your Father, ye would love me:  I proceeded and came [2444] from
   God; and it was not of my own self that I came, [2445] but he sent [54]
   [Arabic, p. 136] me.  [2446] Why then do ye not know my word?  Because
   ye cannot hear my word.  [55] [2447] Ye are from the father, the devil,
   [2448] and the lust of your father do ye desire to do, who from the
   beginning is a slayer of men, and in the truth standeth not, because
   the truth is not in him.  And when he speaketh untruth, he speaketh
   from [56] himself:  for he is a liar, and the father of untruth.
   [2449] And I who speak the truth, ye [57] believe me not.  [2450] Who
   of you rebuketh me for a sin?  And if I speak the truth, ye [58] do not
   believe me. [2451]   [2452] Whosoever is of God heareth the words of
   God:  therefore do [59] ye not hear, because ye are not of God.  [2453]
   The Jews answered and said unto him, [60] Did we not say well that thou
   art a Samaritan, and hast demons?  [2454] Jesus said unto them, As for
   me, I have not a devil; but my Father do I honour, and ye dishonour
   [61] me.  [2455] I seek not my glory:  here is one who seeketh and
   judgeth.

   Section XXXVI.

   [1] [2456] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever keepeth my word
   shall not see death [2] for ever.  [2457] The Jews said unto him, Now
   we know that thou hast demons.  Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and
   thou sayest, Whosoever keepeth my word shall not [3] taste death for
   ever.  [2458] Art thou haply greater than our father Abraham, who is
   [4] dead, and than the prophets, which are dead? whom makest thou
   thyself?  [2459] Jesus said unto them, If I glorify myself, my glory is
   nothing:  my Father is he that [5] glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that
   he is our [2460] God; [2461] and yet ye have not known him:  but I know
   him; and if I should say that I know him not, I should become [6]
   [Arabic, p. 137] a liar like you:  but I know him, and keep his word.
   [2462] Abraham your father [7] longed to see my day; and he saw, and
   rejoiced.  [2463] The Jews said unto him, [8] Thou art now not fifty
   years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?  [2464] Jesus said unto [9]
   them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.  [2465]
   And they take [2466] stones to stone him:  [2467] but Jesus concealed
   himself, and went out of the temple.  And he passed through them, and
   went his way.

   [10] [2468] And as he passed, he saw a man blind from his mother's
   womb.  [2469] And his [11] disciples asked him, and said, Our Master,
   who sinned, this man, or his parents, so [12] that he was born blind?
   [2470]   [2471] Jesus said unto them, Neither did he sin, nor his
   parents:  [13] but that the works of God may be seen in him. [2472]
   [2473] It is incumbent on me to do the deeds of him that sent me, while
   it is day:  a night will come, and no man will be [14] able to busy
   himself.  [2474] As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the
   world.  [15] [2475] And when he said that, he spat upon the ground, and
   made clay of his spittle, and [16] smeared it on the eyes of the blind
   man, and said unto him, [2476] Go and wash thyself in [17] the pool
   [2477] of Siloam. [2478]   [2479] And he went and washed, and came
   seeing.  And his neighbours, which saw him of old begging, said, Is not
   this he that was sitting begging?  [18] [2480] And some said, It is he;
   and others said, Nay, but he resembles him much.  He [19, 20] said, I
   am he.  [2481] They said unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?
   [2482] He answered and said unto them, A man named Jesus made clay, and
   smeared it on my eyes, and said unto me, Go and wash in the water of
   Siloam:  and I went and [21] washed, and received sight. [2483]
   [2484] They said unto him, Where is he?  He said, I know not.  [22, 23]
   [Arabic, p. 138] [2485] And they brought him that was previously blind
   to the Pharisees.  [2486] And the day in which Jesus made clay and
   opened with it his eyes was a sabbath [24] day.  [2487] And again the
   Pharisees asked him, How didst thou receive sight?  And he said [25]
   unto them, He put clay on mine eyes, and I washed, and received sight.
   [2488] The people [2489] of the Pharisees said, This man is not from
   God, for he keepeth not the sabbath.  And others said, How can a man
   that is a sinner do these signs?  And there came [26] to be a division
   amongst them.  [2490] And again they said to that blind man, Thou,
   then, what sayest thou of him that opened for thee thine eyes?  He said
   unto them, [27] I say that he is a prophet.  [2491] And the Jews did
   not believe concerning him, that he was blind, and received sight,
   until they summoned the parents of him who received [28] sight, and
   asked them, [2492] Is this [2493] your son, of whom ye said that he was
   born blind? [29] how then, behold, doth he now see?  [2494] His parents
   answered and said, We know [30] that this is our son, and that he was
   born blind:  [2495] but how he has come to see now, or who it is that
   opened his eyes, we know not:  and he also has reached his prime; [31]
   ask him, and he will speak for himself.  [2496] This said his parents,
   because they were fearing the Jews:  and the Jews decided, that if any
   man should confess of him that [32] he was the Messiah, they would put
   him out of the synagogue.  [2497] For this reason [33] said his
   parents, He hath reached his prime; ask him.  [2498] And they called
   the man a second time, him that was blind, and said unto him, Praise
   God:  we know that this [34] man is a sinner.  [2499] He answered and
   said unto them, Whether he be a sinner, I know [35] not:  I know one
   thing, that I was blind, and I now see.  [2500] They said unto him
   again, [36] [Arabic, p. 139] What did he unto thee? how opened he for
   thee thine eyes?  [2501] He said unto them, I said unto you, and ye did
   not hear:  what [2502] wish ye further to hear? [37] ye also, do ye
   wish to become disciples to him?  [2503] And they reviled him, and said
   unto him, Thou art the disciple [2504] of that man; but as for us, we
   are the disciples of [38] Moses.  [2505] And we know that God spake
   unto Moses:  but this man, we know not [39] whence he is.  [2506] The
   man answered and said unto them, From this is the wonder, [40] because
   ye know not whence he is, and mine eyes hath he opened.  [2507] And we
   know that God heareth not the voice of sinners:  but whosoever feareth
   him, and doeth [41] his will, him he heareth.  [2508] From eternity
   hath it not been heard of, that a man [42] opened the eyes of a blind
   man, who had been born in blindness.  [2509] If then this man [43] were
   not from God, he could not do that.  [2510] They answered and said unto
   him, Thou wast all of thee born in sins, and dost thou teach us?  And
   they put him forth without.

   [44] [2511] And Jesus heard of his being put forth without, and found
   him, and said unto [45] him, Dost thou believe in the Son of God?
   [2512] He that was made whole answered [46] and said, Who is he, my
   Lord, that I may believe in him?  [2513] Jesus said unto him, [47] Thou
   hast seen him, and he that speaketh to thee is he.  [2514] And he said,
   I believe, my Lord.  And he fell down worshipping him.

   Section XXXVII.

   [1] [2515] And Jesus said, To judge the world am I come, so that they
   that see not may [2] see, and they that see may become blind.  [2516]
   And some of the Pharisees which were [3] with him heard that, and they
   said unto him, Can it be that we are blind?  [2517] Jesus said unto
   them, If ye were blind, ye should not have sin:  but now ye say, We
   see:  and because of this your sin remaineth. [2518]

   [4] [Arabic, p. 140] [2519] Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever
   entereth not into the fold of the sheep by the door, but goeth up from
   another place, that man is a thief and a [5, 6] stealer.  [2520] But he
   that entereth by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.  [2521] And
   therefore [2522] the keeper of the door openeth for him the door; and
   the sheep hear his voice:  and [7] he calleth his sheep [2523] by their
   names, and they go forth unto him.  [2524] And when he putteth forth
   his sheep, he goeth before them, and his sheep [2525] follow him:
   because [8] they know his voice.  [2526] And after a stranger will the
   sheep not go, but they flee from [9] him:  because they hear not the
   voice of a stranger.  [2527] This parable spake Jesus unto them:  but
   they knew not what he was saying unto them.

   [10] [2528] Jesus said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   I am the door of the [11] sheep.  [2529] And all that came are thieves
   and stealers:  but the sheep heard them not.  [12] [2530] I am the
   door:  and if a man enter by me, he shall live, and shall go in and go
   out, [13] and shall find pasture.  [2531] And the stealer cometh not,
   save that he may steal, and kill, and destroy:  but I came that they
   might have life, and that they might have [14] the thing that is
   better. [2532]   [2533] I am the good shepherd; and the good shepherd
   giveth [15] himself [2534] for his sheep.  [2535] But the hireling, who
   is not a shepherd, and whose the sheep [2536] are not, when he seeth
   the wolf as it cometh, leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, [16] and the wolf
   cometh, and snatcheth away the sheep, and scattereth [2537] them:
   [2538] and the [17] hireling fleeth because he is an hireling, and hath
   no care for the sheep.  [2539] I am the [18] good shepherd; [2540] and
   I know what is mine, and what is mine knoweth me, as my Father knoweth
   me, and I know my Father; and I give myself [2541] for the sheep.  [19]
   [2542] And I have other sheep also, that are not of this flock:  them
   also I must invite, and they shall hear my voice; and all the sheep
   shall be one, and the shepherd one.  [20] [Arabic, p. 141] [2543] And
   therefore doth my Father love me, because I give my life, that I may
   [21] take it again.  [2544] No man taketh it from me, but I leave it of
   my own choice.  And I have the right to leave it, and have the right
   also to take it.  And this commandment did I receive of my Father.

   [22] [2545] And there occurred a disagreement among the Jews because of
   these sayings.  [23] [2546] And many of them said, He hath a devil, and
   is afflicted with madness; [2547] why listen [24] ye to him?  [2548]
   And others said, These sayings are not those of men possessed with
   demons.  Can a demon haply open the eyes of a blind man?

   [25, 26] [2549] And the feast of the dedication came on at Jerusalem:
   and it was winter.  [2550] And [27] Jesus was walking in the temple in
   the porch of Solomon.  [2551] The Jews therefore surrounded him, and
   said unto him, Until when dost thou make our hearts anxious?  [28]
   [2552] If thou art the Messiah, tell us plainly.  He answered and said
   unto them, I told you, and ye believe not:  and the deeds that I do in
   my Father's name bear witness [29, 30] to me.  [2553] But ye believe
   not, because ye are not of my sheep, [2554] as I said unto you.  [31]
   [2555] And my sheep [2556] hear my voice, and I know them, and they
   come after me:  [2557] and I give them eternal life; and they shall not
   perish for ever, nor shall any man snatch [32] them out of my hands.
   [2558]   [2559] For the Father, who hath given them unto me, is greater
   [33] than all; and no man is able to take them from the hand of my
   [2560] Father.  [2561] I and [34, 35] my Father are one.  [2562] And
   the Jews took stones to stone him.  [2563] Jesus said unto them, Many
   good deeds from my Father have I shewed you; because of which [2564] of
   them, [36] then, do ye stone me?  [2565] The Jews said unto him, Not
   for the good deeds do we stone thee, but because thou blasphemest; and,
   whilst thou art a man, makest thyself [37] God.  [2566] Jesus said unto
   them, Is it not thus written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?  [38]
   [Arabic, p. 142] [2567] And if he called those gods--for [2568] to them
   came the word of God (and it is [39] not possible in [2569] the
   scripture that anything should be undone)-- [2570] he then, whom the
   Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, do ye say that he
   blasphemeth; [40] because I said unto you, I am the Son of God?  [2571]
   If then I do not the deeds of my [41] Father, ye believe me not. [2572]
     [2573] But if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the deeds:
   that ye may know and believe that my Father is in me, and I in my
   Father.  [42] [2574] And they sought again to take him:  and he went
   forth out of their hands.

   [43] [2575] And he went beyond Jordan to the place where John was
   baptizing formerly; [44] and abode there.  [2576] And many people came
   unto him; and they said, John did not [45] work even one sign:  but all
   that John said of this man is truth.  [2577] And many believed in him.

   [46] [2578] And there was a sick man, named Lazarus, of the village of
   Bethany, the brother [47] of Mary and Martha.  [2579] And Mary was she
   that anointed with sweet ointment the feet of Jesus, and wiped them
   with her hair; and Lazarus, who was sick, was the [48] brother of this
   woman. [2580]   [2581] And his sisters sent unto Jesus, and said unto
   him, Our [49] Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.  [2582] But
   Jesus said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glorifying of
   God, that the Son of God may be glorified [50, 51] because of it.
   [2583] And Jesus loved Martha, and Mary, and Lazarus.  [2584] And when
   he [52] heard that he was sick, he abode in the place where he was two
   days.  [2585] And after that, [53] he said unto his disciples, Come,
   let us go into Judæa.  [2586] His disciples said unto him, Our [Arabic,
   p. 143] Master, now the Jews desire to stone thee; and goest thou again
   thither?  [54, 55] [2587] Jesus said unto them, Is not the day of
   twelve hours?  If then a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because
   he seeth the light of the world.  [2588] But if [56] a man walk in the
   night, he stumbleth, because there is no lamp in him.  [2589] This said
   Jesus:  and after that, he said unto them, Lazarus our friend hath
   fallen asleep; but [57] I am going to awaken him.  [2590] His disciples
   said unto him, Our Lord, if he hath [58] fallen asleep, he will
   recover.  [2591] But Jesus said that concerning his death:  while they
   [59] supposed that he spake of lying down to sleep.  [2592] Then Jesus
   said unto them plainly, [60] Lazarus is dead.  [2593] And I am glad
   that I was not there for your sakes, that ye may [61] believe; but let
   us go thither.  [2594] Thomas, who is called Thama, [2595] said to the
   disciples, his companions, Let us also go, and die with him.

   Section XXXVIII.

   [1, 2] [2596] And Jesus came to Bethany, and found him already four
   days in the grave.  [2597] And Bethany was beside Jerusalem, and its
   distance from it was a sum of fifteen furlongs; [2598] [3] [2599] and
   many of the Jews came unto Mary and Martha, to comfort their heart [4]
   because of their brother.  [2600] And Martha, when she heard that Jesus
   had come, went [5] out to meet him:  but Mary was sitting in the
   house.  [2601] Martha then said unto Jesus, [6] My Lord, if thou hadst
   been here, my brother had not died.  [2602] But I know now that, [7]
   whatever thou shalt ask of God, he will give thee.  [2603] Jesus said
   unto her, Thy brother shall [8] rise.  [2604] Martha said unto him, I
   know that he shall rise in the resurrection at the last day.  [9]
   [2605] Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:
   whosoever believeth in [10] [Arabic, p. 144] me, even though he die, he
   shall live:  [2606] and every living one that believeth [11] in me
   shall never die.  Believest thou this?  [2607] She said unto him, Yea,
   my Lord:  I believe that thou art the Messiah, the Son of God, that
   cometh into the [12] world.  [2608] And when she had said that, she
   went and called Mary her sister secretly, [13] and said unto her, Our
   Master hath come, and summoneth thee.  [2609] And Mary, when [14] she
   heard, rose in haste, and came unto him.  [2610] (And Jesus then had
   not come into [15] the village, but was in the place where Martha met
   him.)  [2611] And the Jews also that were with her in the house, to
   comfort her, when they saw that Mary rose up and went out in haste,
   went after her, because they supposed that she was going to the [16]
   tomb to weep.  [2612] And Mary, when she came to where Jesus was, and
   saw him, fell at his feet, and said unto him, If thou hadst been here,
   my Lord, my brother had [17] not died.  [2613] And Jesus came; and when
   he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were [18] with her weeping, he
   was troubled [2614] in himself, and sighed; and he said, [2615] In what
   [19] place have ye laid him?  And they said unto him, Our Lord, come
   and see.  [2616] And [20] the tears of Jesus came. [2617]   [2618] The
   Jews therefore said, See the greatness of his love for [21] him!
   [2619] But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes
   of that [22] blind man, have caused that this man also should not die?
   [2620] And Jesus came to the place of burial, being troubled within
   himself.  And the place of burial was a cave, [23] and a stone was
   placed at its door.  [2621] Jesus therefore said, Take these stones
   away.  Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said unto him, My Lord,
   he hath come to [24] stink for some time:  he hath been [2622] four
   days dead.  [2623] Jesus said unto her, Did not I say [25] [Arabic, p.
   145] unto thee, If thou believest, thou shalt see the glory of God?
   [2624] And they removed those stones.  And Jesus lifted his eyes on
   high, and said, My Father, [26] I thank thee since thou didst hear me.
   [2625] And I know that thou at all times hearest me:  but I say this
   unto thee because of this multitude that is standing, that they [27]
   may believe that thou didst send me.  [2626] And when he had said that,
   he cried with a [28] loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.  [2627] And that
   dead man came out, having his hands and feet bound with bandages, and
   his face wrapped in a scarf.  Jesus said unto them, Loose him, and let
   him go.

   [29] [2628] And many of the Jews which came unto Mary, when they saw
   the deed of Jesus, [30] believed in him.  [2629] But some of them went
   to the Pharisees, and informed them of all that Jesus did.

   [31] [2630] And the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered, and said,
   What shall we do? [32] for lo, this man doeth many signs.  [2631] And
   if we leave him thus, all men will believe [33] in him:  and the Romans
   will come and take our country and people.  [2632] And one of them, who
   was called Caiaphas, the chief priest he was in that year, said unto
   them, [34] [2633] Ye know not anything, nor consider that it is more
   advantageous for us that one [35] man should die instead of the people,
   and not that the whole people perish.  [2634] And this he said not of
   himself:  but because he was the chief priest of [2635] that year, he
   [36] prophesied that Jesus was to die instead of the people; [2636] and
   not instead of the people alone, but that he might gather the scattered
   children of God together.  [37] [2637] And from that day they
   considered how to kill him.

   [38] [Arabic, p. 146] [2638] And Jesus did not walk openly amongst the
   Jews, but departed thence to a place near the wilderness, to a town
   [2639] called Ephraim; and he was there, going [39] about with his
   disciples.  [2640] And the passover of the Jews was near:  and many
   went [40] up from the villages unto Jerusalem before the feast, to
   purify themselves.  [2641] And they sought for Jesus, and said one to
   another in the temple, What think ye of his [41] holding back from the
   feast?  [2642] And the chief priests and the Pharisees had given
   commandment, that, if any man knew in what place he was, he should
   reveal it to them, that they might take him.

   [42] [2643] And when the days of his going up were accomplished, he
   prepared himself that [43] he might go [2644] to Jerusalem.  [2645] And
   he sent messengers before him, and departed, [2646] and [44] entered
   into a village [2647] of Samaria, that they might make ready for him.
   [2648] And they [45] received him not, because he [2649] was prepared
   for going to Jerusalem.  [2650] And when James and John his disciples
   saw it, they said unto him, Our Lord, wilt thou that we speak, and fire
   come down from heaven, to extirpate them, as did Elijah also?  [46]
   [2651] And Jesus turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not of
   what spirit ye are.  [47] [2652] Verily the Son of man did not come to
   destroy lives, but to give life.  And they went to another village.

   Section XXXIX.

   [1] [2653] And Jesus six days before the passover [2654] came to
   Bethany, where was Lazarus, [2] whom Jesus raised from among the dead.
   [2655] And they made [2656] a feast for him there:  [3] and Martha was
   serving; while Lazarus was one of them that sat with him.  [2657] And
   [4] at the time of Jesus' being at Bethany in the house of Simon the
   leper, [2658] great multitudes of the Jews heard that Jesus was there:
   and they came, not because of Jesus alone, but [Arabic, p. 147] that
   they might look also on Lazarus, whom he raised from among the dead.
   [5, 6] [2659] And the chief priests considered how they might kill
   Lazarus also; [2660] because [7] many of the Jews were going on his
   account, and believing in Jesus.  [2661] And Mary took a case of the
   ointment of fine nard, of great price, [2662] and opened it, and poured
   [8] it out on the head of Jesus as he was reclining; [2663] and she
   anointed his feet, and wiped them with her hair:  and the house was
   filled with the odour of the ointment.  [9, 10] [2664] But Judas
   Iscariot, one of the disciples, he that was to betray him, said, [2665]
   Why was [11] not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given
   unto the poor?  [2666] This he said, not because of his care for the
   poor, but because he was a thief, and the chest [12] was with him, and
   what was put [2667] into it he used to bear.  [2668] And that
   displeased the rest of the disciples also within themselves, and they
   said, Why went this ointment [13] to waste?  [2669] It was possible
   that it should be sold for much, and the poor be given [14] it.  [2670]
   And they were angry with [2671] Mary.  [2672] And Jesus perceived it,
   and said unto them, [2673] Leave her; why molest ye her? a good work
   hath she accomplished on me:  [2674] for the [15] day of my burial kept
   she it.  [2675] At all times the poor are with you, and when ye [16]
   wish ye can do them a kindness:  [2676] but I am not at all times with
   you.  [2677] And for this cause, when she poured [2678] this ointment
   on my body, it is as if she did it for my burial, [17] and anointed my
   body beforehand.  [2679] And verily I say unto you, In every place
   where this my gospel shall be proclaimed in all the world, what she did
   shall be told for a memorial of her.

   [18, 19] [Arabic, p. 148] [2680] And when Jesus said that, he went out
   leisurely to go to Jerusalem.  [2681] And when he arrived at Bethphage
   and at Bethany, beside the mount which is [20] called the mount of
   Olives, [2682] Jesus sent two of his disciples, and he said unto them,
   Go [21] into this village that is opposite you:  [2683] and when ye
   enter it, ye shall find an ass tied, and [22] a colt with him, [2684]
   which no man ever yet mounted:  loose him, and bring them [2685] unto
   me.  [2686] And if any man say unto you, Why loose ye them? say unto
   him thus, We [23] seek them for our Lord; and straightway send them
   hither.  [2687] All this was, that what was said in the prophet might
   be fulfilled, which said,

   [24] [2688] Say ye unto the daughter of Zion,

   Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,

   Meek, and riding upon an ass,

   And upon a colt the foal of an ass.

   [25] [2689] And the disciples did not know this at that time:  but
   after that Jesus was glorified, his disciples remembered that these
   things were written of him, and that this [26] they had done unto him.
   [2690] And when the two disciples went, they found as he had [27] said
   unto them, and they did as Jesus charged them.  [2691] And when they
   loosed them, [28] their owners said unto them, Why loose ye them?
   [2692] They said unto them, We seek [29] them for our Lord.  [2693] And
   they let them go.  And they brought the ass and the colt, [30] and they
   placed on the colt their garments; and Jesus mounted it.  [2694] And
   most of the multitudes spread their garments on the ground before him:
   and others cut branches [31] from the trees, and threw them in the
   way.  [2695] And when he neared his [2696] descent from [Arabic, p.
   149] the mount of Olives, all the disciples began to rejoice and to
   praise God with [32] a loud voice for all the powers which they had
   seen; [2697] and they said, Praise in the highest; Praise to the Son of
   David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name [33] of the Lord; [2698]
   and blessed [2699] is the kingdom that cometh, that of [2700] our
   father David:  [2701] Peace in heaven, and praise in the highest.

   [34] [2702] And a great multitude, that which came to the feast, when
   they heard that Jesus [35] was coming to Jerusalem, took young palm
   branches, [2703] [2704] and went forth to meet him, and cried and said,
   Praise:  Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the [36]
   King of Israel.  [2705] Certain therefore of the Pharisees from among
   the multitudes [37] said unto him, Our Master, rebuke thy disciples.
   [2706] He said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If these were silent,
   the stones would cry out.

   [38, 39] [2707] And when he drew near, and saw the city, he wept over
   it, and said, [2708] Would that thou hadst known the things that are
   [2709] for thy peace, in this thy day! now that is [40] hidden from
   thine eyes.  [2710] There shall come unto thee days when thine enemies
   [41] shall encompass thee, and straiten thee from every quarter, [2711]
   and shall get possession of [2712] thee, and thy children within thee;
   and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon another; because thou
   knewest not the time of thy visitation.

   [42] [2713] And when he entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was
   agitated, and they said, [43] Who is this?  [2714] And the multitudes
   said, This is Jesus, the prophet that is from Nazareth [44] of
   Galilee.  [2715] And the multitude which was with him bare witness that
   he called [45] Lazarus from the grave, and raised him from among the
   dead.  [2716] And for this cause great multitudes went out to meet him,
   because they heard the sign which he did.

   Section XL.

   [1] [Arabic, p. 150] [2717] And when Jesus entered the temple, they
   brought unto him blind and [2] lame:  and he healed them.  [2718] But
   when the chief priests and the Pharisees saw the wonders that he did,
   and the children that were crying in the temple and [3] saying, Praise
   be to the Son of David:  it distressed them, [2719] and they said,
   Hearest thou not what these say?  Jesus said unto them, Yea:  did ye
   not read long ago, From [4] the mouths of children and infants thou
   hast chosen my praise?  [2720] And the Pharisees said one to another,
   Behold, do ye not see that nothing availeth us? for lo, the whole world
   hath followed him.

   [5] [2721] And there were among them certain Gentiles also, which had
   come up to worship [6] at the feast:  [2722] these therefore came to
   Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, [7] and asked him, and said
   unto him, My lord, we wish to see Jesus.  [2723] And Philip [8] came
   and told Andrew:  and Andrew and Philip told Jesus.  [2724] And Jesus
   answered and said unto them, The hour is come nigh, in which the Son of
   man is to be glorified.  [9] [2725] Verily, verily, I say unto you, A
   grain of wheat, if it fall not and die in the [10] earth, remaineth
   alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.  [2726] He that loveth his
   life [2727] destroyeth it; and he that hateth his life [2728] in this
   world shall keep it unto the life eternal.  [11] [2729] If a man serve
   me, he will follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be [12]
   also:  and whosoever serveth me, the Father will honour him.  [2730]
   Now is my soul troubled:  [Arabic, p. 151] and what shall I say?  My
   Father, deliver me from this hour.  But [13] for this cause came I unto
   this hour.  [2731] My Father, glorify thy name.  And a [14] voice was
   heard from heaven, I have glorified it, and shall glorify it.  [2732]
   And the multitude that were standing heard, and said, This is thunder:
   and others said, An [15] angel speaketh to him.  [2733] Jesus answered
   and said unto them, Not because of me [16] was this voice, but because
   of you.  [2734] Now is the judgement of this world; and the [17] prince
   of this world shall now be cast forth.  [2735] And I, when I am lifted
   up from the [18] earth, shall draw every man unto me.  [2736] This he
   said, that he might shew by what [19] manner of death he should die.
   [2737] The multitudes said unto him, We have heard out of the law that
   the Messiah abideth for ever:  how then sayest thou, that the Son of
   [20] man is to be lifted up? who is this, the Son of man?  [2738] Jesus
   said unto them, Another little while is the light with you.  Walk so
   long as ye have light, lest the darkness overtake you; for he that
   walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.  [21] [2739] So
   long as ye have light, believe the light, that ye may be the children
   of the light.

   [22] [2740] And when certain of the Pharisees asked of Jesus, when the
   kingdom of God should come, he answered and said unto them, The kingdom
   of God cometh not [23] with expectation:  [2741] neither shall they
   say, Lo, it is here! nor, Lo, it is there! for the kingdom of God is
   within you.

   [24] [2742] And in the daytime he was teaching in the temple; and at
   night he used to go [25] out, and pass the night in the mount called
   the mount of Olives.  [2743] And all the people came [2744] to him in
   the morning in the temple, to hear his word.

   [26, 27] [2745] Then spake Jesus unto the multitudes and his disciples,
   and said unto them, [2746] On [28] [Arabic, p. 152] the seat of Moses
   are seated the scribes and Pharisees:  [2747] everything that they say
   unto you now to keep, keep and do:  but according to their deeds [29]
   do ye not; for they say, and do not.  [2748] And they bind heavy
   burdens, and lay them on the shoulders of the people; while they with
   one of their fingers will not come [30, 31] near [2749] them.  [2750]
   But all their deeds they do to make a shew before men.  [2751] And all
   the multitude were hearing that with pleasure.

   [32] [2752] And in the course of his teaching he said unto them, Guard
   yourselves from the [33] scribes, who desire to walk in robes, [2753]
   and love salutation in the marketplaces, and sitting in the highest
   places of the synagogues, and at feasts in the highest parts of [34]
   the rooms:  [2754] and they broaden their amulets, and lengthen the
   cords of their cloaks, [35] [2755] and love that they should be called
   by men, My master, [2756] and devour widows' houses, because [2757] of
   their prolonging their prayers; these then shall receive greater
   judgement.  [36] [2758] But ye, be ye not called masters: [2759]   for
   your master is one; all ye are brethren.  [37] [2760] Call not then to
   yourselves any one [2761] father on earth:  for your Father is one, who
   is [38] in heaven.  [2762] And be not called directors:  for your
   director is one, even the Messiah.  [39, 40] [2763] He that is great
   among you shall be unto you a minister.  [2764] Whosoever shall exalt
   himself shall be abased; and whosoever shall abase himself shall be
   exalted.

   [41] [2765] Woe unto you, Pharisees! because ye love the highest places
   in the synagogues, and salutation in the marketplaces.

   [42] [2766] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
   devour widows' houses, because [2767] of your prolonging your prayers:
   for this reason then ye shall receive greater judgement.

   [43] [2768] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
   have shut the kingdom of God before men.

   [44] [Arabic, p. 153] [2769] Woe unto you that know the law! for ye
   concealed the keys of knowledge:  [2770] ye enter not, and those that
   are entering ye suffer not to enter.

   [45] [2771] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because
   [2772] ye compass land and sea to draw [2773] one proselyte; and when
   he is become so, ye make him a son of hell twice as much [2774] as
   yourselves.

   [46] [2775] Woe unto you, ye blind guides! because ye say, Whosoever
   sweareth by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the
   gold that is in the temple, [47] shall be condemned. [2776]   [2777] Ye
   blind foolish ones:  which is greater, the gold, or the [48] temple
   which sanctifieth the gold?  [2778] And, Whosoever sweareth by the
   altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the offering that is
   upon it, shall be condemned. [2779]   [49] [2780] Ye blind foolish
   ones:  which is greater, the offering, or the altar which sanctifieth
   [50] the offering?  [2781] Whosoever then sweareth by the altar, hath
   sworn by it, and by all [51] that is upon it.  [2782] And whosoever
   sweareth by the temple, hath sworn by it, and by [52] him that is
   dwelling in it.  [2783] And whosoever sweareth by heaven, hath sworn by
   the throne of God, and by him that sitteth upon it.

   [53] [2784] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
   tithe mint and rue and dill and cummin and all herbs, and ye leave the
   important matters of the law, judgement, and mercy, and faith, and the
   love of God:  this ought ye to do, and [54] not to leave that undone.
   [2785] Ye blind guides, which strain out a gnat, and swallow [2786]
   camels.

   [55] [2787] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
   cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter, while the inside of
   them is full of injustice and wrong.  [56] [2788] Ye blind Pharisees,
   cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, then shall the
   outside of them be cleansed.

   [57] [Arabic, p. 154] [2789] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
   hypocrites! because ye resemble whited sepulchres, which appear [2790]
   from the outside beautiful, but within [58] full of the bones of the
   dead, and all uncleanness.  [2791] So ye also from without appear unto
   men like the righteous, but within ye are full of wrong and hypocrisy.

   [59] [2792] One of the scribes answered and said unto him, Teacher, in
   this saying of thine [60] thou art casting a slur on us.  [2793] He
   said, And to you also, ye scribes, woe! for ye lade men with heavy
   burdens, and ye with one of your fingers come not near [2794] those
   burdens.

   [61] [2795] Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
   build the tombs of the prophets, which your fathers killed, and adorn
   the burying-places of the righteous, [62] and say, [2796] If we had
   been in the days of our fathers, we should not have been partakers [63]
   with them in the blood of the prophets.  [2797] Wherefore, behold, ye
   witness against [64] yourselves, that ye are the children of those that
   slew the prophets.  [2798] And ye also, [65] ye fill up the measure
   [2799] of your fathers.  [2800] Ye serpents, ye children of vipers,
   where shall ye flee from the judgement of Gehenna?

   Section XLI.

   [1] [2801] Therefore, behold, I, the wisdom of God, am sending unto you
   prophets, and apostles, and wise men, and scribes:  and some of them ye
   shall slay and crucify; and some of them ye shall beat in your
   synagogues, and persecute [2802] from city to [2] city:  [2803] that
   there may come on you all the blood of the righteous that hath been
   poured upon the ground [2804] from the blood of Abel the pure to the
   blood of Zachariah the son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the
   temple [2805] and the altar.  [3] [2806] Verily I say unto you, All
   these things shall come upon this generation. [2807]

   [4] [Arabic, p. 155] [2808] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, slayer of the
   prophets, and stoner of them that are sent unto her! how many times did
   I wish to gather thy children, as [5] a hen gathereth her chickens
   under her wings, and ye would not!  [2809] Your house shall [6] be left
   over you desolate.  [2810] Verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me
   henceforth, till ye shall say Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
   the Lord.

   [7] [2811] And many of the rulers also believed on him; but because of
   the Pharisees they [8] were not confessing him, lest they be put [2812]
   out of the synagogue:  [2813] and they loved [9] the praise of men more
   than the praising of God.  [2814] And Jesus cried and said, [10]
   Whosoever believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him that sent
   me.  [2815] And [11] whosoever seeth me hath seen him that sent me.
   [2816] I am come a light [2817] into the [12] world, and so every one
   that believeth in me abideth not in the darkness.  [2818] And whosoever
   heareth my sayings, and keepeth them not, I judge him not:  for I came
   [13] not to judge the world, but to give the world life. [2819]
   [2820] Whosoever wrongeth [2821] me, and receiveth not my sayings,
   there is one that judgeth him:  the word that I spake, it [14] shall
   judge him at the last day.  [2822] I from myself did not speak:  but
   the Father which sent me, he hath given me commandment, [2823] what I
   should say, and what I [15] should speak; and I know that his
   commandment [2824] is eternal life.  [2825] The things that I say now,
   as my Father hath said unto me, even so I say.

   [16] [2826] And when he said that unto them, the scribes and Pharisees
   began their evil-doing, being angry with him, and finding fault with
   his sayings, and harassing [2827] him [17] in many things; [2828]
   seeking to catch something from his mouth, that they might be able to
   calumniate him.

   [18] [2829] And when there gathered together myriads of great
   multitudes, which almost trode [Arabic, p. 156] one upon another, Jesus
   began to say unto his disciples, Preserve yourselves [19] from the
   leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.  [2830] For there is
   nothing [20] concealed, that shall not be revealed:  nor hid, that
   shall not be known.  [2831] Everything that ye have said in the
   darkness shall be heard in the light; and what ye have spoken secretly
   in the ears in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed on the roofs.

   [21, 22] [2832] This said Jesus, and he went and hid himself from
   them.  [2833] But notwithstanding [23] his having done all these signs
   before them, they believed not in him:  [2834] that the word of Isaiah
   the prophet might be fulfilled, who said,

   My Lord, who is he that hath believed to hear us?

   And the arm of the Lord, to whom hath it appeared?

   [24] [2835] And for this reason it is not possible for them to believe,
   because Isaiah also said,

   [25] [2836] They have blinded their eyes, and made dark their heart;

   That they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart,

   And turn,

   So that I should heal them.

   [26] [2837] This said Isaiah when he saw his glory, and spake of him.

   [27] [2838] And when Jesus went out of the temple, certain of his
   disciples came forward [28] to shew [2839] him the buildings of the
   temple, [2840] and its beauty and greatness, and the strength of the
   stones that were laid in it, and the elegance of its building, and that
   [29] it was adorned with noble stones and beautiful colours.  [2841]
   Jesus answered and said [30] unto them, See ye these great buildings?
   [2842] verily I say unto you, Days will come, when there shall not be
   left here a stone upon another, that shall not be cast down.

   [31] [2843] And two days before [2844] the passover of unleavened
   bread, the chief priests and [32] the scribes sought how they might
   take him by deceit, [2845] and kill him:  [2846] and they said, It
   shall not be at the feast, lest the people be agitated.

   [33] [2847] And when Jesus sat on the mount of Olives opposite the
   temple, his disciples, Simon Cephas and James and John and Andrew, came
   forward unto him, and said unto him [34] between themselves and him,
   [2848] Teacher, tell us when that shall be, and what is the sign [35]
   [Arabic, p. 157] of thy coming and the end of the world.  [2849] Jesus
   answered and said unto them, Days will come, when ye shall long to see
   one of the days of the Son of [36, 37] [2850] man, and shall not
   behold.  [2851] Take heed lest any man lead you astray.  Many shall
   [38] come in my name, and say, I am the Messiah; [2852] and they shall
   say, The time is come [39] near, and shall lead many astray:  go not
   therefore after them.  [2853] And when ye hear of wars and tidings of
   insurrections, see to it, be [2854] not agitated:  for these things
   must [40] first be; only the end is not yet come.  [2855] Nation shall
   rise against nation, and kingdom [41] against kingdom:  [2856] and
   great earthquakes shall be in one place and another, and there shall be
   famines and deaths and agitations:  and there shall be fear and terror
   and great signs that [2857] shall appear from heaven, and there shall
   be great [42, 43] storms   [2858] All these things are the beginning of
   travail.  [2859] But before all of that, they shall lay hands upon you,
   and persecute you, and deliver you unto the synagogues [44] and into
   prisons, and bring you before kings and judges for my name's sake.
   [2860] And [45] that shall be unto you for a witness.  [2861] But first
   must my gospel be preached unto all [46] nations.  [2862] And when they
   bring you into the synagogues before the rulers and the authorities, be
   not anxious beforehand how ye shall answer for yourselves, or what ye
   [47, 48] shall say:  [2863] because it is not ye that speak, but the
   Holy Spirit.  [2864] Lay it to your heart, not [49] [Arabic, p. 158] to
   be anxious before the time what ye shall say:  [2865] and I shall
   [2866] give you understanding and wisdom, [2867] which all your
   adversaries shall not be able to gainsay.  [50] [2868] And then shall
   they deliver you unto constraint, and shall kill you:  and ye shall be
   [51] hated of all nations because of my name.  [2869] And then shall
   many go astray, [2870] and they [52] shall hate one another, and
   deliver one another unto death.  [2871] And your parents, and your
   brethren, and your kinsfolk, and your friends shall deliver you up, and
   shall [53, 54] slay some of you.  [2872] But a lock of hair from your
   heads shall not perish.  [2873] And by [55] your patience ye shall gain
   [2874] your souls.  [2875] And many men, [2876] false prophets, shall
   arise, [56] and lead many astray.  [2877] And because of the abounding
   of iniquity, the love of many [57] shall wax cold.  [2878] But he that
   endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.  [2879] And [58] this,
   the [2880] gospel of the kingdom, shall be preached in all the world
   for a testimony to all nations; and then shall come the end of all.

   Section XLII.

   [1] [2881] But when ye see Jerusalem with the army compassing it about,
   then know that [2] its desolation is come near.  [2882] Those then that
   are in Judæa at that time shall flee to the mountain; and those that
   are within her shall flee; and those that are in the [3] villages shall
   not enter her.  [2883] For these days are the days of vengeance, that
   all that [4] is written may be fulfilled.  [2884] And when ye see the
   unclean sign of desolation, [2885] spoken of in Daniel the prophet,
   standing in the pure place, he that readeth shall understand, [5, 6]
   [2886] and then he that is in Judæa shall flee in to the mountain:
   [2887] and let him that is on the [7] roof not go down, nor enter in to
   take anything from his house:  [2888] and let him that is in [8]
   [Arabic, p. 159] the field not turn behind him to take his garment.
   [2889] Woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in
   those days! there shall be great [9] distress in the land, and wrath
   against this nation.  [2890] And they shall fall on the edge of the
   sword, [2891] and shall be taken captive to every land:  and Jerusalem
   shall be trodden down of the nations, until the times of the nations be
   ended.

   [10] [2892] Then if any man say unto you, The Messiah is here; or, Lo,
   he is there; believe [11] him not:  [2893] there shall rise then false
   Messiahs and prophets of lying, and shall do signs and wonders, in
   order that they may lead astray even the elect also, if they [12] be
   able.  [2894] But as for you, beware:  for I have acquainted you with
   everything [13] beforehand.  [2895] If then they say unto you, Lo, he
   is in the desert; go not out, lest ye [14] be taken:  and if they say
   unto you, Lo, he is in the chamber; believe not.  [2896] And as the
   lightning appeareth from the east, and is seen unto the west; so shall
   be the [15] coming of the Son of man.  [2897] But first he must suffer
   much and be rejected by this [16] generation. [2898]   [2899] Pray
   therefore that your flight be not in winter, nor on a sabbath:  [17]
   [2900] there shall be then great tribulation, [2901] the like of which
   there hath not been from the [18] beginning of the world till now, nor
   shall be.  [2902] And except the Lord had shortened those days, no
   flesh would have lived:  but because of the elect, whom he elected,
   [19] he shortened those days.  [2903] And there shall be signs in the
   sun and the moon and the stars; and upon the earth affliction [2904] of
   the nations, and rubbing of hands for the confusion [2905] [20]
   [Arabic, p. 160] of the noise of the sea, and an earthquake:  [2906]
   the souls of men shall [21] go forth from fear of that which is to come
   upon the earth.  [2907] And in those days, straightway after the
   distress of those days, the sun shall become dark, and the moon shall
   not shew its light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the
   powers [22] of heaven shall be convulsed:  [2908] and then shall appear
   the sign of the Son of man in heaven:  and at that time all the tribes
   of the earth shall wail, and look unto the Son [23] of man coming on
   the clouds of heaven with power and much glory.  [2909] And he shall
   send his angels with the great trumpet, and they shall gather his elect
   from the four [24] winds, from one end of heaven to the other. [2910]
   [2911] But when these things begin to be, be of good cheer, and lift up
   your heads; for your salvation [2912] is come near.

   [25] [2913] Learn the example of the fig tree:  when it letteth down
   its branches, [2914] and putteth [26] forth its leaves, ye know that
   the summer is come; [2915] so ye also, when ye see these things begun
   to be, know ye that the kingdom of God hath arrived at the [27] door.
   [2916] Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
   until all these [28] things shall be.  [2917] Heaven and earth shall
   pass away, but my sayings shall not pass away.

   [29] [2918] Take heed to yourselves, that your hearts become not heavy
   with inordinate desire, [2919] and drunkenness, and the care of the
   world at any time, and that day come [30] upon you suddenly:  [2920]
   for it is as a shock that shocks all the inhabitants that are on the
   [31] face of the whole earth.  [2921] Watch at all times, and pray,
   that ye may be worthy to escape [Arabic, p. 161] from all the things
   that are to be, and that ye may stand before the Son of [32] man.
   [2922] Of that day and of that hour hath no man learned, not even the
   angels [33] of heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.  [2923] See ye,
   and watch and pray:  for ye know [34] not when that time will be.
   [2924] It is as a man, who journeyed, and left his house, and gave his
   authority to his servants, and appointed every man to his work, and
   [35] charged the porter to be wakeful.  [2925] Be wakeful then: [2926]
     since ye know not when the lord of the house cometh, in the evening,
   or in the middle of the night, or when the [36] cock croweth, or in the
   morning; [2927] lest he come unexpectedly, and find you sleeping.  [37]
   [2928] The thing that I say unto you, unto all of you do I say it, Be
   ye watchful.

   [38] [2929] For as it was in the days of Noah, so shall the coming of
   the Son of man be.  [39] [2930] As they were before the flood eating
   and drinking, and taking wives, and giving [40] wives to men, [2931]
   until the day in which Noah entered into the ark, and they perceived
   not till the flood came, and took them all; so shall the coming of the
   Son of man [41] be.  [2932] And as it was in the days of Lot; they were
   eating and drinking, and selling [42] and buying, and planting and
   building, [2933] on the day in which Lot went out from Sodom, and the
   Lord rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them [43, 44]
   all:  [2934] so shall it be in the day in which the Son of man is
   revealed. [2935]   [2936] And in that day, whosoever is on the roof,
   and his garments [2937] in the house, let him not go down to [45] take
   them:  and he that is in the field shall not turn behind him.  [2938]
   Remember Lot's [46] wife.  [2939] Whosoever shall desire to save his
   life shall destroy it:  but whosoever shall [47] destroy his life shall
   save it.  [2940] Verily I say unto you, In that night there shall be
   two on [48] [Arabic, p. 162] one bed; one shall be taken, and another
   left.  [2941] And two women shall be grinding [49] at one mill; one
   shall be taken, and another left.  [2942] And two shall be in the [50]
   field; one shall be taken, and another left.  [2943] They answered and
   said unto him, To what place, our Lord?  He said unto them, Where the
   body is, there will the eagles [51, 52] gather.  [2944] Be attentive
   now:  for ye know not at what hour your Lord cometh.  [2945] Know
   this:  if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief
   would come, he would have been attentive, and would not make it
   possible that his house should be [53] broken through.  [2946]
   Therefore be ye also ready:  for in the hour that ye think not the Son
   of man cometh.

   Section XLIII.

   [1] [2947] Simon Cephas said unto him, Our Lord, is it to us that thou
   hast spoken this [2] parable, or also to every man?  [2948] Jesus said
   unto him, Who, thinkest thou, is the servant, the master of the house,
   [2949] trusted with control, [2950] whom his lord set over his [3]
   household, to give them their food in its season?  [2951] Blessed is
   that servant, whom his [4] lord shall come and find having done so.
   [2952] Verily I say unto you, He will set him [5] over all that he
   hath.  [2953] But if that evil servant say in his heart, My lord
   delayeth his [6] coming; [2954] and shall begin to beat his servants
   and the maidservants of his lord, and [7] shall begin to eat and to
   drink with the drunken; [2955] the lord of that servant shall come [8]
   in the day that he thinketh not, and in the hour that he knoweth not,
   [2956] and shall [Arabic, p. 163] judge him, and appoint his portion
   with the hypocrites, [2957] and with those that are not faithful:
   [2958] there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

   [9] [2959] Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like unto ten virgins,
   those that took their [10] lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom
   and the bride.  [2960] Five of them were [11] wise, and five foolish.
   [2961] And those foolish ones took their lamps, and took not with [12,
   13] them oil:  [2962] but those wise ones took oil in vessels along
   with their lamps.  [2963] When then [14] the bridegroom delayed, they
   all slumbered and slept.  [2964] But in the middle of the night there
   occurred a cry, Behold, the bridegroom cometh!  Go forth therefore to
   [15, 16] meet him.  [2965] Then all those virgins arose, and made ready
   their lamps.  [2966] The foolish [17] said unto the wise, Give us of
   your oil; for our lamps are gone out.  [2967] But those wise answered
   and said, Perhaps [2968] there will not be enough for us and you:  but
   go ye to [18] the sellers, and buy for yourselves.  [2969] And when
   they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those that were ready
   went in with him to the marriage feast:  and [19] the door was shut.
   [2970] And at last those other virgins also came and said, Our Lord,
   [20] our Lord, open unto us.  [2971] He answered and said unto them,
   Verily I say unto you, [21] I know you not.  [2972] Watch then, for ye
   know not that day nor that hour.

   [22] [2973] It is as a man, who went on a journey, and called his
   servants, and delivered unto [23] them his possessions.  [2974] And
   unto one he gave five talents, [2975] and another two, and another [24]
   one; every one according to his strength; and went on his journey
   forthwith.  [2976] He [Arabic, p. 164] then that received the five
   talents went and traded with them, and gained [26] other five.  [2977]
   And so also he of the two gained other two.  [2978] But he that
   received [27] the one went and digged in the earth, and hid the money
   of his lord.  [2979] And after a long time the lord of those servants
   came, and took from them the account.  [28] [2980] And he that received
   five talents came near and brought other five, and said, My lord, thou
   gavest me five talents:  lo, I have gained other five in addition to
   them.  [29] [2981] His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and
   faithful servant:  over a little hast [30] thou been faithful, over
   much will I set thee:  enter into the joy of thy lord.  [2982] And he
   that had the two came near and said, My lord, thou gavest me two
   talents:  lo, [31] other two have I gained in addition to them.  [2983]
   His lord said unto him, Good, [2984] thou faithful servant:  over a
   little hast thou been faithful, over much will I set thee:  enter [32]
   into the joy of thy lord.  [2985] And he also that received the one
   talent came forward and said, My lord, I knew thee that thou art a
   severe man, who reapest where thou [33] sowest not, and gatherest where
   thou didst not scatter:  [2986] and so I was afraid, and [34] went away
   and hid thy talent in the earth:  lo, thou hast what is thine.  [2987]
   His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant,
   thou knewest me [35] that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I
   did not scatter; [2988] it was incumbent on thee to put my money to the
   bank, [2989] and then I should come and seek it with its [36] gains.
   [2990] Take now from him the talent, and give it to him that hath ten
   talents.  [37] [2991] Whosoever hath shall be given, and he shall have
   more:  but he that hath not, even [38] [Arabic, p. 165] what he hath
   shall be taken from him.  [2992] And the unprofitable servant, put him
   forth into the outer darkness:  there shall be the weeping and gnashing
   of teeth.

   [39, 40] [2993] Your loins shall be girded, and your lamps lit; [2994]
   and ye shall be like the people that are looking for their lord, when
   he shall return from the feast; so that, when [41] he cometh and
   knocketh, they may at once open unto him.  [2995] Blessed are those
   servants, whom their lord shall come and find attentive:  verily I say
   unto you, that he will gird his waist, and make them sit down, and pass
   through [2996] them and serve [42] them.  [2997] And if he come in the
   second watch, or the third, and find thus, blessed are those servants.

   [43] [2998] But when the Son of man cometh in his glory, and all his
   pure angels with him, [44] then shall he sit on the throne of his
   glory:  [2999] and he will gather before him all the nations, and
   separate them the one from the other, like the shepherd who separateth
   [45] the sheep from the goats; [3000] and will set [3001] the sheep on
   his right, and the goats on his [46] left.  [3002] Then shall the King
   say to those that are at his right, Come, ye blessed of my Father,
   inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations [3003] of the
   world:  [47] [3004] I hungered, and ye gave me to eat; and I thirsted,
   and ye gave me to drink; and I [48] was a stranger, and ye took me in;
   [3005] and I was naked, and ye clothed me; and I [49] was sick, and ye
   visited me; and I was in prison, and ye cared for me.  [3006] Then
   shall those righteous say unto him, Our Lord, when saw we thee hungry,
   and fed thee? [50] or thirsty, and gave thee to drink?  [3007] And when
   saw we thee a stranger, and took [51] thee in? or naked, and clothed
   thee?  [3008] And when saw we thee sick, or imprisoned, and [52] cared
   for thee?  [3009] The King shall answer and say [3010] unto them,
   Verily I say unto you, What [53] [Arabic, p. 166] ye did to one of
   these my brethren, the little ones, ye did unto me.  [3011] Then shall
   he say unto those that are on his left also, Depart from me, ye cursed,
   [54] into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his hosts:
   [3012] I hungered, and ye fed me [55] not; and I thirsted, and ye did
   not give me to drink; [3013] and I was a stranger, and ye took me not
   in; and I was naked, and ye clothed me not; and I was sick, and
   imprisoned, [56] and ye visited me not.  [3014] Then shall those also
   answer and say, Our Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or
   naked, or a stranger, or sick, or imprisoned, [57] and did not minister
   unto thee?  [3015] Then shall he answer and say unto them, Verily I say
   unto you, When ye did it not unto one of these little ones, ye did it
   not [58] unto me also.  [3016] And these shall go away into eternal
   punishment:  but the righteous into eternal life.

   Section XLIV.

   [1, 2] [3017] And when Jesus [3018] finished all these sayings, he said
   unto his disciples, [3019] Ye know that after two days will be the
   passover, and the Son of man is delivered up to be [3] crucified.
   [3020] Then gathered together the chief priests, and the scribes, and
   the elders [4] of the people, unto the court of the chief priest, who
   was called Caiaphas; [3021] and they took counsel together concerning
   Jesus, that they might seize him by subtilty, and [5] kill him.  [3022]
   But they said, Not during the feast, lest there take place a
   disturbance among the people; [3023] for they feared the people.

   [6] [3024] And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, who
   was of the number [7] of the twelve.  [3025] And he went away, and
   communed with the chief priests, and the scribes, and those that held
   command in the temple, and said unto them, What [8] [Arabic, p. 167]
   would ye pay me, and I will deliver him unto you?  [3026] And they,
   when they heard it, were pleased, and made ready [3027] for him thirty
   pieces of money. [3028]   [9] [3029] And he promised [3030] them, and
   from that time he sought an opportunity [3031] that he might deliver
   unto them Jesus without the multitude.

   [10] [3032] And on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came
   to Jesus, and said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready
   for thee that thou mayest eat the passover?

   [11] [3033] And before the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that the
   hour was arrived for his departure from this world unto his Father; and
   he loved his own in this world, [12] and to the last he loved them.
   [3034] And at the time of the feast, Satan put into the [13] heart of
   Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to deliver him up.  [3035] And Jesus,
   because he knew that the Father had delivered into his hands
   everything, and that he came [14] forth from the Father, and goeth unto
   God, [3036] rose from supper, and laid aside his [15] garments; [3037]
   and took a towel, and girded his waist, and poured water into a bason,
   and began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe them with the
   towel wherewith [16] his waist was girded.  [3038] And when he came to
   Simon Cephas, Simon said unto [17] him, Dost thou, my Lord, wash for me
   my feet?  [3039] Jesus answered and said unto [18] him, What I do, now
   thou knowest not; but afterwards thou shalt learn.  [3040] Simon said
   unto him, Thou shalt never wash for me my feet.  Jesus said unto him,
   If I [19] wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.  [3041] Simon
   Cephas said unto him, Then, my [20] Lord, wash not for me my feet
   alone, but my hands also and my head.  [3042] Jesus said unto him, He
   that batheth [3043] needeth not to wash save his feet, whereas his
   whole [21] body is clean:  and ye also are clean, but not all of you.
   [3044] For Jesus knew him that should betray him; therefore said he, Ye
   are not all clean.

   [22] [Arabic, p. 168] [3045] So when he had washed their feet, he took
   his garments, and sat down, and [23] said unto them, Know ye what I
   have done unto you?  [3046] Ye call me, Master, [24] and, Lord:  and ye
   say well; so I am.  [3047] If then I, now, who am your Lord and Master,
   have washed for you your feet, how needful is it that ye should wash
   one another's feet!  [25] [3048] This have I given you as an example,
   that as I have done to you so ye should do [26] also.  [3049] Verily,
   verily, I say unto you, No servant is greater than his lord; nor an
   [27] apostle greater than he that sent him.  [3050] If ye know that, ye
   are happy if ye do it.  [28] [3051] My saying this [3052] is not for
   all of you:  for I know whom I have chosen:  but that the scripture
   might be fulfilled, He that eateth with me bread lifted against me his
   [29] heel.  [3053] Henceforth I say unto you before it come to pass,
   that, when it cometh to [30] pass, ye may believe that I am he.  [3054]
   Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever receiveth whomsoever I send
   receiveth me; and whosoever receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

   [31] [3055] Who is the great one, he that sitteth, or he that serveth?
   is it not he that sitteth?  [32] [3056] I am among you as he that
   serveth.  [3057] But ye are they that have continued with me [33] in my
   temptations; [3058] I promise [3059] you, as my Father promised [3060]
   me, the kingdom, that ye may eat and drink at the table of my kingdom.

   [34] [3061] And the first day [3062] came, the feast of unleavened
   bread, on which the Jews were [35] wont [3063] to sacrifice [3064] the
   passover.  [3065] And Jesus sent two of his disciples, Cephas and John,
   and said unto them, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may
   eat.  [36, 37] [3066] And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we
   make ready for thee?  [3067] He said unto them, Go, enter the city;
   [3068] and at the time of your entering, there shall meet you a man
   bearing a pitcher of water; [3069] follow him, and the place where he
   entereth, say [38] to such an one, the master of the house, [3070] Our
   Master saith, My time is come, and [Arabic, p. 169] at thy house I keep
   the passover.  [3071] Where then is the lodging-place where [39] I
   shall eat with my disciples?  [3072] And he will shew you a large upper
   room [40] spread and made ready:  [3073] there then make ready for us.
   [3074] And his two disciples went out, and came to the city, and found
   as he had said unto them:  and they made ready the passover as he had
   said unto them.

   [41] [3075] And when the evening was come, and the time arrived, Jesus
   came and reclined, [42] and the twelve apostles with him.  [3076] And
   he said unto them, With desire I have [43] desired to eat this passover
   with you before I suffer:  [3077] I say unto you, that henceforth I
   shall not eat it, until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

   [44] [3078] Jesus said that, and was agitated [3079] in his spirit, and
   testified, and said, Verily, [45] verily, I say unto you, One of you,
   he that eateth with me, shall betray me.  [3080] And they were very
   sorrowful; and they began to say unto him, one after another of [46]
   them, Can it be I, Lord?  [3081] He answered and said unto them, One of
   the twelve, [47] he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, will
   betray me.  [3082] And lo, the hand of [48] him that betrayeth me is on
   the table.  [3083] And the Son of man goeth, as it is written of him:
   woe then to that man by whose hand the Son of man is betrayed! for it
   [49] would have been better for that man had he not been born.  [3084]
   And the disciples [50] looked one on another, for they knew not to whom
   he referred; [3085] and they began to search among themselves, who that
   might be who was to do this.

   Section XLV.

   [1, 2] [Arabic, p. 170] [3086] And one of his disciples was sitting
   [3087] in his bosom, he whom Jesus loved.  [3088] To him Simon Cephas
   beckoned, that he should ask him who this was, concerning [3] whom he
   spake.  [3089] And that disciple leaned [3090] on Jesus' breast, and
   said unto him, [4] My Lord, who is this?  [3091] Jesus answered and
   said, He to whom I shall dip bread, and give it.  And Jesus dipped
   bread, and gave to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.  [5] [3092] And
   after the bread, Satan entered him.  And Jesus said unto him, What thou
   [6] desirest to do, hasten the doing of it.  [3093] And no man of them
   that sat knew why he [7] said this unto him.  [3094] And some of them
   thought, because Judas had the box, that he was bidding him buy what
   would be needed for the feast; or, that he might pay [8] something to
   the poor.  [3095] Judas the betrayer answered and said, Can it be I, my
   [9] Master?  Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said.  [3096] And Judas
   took the bread straightway, and went forth without:  and it was still
   night.

   [10] [3097] And Jesus said, Now is the Son of man being glorified,
   [3098] and God is being glorified [3099] [11] in him; [3100] and if God
   is glorified in him, God also will glorify him in him, and straightway
   will glorify him.

   [12] [3101] And while they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed,
   and divided; [3102] and he [13] gave to his disciples, and said unto
   them, Take and eat; this is my body.  [3103] And he [Arabic, p. 171]
   took a cup, and gave thanks, and blessed, and gave them, [3104] and
   said, Take [14, 15] and drink of it, all of you.  [3105] And they drank
   of it, all of them.  [3106] And he said unto them, [3107] This is my
   blood, the new covenant, that is shed for many for the [16] forgiveness
   of sins.  [3108] I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this,
   the juice of the vine, until the day in which I drink [3109] with you
   new wine in the kingdom of [17] God.  [3110] And thus do ye in
   remembrance of me.  [3111] And Jesus said unto Simon, Simon, [18]
   behold, Satan asketh that he may sift you like wheat:  [3112] but I
   entreat [3113] for thee, that thou lose not thy faith: [3114]   and do
   thou, at some time, turn [3115] and strengthen thy brethren.

   [19] [3116] My children, another little while am I with you.  And ye
   shall seek me:  and as [20] I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye
   cannot come; I say unto you now also.  [3117] A new commandment I give
   you, that ye may love one another; and as I have loved [21] you, so
   shall ye also love one another.  [3118] By this shall every man know
   that ye are [22] my disciples, if ye have love one to another.  [3119]
   Simon Cephas said unto him, Our Lord, whither goest thou?  Jesus
   answered and said unto him, Whither I go, thou canst not now follow me;
   but later thou shalt come.

   [23] [3120] Then said Jesus unto them, Ye all shall desert [3121] me
   this night: [3122]   it is written, I [24] will smite the shepherd, and
   the sheep of the flock shall be scattered.  [3123] But after my [25]
   rising, I shall go before you into Galilee.  [3124] Simon Cephas
   answered and said unto [26] him, My Lord, if every man desert thee, I
   shall at no time desert thee.  [3125] I am with thee ready for
   imprisonment and for death.  [3126] And my life will I give up for
   thee.  [27] [Arabic, p. 172] [3127] Jesus said unto him, Wilt thou give
   up thy life for me?  [3128] Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Thou shalt
   to-day, during this night, before the cock crow [28] twice, three times
   deny me, that thou knowest me not.  [3129] But Cephas said the more,
   [3130] Even if it lead to [3131] death with thee, I shall not deny
   thee, my Lord.  And in like manner said all the disciples also.

   [29] [3132] Then Jesus said unto them, Let not your hearts be troubled:
   [3133]   believe in God, [30] and believe in me.  [3134] The stations
   [3135] in my Father's house are many, else I should [31] have told
   [3136] you.  I [3137] go to prepare for you a place.  [3138] And if I
   go to prepare for you a place, I shall return again, and take you unto
   me:  and so where I am, there ye [32, 33] shall be also.  [3139] And
   the place that I go ye know, [3140] and the way ye know. [3141]
   [3142] Thomas said unto him, Our Lord, we know not whither thou goest;
   and how is the way for [34] us to the knowledge of that? [3143]
   [3144] Jesus said unto him, I am the way, and the truth, [35] and the
   life:  and no man cometh unto my Father, but through me.  [3145] And if
   ye had known me, ye should have known my Father:  and from henceforth
   ye know [3146] him, [36] and have seen him.  [3147] Philip [3148] said
   unto him, Our Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth [37] us.
   [3149] Jesus said unto him, Have I been all this time with you, and
   dost thou not know [3150] me, Philip? [3151] whosoever hath seen me
   hath seen the Father; how then sayest [38] thou, Shew us the Father?
   [3152] Believest thou not that I am in my Father, and my Father in me?
   and the saying that I say, I say not of myself:  but my Father who
   dwelleth in [39] me, he doeth these deeds.  [3153] Believe that I am in
   my Father, and my Father in me:  [40] [Arabic, p. 173] or else believe
   for the sake of the deeds.  [3154] Verily, verily, I say unto you,
   Whosoever believeth in me, the deeds that I do shall he do also; and
   [41] more than that shall he do:  I go unto the Father.  [3155] And
   what ye shall ask in my [42] name, I shall do unto you, that the Father
   may be glorified in his Son.  [3156] And if ye [43, 44] ask me [3157]
   in my name, I will do it.  [3158] If ye love me, keep my commandments.
   [3159] And I will entreat of my Father, and he will send unto you
   another Paraclete, that he [45] may be with you for ever, even the
   Spirit of truth:  [3160] whom the world cannot receive; for it hath not
   seen him, nor known him:  but ye know him; for he hath dwelt [3161]
   [46] with you, and is in you.  [3162] I will not leave you orphans:  I
   will come unto you.  [47] [3163] Another little while, and the world
   seeth me not; but ye see me that I live, and ye [48] shall live also.
   [3164] And in that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in
   me, and I in you.

   Section XLVI.

   [1] [3165] Whosoever hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is
   that loveth me:  and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and
   I will love him, and will [2] shew myself unto him.  [3166] Judas (not
   Iscariot) said unto him, My Lord, what is the [3] purpose of thy
   intention to shew thyself to us, and not to the world?  [3167] Jesus
   answered and said unto him, Whosoever loveth me will keep my word:  and
   my Father will love him, and to him will we come, and make our [3168]
   abode with him.  [4] [3169] But he that loveth me not keepeth not my
   word:  and this word that ye hear is not my word, but the Father's
   which sent me.

   [5, 6] [3170] This have I spoken unto you, while I was yet with you.
   [3171] But the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, whom my Father will send in
   my name, he will teach you everything, and [7] [Arabic, p. 174] he will
   bring to your remembrance all that I say unto you.  [3172] Peace I
   leave you; my peace I give unto you:  and not as this world giveth,
   give I unto you.  [8] [3173] Let your heart not be troubled, [3174] nor
   fearful.  Ye heard that I said unto you, that I go away, and come unto
   you.  If [3175] ye loved me, ye would rejoice, that I go away to my [9]
   Father:  for my Father is greater than I.  [3176] And now I say unto
   you before it come [10] to pass, that, when it cometh to pass, ye may
   believe me.  [3177] Now I will not speak with you much:  the Archon of
   the world will come, and he will have nothing in [11] me:  [3178] but
   that the world may know that I love my Father, and as my Father charged
   me, so I do.

   [12] [3179] And he said unto them, When I sent you without purses, or
   wallets, and shoes, [3180] [13] lacked ye perchance anything?  They
   said unto him, Nothing.  [3181] He said unto them, Henceforth,
   whosoever hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise the wallet also:
   and whosoever hath not a sword, shall sell his garment, and buy for
   himself a [14] sword.  [3182] I say unto you, that this scripture also
   must be fulfilled in me, that I should be reckoned [3183] with the
   transgressors:  for all that is said of me is fulfilled in [15] me.
   [3184] His disciples said unto him, Our Lord, lo, here are two swords.
   He said [16] unto them, They are sufficient.  [3185] Arise, let us go
   hence.  And they arose, and praised, and went forth, and went,
   according to their custom, to the mount of Olives, he and his
   disciples.

   [17] [3186] And he said unto them, I am the true vine, and my Father is
   the husbandman.  [18] [3187] Every branch that produceth not fruit in
   me, he taketh it:  and that which giveth fruit, [19] he cleanseth it,
   that it may give much fruit.  [3188] Ye are already clean because of
   the word [20] that I have spoken unto you.  [3189] Abide in me, and I
   in you.  And as the branch of the [Arabic, p. 175] vine cannot produce
   fruit of itself, if it be not abiding in the vine; so too ye [21] also,
   if ye abide not in me.  [3190] I am the vine, and ye are the branches:
   He then that abideth in me, and I in him, he giveth much fruit:  for
   without me ye cannot [22] do anything.  [3191] And if a man abide not
   in me, he is cast without, like a withered [23] branch; and it is
   gathered, and cast [3192] into the fire, that it may be burned.  [3193]
   If ye abide in me, and my word abide in you, everything that ye desire
   to ask shall be [24] done unto you.  [3194] And herein is the Father
   glorified, that ye may give much fruit; [25] and ye shall be my
   disciples.  [3195] And as my Father loved me, I loved you also:  [26]
   abide in my love.  [3196] If ye keep my commands, ye shall abide in my
   love; as I have [27] kept my Father's commands, and abode in his love.
   [3197] I have spoken that unto you, [28] that my joy [3198] may be in
   you, and your joy [3199] be fulfilled.  [3200] This is my commandment,
   [29] that ye love one another, as I loved you.  [3201] And no love is
   greater than this, namely, [30] that a man should give his life for his
   friends.  [3202] Ye are my friends, if ye do all that [31] I command
   you.  [3203] I call you not now servants; for the servant knoweth not
   what his lord doeth:  my friends have I now called you; for everything
   that I heard from [32] my Father I have made known unto you.  [3204] Ye
   did not choose [3205] me, but I chose I you, and appointed you, that ye
   also should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should [3206] [33]
   abide; and that all that ye shall ask my Father in my name, he may
   [3207] give you.  [3208] This [34] I command [3209] you, that ye love
   one another.  [3210] And if the world hate you, know that [35] before
   you it hated me.  [3211] If then ye were of the world, the world would
   love its own:  but ye are not of the world:  I chose you out of the
   world:  therefore the world [36] [Arabic, p. 176] hateth you.  [3212]
   Remember the word that I said unto you, that no servant is greater than
   his lord.  And if they persecuted [3213] me, you also will they [37]
   persecute; [3214] and if they kept my word, your word also will they
   keep.  [3215] But all these things will they do unto you for my name's
   sake, for they have not known [3216] him [38] that sent me.  [3217] And
   if I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:  [39] but
   now they have no excuse for their sins.  [3218] Whosoever hateth me,
   also hateth my [40] Father.  [3219] And if I had not done the deeds
   before them that no other man did, they would not have had sin:  but
   now they have seen and hated me and my Father [41] also:  that the word
   may be fulfilled that is written in their law, [3220] They hated me for
   [42] nothing.  [3221] But when the Paraclete is come, whom I will send
   unto you from my Father, even the Spirit of truth, which goeth forth
   from my Father, he shall bear witness of [43] me:  [3222] and ye also
   bear witness, because from the beginning ye have been with me.

   [44, 45] [3223] I have said that unto you, that ye may not stumble.
   [3224]   [3225] And they shall put you out of their synagogues:  and
   there cometh an [3226] hour when every one that killeth [46] you shall
   think that he hath offered unto God an offering.  [3227] And they will
   do that, [47] because they do not know me, nor my Father.  [3228] I
   have said that unto you, so that [48] when its time is come, ye may
   remember it, that I told you.  [3229] And this hitherto I said not unto
   you, because I was with you.  But [3230] now I go unto him that sent
   me; and no [49] man of you asketh me whither I go.  [3231] I have said
   that unto you now, and grief hath [50] come and taken possession of
   your hearts   [3232] But I say the truth unto you; It is better [3233]
   for you that I go away:  for if I go not away, the Paraclete will not
   come unto you; [51] [Arabic, p. 177] but if I go away, I will send him
   unto you.  [3234] And when he cometh, he will reprove the world for
   sin, and for righteousness, and for judgement:  [52, 53] for sin,
   [3235] because they have not believed in me; [3236] and for
   righteousness, because I go [54] to my Father; [3237] and for
   judgement, because [3238] the Archon of this world hath been [55]
   judged.  [3239] And further have I many things to speak unto you, but
   ye cannot tarry [3240] [56] now.  [3241] Howbeit [3242] when the Spirit
   of truth is come, he will remind [3243] you of all the truth:  he will
   say nothing from himself; but everything that he heareth, that shall
   [57] he say:  and he shall make known unto you the things that are to
   be.  [3244] And he shall [58] glorify me; for from me shall he take and
   shew you.  [3245] All that my Father hath is mine:  therefore said I
   unto you, that he taketh [3246] of mine, and shall shew [3247] you.

   [1] [3248] A little while, and ye shall not behold me; and a little
   while again, and ye shall [2] behold me; because I go to the Father.
   [3249] His disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that
   he hath said unto us, A little while, and ye shall not behold me; and a
   little while again, and ye shall behold me:  and, I go to my [3]
   Father?  [3250] And they said, What is this little while that he hath
   said?  We know not [4] what he speaketh.  [3251] And Jesus perceived
   that they were seeking to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye inquire
   among yourselves concerning this, that I said unto you, A little while,
   and ye behold me not, and a little while again, and ye shall [5] behold
   me?  [3252] Verily, verily, [3253] I say unto you, that ye shall weep
   and grieve, but the world shall rejoice:  and ye shall be sorrowful,
   but your grief shall turn [3254] to joy.

   [6] [3255] For, a woman when the time is come for her that she should
   bring forth, the arrival of the day of her bringing forth distresseth
   her:  but whenever she hath brought forth a son, she remembereth not
   her distress, for joy at the birth of a man into the [7] world.  [3256]
   And ye now also grieve:  but I shall see you, and your hearts shall
   rejoice, [8] [Arabic, p. 178] and your joy no man taketh from you.
   [3257] And in that day ye shall ask me nothing.  And verily, verily,
   [3258] I say unto you, All that ye ask my Father in my name, he will
   give you.  [3259] Hitherto ye have asked nothing [9] in my name:  ask,
   and ye shall receive, that your joy may be complete.

   [10] [3260] I have spoken unto you now in ænigmas: [3261]   but there
   will come an hour when [3262] I shall not speak to you in ænigmas,
   [3263] but shall reveal unto you the Father plainly, [11] in that day
   when [3264] ye shall ask in my name:  [3265] and I say not unto you,
   that I shall [12] entreat the Father for you; [3266] for the Father
   loveth you, because ye have loved me, [13] and have believed that I
   came forth from my Father.  [3267] I came forth from my Father, and
   came into the world:  and I leave the world, and go unto my Father.
   [14] [3268] His disciples said unto him, Lo, thy speech is now plain,
   and thou hast not said one [15] thing in an ænigma.  [3269] Now, lo, we
   know that thou knowest everything, and needest not that any man should
   ask thee:  and by this we believe that thou camest forth [16, 17] from
   God.  [3270] Jesus said unto them, Believe that an hour cometh, [3271]
   and lo, it hath come, and ye shall be scattered, every one of you to
   his place, and shall leave me [18] alone:  and yet I am not alone,
   because the Father is with me.  [3272] This have I said unto you, that
   in me ye may have peace.  And in the world trouble shall overtake you:
   but be of good courage; for I have overcome the world.

   [19] [3273] This said Jesus, and lifted up his eyes unto heaven, and
   said, My Father, the hour [20] is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son
   may glorify thee:  [3274] as thou gavest him authority [21] over all
   flesh, that all that thou hast given him, he might give them [3275]
   eternal life.  [3276] And this is eternal life, that they should [3277]
   know that thou alone art true God, and that he [22] [Arabic, p. 179]
   whom thou didst send is Jesus the Messiah. [3278]   [3279] I glorified
   thee in the earth, [23] and the work which thou gavest me to do I have
   accomplished.  [3280] And now glorify thou me, O Father, beside thee,
   with that glory which I had with thee [24] before the world was.
   [3281] I made known thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the
   world:  thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept
   [25, 26] thy word.  [3282] Now they [3283] know that all that thou hast
   given me is from thee:  [3284] and the sayings which thou gavest me I
   have given unto them; and they received them, and knew of a truth that
   I came forth from thee, and believed that thou didst send me.  [27]
   [3285] And I ask for their sake:  and my asking is not for the world,
   but for those whom [28] thou hast given me; for they are thine:  [3286]
   and all that is mine is thine, and all that is [29] thine is mine:  and
   I am glorified in them.  [3287] And now I am not in the world, and they
   are in the world, and I come to thee.  My [3288] holy Father, keep them
   in thy [30] name which thou hast given unto me, that they may be one,
   as we are.  [3289] When I was with them in the world, I kept them in
   thy name:  and I kept those whom thou gavest unto me:  and no man of
   them hath perished, but the son of perdition; that [31] the scripture
   might be fulfilled.  [3290] Now I come to thee:  and this I say in the
   world, [32] that my joy may be complete in them.  [3291] I have given
   them thy word; and the world [33] hated them, because they were not of
   the world, as I was not of the world.  [3292] And I ask not this, that
   thou take them from the world, but that thou keep them from the [34,
   35] evil one.  [3293] They were not of the world, as I was not of the
   world.  [3294] O Father, sanctify [36] them in thy truth:  for thy word
   is truth.  [3295] And as thou didst send me into the world, I [37]
   [Arabic, p. 180] also send them into the world.  [3296] And for their
   sake I sanctify myself, that they [38] also may be sanctified in the
   truth.  [3297] Neither for these alone do I ask, but for [39] the sake
   of them that believe in me through their word; [3298] that they may be
   all one; as thou art in me, and I in thee, and so they also shall be
   one in us:  that the world [40] may believe that thou didst send me.
   [3299] And the glory which thou hast given unto [41] me I have given
   unto them; [3300] that they may be one, as we are one; I in them, and
   thou in me, that they may be perfect into [3301] one; and that the
   world may know that [42] thou didst send me, and that I [3302] loved
   them, as thou lovedst me.  [3303] Father, and those whom thou hast
   given me, I wish that, where I am, they may be with me also; that they
   may behold my glory, which thou hast given me:  for thou lovedst me
   before [43] the foundation [3304] of the world.  [3305] My righteous
   Father, [3306] and the world knew thee not, [44] but I know thee; and
   they knew that thou didst send me; and I made known unto them thy name,
   and will make it known to them; [3307] that the love wherewith thou
   lovedst me may be in them, and I shall [3308] be in them.

   Section XLVIII.

   [1] [3309] This said Jesus, and went forth with his disciples to a
   place which was called Gethsemane, [3310] on [3311] the side that is in
   the plain [3312] of Kidron, the mountain, [3313] the place [2] in which
   was a garden; and he entered thither, he and his disciples.  [3314] And
   Judas the [3] betrayer knew that place:  for Jesus oft-times met with
   his disciples there.  [3315] And when Jesus came to the place, he said
   to his disciples, Sit ye here, so that I may go and pray; [4, 5]
   [Arabic, p. 181] and pray ye, that ye enter not into temptations.
   [3316] And he took with him Cephas and the sons of Zebedee together,
   James and John; and he began to [6] look sorrowful, and to be anxious.
   [3317] And he said unto them, My soul is distressed unto [7] death:
   abide ye here, and watch with me.  [3318] And he withdrew from them a
   little, [8] the space of a stone's throw; [3319] and he kneeled, [3320]
   and fell on his face, and prayed, so [9] that, if it were possible,
   this hour might pass [3321] him.  [3322] And he said, Father, thou art
   able for all things; if thou wilt, let this cup pass me:  [3323] but
   let not my will be done, [10] but let thy will be done.  [3324] And he
   came to his disciples, and found them sleeping; [11] and he said unto
   Cephas, Simon, didst thou sleep?  [3325] Could ye thus not for one hour
   [12] watch with me?  [3326] Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
   temptations:  the spirit is [13] willing and ready, but the body is
   weak. [3327]   [3328] And he went again a second time, and prayed, and
   said, My Father, if it is not possible with regard to [3329] this cup
   that it pass, [14] except I drink it, thy will be done.  [3330] And he
   returned again, and found his disciples sleeping, for their eyes were
   heavy from their grief and anxiety; and they knew not [15] what to say
   to him.  [3331] And he left them, and went away again, and prayed a
   third [16] time, and said the very same word.  [3332] And there
   appeared unto him an angel from [17] heaven, encouraging him.  [3333]
   And being afraid [3334] he prayed continuously: [3335]   and his sweat
   [3336] [18] [Arabic, p. 182] became like a stream of blood, and fell on
   the ground.  [3337] Then he rose from [19] his prayer, and came to his
   disciples, and found them sleeping.  [3338] And he [20] said unto them,
   Sleep now, and rest:  [3339] the end hath arrived, [3340] and the hour
   hath come; [21] and behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands
   of sinners.  [3341] Arise, let us go: [3342]   for he hath come that
   betrayeth me.

   [22] [3343] And while he was still speaking, came Judas the betrayer,
   one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude carrying lanterns and
   torches [3344] and swords and staves, from the chief priests and
   scribes and elders of the people, and with him the footsoldiers [23] of
   the Romans. [3345]   [3346] And Judas the betrayer gave them a sign,
   and said, He whom I shall kiss, he is he:  take him with care, [3347]
   and lead him away. [3348]

   [24] [3349] And Jesus, because he knew everything that should come upon
   him, went forth [25] unto them.  [3350] And immediately Judas the
   betrayer came to Jesus, and said, Peace, [26] my Master; and kissed
   him.  [3351] And Jesus said unto him, Judas, with a kiss betrayest [27]
   thou the Son of man?  [3352] Was it for that thou camest, my friend?
   And Jesus said [28] to those that came unto him, Whom seek ye?  [3353]
   They said unto him, Jesus the Nazarene.  Jesus said unto them, I am
   he.  And Judas the betrayer also was standing [29] with them.  [3354]
   And when Jesus said unto them, I am he, they retreated backward, and
   [30] fell to the ground.  [3355] And Jesus asked them again, Whom seek
   ye?  They answered, [31] Jesus the Nazarene.  [3356] Jesus said unto
   them, I told you that I am he:  and if ye seek [32] me, let these go
   away:  that the word might be fulfilled which he spake, [3357] Of those
   [33] [Arabic, p. 183] whom thou hast given me I lost not even one.
   [3358] Then came those that were with Judas, and seized Jesus, and took
   him.

   [34] [3359] And when his disciples saw what happened, they said, Our
   Lord, shall we smite [35] them with swords?  [3360] And Simon Cephas
   had a sword, and he drew it, and struck the servant of the chief
   priest, and cut off his right ear.  And the name of that servant [36]
   was Malchus.  [3361] Jesus said unto Cephas, The cup which my Father
   hath given [37] me, shall I not drink it?  [3362] Put the sword into
   its sheath:  for all that take with [3363] the [38] sword shall die by
   the sword.  [3364] Thinkest [3365] thou that I am not able to ask of my
   [39] Father, and he shall now raise up for me more than [3366] twelve
   tribes of angels?  [3367] Then [40] how should the scriptures which
   were spoken be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  [3368] Your [41] leave
   in this. [3369]   [3370] And he touched the ear of him that was struck,
   and healed it.  And in that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, As they
   come out against a thief are ye come out against me with swords and
   staves to take me?  Daily was I with you in [42] the temple sitting
   teaching, and ye took me not:  [3371] but this is your hour, and the
   power [43] of darkness.  [3372] And that was, that the scriptures of
   the prophets might be fulfilled.

   [44] [3373] Then the disciples all left him, and fled.  And the
   footsoldiers and the officers [45] and the soldiers [3374] of the Jews
   seized Jesus, and came.  [3375] And a certain [3376] young man [46]
   followed him, and he was wrapped in a towel, naked:  [3377] and they
   seized him; so he [47] [Arabic, p. 184] left the towel, and fled
   naked.  [3378] Then they took Jesus, and bound him, and brought him to
   Annas first; because he was the father in law of Caiaphas, [48] who was
   chief priest that year.  [3379] And Caiaphas was he that counselled the
   Jews, that it was necessary that one man should die instead of the
   people.

   [49] [3380] And Simon Cephas and one of the other disciples followed
   Jesus.  And the chief [50] priest knew that disciple, and he entered
   with Jesus into the court; [3381] but Simon was standing without at the
   door.  And that other disciple, whom the chief priest knew, [51] went
   out and spake unto her that kept the door, and she brought Simon in.
   [3382] And when the maid that kept the door saw Simon, she looked
   stedfastly at him, and said unto him, Art not thou also one of the
   disciples of this man, I mean Jesus the [52] Nazarene?  [3383] But he
   denied, and said, Woman, I know him not, neither know I even [53] what
   thou sayest.  [3384] And the servants and the soldiers rose, and made a
   fire in the [54] middle of the court, that they might warm themselves;
   for it was cold.  [3385] And when [55] the fire burned up, they sat
   down around it.  [3386] And Simon also came, and sat down with them to
   warm himself, that he might see the end of what should happen.

   Section XLIX.

   [1, 2] [3387] And the chief priest asked Jesus about his disciples, and
   about his doctrine. [3388]   [3389] And Jesus said unto him, I was
   speaking [3390] openly to the people; and I ever taught in the
   synagogue, and in the temple, where all the Jews gather; and I have
   spoken nothing in [3] [Arabic, p. 185] secret.  [3391] Why askest thou
   me? ask those that have heard, what I spake unto [4] them:  for they
   know all that I said.  [3392] And when he had said that, one of the
   soldiers which were standing there struck the cheek [3393] of Jesus,
   and said unto him, [5] Dost thou thus answer the chief priest?  [3394]
   Jesus answered and said unto him, If I [6] have spoken evil, bear
   witness of evil: [3395]   but if well, why didst thou smite me?  [3396]
   And Annas sent Jesus bound unto Caiaphas the chief priest.

   [7] [3397] And when Jesus went out, Simon Cephas was standing in the
   outer court warming [8] himself.  [3398] And that maid saw him again,
   and began to say to those that stood [9] by, This man also was there
   with Jesus the Nazarene.  [3399] And those that stood by [10] came
   forward and said to Cephas, Truly thou art one of his disciples.
   [3400] And he [11] denied again with an oath, I know not the man.
   [3401] And after a little one of the servants of the chief priest, the
   kinsman of him whose ear Simon cut off, saw him; and [12] he disputed
   [3402] and said, Truly this man was with him:  [3403] and he also is a
   Galilæan; [13] and his speech resembles. [3404]   [3405] And he said
   unto Simon, Did not I see thee with him [14] in the garden?  [3406]
   Then began Simon to curse, [3407] and to swear, I know not this man
   [15] whom ye have mentioned.  [3408] And immediately, while he was
   speaking, the cock crew [16] twice.  [3409] And in that hour Jesus
   turned, he being without, and looked stedfastly at Cephas.  And Simon
   remembered the word of our Lord, which he said unto him, [17, 18]
   [3410] Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.  [3411]
   And Simon went forth without, and wept bitterly.

   [19] [Arabic, p. 186] [3412] And when the morning approached, the
   servants of all the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the
   people and all the multitude assembled, [20, 21] and made a plot;
   [3413] and they took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.  [3414]
   And they sought false witnesses who should witness against him, that
   they might put him to [22, 23] death, and they found not; [3415] but
   many false witnesses came, [3416] but their witness did not [24, 25]
   agree.  [3417] But at last there came two lying witnesses, [3418] and
   said, We heard him say, I will destroy this [3419] temple of God that
   is made with hands, and will build another not [26, 27] made with hands
   after three days.  [3420] And not even so did their witness agree.  But
   Jesus was silent.  [3421] And the chief priest rose in the midst, and
   asked Jesus, and said, [28] [3422] Answerest thou not a word concerning
   anything? what do these [3423] witness against [29, 30] thee?  [3424]
   But Jesus was silent, and answered him nothing.  [3425] And they took
   him up [31] into their assembly, [3426] and said unto him, If thou art
   the Messiah, tell us.  [3427] He said [32] unto them, If I tell you, ye
   will not believe me:  [3428] and if I ask you, ye will not answer [33]
   me a word, nor let me go.  [3429] And the chief priest answered and
   said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us
   whether thou art the Messiah, the [34, 35] Son of the living God.
   [3430] Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said that I am he.  [3431] They
   all said unto him, Then thou art now the Son of God?  Jesus said, Ye
   have said [36] that I am he.  [3432] I say unto you, that henceforth ye
   shall see the Son of man sitting [37] [Arabic, p. 187] at the right
   hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.  [3433] Then the
   [38] chief priest rent his tunic, [3434] and said, He hath blasphemed.
   [3435] And they all said, Why should we seek now witnesses? we have
   heard now the blasphemy from his mouth.  [39, 40] What then think ye?
   [3436] They all answered and said, He is worthy of death.  [3437] Then
   some of them drew near, and spat in his face, and struck him, and
   scoffed at him.  [41] [3438] And the soldiers struck him on his cheeks,
   [3439] and said, Prophesy unto us, thou Messiah:  [42] who is he that
   struck thee?  [3440] And many other things spake they falsely, [3441]
   and said against him.

   [43] [3442] And all of their assembly arose, [3443] and took Jesus, and
   brought him bound [3444] to [44] the prætorium, [3445] and delivered
   him up to Pilate the judge; [3446] but they entered not into the
   prætorium, that they might not be defiled when they should eat the
   passover.

   [45] [3447] And Jesus stood before the judge.  And Pilate went forth
   unto them without, and [46] said unto them, What accusation [3448] have
   ye against this man?  [3449] They answered and said unto him, If he had
   not been doing evils, neither should we have delivered [47] him up unto
   thee.  [3450] We found this man leading our people astray, and
   restraining from giving tribute to Cæsar, and saying of himself that he
   is the King, the Messiah.  [48] [3451] Pilate said unto them, Then take
   ye him, and judge him according to your law.  [Arabic, p. 188] The Jews
   said unto him, We have no authority to put a man to death:  [49] [3452]
   that the word might be fulfilled, which Jesus spake, when he made known
   by what manner of death he was to die.

   [50] [3453] And Pilate entered into the prætorium, and called Jesus,
   and said unto him, Art [51] thou the King of the Jews?  [3454] Jesus
   said unto him, Of thyself saidst thou this, or [52] did others tell it
   thee concerning me?  [3455] Pilate said unto him, Am I, forsooth,
   [3456] a Jew?  The sons of thy nation [3457] and the chief priests
   delivered thee unto me:  what [53] hast thou done?  [3458] Jesus said
   unto him, My kingdom is not of this world:  if my kingdom were of this
   world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be [54]
   delivered to the Jews:  now my kingdom is not from hence.  [3459]
   Pilate said unto him, Then thou art a king?  Jesus said unto him, Thou
   hast said that I am a king.  And for this was I born, and for this came
   I into the world, that I should bear witness [55] of the truth.  [3460]
   And every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.  Pilate said unto
   him, And what is the truth?  And when he said that, he went out again
   unto the Jews.

   Section L.

   [1] [3461] And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitude, I
   have not found [2] against this man anything.  [3462] But they cried
   out and said, He hath disquieted [3463] our people with his teaching in
   all Judæa, and he began [3464] from Galilee and unto this [3] place.
   [3465] And Pilate, when he heard the name of Galilee, asked, Is this
   man a Galilæan?  [4] [3466] And when he learned that he was under the
   jurisdiction of Herod, he sent him to Herod:  for he was in Jerusalem
   in those days.

   [5] [3467] And Herod, when he saw Jesus, rejoiced exceedingly:  for he
   had desired to see him for a long time, because he had heard regarding
   him many things; and he counted on [3468] [6] [Arabic, p. 189] seeing
   some sign from him.  [3469] And he questioned him with many words; but
   [7] Jesus answered him not a word.  [3470] And the scribes and chief
   priests were [8] standing by, and they accused him vehemently.  [3471]
   And Herod scoffed at him, he and his servants; and when he had scoffed
   at him, he clothed him in robes of scarlet, [9] and sent him to
   Pilate.  [3472] And on that day Pilate and Herod became friends, there
   having been [3473] enmity between them before that.

   [10, 11] [3474] And Pilate called the chief priests and the rulers of
   the people, [3475] and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as
   the perverter of your people:  and I have tried him before you, and
   have not found in this man any cause [3476] of all that ye [12] seek
   [3477] against him:  [3478] nor yet Herod:  for I sent him unto him;
   and he hath done [13] nothing for which he should deserve death.
   [3479] So now I will chastise him, and let [14, 15] him go.  [3480] The
   multitude all cried out and said, Take him from us, take him.  [3481]
   And [16] the chief priests and the elders accused him of many things.
   [3482] And during their [17] accusation he answered not a word.  [3483]
   Then Pilate said unto him, Hearest thou not [18] how many things they
   witness against thee?  [3484] And he answered him not, not even one
   word:  and Pilate marvelled at that.

   [19] [3485] And when the judge sat on his tribune, his wife sent unto
   him, and said unto him, See that thou have nothing to do with that
   righteous man:  for I have suffered much in my dream [3486] to-day
   because of him.

   [20] [3487] And at every feast the custom of the judge was to release
   to the people one [21] prisoner, him whom they would.  [3488] And there
   was in their prison a well-known prisoner, [22, 23] called Barabbas.
   [3489] And when they assembled, Pilate said unto them, [3490] Ye have a
   custom, that I should release unto you a prisoner at the passover:
   will ye that I [24] release unto you the King of the Jews?  [3491] And
   they all cried out and said, Release not [Arabic, p. 190] unto us this
   man, but release unto us Barabbas.  And this Barabbas was a [25]
   robber, [3492] who for sedition [3493] and murder, which was in the
   city, was cast into the [26] prison.  [3494] And all the people cried
   out and began to ask him to do as the custom was [27] that he should do
   with them.  [3495] And Pilate answered and said unto them, Whom will ye
   that I release unto you?  Barabbas, or Jesus which is called the
   Messiah, the [28] King of the Jews?  [3496] For Pilate knew that envy
   had moved them to deliver him up. [29] [3497] And the chief priests and
   the elders asked the multitudes to deliver Barabbas, and [30] to
   destroy Jesus.  [3498] The judge answered and said unto them, Whom of
   the two will [31] ye that I release unto you?  They said, Barabbas.
   [3499] Pilate said unto them, And [32] Jesus which is called the
   Messiah, what shall I do with him?  [3500] They all cried out [33] and
   said, Crucify him.  [3501] And Pilate spake to them again, for he
   desired to release [34] Jesus; [3502] but they cried out and said,
   Crucify him, crucify him, and release unto us [35] Barabbas.  [3503]
   And Pilate said unto them a third time, What evil hath this man done?
   I have not found in him any cause [3504] to necessitate death:  I will
   chastise him and [36] let him go.  [3505] But they increased in
   importunity [3506] with a loud voice, and asked him to crucify him.
   And their voice, and the voice of the chief priests, prevailed.  [37]
   [3507] Then Pilate released unto them that one who was cast into prison
   for sedition and murder, Barabbas, whom they asked for:  [3508] and he
   scourged Jesus with whips. [3509]

   [38] [3510] Then the footsoldiers of the judge took Jesus, and went
   into the prætorium, and [39] [Arabic, p. 191] gathered unto him all of
   the footsoldiers.  [3511] And they stripped him, and put on [40] him a
   scarlet cloak.  [3512] And they clothed him in garments of purple, and
   plaited [41] a crown of thorns, and placed it on his head, and a reed
   in his right hand; [3513] and while they mocked at him and laughed,
   they fell down on their knees before him, and bowed [42] down to [3514]
   him, and said, Hail, [3515] King of the Jews!  [3516] And they spat in
   his face, and took the reed from his hand, and struck him on his head,
   [3517] and smote his cheeks.  [43] [3518] And Pilate went forth without
   again, and said unto the Jews, I bring him forth to [44] you, that ye
   may know that I do not find, in examining [3519] him, even one crime.
   [3520]   [3521] And Jesus went forth without, wearing the crown of
   thorns and the purple garments.  [45] [3522] Pilate said unto them,
   Behold, the man!  And when the chief priests and the soldiers [3523]
   saw him, they cried out and said, Crucify him, crucify him.  Pilate
   said unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him:  for I find not a
   cause [3524] against [46] him.  [3525] The Jews said unto him, We have
   a law, and according to our law he deserves [47] death, because he made
   himself the Son of God.  [3526] And when Pilate heard this word, [48]
   his fear increased; [3527] and he entered again into the porch, and
   said to Jesus, Whence [49] art thou?  [3528] But Jesus answered him not
   a word.  Pilate said unto him, Speakest [3529] thou not unto me?
   knowest thou not that I have authority to release thee, and have [50]
   authority to crucify thee?  [3530] Jesus said unto him, Thou hast not
   any [3531] authority over me, if thou wert not given it from above:
   therefore the sin of him that delivered [51] me up unto thee is greater
   than thy sin.  [3532] And for this word Pilate wished to release him:
   but the Jews cried out, If thou let him go, thou art not a friend of
   Cæsar:  for every one that maketh himself a king is against Cæsar.

   [1] [Arabic, p. 192] [3533] And when Pilate heard this saying, he took
   Jesus out, and sat on the tribune in the place which was called the
   pavement of stones, but in the Hebrew [2] called Gabbatha.  [3534] And
   that day was the Friday of the passover:  and it had reached [3] about
   the sixth hour. [3535]   [3536] And he said to the Jews, Behold, your
   King!  And they cried out, Take him, take him, crucify him, crucify
   him.  Pilate said unto them, Shall I crucify your King?  The chief
   priests said unto him, We have no king except [4] Cæsar.  [3537] And
   Pilate, when he saw it, and [3538] he was gaining nothing, but the
   tumult was increasing, took water, and washed his hands before the
   multitude, and said, I [5] am innocent of the blood of this innocent
   man:  ye shall know. [3539]   [3540] And all the people [6] answered
   and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.  [3541] Then Pilate
   commanded to grant them their request; and delivered up Jesus to be
   crucified, according to their wish.

   [7] [3542] Then Judas the betrayer, when he saw Jesus wronged, went and
   returned the [8] thirty pieces of money to the chief priests and the
   elders, [3543] and said, I have sinned in my betraying innocent blood.
   And they said unto him, And we, what must we do? [9] know thou.  [3544]
   And he threw down the money in the temple, and departed; and he [10]
   went away [3545] and hanged [3546] himself.  [3547] And the chief
   priests took the money, and said, We have not authority to cast it into
   the place of the offering, [3548] for it is the price [11] of blood.
   [3549] And they took counsel, and bought with it the plain of the
   potter, for [12] the burial of strangers.  [3550] Therefore that plain
   was called, The field of blood, unto [13] [Arabic, p. 193] this day.
   [3551] Therein [3552] was fulfilled the saying in the prophet which
   said, I took thirty pieces of money, the price of the precious one,
   which was fixed [14] by the children of Israel; [3553] and I paid them
   for the plain of the potter, as the Lord commanded me.

   [15] [3554] And the Jews took Jesus, and went away to crucify him.
   [3555] And when he bare his [16] cross and went out, they stripped him
   of those purple and scarlet garments which he [17] had on, and put on
   him his own garments.  [3556] And while they were going with him, they
   found a man, a Cyrenian, coming from the country, named Simon, the
   father of Alexander and Rufus:  [3557] and they compelled this man to
   bear the cross of Jesus.  [18] [3558] And they took the cross and laid
   it upon him, that he might bear it, and come after Jesus; and Jesus
   went, and his cross behind him.

   [19] [3559] And there followed him much people, and women which were
   lamenting and [20] raving. [3560]   [3561] But Jesus turned unto them
   and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not [21] for me:  weep for
   yourselves, and for your children.  [3562] Days are coming, when they
   shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that bare not, and the
   breasts [22] that gave not suck.  [3563] Then shall they begin to say
   to the mountains, Fall on us; and [23] to the hills, Cover us.  [3564]
   For if they do so in the green tree, [3565] what shall be in the dry?

   [24] [3566] And they brought with Jesus two others of the malefactors,
   [3567] to be put to death.

   [25] [3568] And when they came unto a certain place called The skull,
   and called in the Hebrew Golgotha, they crucified him there:  [3569]
   they crucified with him these two [26] malefactors, one on his right,
   and the other on his left.  [3570] And the scripture was [27] [Arabic,
   p. 194] fulfilled, which saith, He was numbered with the
   transgressors.  [3571] And they gave him to drink wine and myrrh, and
   vinegar which had been mixed with the myrrh; [3572] and he tasted, and
   would not drink; and he received it not.

   [28] [3573] And the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his
   garments, and cast lots for them in four parts, to every party of the
   soldiers a part; and his tunic was [29] without sewing, from the top
   woven throughout.  [3574] And they said one to another, Let us not rend
   it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be:  and the scripture was
   fulfilled, which saith,

   They divided my garments among them,

   And cast the lot for my vesture.

   [30, 31] [3575] This the soldiers did.  And they sat and guarded him
   there.  [3576] And Pilate wrote on a tablet the cause of his death, and
   put it on the wood of the cross above his head. [3577]   And there was
   written upon it thus:  This is Jesus the Nazarene, the King of the [32]
   Jews.  [3578] And this tablet [3579] read many of the Jews:  for the
   place where Jesus was crucified was near the city:  and it was written
   in Hebrew and Greek and Latin.  [33] [3580] And the chief priests said
   unto Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, He it is [34] that
   [3581] said, I am the King of the Jews.  [3582] Pilate said unto them,
   What hath been [35] written hath been written. [3583]   [3584] And the
   people were standing beholding; and they [36] that passed by were
   reviling [3585] him, and shaking [3586] their heads, and saying, [3587]
   Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, [3588]
   save thyself if thou art the Son [37] of God, and come down from the
   cross.  [3589] And in like manner the chief priests and the [Arabic, p.
   195] scribes and the elders and the Pharisees derided him, and laughed
   one with [38, 39] another, and said, [3590] The saviour of others
   cannot save himself.  [3591] If he is the Messiah, the chosen of God,
   and the King of Israel, [3592] let him come down now from the [40]
   cross, that we may see, and believe in him.  [3593] He that relieth on
   God--let him deliver him [41] now, if he is pleased with him:  for he
   said, I am the Son of God.  [3594] And the soldiers [42] also scoffed
   at him in that they came near unto him, [3595] and brought him vinegar,
   and [43] said unto him, If thou art the King of the Jews, save
   thyself.  [3596] And likewise the two robbers [3597] also that were
   crucified with him reproached him.

   [44] [3598] And one of those two malefactors who were crucified with
   him reviled him, and [45] said, If thou art the Messiah, save thyself,
   and save us also.  [3599] But his comrade rebuked him, and said, Dost
   thou not even fear God, being thyself also in this [46] condemnation?
   [3600] And we with justice, and as we deserved, and according to our
   deed, [3601] have we been rewarded:  but this man hath not done
   anything unlawful.  [47] [3602] And he said unto Jesus, Remember me, my
   Lord, when thou comest in thy kingdom.  [48] [3603] Jesus said unto
   him, Verily [3604] I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in
   Paradise.

   [49] [3605] And there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
   mother's sister, [3606] [50] Mary [3607] that was related to Clopas,
   and Mary Magdalene.  [3608] And Jesus saw his mother, and that disciple
   whom he loved standing by; and he said to his mother, [51] Woman,
   behold, thy son!  [3609] And he said to that disciple, Behold, thy
   mother!  And from that hour that disciple took her unto himself.

   [52] [Arabic, p. 196] [3610] And from the sixth hour [3611] darkness
   was on all the land unto the ninth [53] hour, [3612] and the sun became
   dark.  [3613] And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
   and said, Yail, Yaili, [3614] why hast thou forsaken me? which [3615]
   is, My [54] God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  [3616] And some of
   those that stood there, when they heard, said, [3617] This man called
   Elijah.

   Section LII.

   [1] [3618] And after that, Jesus knew that all things were finished;
   and that the scripture [2] might be accomplished, he said, I thirst.
   [3619] And there was set a vessel full of vinegar:  and in that hour
   one of them hasted, and took a sponge, and filled it with that [3]
   vinegar, [3620] and fastened it on a reed, and brought it near [3621]
   his mouth to give him a [4] drink.  [3622] And when Jesus had taken
   that vinegar, he said, Everything is finished.  [5] [3623] But the rest
   said, Let be, that we may [3624] see whether Elijah cometh to save
   him.  [6, 7] [3625] And Jesus said, My Father, forgive them; for they
   know not what they do.  And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and
   said, My Father, into thy hands I commend [3626] my spirit.  [3627] He
   said that, and bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.

   [8] [3628] And immediately the face of [3629] the door of the temple
   was rent into two parts from [9] top to bottom; [3630] and the earth
   was shaken; and the stones were split to pieces; and the [Arabic, p.
   197] tombs were opened; and the bodies of many saints which slept,
   arose and [10] came forth; [3631] and after his resurrection they
   entered into the holy city and [11] appeared unto many.  [3632] And the
   officer of the footsoldiers, and they that were with him who were
   guarding Jesus, [3633] when they saw the earthquake, and the things
   which came [12] to pass, feared greatly, and praised God, and said,
   [3634] This man was righteous; and, [13] Truly he was the Son of God.
   [3635] And all the multitudes that were come together to the sight,
   when they saw what came to pass, returned and smote upon their breasts.

   [14] [3636] And the Jews, because of the Friday, said, Let these bodies
   not remain on their crosses, [3637] because it is the morning of the
   sabbath (for that sabbath was a great day); and they asked of Pilate
   that they might break the legs of those that were [15] crucified, and
   take them down.  [3638] And the soldiers came, and brake the legs of
   the [16] first, and that other which was crucified with him:  [3639]
   but when they came to Jesus, [17] they saw that he had died before, so
   they brake not his legs:  [3640] but one of the soldiers pierced [3641]
   him in his side with a spear, and immediately there came forth blood
   and [18] water.  [3642] And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and
   his witness is true:  and he [19] knoweth that he hath said the truth,
   that ye also may believe.  [3643] This he did, that [20] the scripture
   might be fulfilled, which saith, A bone shall not be broken in him;
   [3644] and the scripture also which saith, Let them look upon him whom
   they pierced. [3645]

   [21] [3646] And there were in the distance all the acquaintance of
   Jesus standing, and the women that came with him from Galilee, those
   that followed him and ministered.  [22] [3647] One of them was Mary
   Magdalene; and Mary the mother of James the little and [23] [Arabic, p.
   198] Joses, [3648] and the mother of the sons of Zebedee, and Salome,
   and many others which came up with him unto Jerusalem; [3649] and they
   saw that.

   [24] [3650] And when the evening of the Friday was come, because of the
   entering of the [25] sabbath, [3651] there came a rich man, [3652] a
   noble [3653] of Ramah, [3654] a city of Judah, [3655] named Joseph, and
   he was a good man and upright; [3656] and he was a [3657] disciple of
   Jesus, but [26] was concealing himself for fear of the Jews.  [3658]
   And he did not agree with the accusers [27] in their desire and their
   deeds:  [3659] and he was looking for the kingdom of God.  [3660] And
   this man went boldly, and entered in unto Pilate, and asked of him the
   body of [28] Jesus.  [3661] And Pilate wondered how he had died
   already:  and he called the officer of [29] the footsoldiers, and asked
   him concerning his death before the time.  [3662] And when [30] he
   knew, he commanded him to deliver up his body unto Joseph.  [3663] And
   Joseph bought for him a winding cloth of pure linen, and took down the
   body of Jesus, [31] and wound it in it; and they came and took it.
   [3664] And there came unto him Nicodemus also, who of old came unto
   Jesus by night; and he brought with him perfume [3665] [32] of myrrh
   and aloes, about a hundred pounds.  [3666] And they took the body of
   Jesus, and wound it in the linen and the perfume, as was the custom of
   the Jews to bury.

   [33] [3667] And there was in the place where Jesus was crucified a
   garden; and in that garden [34] a new tomb cut out in a rock, [3668]
   wherein was never man yet laid.  [3669] And they left [35] Jesus there
   because the sabbath had come in, and because the tomb was near.  [3670]
   And they pushed [3671] a great stone, and thrust [3672] it against the
   door of the sepulchre, and [36] went away.  [3673] And Mary Magdalene
   and Mary that was related to Joses came to [37] [Arabic, p. 199] the
   sepulchre after them, [3674]   [3675] and sat opposite the sepulchre,
   [3676] and saw the [38] body, how they took it in and laid it there.
   [3677] And they returned, and bought ointment [3678] and perfume,
   [3679] and prepared [3680] it, that they might come and anoint him.
   [39] [3681] And on the day which was the sabbath day they desisted
   according to the command.

   [40, 41] [3682] And the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered unto
   Pilate, and said unto him, [3683] Our lord, we remember that that
   misleader said, while he was alive, After three days [42] I rise.
   [3684] And now send beforehand and guard the tomb [3685] until the
   third day, [3686] lest his disciples come and steal him by night, and
   they will say unto the people that he [43] is risen from the dead:  and
   the last error shall be worse than the first.  [3687] He said unto
   them, And have ye not guards? [3688] go, and take precautions as ye
   know how.  [44] [3689] And they went, and set guards at the tomb, and
   sealed that stone, with the guards.

   [45] [3690] And in the evening of the sabbath, which is the morning of
   the first day, and in [46] the dawning [3691] while the darkness yet
   remained, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary and other women to see
   the tomb.  [3692] They brought with them the [47] perfume which they
   had prepared, and said among themselves, [3693] Who is it that will
   [48] remove for us the stone from the door of the tomb? for it was very
   great.  [3694] And when they said thus, there occurred a great
   earthquake; and an angel came down [49] from heaven, and came and
   removed the stone from the door.  [3695] And they came and found the
   stone removed from the sepulchre, and the angel sitting upon the [50]
   stone.  [3696] And his appearance was as the lightning, and his raiment
   white as the [51] snow:  [3697] and for fear of him the guards were
   troubled, and became as dead men.  [52] [3698] And when he went away,
   the women entered into the sepulchre; and they found [53] [Arabic, p.
   200] not the body of Jesus.  [3699] And they saw there a young man
   sitting on the [54] right, arrayed in a white garment; and they were
   amazed. [3700]   [3701] And the angel answered and said unto the women,
   Fear ye not:  for I know that ye seek Jesus the [55] Nazarene, who hath
   been crucified.  He is not here; but he is risen, as he said.  [3702]
   Come and see the place where our Lord lay.

   in [4] Galilee, and saying, [3707] The Son of man is to be delivered up
   into the hands of sinners, [5] and to be crucified, and on the third
   day to rise.  [3708] But go in haste, and say to his disciples and to
   Cephas, He is risen from among the dead; and lo, he goeth before [6]
   you into Galilee; [3709] and there ye shall see him, where [3710] he
   said unto you:  lo, I have [7] told you.  [3711] And they remembered
   his sayings; and they departed in haste from the [8] tomb with joy and
   great fear, and hastened and went; [3712] and perplexity and fear [9]
   encompassed them; and they told no man anything, for they were afraid.
   [3713] And Mary hastened, and came to Simon Cephas, and to that other
   disciple whom Jesus loved, and said unto them, They have taken our Lord
   from the sepulchre, and I [10] know not where they have laid him.
   [3714] And Simon went out, and that other disciple, [11] and came to
   the sepulchre.  [3715] And they hastened both together:  and that
   disciple [12] outran [3716] Simon, and came first to the sepulchre;
   [3717] and he looked down, and saw the [13] linen laid; but he went not
   in.  [3718] And Simon came after him, and entered into the [14]
   [Arabic, p. 201] sepulchre, and saw the linen laid; [3719] and the
   scarf with which his head was bound was not with the linen, but wrapped
   and laid aside in a certain place.  [15] [3720] Then entered that
   disciple which came first to the sepulchre, and saw, and believed.
   [16] [3721] And they knew not yet from the scriptures that the Messiah
   was to rise from among [17] the dead.  [3722] And those two disciples
   went to their place.

   [18] [3723] But Mary remained [3724] at the tomb weeping:  and while
   she wept, she looked [19] down into the tomb; [3725] and she saw two
   angels sitting in white raiment, one of them toward his pillow, and the
   other toward his feet, where the body of Jesus had been [20] laid.
   [3726] And they said unto her, Woman, why weepest thou?  She said unto
   them, [21] They have taken my Lord, and I know not where they have left
   him.  [3727] She said that, and turned behind her, and saw Jesus
   standing, and knew not that it was [22] Jesus.  [3728] Jesus said unto
   her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?  And she supposed
   [3729] him to be the gardener, and said, My lord, if thou hast taken
   him, [23] tell me where thou hast laid him, that I may go and take
   him.  [3730] Jesus said unto her, Mary.  She turned, and said unto him
   in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is, being [24] interpreted, Teacher.  [3731]
   Jesus said unto her, Touch me not; [3732] for I have not ascended yet
   unto my Father:  go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my
   Father and your Father, and my God and your God.

   [25] [3733] And on the First-day on which he rose, he appeared first
   unto Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.

   [26] [3734] And some of those guards [3735] came to the city, and
   informed the chief priests of [27] [Arabic, p. 202] all that had
   happened.  [3736] And they assembled with the elders, and took [28]
   counsel; [3737] and they gave money, not a little, to the guards, and
   said unto them, Say ye, His disciples came and stole him by night,
   while we were sleeping.

   [29] [3738] And if the judge hear that, we will make a plea with him,
   and free you of blame.  [30] [3739] And they, when they took the money,
   did according to what they taught them.  And this word spread among the
   Jews unto this day.

   [31] [3740] And then came Mary Magdalene, and announced to the
   disciples that she had seen our Lord, and that he had said that unto
   her.

   [32] [3741] And while the first [3742] women [3743] were going in the
   way to inform [3744] his disciples, [3745] [33] Jesus met them, and
   said unto them, Peace unto you.  [3746] And they came and took [34]
   hold of his feet, and worshipped him.  [3747] Then said Jesus unto
   them, Fear not:  but go and say to my brethren that they depart into
   Galilee, and there they shall see [35] me.  [3748] And those women
   returned, and told all that to the eleven, and to the rest of the
   disciples; [3749] and to those that had been with him, for they were
   saddened and [36] weeping.  [3750] And those were Mary Magdalene, and
   Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and the rest who were with them:
   and they were those that told the apostles.  [37] [3751] And they, when
   they heard them say that he was alive and had appeared unto them, [38]
   did not believe them:  [3752] and these sayings were before their eyes
   as the sayings of madness.  [39] [Arabic, p. 203] [3753] And after
   that, he appeared to two of them, on that day, and while they were
   going to the village which was named Emmaus, and whose distance [40]
   from Jerusalem was sixty furlongs. [3754]   [3755] And they were
   talking the one of them with the [41] other of all the things which had
   happened.  [3756] And during the time of their talking and [42]
   inquiring with one another, Jesus came and reached them, and walked
   with them.  [3757] But [43] their eyes were veiled that they should not
   know him.  [3758] And he said unto them, What are these sayings which
   ye address the one of you to the other, as ye walk and are [44] sad?
   [3759] One of them, whose name was Cleopas, answered and said unto him,
   Art thou perchance alone a stranger to Jerusalem, since thou knowest
   not what was in [45] it in these days?  He said unto them, What was?
   [3760] They said unto him, Concerning Jesus, he who was from Nazareth,
   a man who was a prophet, and powerful in [46] speech and deeds before
   God and before all the people:  [3761] and the chief priests and [47]
   the elders delivered him up to the sentence of [3762] death, and
   crucified him.  [3763] But we supposed that he was the one who was to
   deliver Israel.  And since all [3764] these [48] things happened there
   have passed three days.  [3765] But certain women of us also [49]
   informed us that they had come to the sepulchre; [3766] and when they
   found not his body, they came and told us that they had seen there the
   angels, and they [3767] said [50] concerning him that he was alive.
   [3768] And some of us also went to the sepulchre, and [51] found the
   matter as the women had said:  only they saw him not.  [3769] Then said
   Jesus [52] unto them, Ye lacking in discernment, and heavy in heart to
   believe!  [3770] Was it not in all the sayings of the prophets that the
   Messiah was to suffer these things, and to [53] [Arabic, p. 204] enter
   into his Glory?  [3771] And he began from Moses and from all the
   prophets, [54] and interpreted to them concerning himself from all the
   scriptures.  [3772] And they drew near unto the village, whither they
   were going:  and he was leading them to [55] imagine that he was as if
   going to a distant region.  [3773] And they pressed [3774] him, and
   said unto him, Abide with us:  for the day hath declined now to the
   darkness.  And he went [56] in to abide with them.  [3775] And when he
   sat with them, he took bread, and blessed, [57] and brake, and gave to
   them.  [3776] And straightway their eyes were opened, and they [58]
   knew him; and he was taken away from them. [3777]   [3778] And they
   said the one to the other, Was not our heart heavy within us, while he
   was speaking to us in the way, and interpreting to us the scriptures?

   [59] [3779] And they rose in that hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and
   found the eleven [60] gathered, and those that were with them, saying,
   [3780] Truly our Lord is risen, and hath [61] appeared to Simon.
   [3781] And they related what happened in the way, and how they knew him
   when he brake the bread.  [3782] Neither believed they that also.

   Section LIV.

   [1] [3783] And while they talked together, [3784] the evening of that
   day arrived which was the First-day; and the doors were shut where the
   disciples were, because of the fear of the [2] Jews; [3785] and Jesus
   came and stood among them, and said unto them, Peace be with you:  I am
   he; fear not.  [3786] But they were agitated, and became afraid, and
   supposed that they [3] saw a spirit.  [3787] Jesus said unto them, Why
   are ye agitated? and why do thoughts rise [4] [Arabic, p. 205] in
   [3788] your hearts?  [3789] See my hands and my feet, that I am he:
   feel me, and know that a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me
   having that.  [5] [3790] And when he had said this, he shewed them his
   hands and his feet and his side. [3791]   [6] [3792] And they were
   until this time unbelieving, from their joy and their wonder.  He [7]
   said unto them, Have ye anything here to eat?  [3793] And they gave him
   a portion of broiled fish and of honey. [3794]   [3795] And he took it,
   and ate before them.

   [8] [3796] And he said unto them, These are the sayings which I spake
   unto you, while I was with you, that [3797] everything must be
   fulfilled, which is written in the law of [9] Moses, and the prophets,
   and the psalms, concerning me.  [3798] Then opened he their [10] heart,
   that they might understand the scriptures; and he said unto them,
   [3799] Thus it is written, and thus it is necessary [3800] that the
   Messiah suffer, and rise from among the [11] dead on the third day;
   [3801] and that repentance unto the forgiveness of sins be preached
   [12] in his name among all the peoples; and the beginning shall be from
   Jerusalem.  [3802] And [13] ye shall be witnesses of that.  And I send
   unto you the promise of my Father.  [3803] And [14] when the disciples
   heard that, they were glad.  [3804] And Jesus said unto them again,
   [15] Peace be with you:  as my Father hath sent me, I also send you.
   [3805] And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said unto
   them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:  [16] [3806] and if ye forgive sins
   to any man, they shall be forgiven him; and if ye retain them against
   any man, they shall be retained.

   [17] [3807] But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Thama, was not there
   with the disciples [18] when Jesus came.  [3808] The disciples
   therefore said unto him, We have seen our Lord.  But he said unto them,
   If I do not see in his hands the places of the nails, and put on them
   my fingers, and pass my hand over his side, I will not believe.

   [19] [3809] And after eight days, on the next First-day, the disciples
   were assembled again within, and Thomas with them.  And Jesus came, the
   doors being shut, and stood [20] [Arabic, p. 206] in the midst, and
   said unto them, Peace be with you.  [3810] And he said to Thomas, Bring
   hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and bring hither [21] thy hand,
   and spread it on my side:  and be not unbelieving, but believing.
   [3811] Thomas [22] answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
   [3812] Jesus said unto him, Now since thou hast seen me, thou hast
   believed:  blessed are they that have not seen me, and have believed.

   [23] [3813] And many other signs did Jesus before his disciples, and
   they are they which [24] are not written in this book:  [3814] but
   these that [3815] are written also are that ye may believe in Jesus the
   Messiah, the Son of God; and that when ye have believed, ye may have in
   his name eternal life.

   [25] [3816] And after that, Jesus shewed himself again to his disciples
   at the sea of Tiberias; [26] and he shewed himself unto them thus.
   [3817] And there were together Simon Cephas, and Thomas which was
   called Twin, [3818] and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee, [27] and
   the sons of Zebedee, and two other of the disciples.  [3819] Simon
   Cephas said unto them, I go to catch fish.  They said unto him, And we
   also come with thee.  And they went forth, and went up into the boat;
   and in that night they caught nothing.  [28] [3820] And when the
   morning arrived, Jesus stood on the shore of the sea:  but the
   disciples [29] knew not that it was Jesus.  [3821] And Jesus said unto
   them, Children, have ye anything [30] to eat?  They said unto him, No.
   [3822] He said unto them, Cast your net from the right side of the
   boat, and ye shall find. [3823]   And they threw, and they were not
   able [31] to draw the net for the abundance of the fish that were come
   [3824] into it.  [3825] And that disciple whom Jesus loved said to
   Cephas, This is our Lord.  And Simon, when he heard that it was our
   Lord, took his tunic, and girded it on his waist (for he was [32]
   naked), and cast himself into the sea to come to Jesus.  [3826] But
   some others of the disciples came in the boat [3827] (and they were not
   far from the land, but about two [33] [Arabic, p. 207] hundred cubits),
   and drew that net of fish.  [3828] And when they went up on the [34]
   land, they saw live coals laid, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
   [3829] And Jesus [35] said unto them, Bring of this fish which ye have
   now caught.  [3830] Simon Cephas therefore went up, and dragged the net
   to the land, full of great fish, a hundred and fifty-three [36]
   fishes:  and with all this weight that net was not rent.  [3831] And
   Jesus said unto them, Come and sit down.  And no man of the disciples
   dared to ask him who he was, for they knew that it was our Lord.  But
   he did not appear to them in his own [37, 38] form.  [3832] And Jesus
   came, and took bread and fish, and gave unto them.  [3833] This is the
   third time that Jesus appeared to his disciples, when he had risen from
   among the dead.

   [39] [3834] And when they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Cephas,
   Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me more than these?  He said unto him,
   Yea, my Lord; thou [40] knowest that I love thee.  [3835] Jesus said
   unto him, Feed for me my lambs.  He said unto him again a second time,
   Simon, son of Jonah, lovest thou me?  He said unto him, Yea, my Lord;
   thou knowest that I love thee.  He said unto him, Feed for [41] me my
   sheep. [3836]   [3837] He said unto him again the third time, Simon,
   son of Jonah, lovest thou me?  And it grieved Cephas that he said unto
   him three times, Lovest thou me?  He said unto him, My Lord, thou
   knowest everything; thou knowest that I [42] love thee.  [3838] Jesus
   said unto him, Feed for me my sheep. [3839]   Verily, verily, I say
   unto thee, When thou wast a child, thou didst gird thy waist for
   thyself, and go whither [Arabic, p. 208] thou wouldest:  but when thou
   shalt be old, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and another shall gird
   thy waist, and take thee whither thou wouldest not.  [43] [3840] He
   said that to him to explain by what death he was to glorify God.  And
   when he [44] had said that, he said unto him, Come after me.  [3841]
   And Simon Cephas turned, and saw that disciple whom Jesus loved
   following him; he which at the supper leaned [3842] on [45] Jesus'
   breast, and said, My Lord, who is it that betrayeth thee?  [3843] When
   therefore Cephas saw him, he said to Jesus, My Lord, and this man, what
   shall be in his [46] case? [3844]   [3845] Jesus said unto him, If I
   will that this man remain until I come, what is [47] that to thee?
   follow thou me.  [3846] And this word spread among the brethren, that
   that disciple should not die:  but Jesus said not that he should not
   die; but, If I will that this man remain until I come, what is that to
   thee?

   [48] [3847] This is the disciple which bare witness of that, and wrote
   it:  and we know that his witness is true.

   Section LV.

   [1] [3848] But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain
   [3849] where Jesus had [2] appointed them.  [3850] And when they saw
   him, they worshipped him:  but there were of [3] them who doubted.
   [3851] And while they sat there he appeared to them again, and
   upbraided them for their lack of faith and the hardness of their
   hearts, those that saw him when he was risen, and believed not. [3852]

   [4] [Arabic, p. 209] [3853] Then said Jesus unto them, I have been
   given all authority in heaven [5] and earth; and as my Father hath sent
   me, so I also send you.  [3854] Go now into [6] all the world, and
   preach my gospel in all the creation; [3855] and teach [3856] all the
   peoples, and [7] baptize them in the name of the Father and the Son and
   the Holy Spirit; [3857] and teach them to keep all whatsoever I
   commanded you:  and lo, I am with you all the days, unto [8] the end of
   the world.  [3858] For whosoever believeth and is baptized shall be
   saved; but [9] whosoever believeth not shall be rejected.  [3859] And
   the signs [3860] which shall attend those that believe in me are
   these:  that they shall cast out devils in my name; and they [10] shall
   speak with new tongues; [3861] and they shall take up serpents, and if
   they drink deadly poison, [3862] it shall not injure them; and they
   shall lay their hands on the diseased, [11] and they shall be healed.
   [3863] But ye, abide in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be clothed with
   power from on high.

   [12] [3864] And our Lord Jesus, after speaking to them, took them out
   to Bethany:  and he [13] lifted up his hands, and blessed them.  [3865]
   And while he blessed them, he was separated from them, and ascended
   into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.  [14, 15] [3866]
   And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:
   [3867] and at all times they were in the temple, praising and blessing
   God.  Amen.

   [16] [3868] And from thence they went forth, and preached in every
   place; and our Lord helped them, and confirmed their sayings by the
   signs which they did. [3869]

   [17] [3870] And here are also many other things which Jesus did, which
   if they were written every one of them, not even the world, according
   to my opinion, would contain the books which should be written. [3871]

   The Revelation of Peter.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The fragment here translated was discovered in 1886 by the French
   Archæological Mission in an ancient burying place at Akhmîm in Upper
   Egypt.  It was published at Paris in 1892 (Bouriant, Mémoires publiés
   par les membres de la Mission Archéologique Française au Caire, T. ix.,
   fasc. 1, 1892).  The ms. is now in the Gizeh Museum and has been held
   to be of a date between the eighth and twelfth centuries.  Until the
   discovery of the fragment, the following was all that was known about
   the Revelation of Peter.

   1.  The so-called Muratorian Fragment, a list of sacred writings, first
   published by Muratori in 1740, and found by him in a seventh or eighth
   century ms. belonging to the Ambrosian Library in Milan, but which had
   previously belonged to the Columban Monastery of Bobbio, is assigned on
   internal evidence to the third quarter of the second century.  (Vide
   Westcott, Canon of the N.T., p. 514.)  At line 69 it says:  "the
   Apocalypses also of John and Peter only do we receive, which (latter)
   some among us would not have read in church."

   2.  Clement of Alexandria (fl. c. 200 a.d.) in his Hypotoposes,
   according to the testimony of Eusebius, H. E., vi., 14, gave "abridged
   accounts of all the canonical Scriptures, not even omitting those that
   are disputed, I mean the book of Jude and the other general epistles.
   Also the Epistle of Barnabas and that called the Revelation of Peter."
   Also in his Eclogæ Prophetiæ, chapters 41, 48 and 49, he gives three,
   or as some think, four quotations from the Revelation of Peter,
   mentioning it twice by name.

   3.  The Catalogus Claromontanus, an Eastern list of Holy Scriptures,
   belonging to the third century, gives at the end the Revelation of
   Peter (v. Westcott, Canon, p. 555).  This catalogue gives the length of
   the various books it enumerates measured in stichoi.  Our book is said
   to have two hundred and seventy, which makes it rather longer than the
   Epistle to the Colossians which has two hundred and fifty-one.

   4.  Methodius, bishop of Olympus in Lycia in the beginning of the
   fourth century, in his Symposium, ii., 6, says, "wherefore we have also
   learned from divinely inspired Scriptures that untimely births even if
   they are the offspring of adultery are delivered to caretaking
   angels."  Though Peter is not here mentioned, the purport of the
   passage is the same as that of one of the quotations given by Clement
   of Alexandria.

   5.  Eusebius ( c. 339 a.d.), in his Ecclesiastical History, iii., 25,
   expressly mentions the Revelation of Peter along with the Acts of Paul
   and the Pastor as spurious books, while at iii., 3, he says:  "as to
   that which is called the Preaching and that called the Apocalypse of
   Peter, we know nothing of their being handed down as Catholic
   writings.  Since neither among the ancients nor among the
   ecclesiastical writers of our own day, has there been anyone that has
   appealed to testimony taken from them."

   6.  Macarius Magnes (beginning of fifth century) in his Apocritica,
   iv., 6, quotes as from a heathen opponent of Christianity the
   following:  "Let us by way of superfluity cite also that saying in the
   Apocalypse of Peter.  It thus introduces the heaven as being about to
   undergo judgment along with the earth.  The earth,' it says, shall
   present all men before God at the day of judgment, being itself also to
   be judged along with the heaven also which encompasses it.'"  And at
   iv., 16, he examines this passage again, naming the revelation of
   Peter, and supporting the doctrine of the passage by the authority of
   prophecy (Isaiah xxxiv. 4) and the Gospel (Matt. xxiv. 35).

   7.  Sozomen (middle of fifth century), H. E., vii., 19, says:  "For
   instance, the so-called Apocalypse of Peter which was esteemed as
   entirely spurious by the ancients, we have discovered to be read in
   certain churches of Palestine up to the present day, once a year, on
   the day of preparation, during which the people most religiously fast
   in commemoration of the Saviour's Passion" (i.e., on Good Friday).  It
   is to be noted that Sozomen himself belonged to Palestine.

   8.  In the list of the Sixty Books which is assigned to the fifth or
   sixth century the Revelation of Peter is mentioned among the Apocrypha
   (v. Westcott, Canon, p. 551).

   9.  The so-called Stichometry of Nicephorus, a list of scriptures with
   notes of their extent, ascribed to Nicephorus, Patriarch of
   Constantinople, 806-814 a.d., includes the Revelation of Peter among
   the antilegomena or disputed writings of the New Testament, and gives
   it three hundred stichoi or thirty more than the above-mentioned
   Catalogus Claromontanas.

   10.  The Armenian annalist Mkhitan (thirteenth century) in a list of
   the New Testament antilegomena mentions the Revelation of Peter, after
   the Gospel of Thomas and before the Periodoi Pauli, and remarks that he
   has himself copied these books.  (Cf. Harnack, Geschichte der
   altchristlichen Literatur.)

   Up till lately these facts represented all that was positively known of
   the Revelation of Peter.  From them we gather that it must have been
   written before the middle of the second century (so as to be known at
   Rome and included in the Muratorian Canon), that it had a wide
   circulation, that it was for some time very popular, so that it would
   appear to have run a considerable chance of achieving a place in the
   canon, but that it was ultimately rejected and in the long run dropped
   out of knowledge altogether.  But even previously to the discovery at
   Akhmîm, the general character of the book had been inferred from the
   scanty fragments preserved in ancient writers and from the common
   elements contained in other and later apocalyptic writings which seemed
   to require some such book as the Revelation of Peter as their ultimate
   source.  Such writings are the (Christian) Apocalypse of Esdras, the
   Vision of Paul, the Passion of S. Perpetua and the visions contained in
   the History of Barlaam and Josaphat.  (Cf. Robinson, Texts and Studies,
   i., 2, p. 37-43, and Robinson and James, The Gospel according to Peter
   and the Revelation of Peter, 1892.)

   The Revelation of Peter affords the earliest embodiment in Christian
   literature of those pictorial presentations of heaven and hell which
   have exercised so widespread and enduring an influence.  It has, in its
   imagery, little or no kinship with the Book of Daniel, the Book of
   Enoch, or the Revelation of S. John.  Its only parallels in canonical
   scripture, with the notable exception of the Second Epistle of Peter,
   are to be found in Isaiah lxvi. 24, Mark ix. 44, 48, and the parable of
   Dives and Lazarus in Luke xvi. 19.  It is indeed Judaic in the severity
   of its morality and even in its phraseology (cf. the frequent use of
   the word righteous, and the idea that God and not Christ will come to
   judge sinners).  But the true parallels for, if not the sources of, its
   imagery of the rewards and punishments which await men after death are
   to be found in Greek beliefs which have left their traces in such
   passages as the Vision of Er at the end of Plato's Republic.

   The heaven of the Petrine Apocalypse is akin to the Elysian Fields and
   the Islands of the Blest.  In it the saints are crowned as with flowers
   and beautiful of countenance, singing songs of praise in the fragrant
   air, in a land all lighted up with the light of the sun. [3876]   We
   are reminded of "the Elysian Fields and the world's end where is
   Rhadamanthus of the fair hair, where life is easiest for men.  No snow
   is there, nor yet great storm, nor any rain; but alway Ocean sendeth
   forth the breeze of the shrill West to blow cool on men" (Odyssey, iv.,
   563), and of the garden of the gods on Olympus, which "is not shaken by
   winds, or ever wet with rain, nor doth the snow come nigh thereto, but
   most clear air is spread about it cloudless, and the white light floats
   over it" (Odyssey, vi., 43, Butcher and Lang's transl.).  Perhaps the
   most striking parallel of all is afforded by the fragment of a dirge of
   Pindar:  "For them shineth below the strength of the sun, while in our
   world it is night, and the space of crimson-flowered meadow before
   their city is full of the shade of frankincense trees, and of fruits of
   gold.  And some in horses, and in bodily feats, and some in dice, and
   some in harp-playing have delight; and among them thriveth all
   fair-flowering bliss; and fragrance streameth ever through the lovely
   land, as they mingle incense of every kind upon the altars of the gods"
   (Pindar, E. Myer's transl., p. 176).  Beside this heaven the New
   Jerusalem of the canonical Apocalypse is austere.  But it is the
   spiritual city.  "For the city had no need of the sun, neither of the
   moon to shine on it, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb were in the
   midst of it and the Lamb was the light thereof."

   So likewise in the case of the torments of the wicked as presented in
   the Revelation of Peter.  We are not here in the Jewish Sheol, or among
   the fires of the valley of Hinnom, so much as among the tortures of
   Tartarus and the boiling mud of the Acherusian Lake (cf. Plato, Phædo,
   p. 113; Aristophanes, Frogs, line 145), or where "wild men of fiery
   aspect...seized and carried off several of them, and Ardiæus and
   others, they bound head and foot and hand, and threw them down and
   flayed them with scourges, and dragged them along the road at the side,
   carding them on thorns like wool, and declaring to the passers-by what
   were their crimes, and that they were being taken away to be cast into
   hell" (Republic, x., p. 616, Jowett's transl.).  It is not surprising
   that in later visions of the same kind the very names of the Greek
   under-world are ascribed to localities of hell.  It is across the river
   Oceanus.  It is called Tartarus.  In it is the Acherusian Lake.  Notice
   in this connection that the souls of innocent victims are present along
   with their murderers to accuse them.

   The Revelation of Peter shows remarkable kinship in ideas with the
   Second Epistle of Peter.  The parallels will be noted in the margin of
   the translation.  It also presents notable parallels to the Sibylline
   Oracles (cf. Orac. Sib., ii., 225 sqq.), while its influence has been
   conjectured, almost with certainty, in the Acts of Perpetua and the
   visions narrated in the Acts of Thomas and the History of Barlaam and
   Josaphat.  It certainly was one of the sources from which the writer of
   the Vision of Paul drew.  And directly or indirectly it may be regarded
   as the parent of all the mediæval visions of the other world.

   The fragment begins in the middle of an eschatological discourse of
   Jesus, probably represented as delivered after the resurrection, for
   verse 5 implies that the disciples had begun to preach the Gospel.  It
   ends abruptly in the course of a catalogue of sinners in hell and their
   punishments.  The fragments preserved in the writings of Clement of
   Alexandria and Methodius probably belonged to the lost end of the book;
   that preserved by Macarius Magnes may have belonged to the
   eschatological discourse at the beginning.  Taking the length of the
   whole at from two hundred and seventy to three hundred stichoi, the
   Akhmîm fragment contains about the half.

   The present translation is made from Harnack's edition of the text, 2d
   ed., Leipzig, 1893.

   There is another and later Apocalypse of Peter in Arabic, of which mss.
   exist in Rome and Oxford.  It is called the Apocalypse of Peter, or the
   narrative of things revealed to him by Jesus Christ which had taken
   place from the beginning of the world and which shall take place till
   the end of the world or the second coming of Christ.  The book is said
   to have been written by Clement, to whom Peter had communicated the
   secrets revealed to him.  The writer himself calls the book Librum
   Perfectionis or Librum Completum.  Judging from the analysis of its
   contents quoted by Tischendorf (Apocalypses Apocr.) it has no
   connection with the present work.

   The Apocalypse of Peter.

   ------------------------

   1.  ...many of them will be false prophets, [3877] and will teach
   divers ways and doctrines of perdition:  but these will become sons of
   perdition. [3878]   3.  And then God will come unto my faithful ones
   who hunger and thirst and are afflicted and purify their souls in this
   life; and he will judge the sons of lawlessness. [3879]

   4.  And furthermore the Lord said:  Let us go into the mountain: [3880]
     Let us pray.  5.  And going with him, we, the twelve disciples,
   begged that he would show us one of our brethren, the righteous who are
   gone forth out of the world, in order that we might see of what manner
   of form they are, and having taken courage, might also encourage [3881]
   the men who hear us.

   6.  And as we prayed, suddenly there appeared two men standing before
   the Lord towards the East, on whom we were not able to look; [3882] 7,
   for there came forth from their countenance a ray as of the sun, and
   their raiment was shining, such as eye of man [3883] never saw; for no
   mouth is able to express or heart to conceive the glory with which they
   were endued, and the beauty of their appearance.  8.  And as we looked
   upon them, we were astounded; for their bodies were whiter than any
   snow and ruddier than any rose; [3884] 9, and the red thereof was
   mingled with the white, and I am utterly unable to express their
   beauty; 10, for their hair was curly and bright and seemly both on
   their face and shoulders, as it were a wreath [3885] woven of spikenard
   and divers-coloured flowers, or like a rainbow in the sky, such was
   their seemliness.

   11.  Seeing therefore their beauty we became astounded at them, since
   they appeared suddenly.  12.  And I approached the Lord and said:  Who
   are these?  13.  He saith to me:  These are your brethren the
   righteous, whose forms ye desired to see.  14.  And I said to him:  And
   where are all the righteous ones and what is the æon in which they are
   and have this glory?

   15.  And the Lord showed me [3886] a very great country outside of this
   world, exceeding bright with light, and the air there lighted with the
   rays of the sun, and the earth itself blooming with unfading flowers
   and full of spices and plants, fair-flowering and incorruptible and
   bearing blessed fruit.  16.  And so great was the perfume that it
   [3887] was borne thence even unto us.  17.  And the dwellers in that
   place were clad in the raiment of shining angels and their raiment was
   like unto their country; and angels hovered about them there.  18.  And
   the glory of the dwellers there was equal, and with one voice they sang
   praises alternately to the Lord God, rejoicing in that place.  19.  The
   Lord saith to us:  This is the place of your high-priests, [3888] the
   righteous men.

   20.  And over against that place I saw another, squalid, and it was the
   place of punishment; and those who were punished there and the
   punishing angels had their raiment dark [3889] like the air of the
   place.

   21.  And there were certain there hanging by the tongue:  and these
   were the blasphemers of the way of righteousness; and under them lay
   fire, [3890] burning and punishing them.

   22.  And there was a great lake, full of flaming mire, in which were
   certain men that pervert righteousness, [3891] and tormenting angels
   afflicted them.

   23.  And there were also others, women, hanged by their hair over that
   mire that bubbled up:  and these were they who adorned themselves for
   adultery; and the men who mingled with them in the defilement [3892] of
   adultery, were hanging by the feet and their heads in that mire.  And I
   said:  I did not believe that I should come into this place.

   24.  And I saw the murderers and those who conspired with them, cast
   into a certain strait place, full of evil snakes, and smitten by those
   beasts, and thus turning to and fro in that punishment; and worms,
   [3893] as it were clouds of darkness, afflicted them.  And the souls of
   the murdered stood and looked upon the punishment of those murderers
   and said:  O God, thy judgment is just.

   25.  And near that place I saw another strait place into which the gore
   and the filth of those who were being punished ran down and became
   there as it were a lake:  and there sat women having the gore up to
   their necks, and over against them sat many children who were born to
   them out of due time, crying; and there came forth from them sparks of
   fire and smote the women in the eyes:  and these were the accursed who
   conceived and caused abortion.

   26.  And other men and women were burning up to the middle and were
   cast into a dark place and were beaten by evil spirits, and their
   inwards were eaten by restless worms: [3894]   and these were they who
   persecuted the righteous and delivered them up.

   27.  And near those there were again women and men gnawing their own
   lips, and being punished and receiving a red-hot iron in their eyes:
   and these were they who blasphemed and slandered [3895] the way of
   righteousness.

   28.  And over against these again other men and women gnawing their
   tongues and having flaming fire in their mouths:  and these were the
   false witnesses. [3896]

   29.  And in a certain other place there were pebbles sharper than
   swords or any spit, red-hot, and women and men in tattered and filthy
   raiment rolled about on them in punishment:  and these were the rich
   who trusted in their riches and had no pity for orphans and widows, and
   despised the commandment [3897] of God.

   30.  And in another great lake, full of pitch and blood and mire
   bubbling up, there stood men and women up to their knees:  and these
   were the usurers and those who take interest on interest.

   31.  And other men and women were being hurled down from a great cliff
   and reached the bottom, and again were driven by those who were set
   over them to climb up upon the cliff, and thence were hurled down
   again, and had no rest from this punishment:  and these were they who
   defiled [3898] their bodies acting as women; and the women who were
   with them were those who lay with one another as a man with a woman.

   32.  And alongside of that cliff there was a place full of much fire,
   and there stood men who with their own hands had made for themselves
   carven images instead of God.  And alongside of these were other men
   and women, having rods and striking each other and never ceasing from
   such punishment.

   33.  And others again near them, women and men, burning and turning
   themselves and roasting:  and these were they that leaving the way of
   God [3899] ...

   Fragments of the Apocalypse of Peter.

   1.  Clemens Alexandrinus, Eclog. 48.  For instance, Peter in the
   Apocalypse says that the children who are born out of due time shall be
   of the better part:  and that these are delivered over to a care-taking
   angel that they may attain a share of knowledge and gain the better
   abode [after suffering what they would have suffered if they had been
   in the body:  but the others shall merely obtain salvation as injured
   beings to whom mercy is shown, and remain without punishment, receiving
   this as a reward]. [3900]

   2.  Clem. Alex. Eclog. 49.  But the milk of the women running down from
   their breasts and congealing shall engender small flesh-eating beasts:
   and these run up upon them and devour them. [3901]

   3.  Macarius Magnes, Apocritica iv., 6 cf. 16.  The earth, it (sc. the
   Apoc. of Peter) says, "shall present all men before God at the day of
   judgment, being itself also to be judged, with the heaven also which
   encompasses it."

   4.  Clem. Alex. Eclog. 41.  The scripture says that infants that have
   been exposed are delivered to a care-taking angel, by whom they are
   educated and so grow up, and they will be, it says, as the faithful of
   a hundred years old are here.

   5.  Methodius, Conviv. ii., 6.  Whence also we have received in
   divinely-inspired scriptures that untimely births are delivered to
   care-taking angels, even if they are the offspring of adultery.

   The Vision of Paul.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The present translation of the Vision of Paul is made from the text of
   a Latin version, edited by Mr. M. R. James in the Cambridge Texts and
   Studies, ii., 3, p. 11 ff.--from a ms. of the eighth century now in the
   Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris.

   Tischendorf's Greek text was based on two mss., the earliest of which
   is at Munich and is of the thirteenth century.  This version has
   already been translated in the Ante-Nicene Library, vol. xvi.

   A translation into English from a Syriac version (date unknown) was
   published by the Rev. J. Perkins, D.D., in the Journal of Sacred
   Literature, N. S., vol. vi., 1865, and republished by Tischendorf
   alongside of the Greek version in his Apocalypses Apocryphæ.

   The Revelation of Paul was known to S. Augustine, who thus refers to it
   in his Tractate 98 on the Gospel of John, § 8:  "...There have been
   some vain individuals, who, with a presumption that betrays the
   grossest folly, have forged a Revelation of Paul, crammed with all
   manner of fables, which has been rejected by the Orthodox Church;
   affirming it to be that whereof he had said that he was caught up into
   the third heavens, and there heard unspeakable words which it is not
   lawful for a man to utter.'  Nevertheless, the audacity of such might
   be tolerable, had he said that he heard words which it is not as yet
   lawful for a man to utter; but when he said which it is not lawful for
   a man to utter,' who are they that dare to utter them with such
   impudence and non-success?"

   Sozomen, H. E., vii., 19, after speaking of the Apocalypse of Peter,
   continues:  "So the work entitled The Apocalypse of the Apostle Paul,'
   though rejected by the ancients, is still esteemed by most of the
   monks.  Some persons affirm that the book was found during this reign
   (i.e., of Theodosius) by divine revelation, in a marble box, buried
   beneath the soil, in the house of Paul, at Tarsus, in Cilicia.  I have
   been informed that this report is false, by a presbyter of Tarsus, a
   man of very advanced age, as is indicated by his grey hairs."

   The book was probably composed, or rather compiled, for it is largely
   indebted to previous Apocalyptic writings, about the time when it
   purports to have been discovered at Tarsus, i.e., 388 a.d., the year of
   the consulship of Theodosius the Less and Cynegius.  The alleged
   sending of a copy of the original to Jerusalem probably indicates the
   place where it was composed, or, at least, first found currency.

   The Vision of Paul seems to have enjoyed great popularity during the
   Middle Ages.  Brandes (Halle, 1885), in his edition of two shorter
   Latin versions, enumerates twenty-two different mss. of the Latin and
   "gives particulars of French, English, Danish, and Slavonic forms of
   the legend."

   Of the three main versions, the Latin and Syriac are longer and fuller
   than the Greek, which in its present form has been abbreviated.  Taking
   advantage of the excellent comparative table presented by Mr. M. R.
   James in his edition of the text, the translator has endeavoured to
   point out to the reader, by notes in the margin, the passages where the
   Latin varies from the Greek, and, to a less extent, from the Syriac.
   Parallel passages in other and earlier Apocalyptic writings are also
   indicated in the notes.

   The Vision of Paul.

   ------------------------

   Here Begins the Vision of Saint Paul the Apostle.

   "But I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord:  I know a man
   in Christ fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or out
   of the body, I know not, God knoweth) snatched up in this manner to the
   third heaven:  and I know such a man, whether in the body or out of the
   body I know not, God knoweth; how that he was snatched up into Paradise
   and heard secret words which it is not lawful for men to speak; on
   behalf of such a one will I glory; but on mine own behalf I will not
   glory, save in my infirmities."--2 Cor. xii. 1-5.

   1.  At what time was this revelation made?  In the consulship of
   Theodosius Augustus the Younger and Cynegius, [3902] a certain nobleman
   then living in Tharsus, in the house which was that of Saint Paul, an
   angel appearing in the night revealed to him, saying that he should
   open the foundations of the house and should publish what he found, but
   he thought that these things were dreams.

   2.  But the angel coming for the third time beat him and forced him to
   open the foundation.  And digging he found a marble box, inscribed on
   the sides; there was the revelation of Saint Paul, and his shoes in
   which he walked teaching the word of God.  But he feared to open that
   box and brought it to the judge; when he had received it, the judge,
   because it was sealed with lead, sent it to the Emperor Theodosius,
   fearing lest it might be something else; which when he had received the
   emperor opened it, and found the revelation of Saint Paul; a copy of it
   he sent to Jerusalem, and retained the original himself.

   3.  While I was in the body in which I was snatched up to the third
   heaven, the word of the Lord came to me saying:  speak to the people:
   until when will ye transgress, and heap sin upon sin, and tempt the
   Lord who made you?  Ye are the sons of God, doing the works of the
   devil in the faith of Christ, on account of the impediments of the
   world.  Remember therefore and know that while every creature serves
   God, the human race alone sins.  But it reigns over every creature and
   sins more than all nature.

   4.  For indeed the sun, the great light, often addressed the Lord
   saying:  Lord God Almighty, I look out upon the impieties and
   injustices of men; permit me and I shall do unto them what are my
   powers, that they may know that thou art God alone.  And there came a
   voice saying to him:  I know all these things, for mine eye sees and
   ear hears, but my patience bears them until they shall be converted and
   repent.  But if they do not return to me I will judge them all.

   5.  For sometimes the moon and stars addressed the Lord saying:  Lord
   God Almighty, to us thou hast given the power of the night; till when
   shall we look down upon the impieties and fornications and homicides
   done by the sons of men?  Permit us to do unto them according to our
   powers, that they may know that thou art God alone.  And there came a
   voice unto them saying:  I know all these things, and mine eye looks
   forth and ear hears, but my patience bears with them until they shall
   be converted and repent.  But if they do not return unto me I will
   judge them.

   6.  And frequently also the sea exclaimed saying:  Lord God Almighty,
   men have defiled thy holy name in me; permit me to arise and cover
   every wood and orchard and the whole world, until I blot out all the
   sons of men from before thy face, that they may know that thou art God
   alone.  And the voice came again and said:  I know all things; mine eye
   seeth everything, and mine ear heareth, but my patience bears with them
   until they be converted and repent.  But if they do not return, I will
   judge them.  Sometimes the waters [3903] also spoke against the sins of
   men saying:  Lord God Almighty, all the sons of men have defiled thy
   holy name.  And there came a voice saying:  I know all things before
   they come to pass, for mine eye seeth and mine ear heareth all things,
   but my patience bears with them until they be converted.  But if not I
   will judge them.  Frequently also the earth [3904] too exclaimed to the
   Lord against the sons of men saying:  Lord God Almighty, I above every
   other creature of thine am harmed, supporting the fornications,
   adulteries, homicides, thefts, perjuries and magic and ill-doings of
   men and all the evil they do, so that the father rises up against the
   son, and the son upon the father, the alien against the alien, so that
   each one defiles his neighbour's wife.  The father ascends upon the bed
   of his own son, and the son likewise ascends the couch of his own
   father; and in all these evils, they who offer the sacrifice to thy
   name have defiled thy holy place.  Therefore I am injured above every
   creature, desiring not to shew my power to myself, and my fruits to the
   sons of men.  Permit me and I will destroy the virtue of my fruits.
   And there came a voice and said:  I know all things, and there is none
   who can hide himself from his sin.  Moreover I know their impieties,
   but my holiness suffers them until they be converted and repent.  But
   if they do not return unto me I will judge them.

   7.  Behold, ye sons of men, the creature is subject to God, but the
   human race alone sins.  For this cause, therefore, ye sons of men,
   bless the Lord God unceasingly, every hour and every day: but more
   especially when the sun has set: [3905]   for at that hour all the
   angels proceed to the Lord to worship him and to present the works of
   men, which every man has wrought from the morning till the evening,
   whether good or evil.  And there is a certain angel who proceeds
   rejoicing concerning the man in whom he dwells.  When therefore the sun
   [3906] has set in the first hour of night, in the same hour the angel
   of every people and every man and woman, who protect and preserve them,
   because man is the image of God:  similarly also in the matin hour
   which is the twelfth of the night, all the angels of men and women, go
   up to God to worship God, and present every work which each man has
   wrought, whether good or evil.  Moreover every day and night the angels
   show to God an account [3907] of all the acts of the human race.  To
   you, therefore, I say, ye sons of men, bless the Lord God without fail
   all the days of your life.

   8.  Therefore at the appointed hour all the angels whatever, rejoicing
   at once together, proceed before God that they may meet to worship at
   the hour determined.  And behold suddenly it became the hour of
   meeting, and the angels came to worship in the presence of God, and the
   spirit proceeded to meet them:  and there came a voice and said:
   Whence come ye, our angels, bearing the burdens of tidings?

   9.  They answered and said:  We come from those who have renounced this
   world for the sake of thy holy name, wandering as pilgrims, and in
   caves of the rocks, and weeping every hour in which they inhabited the
   earth, and hungering and thirsting because of thy name, with their
   loins girded, having in their hands the incense of their hearts, and
   praying and blessing every hour, and restraining and overcoming
   themselves, weeping and wailing above the rest that inhabit the earth.
   And we indeed, their angels, mourn along with them:  whither therefore
   it shall please thee, command us to go and minister, lest others also
   do it, but the destitute above the rest who are on earth.  And there
   came the voice of God to them saying:  Know ye that now henceforward my
   grace is appointed unto you, and my help, who is my well-beloved Son,
   shall be present with them, guiding them every hour; ministering also
   to them, never deserting them, since their place is his habitation.

   10.  When therefore these angels had retired, behold other angels came
   to adore in the presence of honour, in the assembly, who wept; and the
   spirit of God proceeded to meet them, and there came the voice of God
   and said:  Whence come ye, our angels, bearing the burdens of the
   ministry of the tidings of the world?  They answered and said in the
   presence of God:  We have arrived from those who called upon thy name,
   and the impediments of the world made them wretched, devising many
   occasions every hour, not even making one pure prayer, nor out of their
   whole heart, in all the time of their life; what need, therefore, is
   there to be present with men who are sinners?  And there came the voice
   of God to them:  It is necessary that ye should minister to them, until
   they be converted and repent:  but if they do not return to me I will
   judge them.  Know therefore, sons of men, that whatever things are
   wrought by you, these angels relate to God, whether good or evil.

   11.  And the angel answered and said unto me:  Follow me, and I will
   show you the place of the just where they are led when they are
   deceased, and after these things taking thee into the abyss, I will
   show thee the souls of sinners and what sort of place they are led into
   when they have deceased.  And I proceeded back after the angel, and he
   led me into heaven, and I looked back upon the firmament, and I saw in
   the same place power, and there was there oblivion which deceives and
   draws down to itself the hearts of men, and the spirit of detraction,
   and the spirit of fornication, and the spirit of madness, and the
   spirit of insolence, and there were there the princes of vices:  these
   I saw under the firmament of heaven:  and again I looked back, and I
   saw angels without mercy, having no pity, whose countenance was full of
   madness, and their teeth sticking out beyond the mouth:  their eyes
   shone like the morning star of the east, and from the hairs of their
   head sparks of fire went out, or from their mouth.  And I asked the
   angel saying:  Sir, who are those?  And the angel answered and said
   unto me:  These are those who are destined to the souls of the impious
   in the hour of need, who did not believe that they had the Lord for
   their helper, nor hoped in him.

   12.  And I looked on high and I saw other angels whose countenance
   shone as the sun, their loins girded with golden girdles, having palms
   in their hands, and the sign of God, clothed with garments in which was
   written the name of the Son of God, filled moreover with all meekness
   and pity; and I asked the angels saying:  Who are these, Lord, in so
   great beauty and pity?  And the angel answered and said unto me:  These
   are the angels of justice who are sent to lead up the souls of the
   just, in the hour of need, who believed that they had the Lord for
   their helper.  And I said to him:  Do the just and sinners necessarily
   meet witnesses when they have died?  And the angel answered and said to
   me:  There is one way by which all pass over to God, but the just
   having their helper with them are not confounded when they go to appear
   in the sight of God.

   13.  And I said to the angel:  I wished to see the souls of the just
   and of sinners going out of the world.  And the angel answered and said
   unto me:  Look down upon the earth.  And I looked down from heaven upon
   the earth, and saw the whole world, and it was nothing in my sight and
   I saw the sons of men as though they were naught, and a-wanting, and I
   wondered and said to the angel:  Is this the greatness of men?  And the
   angel answered and said unto me:  It is, and these are they who do evil
   from morning till evening.  And I looked and saw a great cloud of fire
   spread over the whole world, and I said to the angel:  What is this, my
   Lord? and he said to me:  This is injustice stirred up by the princes
   of sinners.

   14.  I indeed when I had heard this sighed and wept, and said to the
   angel:  I wished to see the souls of the just and of sinners, and to
   see in what manner they go out of the body.  And the angel answered and
   said unto me:  Look again upon the earth.  And I looked and saw all the
   world, and men were as naught and a-wanting:  and I looked carefully
   and saw a certain man about to die, and the angel said to me:  This one
   whom thou seest is a just man.  And I looked again and saw all his
   works, whatever he had done for the sake of God's name, and all his
   desires, both what he remembered, and what he did not remember; they
   all stood in his sight in the hour of need; and I saw the just man
   advance and find refreshment and confidence, and before he went out of
   the world the holy and the impious angels both attended:  and I saw
   them all, but the impious found no place of habitation in him, but the
   holy took possession of his soul, guiding it till it went out of the
   body:  and they roused the soul saying:  Soul, know thy body whence
   thou goest out, for it is necessary that thou shouldst return to the
   same body on the day of the resurrection, that thou mayest receive the
   things promised to all the just.  Receiving therefore the soul from the
   body, they immediately kissed it as familiarly known to them, saying to
   it:  Do manfully, for thou hast done the will of God while placed in
   the earth.  And there came to meet him the angel who watched him every
   day, and said to him:  Do manfully, soul; for I rejoice in thee,
   because thou hast done the will of God on earth:  for I related to God
   all thy works, such as they were.  Similarly also the spirit proceeded
   to meet him and said:  Soul, fear not, nor be disturbed, until thou
   comest into a place which thou hast never known, but I will be a helper
   unto thee:  for I found in thee a place of refreshment in the time when
   I dwelt in thee, while I was on earth.  And his spirit strengthened
   him, and his angel received him, and led him into heaven:  and an angel
   said:  Whither runnest thou, O soul, and dost thou dare to enter into
   heaven?  Wait and let us see if there is anything of ours in thee:  and
   behold we find nothing in thee.  I see also thy divine helper and
   angel, and the spirit is rejoicing along with thee, because thou hast
   done the will of God on earth.  And they led him along till he should
   worship in the sight of God.  And when they had ceased, immediately
   Michael and all the army of angels, with one voice, adored the
   footstool of his feet, and his doom, saying at the same time to the
   soul:  This is your God of all things, who made you in his own image
   and likeness.  Moreover the angel returns and points him out saying:
   God, remember his labours:  for this is the soul, whose works I related
   to thee, doing according to thy judgment.  And the spirit said
   likewise:  I am the spirit of vivification inspiring him:  for I had
   refreshment in him, in the time when I dwelt in him, doing according to
   thy judgment.  And there came the voice of God and said:  In as much as
   this man did not vex me, neither will I vex him; for according as he
   had pity, I also will have pity.  Let him therefore be handed over to
   Michael, the angel of the Covenant, and let him lead him into the
   Paradise of joy, that he himself may become co-heir with all the
   saints.  And after these things I heard the voices of a thousand
   thousand angels, and archangels, and cherubim, and twenty-four elders
   saying hymns, and glorifying the Lord and crying:  thou art just, O
   Lord, and just are thy judgments, and there is no acceptance of persons
   with thee, but thou rewardest unto every man according to thy
   judgment.  And the angel answered and said unto me:  Hast thou believed
   and known, that whatever each man of you has done, he sees in the hour
   of need?  And I said:  Yes, sir.

   15.  And he saith to me:  Look again down on the earth, and watch the
   soul of an impious man going out of the body, which vexed the Lord day
   and night, saying:  I know nothing else in this world, I eat and drink,
   and enjoy what is in the world; for who is there who has descended into
   hell, and ascending has declared to us that there is judgment there!
   And again I looked carefully, and saw all the scorn of the sinner, and
   all that he did, and they stood together before him in the hour of
   need:  and it was done to him in that hour, in which he was threatened
   about his body at the judgment, and I said:  It were better for him if
   he had not been born.  And after these things, there came at the same
   time, the holy angels, and the malign, and the soul of the sinner and
   the holy angels did not find a place in it.  Moreover the malign angels
   cursed it; and when they had drawn it out of the body, the angels
   admonished it a third time, saying:  O wretched soul, look upon thy
   flesh, whence thou camest out:  for it is necessary that thou shouldst
   return to thy flesh in the day of resurrection, that thou mayest
   receive the due for thy sins and thy impieties.

   16.  And when they had led it forth, the customary angel preceded it,
   and said to it:  O wretched soul, I am the angel belonging to thee,
   relating daily to the Lord thy malign works, whatever thou didst by
   night or day:  and if it were in my power, not for one day would I
   minister to thee, but none of these things was I able to do:  the judge
   is pitiful and just, and he himself commanded us that we should not
   cease to minister to the soul, till you should repent, but thou hast
   lost the time of repentance.  I indeed was strange to thee and thou to
   me.  Let us go on then to the just judge:  I will not dismiss thee,
   before I know from to-day why I was strange to thee.  And the spirit
   confounded him, and the angel troubled him.  When, therefore, they had
   arrived at the power, when he started to enter heaven, a labour was
   imposed upon him, above all other labour:  error and oblivion and
   murmuring met him, and the spirit of fornication, and the rest of the
   powers, and said to him:  Whither goest thou, wretched soul, and darest
   thou to rush into heaven? hold, that we may see if we have our
   qualities in thee, since we do not see that thou hast a holy helper.
   And after that I heard voices in the height of heaven saying:  Present
   that wretched soul to God, that it may know that it is God that it
   despised.  When, therefore, it had entered heaven, all the angels saw
   it, a thousand thousand exclaimed with one voice, all saying:  Woe to
   thee, wretched soul, for the sake of thy works which thou didst on
   earth; what answer art thou about to give to God when thou shalt have
   approached to adore him?  The angel who was with it answered and said:
   Weep with me, my beloved, for I have not found rest in this soul.  And
   the angels answered him and said:  Let such a soul be taken away from
   the midst of ours, for from the time he entered, the stink of him
   crosses to us angels.  And after these things it was presented, that it
   might worship in the sight of God, and an angel of God showed him God
   who made him after his own image and likeness.  Moreover his angel ran
   before him saying:  Lord God Almighty, I am the angel of this soul,
   whose works I presented to thee day and night, not doing according to
   thy judgment.  And the spirit likewise said:  I am the spirit who dwelt
   in it from the time it was made, in itself moreover I know it, and it
   has not followed my will:  judge it, Lord, according to thy judgment.
   And there came the voice of God to it and said:  Where is thy fruit
   which thou has made worthy of the goods which thou hast received?  Have
   I put a distance of one day between thee and the just man?  Did I not
   make the sun to arise upon thee as upon the just?  But the soul was
   silent, having nothing to answer:  and again there came a voice
   saying:  Just is the judgment of God, and there is no acceptance of
   persons with God, for whoever shall have done mercy, on them shall he
   have mercy, and whoever shall not have pitied neither shall God pity
   him.  Let him therefore be handed over to the angel Tartaruch, who is
   set over the punishments, and let him place him in outer darkness,
   where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth, and let him be there till
   the great day of judgment.  And after these things I heard the voice of
   angels and archangels saying:  Thou art just, Lord, and thy judgment is
   just.

   17.  And again I saw, and behold a soul which was led forward by two
   angels, weeping and saying:  Have pity on me, just God, God the judge,
   for to-day is seven days since I went out of my body, and I was handed
   over to these two angels, and they led me through to those places,
   which I had never seen.  And God, the just judge, saith to him:  What
   hast thou done? for thou never didst mercy, wherefore thou wast handed
   over to such angels as have no mercy, and because thou didst not do
   uprightly, so neither did they act piously with thee in the hour of thy
   need.  Confess therefore thy sins which thou didst commit when placed
   in the world.  And he answered and said:  Lord, I did not sin.  And the
   Lord, the just Lord, was angered in fury when it said:  I did not sin,
   because it lied; and God said:  Dost thou think thou art still in the
   world? if any one of you, sinning there, conceal and hide his sin from
   his neighbour, here indeed nothing whatever shall be hid:  for when the
   souls come to adore in sight of the throne, both the good works and the
   sins of each one are made manifest.  And hearing these things the soul
   was silent, having no answer.  And I heard the Lord God, the just
   judge, again saying:  Come, angel of this soul, and stand in the
   midst.  And the angel of the sinful soul came, having in his hands a
   manuscript, and said:  These, Lord, in my hands, are all the sins of
   this soul from his youth till to-day, from the tenth year of his
   birth:  and if thou command, Lord, I will also relate his acts from the
   beginning of his fifteenth year.  And the Lord God, the just judge,
   said:  I say unto thee, angel, I do not expect of thee an account of
   him since he began to be fifteen years old, but state his sins for five
   years before he died and before he came hither.  And again God, the
   just judge, said:  For by myself I swear, and by my holy angels, and by
   my virtue, that if he had repented five years before he died, on
   account of one year's life, oblivion would now be thrown over all the
   evils which he sinned before, and he would have indulgence and
   remission of sins:  now indeed he shall perish.  And the angel of the
   sinful soul answered and said:  Lord, command that angel to exhibit
   those souls.

   18.  And in that same hour the souls were exhibited in the midst, and
   the soul of the sinner knew them; and the Lord said to the soul of the
   sinner:  I say unto thee, soul, confess thy work which thou wroughtest
   in these souls, whom thou seest, when they were in the world.  And he
   answered and said:  Lord, it is not yet a full year since I slew this
   one and poured his blood upon the ground, and with another (a woman) I
   committed fornication:  not this alone, but I also greatly harmed her
   in taking away her goods.  And the Lord God, the just judge, said:
   Either thou didst not know that he who does violence to another, if he
   dies first who sustains the violence, is kept in this place until the
   doer of hurt dies, and then both stand in the presence of the judge,
   and now each receives according to his deed.  And I heard a voice of
   one saying:  Let that soul be delivered into the hands of Tartarus, and
   led down into hell:  he shall lead him into the lower prison and he
   shall be put in torments, and left there till the great day of
   judgment.  And again I heard a thousand thousand angels saying hymns to
   the Lord, and crying:  Thou art just, O Lord, and just are thy
   judgments.

   19.  The angel answered and said unto me:  Hast thou perceived all
   these things? and I said, Yes, sir.  And he said to me:  Follow me
   again, and I will take thee, and show thee the places of the just.  And
   I followed the angel, and he raised me to the third heaven, and placed
   me at the entry of the door:  and looking carefully I saw, and the door
   was of gold, and two columns of gold, full above of golden letters, and
   the angel tuned again to me and said:  Blessed wert thou, if thou hadst
   entered into these doors, for it is not allowed to any to enter except
   only to those who have goodness and innocence of body in all things.
   And I asked the angel about everything and said:  Sir, tell me on what
   account these letters are put upon those tables?  The angel answered
   and said unto me:  These are the names of the just, serving God with
   their whole heart, who dwell on the earth.  And again I said:  Sir,
   therefore their names and countenance and the likeness of these who
   serve God are in heaven, and are known to the angels:  for they know
   who are the servants of God with all their heart, before they go out of
   the world.

   20.  And when I had entered the interior of the gate of Paradise,
   [3908] there came out to meet me an old man whose countenance shone as
   the sun; and when he had embraced me he said:  Hail, Paul, beloved of
   God.  And he kissed me with a cheerful countenance.  He wept, and I
   said to him:  Brother, why dost thou weep?  And again sighing and
   lamenting he said:  We are hurt by men, and they vex us greatly; for
   many are the good things which the Lord has prepared, and great is his
   promise, but many do not perceive them.  And I asked the angel, and
   said:  Sir, who is this?  And he said to me:  This is Enoch, the scribe
   of righteousness.  And I entered into the interior of that place, and
   immediately I saw the sun, [3909] and coming it saluted me laughing and
   rejoicing.  And when it had seen (me), it turned away and wept, and
   said to me:  Paul, would that thou shouldst receive thy labours which
   thou hast done in the human race.  For me, indeed, I have seen the
   great and many good things, which God has prepared for the just, and
   the promises of God are great, but many do not perceive them; but even
   by many labours scarcely one or two enters into these places.

   21.  And the angel answered and said to me, [3910] Whatever I now show
   thee here, and whatever thou shalt hear, tell it not to any one in the
   earth.  And he led me and shewed me:  and there I heard words which it
   is not lawful for a man to speak.  And again he said, For now follow
   me, and I will shew thee what thou oughtest to narrate in public and
   relate.

   And he took me down from the third heaven, and led me into the second
   heaven, and again he led me on to the firmament and from the firmament
   he led me over the doors of heaven:  the beginning of its foundation
   was on the river which waters all the earth.  And I asked the angel and
   said, Lord, what is this river of water? and he said to me, This is
   Oceanus!  And suddenly I went out of heaven, and I understood that it
   is the light of heaven which lightens all the earth.  For the land
   there is seven times brighter [3911] than silver.  And I said, Lord,
   what is this place?  And he said to me, This is the land of promise.
   Hast thou never heard what is written:  Blessed are the meek:  for they
   shall inherit the earth?  The souls therefore of the just, when they
   have gone out of the body, are meanwhile dismissed to this place.  And
   I said to the angel, Then this land will be manifested before the
   time?  The angel answered and said to me, When Christ, whom thou
   preachest, shall come to reign, then, by the sentence of God, [3912]
   the first earth will be dissolved and this land of promise will then be
   revealed, and it will be like dew or cloud, and then the Lord Jesus
   Christ, the King Eternal, will be manifested and will come with all his
   saints to dwell in it, and he will reign over them a thousand years,
   and they will eat of the good things which I shall now show unto thee.

   22.  And I looked around upon that land and I saw a river flowing of
   milk and honey, and there were trees planted by the bank of that river,
   full of fruit:  moreover each single tree bore twelve fruits in the
   year, having various and diverse fruits:  and I saw the created things
   which are in that place and all the work of God, and I saw there palms
   of twenty cubits, but others of ten cubits:  and that land was seven
   times brighter than silver.  And there were trees full of fruits from
   the roots to the highest branches, of ten thousand fruits of palms upon
   ten thousand fruits.  The grape-vines moreover had ten thousand plants.
   [3913]   Moreover in the single vines there were ten thousand thousand
   bunches and in each of these a thousand single grapes:  moreover these
   single trees bore a thousand fruits.  And I said to the angel, Why does
   each tree bear a thousand fruits?  The angel answered and said unto me,
   Because the Lord God gives an abounding flood of gifts to the worthy,
   because they also of their own will afflicted themselves when they were
   placed in the world doing all things on account of his holy name.  And
   again I said to the angel, Sir, are these the only promises which the
   Most Holy God makes?  And he answered and said to me:  No! there are
   seven times greater than these.  But I say unto thee that when the just
   go out of the body they shall see the promises and the good things
   which God has prepared for them.  Till then, they shall sigh, and
   lament saying:  Have we emitted any word from our mouth to vex our
   neighbour even on one day?  I asked and said again:  Are these alone
   the promises of God?  And the angel answered and said unto me:  These
   whom you now see are the souls of the married [3914] and those who kept
   the chastity of their nuptials, containing themselves.  But to the
   virgins and those who hunger and thirst after righteousness and those
   who afflicted themselves for the sake of the name of God, God will give
   seven times greater than these, which I shall now show thee.

   And then he took me up from that place where I saw these things and
   behold, a river, and its waters were greatly whiter than milk, and I
   said to the angel, What is this?  And he said to me:  This is the
   Acherousian Lake where is the City of Christ, but not every man is
   permitted to enter that city; for this is the journey which leads to
   God, and if anyone is a fornicator and impious, and is converted and
   shall repent and do fruits worthy of repentance, at first indeed when
   he shall have gone out of the body, he is led and adores God, and
   thence by command of the Lord he is delivered to the angel Michael and
   he baptizes him in the Acherousian Lake--thus he leads them into the
   City of Christ alongside of those who have never sinned.  But I
   wondered and blessed the Lord God for all the things which I saw.

   23.  And the angel answered and said unto me:  Follow me and I will
   lead thee into the City of Christ.  And he was standing on the
   Acherousian Lake and he put me into a golden ship [3915] and angels as
   it were three thousand were saying hymns before me till I arrived at
   the City of Christ.  Moreover those who inhabited the City of Christ
   greatly rejoiced over me as I went to them, and I entered and saw the
   City of Christ, and it was all of gold, and twelve walls encircled it,
   and twelve interior towers, and each wall had between them single
   stadia in the circuit:  And I said to the angel, Sir, how much is a
   stadium?  The angel answered and said to me:  As much as there is
   between the Lord God and the men who are on the earth, for the City of
   Christ is alone great.  And there were twelve gates in the circuit of
   the city, of great beauty, and four rivers which encircled it.  There
   was, moreover, a river of honey and a river of milk, and a river of
   wine and a river of oil.  And I said to the angel:  What are these
   rivers surrounding that city?  And he saith to me:  These are the four
   rivers which flow sufficiently for those who are in this land of
   promise, of which the names [3916] are:  the river of honey is called
   Fison, and the river of milk Euphrates, and the river of oil Gion, and
   the river of wine Tigris, such therefore they are for those who when
   placed in the world did not use the power of these things, but they
   hungered for these things and afflicted themselves for the sake of the
   Lord God:  so that when these enter into this city, the Lord will
   assign them these things on high above all measure.

   24.  I indeed entering the gates saw trees great and very high before
   the doors of the city, having no fruit but leaves only, and I saw a few
   men scattered in the midst of the trees, and they lamented greatly when
   they saw anyone enter the city.  And those trees were sorry for them
   and humbled themselves and bowed down and again erected themselves.
   And I saw and wept with them and I asked the angel and said:  Sir, who
   are these who are not admitted to enter into the City of Christ?  And
   he said to me:  These are they who zealously abstained day and night in
   fasts, but they had a proud heart above other men, glorifying and
   praising themselves and doing nothing for their neighbours.  For they
   gave some friendly greeting, but to others they did not even say hail!
   and indeed they shewed hospitality to those only whom they wished, and
   if they did anything whatever for their neighbour they were
   immoderately puffed up.  And I said:  What then, Sir?  Did their pride
   prevent them from entering into the City of Christ?  And the angel
   answered and said unto me:  Pride is the root of all evils.  Are they
   better than the Son of God who came to the Jews with much humility?
   And I asked him and said:  Why is it that the trees humble themselves
   and erect themselves again?  And the angel answered and said to me:
   The whole time which these men passed on earth zealously serving God,
   on account of the confusion and reproaches of men at the time, they
   blushed and humiliated themselves, but they were not saddened. nor did
   they repent that they should recede from their pride which was in
   them.  This is why the trees humble themselves, and again are raised
   up.  And I asked and said:  For what cause were they admitted to the
   doors of the city?  The angel answered and said unto me:  Because of
   the great goodness of God, and because there is the entry of his holy
   men entering into this city:  for this cause they are left in this
   place, but when Christ the King Eternal enters with his saints, as he
   enters just men may pray for these, and then they may enter into the
   city along with them:  but yet none of them is able to have assurance
   such as they have who humbled themselves, serving the Lord God all
   their lives.

   25.  But I went on while the angel instructed me, and he carried me to
   the river of honey, and I saw there Isaiah and Jeremiah [3917] and
   Ezekiel and Amos, and Micah and Zechariah, the minor and major
   prophets, and they saluted me in the city.  I said to the angel:  What
   way is this?  And he said to me:  This is the way of the prophets,
   every one who shall have afflicted his soul and not done his own will
   because of God, when he shall have gone out of the world and have been
   led to the Lord God and adored him, then by the command of God he is
   handed over to Michael, and he leads him into the city to this place of
   the prophets, and they salute him as their friend and neighbour because
   he did the will of God.

   26.  Again he led me where there is a river of milk, and I saw in that
   place all the infants whom Herod slew because of the name of Christ,
   and they saluted me, and the angel said to me:  All who keep their
   chastity with purity, when they shall have come out of the body, after
   they adore the Lord God are delivered to Michael and are led to the
   infants and they salute them, saying that they are our brothers and
   friends and members; in themselves they shall inherit the promises of
   God.

   27.  Again he took me up and carried me to the north of the city and
   led me where there was a river of wine, and there I saw Abraham and
   Isaac and Jacob, Lot and Job and other saints, [3918] and they saluted
   me:  and I asked and said:  What is this place, my Lord?  The angel
   answered and said to me:  All who are receivers of pilgrims, when they
   go out of the world, first adore the Lord God, and are delivered to
   Michael and by this way are led into the city, and all the just salute
   him as son and brother, and say unto him:  Because thou hast observed
   humanity and the receiving of pilgrims, come, have an inheritance in
   the city of the Lord our God:  every just man shall receive good things
   of God in the city, according to his own action.

   28.  And again he carried me near the river of oil on the east of the
   city.  And I saw there men rejoicing and singing psalms, and I said:
   Who are those, my Lord?  And the angel saith to me:  Those are they who
   devoted themselves to God with their whole heart and had no pride in
   themselves.  For all those who rejoice in the Lord God and sing psalms
   to the Lord with their whole heart are here led into this city.

   29.  And he carried me into the midst of the city near the twelve
   walls. [3919]   But there was in this place a higher wall, and I asked
   and said:  Is there in the City of Christ a wall which in honour
   exceeds this place?  And the angel answering said to me:  There is a
   second better than the first, and similarly a third than the second, as
   each exceeds the other, unto the twelfth wall.  And I said:  Tell me,
   Sir, why one exceeds another in glory?  And the angel answered and said
   unto me:  All who have in themselves even a little detraction or zeal
   or pride, something of his glory would be made void even if he were in
   the city of Christ:  look backward!

   And turning round I saw golden thrones placed in each gate, and on them
   men having golden diadems and gems: [3920]   and I looked carefully and
   I saw inside between the twelve men thrones placed in another rank
   which appeared of much glory, so that no one is able to recount their
   praise.  And I asked the angel and said:  My lord, who is on the
   throne?  And the angel answered and said unto me:  Those thrones belong
   to those who had goodness and understanding of heart and made
   themselves fools for the sake of the Lord God, nor knew new Scriptures
   nor psalms, but, mindful of one chapter of the commands of God, and
   hearing what it contained they wrought thereby in much diligence and
   had a right zeal before the Lord God, and the admiration of them will
   seize all the saints in presence of the Lord God, for talking with one
   another they say, Wait and see the unlearned who know nothing more:  by
   which means they merited so great and such a garment and so great glory
   on account of their innocence.

   And I saw in the midst of this city a great altar, very high, and there
   was one standing near the altar whose countenance shone as the sun, and
   he held in his hands a psaltery and harp, and he sang psalms, saying
   Halleluia!  And his voice filled the whole city:  at the same time when
   all they who were on the towers and gates heard him they responded
   Halleluia! so that the foundations of the city were shaken:  and I
   asked the angel and said, Sir, who is this of so great power?  And the
   angel said to me:  This is David:  this is the city of Jerusalem, for
   when Christ the King of Eternity shall come with the assurance of His
   kingdom, he again shall go before him that he may sing psalms, and all
   the just at the same time shall sing psalms responding Halleluia!  And
   I said, Sir, how did David alone above the other saints make a
   beginning of psalm-singing?  And the angel answered and said unto me:
   Because Christ the Son of God sits at the right hand of His Father, and
   this David sings psalms before him in the seventh heaven, and as is
   done in the heavens so also below, because the host may not be offered
   to God without David, but it is necessary that David should sing psalms
   in the hour of the oblation of the body and blood of Christ:  as it is
   performed in heaven so also on earth.

   30.  And I said to the angel:  Sir, what is Alleluia?  And the angel
   answered and said to me:  You ask questions about everything.  And he
   said to me, Alleluia is said in the Hebrew language of God and angels,
   for the meaning of Alleluia is this:  tecel cat. marith macha. [3921]
   And I said, Sir, what is tecel cat. marith macha?  And the angel
   answered and said unto me:  Tecel cat. marith macha is:  Let us all
   bless him together.  I asked the angel and said, Sir, do all who say
   Alleluia bless the Lord?  And the angel answered and said to me:  It is
   so, and again, therefore, if any one sing Alleluia and those who are
   present do not sing at the same time, they commit sin because they do
   not sing along with him.  And I said:  My lord, does he also sin if he
   be hesitating or very old?  The angel answered and said unto me:  Not
   so, but he who is able and does not join in the singing, know such as a
   despiser of the Word, and it would be proud and unworthy that he should
   not bless the Lord God his maker.

   31.  Moreover when he had ceased speaking to me, he led me outside the
   city through the midst of the trees and far from the places of the land
   of the good, and put me across the river of milk and honey:  and after
   that he led me over the ocean which supports the foundations of heaven.

   The angel answered and said unto me:  Dost thou understand why thou
   goest hence?  And I said:  Yes, sir.  And he said to me:  Come and
   follow me, and I will show thee the souls of the impious and sinners,
   that thou mayest know what manner of place it is.  And I proceeded with
   the angel and he carried me by the setting of the sun, and I saw the
   beginning of heaven founded on a great river of water, and I asked:
   What is this river of water?  And he said to me:  This is Ocean which
   surrounds all the Earth.  And when I was at the outer limit of Ocean I
   looked, and there was no light in that place, but darkness and sorrow
   and sadness:  and I sighed.

   And I saw there a fervent river of fire, and in it a multitude of men
   and women immersed up to the knees, and other men up to the navel,
   others even up to the lips, others moreover up to the hair.  And I
   asked the angel and said:  Sir, who are those in the fiery river?  And
   the angel answered and said to me:  They are neither hot nor cold,
   because they were found neither in the number of the just nor in the
   number of the impious. [3922]   For those spent the time of their life
   on earth passing some days in prayer, but others in sins and
   fornications, until their death.  And I asked him and said:  Who are
   these, Sir, immersed up to their knees in fire?  He answered and said
   to me:  These are they who when they have gone out of church throw
   themselves into strange conversations to dispute.  Those indeed who are
   immersed up to the navel are those who, when they have taken the body
   and blood of Christ go and fornicate and did not cease from their sins
   till they died.  Those who are immersed up to the lips are the
   detractors of each other when they assemble in the church of God:
   those up to the eyebrows are those who nod approval of themselves and
   plot spite against their neighbour. [3923]

   32.  And I saw on the north a place of various and diverse punishments
   full of men and women, [3924] and a river of fire ran down into it.
   Moreover I observed and I saw pits great in depth, and in them several
   souls together, and the depth of that place was as it were three
   thousand cubits, and I saw them groaning and weeping and saying:  Have
   pity on us, O Lord! and none had pity on them.  And I asked the angel
   and said:  Who are these, Sir?  And the angel answered and said unto
   me:  These are they who did not hope in the Lord, that they would be
   able to have him as their helper.  And I asked and said:  Sir, if these
   souls remain for thirty or forty generations thus one upon another, if
   they were sent deeper, the pits I believe would not hold them.  And he
   said to me:  The Abyss has no measure, for beyond [3925] this it
   stretches down below him who is down in it:  and so it is, that if
   perchance anyone should take a stone and throw it into a very deep well
   and after many hours it should reach the bottom, such is the abyss.
   For when the souls are thrown in there, they hardly reach the bottom in
   fifty years.

   33.  I, indeed, when I heard this, wept and groaned over the human
   race.  The angel answered and said unto me:  Why dost thou weep?  Art
   thou more pitiful than God?  For though God is good, He knows also that
   there are punishments, and He patiently bears with the human race,
   dismissing each one to work his own will in the time in which he dwells
   on the earth.

   34.  I further observed the fiery river and saw there a man being
   tortured by Tartaruchian angels having in their hands an iron with
   three hooks with which they pierced the bowels of that old man:  and I
   asked the angel, and said:  Sir, who is that old man on whom such
   torments are imposed?  And the angel answered and said to me:  He whom
   you see was a presbyter who did not perform well his ministry:  when he
   had been eating and drinking and committing fornication he offered the
   host to the Lord at his holy altar.

   35.  And I saw not far away another old man led on by malign angels
   running with speed, and they pushed him into the fire up to his knees,
   and they struck him with stones and wounded his face like a storm, and
   did not allow him to say:  Have pity on me!  And I asked the angel and
   he said to me:  He whom you see was a bishop, and did not perform well
   his episcopate, who indeed accepted the great name but did not enter
   into the witness of him who gave him the name in all his life, seeing
   that he did not do just judgment, and did not pity widows and orphans,
   but now he receives retribution according to his iniquity and his
   works.

   36.  And I saw another man in the fiery river up to his knees.
   Moreover his hands were stretched out and bloody, and worms proceeded
   from his mouth and nostrils and he was groaning and weeping, and crying
   he said:  Have pity on me! for I am hurt above the rest who are in this
   punishment.  And I asked, Sir, who is this?  And he said to me:  This
   man whom thou seest, was a deacon who devoured the oblations and
   committed fornications and did not right in the sight of God, for this
   cause he unceasingly pays this penalty.

   And I looked closely and saw alongside of him another [3926] man whom
   they delivered up with haste and cast into the fiery river, and he was
   (in it) up to the knees:  and there came the angel who was set over the
   punishments having a great fiery razor, and with it he cut the lips of
   that man and the tongue likewise.  And sighing, I lamented and asked:
   Who is that, sir.  And he said to me, He whom thou seest was a reader
   and read to the people, but he himself did not keep the precepts of
   God:  now he also pays the proper penalty.

   37.  And I saw another multitude of pits in the same place, and in the
   midst of it a river full of a multitude of men and women, [3927] and
   worms [3928] consumed them.  But I lamented and sighing asked the angel
   and said:  Sir, who are these?  And he said to me:  These are those who
   exacted interest [3929] on interest and trusted in their riches and did
   not hope in God that He was their helper.

   And after that I looked and saw another place, very narrow, and it was
   like a wall, and fire round about it.  And I saw inside men and women
   gnawing [3930] their tongues, and I asked:  Sir, who are these.  And he
   said to me:  These are they who in church disparage the Word of God,
   not attending to it, but as it were make naught of God and His angels:
   for that cause they now likewise pay the proper penalty.

   38.  And I observed and saw another old man down in a pit and his
   countenance was like blood, and I asked and said, Sir, what is this
   place?  And he said to me:  Into that pit stream all the punishments.
   And I saw men and women immersed up to the lips and I asked, Sir, who
   are these?  And he said to me:  These are the magicians who prepared
   for men and women evil magic arts and did not find how to stop them
   till they died.

   And again I saw men and women with very black faces in a pit of fire,
   [3931] and I sighed and lamented and asked, Sir, who are these?  And he
   said to me:  These are fornicators and adulterers who committed
   adultery having wives of their own:  likewise also the women committed
   adultery having husbands of their own:  therefore they unceasingly
   suffer penalties.

   39.  And I saw there girls having black [3932] raiment, and four
   terrible angels having in their hands burning chains, and they put them
   on the necks of the girls and led them into darkness:  and I, again
   weeping, asked the angel:  Who are these, Sir?  And he said to me:
   These are they who, when they were virgins, defiled their virginity
   unknown to their parents; for which cause they unceasingly pay the
   proper penalties.

   And again I observed there men and women with hands cut and their feet
   placed naked in a place of ice and snow, and worms devoured them.  But
   seeing them I lamented and asked:  Sir, who are these?  And he said to
   me:  These are they who harmed orphans and widows and the poor, [3933]
   and did not hope in the Lord, for which cause they unceasingly pay the
   proper penalties.

   And I observed and saw others hanging over a channel of water, and
   their tongues were very dry, and many fruits were placed in their
   sight, and they were not permitted to take of them, and I asked:  Sir,
   who are these?  And he said to me:  These are they who break their fast
   [3934] before the appointed hour, for this cause they unceasingly pay
   these penalties.

   And I saw other men and women hanging by their eyebrows and their hair,
   [3935] and a fiery river drew them, and I said:  Who are these, my
   Lord?  And he said to me: [3936]   These are they who join themselves
   not to their own husbands and wives but to whores, and therefore they
   unceasingly pay the proper penalties.

   And I saw other men and women covered with dust, and their countenance
   was like blood, and they were in a pit of pitch and sulphur and running
   down into a fiery river, and I asked:  Sir, who are these? [3937]   And
   he said to me:  These are they who committed the iniquity of Sodom and
   Gomorrah, the male with the male, for which reason they unceasingly pay
   the penalties.

   40.  And [3938] I observed and saw men and women clothed in bright
   garments, having their eyes blind, placed in a pit, and I asked:  Sir,
   who are these?  And he said to me:  These are of the people who did
   alms, and knew not the Lord God, for which reason they unceasingly pay
   the proper penalties.  And I observed and saw other men and women on an
   obelisk of fire, and beasts tearing them in pieces, and they were not
   allowed to say, Lord have pity on us!  And I saw the angel [3939] of
   penalties putting heavy punishments on them and saying:  Acknowledge
   the Son of God; for this was predicted to you, when the divine
   Scriptures were read to you, and you did not attend; for which cause
   God's judgment is just, for your actions have apprehended you and
   brought you into these penalties.  But I sighed and wept, and I asked
   and said:  Who are these men and women who are strangled in fire and
   pay their penalties?  And he answered me:  These are women who defiled
   the image of God when bringing forth infants out of the womb, and these
   are the men who lay with them.  And their infants addressed the Lord
   God and the angels who were set over the punishments, saying: [3940]
   Cursed be the hour to our parents, for they defiled the image of God,
   having the name of God but not observing His precepts:  they gave us
   for food to dogs and to be trodden down of swine:  others they threw
   into the river.  But their infants [3941] were handed over to the
   angels of Tartarus who were set over the punishments, that they might
   lead them to a wide place of mercy:  but their fathers and mothers were
   tortured in a perpetual punishment.

   And after that I saw men and women clothed with rags full of pitch and
   fiery sulphur, and dragons were coiled about their necks and shoulders
   and feet, and angels having fiery horns restrained them and smote them,
   and closed their nostrils, saying to them:  Why did ye not know the
   time in which it was right to repent and serve God, and did not do it?
   And I asked:  Sir, who are these?  And he said to me:  These are they
   who seem to give up the world for God, [3942] putting on our garb, but
   the impediments of the world made them wretched, not maintaining agapæ,
   and they did not pity widows and orphans:  they did not receive the
   stranger and the pilgrim, nor did they offer the oblations, and they
   did not pity their neighbour.  Moreover their prayer did not even on
   one day ascend pure to the Lord God, but many impediments of the world
   detained them, and they were not able to do right in the sight of God,
   and the angels enclosed them in the place of punishments.  Moreover
   they saw those who were in punishments and said to them:  We indeed
   when we lived in the world neglected God, and ye also did likewise:  as
   we also truly when we were in the world knew that ye were sinners.  But
   ye said:  These are just and servants of God, now we know why ye were
   called by the name of the Lord:  for which cause they also pay their
   own penalties.

   And sighing I wept and said:  Woe unto men, woe unto sinners! why were
   they born?  And the angel answered and said unto me:  Why dost thou
   lament? [3943]   Art thou more pitiful than the Lord God who is blessed
   forever, who established judgment and sent forth every man to choose
   good and evil in his own will and do what pleases him?  Then I lamented
   again very greatly, and he said to me:  Dost thou lament when as yet
   thou hast not seen greater punishments?  Follow me and thou shalt see
   seven times greater than these.

   41.  And he carried me south and placed me above a well, and I found it
   sealed with seven seals:  and answering, the angel who was with me said
   to the angel of that place:  Open the mouth of the well that Paul, the
   well-beloved of God, may see, for authority is given him that he may
   see all the pains of hell.  And the angel said to me:  Stand afar off
   that thou mayest be able to bear the stench of this place.  When
   therefore the well was opened, immediately there arose from it a
   certain hard and malign stench, which surpasses all punishments:  and I
   looked into the well and I saw fiery masses glowing in every part, and
   narrow places, and the mouth of the well was narrow so as to admit one
   man only.  And the angel answered and said unto me:  If any man shall
   have been put into this well of the abyss and it shall have been sealed
   over him, no remembrance of him shall ever be made in the sight of the
   Father and His Son and the holy angels.  And I said:  Who are these,
   Sir, who are put into this well?  And he said to me:  They are whoever
   shall not confess that Christ has come in the flesh and that the Virgin
   Mary brought him forth, and whoever says that the bread and cup of the
   Eucharist of blessing are not this body and blood of Christ.

   42.  And I looked to the south in the west and I saw there a [3944]
   restless worm and in that place there was gnashing of teeth:  moreover
   the worms were one cubit long, and had two heads, and there I saw men
   and women in cold and gnashing of teeth.  And I asked and said, Sir,
   who are these in this place?  And he said to me:  These are they who
   say that Christ did not rise from the dead and that this flesh will not
   rise again.  And I asked and said:  Sir, is there no fire nor heat in
   this place?  And he said to me:  In this place there is nothing else
   but cold and snow: [3945]   and again he said to me:  Even if the sun
   should rise upon them, they do not become warm on account of the
   superabundant cold of that place and the snow.

   But hearing these things I stretched out my hands and wept, and sighing
   again, I said:  It were better for us if we had not been born, [3946]
   all of us who are sinners.

   43.  But when those who were in the same place saw me weeping with the
   angel, they themselves cried out and wept saying, Lord God have mercy
   upon us!  And after these things I saw the heavens open, and Michael
   [3947] the archangel descending from heaven, and with him was the whole
   army of angels, and they came to those who were placed in punishment
   and seeing him, again weeping, they cried out and said, Have pity on
   us!  Michael the archangel, have pity on us and on the human race, for
   on account of thy prayers the earth standeth.  We now see the judgment
   and acknowledge the Son of God!  It was impossible for us before these
   things to pray for this, before we entered into this place:  for we
   heard that there was a judgment before we went out of the world, but
   impediments and the life of the world did not allow us to repent.  And
   Michael answered and said:  Hear Michael speaking!  I am he who stands
   in the sight of God every hour:  As the Lord liveth, in whose sight I
   stand, I do not intermit one day or one night praying incessantly for
   the human race, and I indeed pray for those who are on the earth:  but
   they do not cease doing iniquity and fornications, and they do not
   bring to me any good while they are placed on earth:  and ye have
   consumed in vanity the time in which ye ought to have repented.  But I
   have always prayed thus and I now beseech that God may send dew and
   send forth rains upon the earth, and now I desire until the earth
   produce its fruits and verily I say, that if any have done but a little
   good, I will agonise for him, protecting him till he have escaped the
   judgment of penalties.  Where therefore are your prayers?  Where are
   your penances?  Ye have lost your time contemptuously.  But now weep
   and I will weep with you and the angels who are with me with the
   well-beloved Paul, if perchance the merciful God will have pity and
   give you refreshment.  But hearing these words they cried out and wept
   greatly, and all said with one voice:  Have pity on us, Son of God!
   And I, Paul, sighed and said:  O Lord God! have pity on thy creature,
   have pity on the sons of men, have pity on thine image.

   44.  And I looked and saw the heaven move like a tree shaken by the
   wind.  Suddenly, moreover, they threw themselves on their faces in the
   sight of the throne.  And I saw twenty-four elders and twenty-four
   thousand adoring God, and I saw an altar and veil and throne, and all
   were rejoicing; and the smoke of a good odour was raised near the altar
   of the throne of God, and I heard the voice of one saying:  For the
   sake of what do ye our angels and ministers intercede?  And they cried
   out saying:  We intercede seeing thy many kindnesses to the human
   race.  And after these things I saw the Son of God descending from
   heaven, and a diadem was on his head.  And seeing him those who were
   placed in punishment exclaimed all with one voice saying:  Have pity,
   Son of the High God!  Thou art He who shewest refreshment for all in
   the heavens and on earth, and on us likewise have pity, for since we
   have seen Thee, we have refreshment.  And a voice went out from the Son
   of God through all the punishments saying:  And what work have ye done
   that ye demand refreshment from me?  My blood was poured out for your
   sakes, and not even so did ye repent:  for your sakes I wore the crown
   of thorns on my head:  for you I received buffets on my cheeks, and not
   even so did ye repent.  I asked water when hanging on the cross and
   they gave me vinegar mixed with gall, with a spear they opened my right
   side, for my name's sake they slew my prophets and just men, and in all
   these things I gave you a place of repentance and ye would not.  Now,
   however, for the sake of Michael the archangel of my covenant and the
   angels who are with him, and because of Paul the well-beloved, whom I
   would not vex, for the sake of your brethren who are in the world and
   offer oblations, and for the sake of your sons, because my precepts are
   in them, and more for the sake of mine own kindness, on the day on
   which I rose from the dead, I give to you all who are in punishment a
   night and a day of refreshment forever.  And they all cried out and
   said, We bless thee, Son of God, that Thou hast given us a night and a
   day of respite.  For better to us is a refreshment of one day above all
   the time of our life which we were on earth, and if we had plainly
   known that this was intended for those who sin, we would have worked no
   other work, we would have done no business, and we would have done no
   iniquity:  what need had we for pride in the world?  For here our pride
   is crushed which ascended from our mouth against our neighbour:  our
   plagues and excessive straitness and the tears and the worms which are
   under us, these are much worse to us than the pains which we have left
   behind us.  When they said thus, the malign angels of the penalties
   were angered with them, saying:  How long do ye lament and sigh? for ye
   had no pity.  For this is the judgment of God who had no pity.  But ye
   received this great grace of a day and a night's refreshment on the
   Lord's Day for the sake of Paul the well-beloved of God who descended
   to you.

   45.  And after that the angel said to me:  Hast thou seen all these
   things?  And I said:  Yes, Sir.  And he said to me:  Follow me and I
   will lead thee into Paradise, that the just who are there may see thee,
   for lo! they hope to see thee, and they are ready to come to meet thee
   in joy and gladness.  And I followed the angel by the impulse of the
   Holy Spirit, and he placed me in Paradise and said to me:  This is
   Paradise in which Adam and his wife erred.  Moreover I entered Paradise
   and saw the beginning of waters, and there was an angel making a sign
   to me and he said to me:  Observe, said he, the waters, for this is the
   river of Physon which surrounds all the land of Evilla, and the second
   is Geon which surrounds all the land of Egypt and Ethiopia, and the
   third is Thigris which is over against the Assyrians, and another is
   Eufrates which waters all the land of Mesopotamia.  And when I had gone
   inside I saw a tree planted from whose roots water flowed out, and from
   this beginning there were four rivers.  And the spirit of God rested on
   that tree, and when the Spirit blew, the waters flowed forth, and I
   said:  My Lord, is it this tree itself which makes the waters flow?
   And he said to me:  That from the beginning, before the heavens and
   earth were manifested, and all things here invisible, the Spirit of God
   was borne upon the waters, but from the time when the command of God
   made the heavens and earth to appear, the Spirit rested upon this
   tree:  wherefore whenever the Spirit blows, the waters flow forth from
   the tree.  And he held me by the hand and led me near the tree of
   knowledge of good and evil, and he said:  This is the tree by which
   death entered into the world, and receiving of it through his wife Adam
   ate and death entered into the world.  And he shewed me another tree in
   the midst of Paradise, and saith to me:  This is the tree of life.

   46.  While I was yet looking upon the tree, I saw a virgin coming from
   afar and two hundred angels before her saying hymns, and I asked and
   said:  Sir, who is she who comes in so great glory?  And he said to
   me:  This is Mary the Virgin, the Mother of the Lord.  And coming near
   she saluted me and said:  Hail, Paul! well-beloved of God and angels
   and men.  For all the saints prayed my Son Jesus who is my Lord that
   thou mightest come hither in the body that they might see thee before
   thou goest out of the world.  And the Lord said to them:  Bear and be
   patient:  yet a little and ye shall see him and he shall be with you
   for ever:  and again they all said to him together:  Do not vex us, for
   we desire to see him in the flesh, for by him Thy name was greatly
   glorified in the world, and we have seen that he endured all the
   labours whether of the greater or of the less.  This we learn from
   those who come hither.  For when we say:  Who is he who directed you in
   the world? they reply to us:  There is one in the world whose name is
   Paul, he preaches and announces Christ, and we believe that many have
   entered into the kingdom through the virtue and sweetness of his
   speeches.  Behold all the just men are behind me coming to meet thee,
   Paul, and I first come for this cause to meet them who did the will of
   my Son and my Lord Jesus Christ, I first advance to meet them and do
   not send them away to be as wanderers until they meet in peace.

   47.  When she had thus spoken, I saw three coming from afar, very
   beautiful in the likeness of Christ, and their forms were shining, and
   their angels, and I asked:  Sir, who are these?  And he said to me:
   Dost thou not know those?  And I said:  No, Sir.  And he answered:
   These are the fathers of the people, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  And
   coming near they saluted me, and said:  Hail, Paul, well-beloved of God
   and men; blessed is he who suffers violence for the Lord's sake.  And
   Abraham answered me and said:  This is my son Isaac, and Jacob my
   well-beloved, and we have known the Lord and followed him; blessed are
   all they who believed in thy word, that they may be able to inherit the
   Kingdom of God by labour, by renunciation, and sanctification, and
   humility, and charity, and meekness, and right faith in the Lord; and
   we also have had devotion to the Lord whom thou preachest in the
   testament, that we might assist those who believed in him with their
   whole soul, and might minister unto them as fathers minister to their
   children.

   When they had thus spoken, I saw other twelve coming from afar in
   honour, and I asked:  Sir, who are these?  And he said:  These are the
   patriarchs.  And coming near they saluted me and said:  Hail, Paul,
   well-beloved of God and men:  the Lord did not vex us, that we might
   see thee yet in the body, before thou goest out of the world.  And each
   one of them reminded me of his name in order, from Ruben to Benjamin:
   and Joseph said to me:  I am he who was sold; but I say to thee, Paul,
   that all the things, whatever my brothers did to me, in nothing did I
   act maliciously with them, nor in all the labour which they imposed on
   me, nor in any point was I hurt by them on that account from morning
   till evening:  blessed is he who receives some hurt on account of the
   Lord, and bears it, for the Lord will repay it to him manifold, when he
   shall have gone out of the world.

   48.  When he had spoken thus far, I saw another beautiful one coming
   from afar, and his angels saying hymns, and I asked:  Sir, who is this
   that is beautiful of countenance?  And he saith to me:  Dost thou not
   know him?  And I said:  No, Sir.  And he said to me:  This is Moses the
   law-giver, to whom God gave the law.  And when he had come near me, he
   immediately wept, and after that he saluted me:  and I said to him:
   What dost thou lament? for I have heard that thou excellest every man
   in meekness.  And he answered saying:  I weep for those whom I planted
   with toil, because they did not bear fruit, nor did any profit by them;
   and I saw all the sheep whom I fed, that they were scattered and become
   as if they had no shepherd, and because all the toils which I endured
   for the sake of the sons of Israel were accounted as naught, and how
   greatsoever virtues I did in the midst of them these they did not
   understand, and I wonder that strangers and uncircumcised and
   idol-worshippers have been converted and have entered into the promises
   of God, but Israel has not entered; and now I say unto thee, brother
   Paul, that in that hour when the people hanged Jesus whom thou
   preachest, that the Father, the God of all, who gave me the law, and
   Michael and all the angels and archangels, and Abraham and Isaac, and
   Jacob, and all the just wept over the Son of God hanging on the cross.
   In that hour all the saints attended on me looking (upon me) and they
   said to me:  See, Moses, what men of thy people have done to the Son of
   God.  Wherefore thou art blessed, Paul, and blessed the generation and
   race which believed in thy word.

   49.  When he had spoken thus far, there came other twelve, and seeing
   me said:  Art thou Paul the glorified in heaven and on earth?  And I
   answered and said:  What are ye?  The first answered and said:  I am
   Esaias whom Manasses cut asunder with a wooden saw.  And the second
   said likewise:  I am Jeremias who was stoned by the children of Israel
   and slain.  And the third said:  I am Ezekiel whom the children of
   Israel dragged by the feet over a rock in a mountain till they knocked
   out my brains, and we endured all these toils, wishing to save the
   children of Israel:  and I say unto thee that after the toils which
   they laid upon me, I cast myself on my face in the sight of the Lord
   praying for them, bending my knees until the second hour of the Lord's
   day, till Michael came and lifted me up from the earth.  Blessed art
   thou, Paul, and blessed the nation which believed through thee.

   And as these passed by, I saw another, beautiful of countenance, and I
   asked:  Sir, Who is this?  Who when he had seen me, rejoiced and said
   to me:  This is Lot [3948] who was found just in Sodom.  And
   approaching [3949] he saluted me and said:  Blessed art thou, Paul, and
   blessed the generation to which thou didst minister.  And I answered
   and said to him:  Art thou Lot who wast found just in Sodom?  And he
   said:  I entertained angels, as travellers, and when they of the city
   wished to violate them, I offered them my two virgin daughters who had
   not yet known men, and gave them to them saying:  use them as ye will,
   but only to these men ye shall do no evil; for this cause they entered
   under the roof of my house.  For this cause, therefore, we ought to be
   confident and know that if anyone shall have done anything, God shall
   repay him manifold when they shall come to him.  Blessed art thou,
   Paul, and blessed the nation which believed in thy word.

   When, therefore, he had ceased talking to me, I saw another coming from
   a distance, very beautiful of countenance, and smiling, and his angels
   saying hymns:  and I said to the angel who was with me:  Has then each
   of the just an angel for companion?  And he said to me:  Each one of
   the saints has his own (angel) assisting him, and saying a hymn, and
   the one does not depart from the other.  And I said:  Who is this,
   Sir?  And he said:  This is Job.  And approaching, he saluted me and
   said:  Brother Paul, thou hast great praise with God and men.  And I am
   Job, who laboured much for a period of thirty years from a plague in
   the blood; and verily in the beginning, the wounds which went forth
   from my body were like grains of wheat.  But on the third day, they
   became as the foot of an ass; worms moreover which fell four digits in
   length:  and on the third (day) the devil appeared and said to me:  Say
   something against God and die.  I said to him:  If such be the will of
   God that I should remain under a plague all the time of my life till I
   die, I shall not cease from blessing the Lord, and I shall receive more
   reward.  For I know that the labours of that world are nothing to the
   refreshment which is afterwards:  for which cause blessed art thou,
   Paul, and blessed the nation which believed through thee.

   50.  When he had spoken thus far, another came calling from afar and
   saying:  Blessed art thou, Paul, and blessed am I because I saw thee,
   the beloved of the Lord.  And I asked the angel:  Sir, who is this?
   And he answered and said unto me:  This is Noe in the time of the
   deluge.  And immediately we saluted each other:  and greatly rejoicing
   he said to me:  Thou art Paul the most beloved of God.  And I asked
   him:  Who art thou?  And he said:  I am Noe, who was in the time of the
   deluge.  And I say to thee, Paul, that working for a hundred years, I
   made the ark, not putting off the tunic with which I was clad, nor did
   I cut the hair of my head.  Till then also I cherished continence, not
   approaching my own wife:  in those hundred years not a hair of my head
   grew in length, nor did my garments become soiled:  and I besought men
   at all times saying:  Repent, for a deluge of waters will come upon
   you.  But they laughed at me, and mocked my words; and again they said
   to me:  But this is the time of those who are able to play and sin
   freely, desiring her with whom it is possible to commit fornication
   frequently:  for God does not regard this, and does not know what
   things are done by us men, and there is no flood of waters straightway
   coming upon this world.  And they did not cease from their sins, till
   God destroyed all flesh which had the breath of life in it.  Know then
   that God loveth one just man more than all the world of the impious.
   Wherefore, blessed art thou, Paul, and blessed is the nation which
   believes through thee.

   51.  And turning round, I saw other just ones coming from afar, and I
   asked the angel:  Sir, who are those?  And he answered me:  These are
   Elias and Eliseus. [3950]   And they saluted me:  and I said to them:
   Who are ye?  And one of them answered and said:  I am Elias, the
   prophet of God; I am Elias who prayed, and because of my word, the
   heaven did not rain for three years and six months, on account of the
   unrighteousness of men.  God is just and true, who doeth the will of
   his servants:  for the angels often besought the Lord for rain, and he
   said:  Be patient till my servant Elias shall pray and petition for
   this and I will send rain on the earth. [3951]

   Greek.  In the Syriac as translated by the Rev. J. Perkins, D.D. (cf.
   Journal of Sacred Literature, N. S., vi., 1865, p. 399), the narrative
   runs as follows:  "And often the angels asked that he would give them
   rain, and he gave not, until I called upon him again; then he gave unto
   them.  But blessed art thou, O Paul, that thy generation, and those
   thou teachest, are the sons of the Kingdom.  And know thou, O Paul,
   that every man who believes through thee hath a great blessing, and a
   blessing is reserved for him."  Then he departed from me. And the angel
   who was with me led me forth, and said unto me:  "Lo, unto thee is
   given this mystery and revelation; as thou pleasest, make it known unto
   the sons of men."  And I, Paul, returned unto myself, and I knew all
   that I had seen; and in life I had not rest that I might reveal this
   mystery, but I wrote it and deposited it under the ground and the
   foundation of a certain faithful man with whom I used to be, in Tarsus,
   a city of Cilicia.  And when I was released from this life of time and
   stood before my Lord, thus said He unto me:  "Paul, have we shown all
   these things unto thee, that thou shouldst deposit them under the
   foundation of a house?  Then send, and disclose, concerning this
   Revelation that men may read it, and turn to the way of truth, that
   they also may not come to these bitter torments." Then follows the
   story of the discovery of the Revelation at Tarsus in the reign of
   Theodosius as given at the beginning of the Greek and Latin versions.

   The Apocalypse of the Virgin.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The present translation of this Apocalypse [3952] is made from the text
   as published by Mr. M. R. James in Texts and Studies, ii., 3, from a
   ms. in the Bodleian Library, which he assigns to the eleventh century.
   The original he conjecturally assigns to the ninth century, and regards
   it as a late and clumsy compilation based on (1) the Assumption Legends
   and (2) the Apocalypse of Paul.  Its main feature, intercession for the
   lost, it has in common with the Testament of Abraham, the Apocalypse of
   Paul, 4 Esdras, the Apocalypse of Baruch, the Apocalypse of Esdras and
   the Apocalypse of Sedrach.  Parallels are pointed out in the notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3952] In this Apocalypse and that of Sedrach which follows, the text
   is in many places so obviously corrupt that the translator cannot be
   confident that he has given the correct meaning of the original in all
   cases.--A.R.

   The Apocalypse of the Holy Mother of God Concerning the Chastisements.

   ------------------------

   I.  The all-holy mother of God was about to proceed to the Mount of
   Olives to pray; and praying to the Lord our God she said:  In the name
   of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit; let the archangel
   Gabriel descend, that he may tell me concerning the chastisements and
   concerning things in heaven and on the earth and under the earth.  And
   as she said the word the archangel Michael descended with the angels of
   the East and the West and angels of the South and the North, and they
   saluted the highly favoured one and said to her:  Hail, reflection of
   the Father, hail dwelling of the Son, hail command of the Holy Spirit,
   hail firmament of the seven heavens, hail firmament of the eleven
   strongholds, hail worship of the angels, hail loftier than the prophets
   unto the throne of God.  And the holy mother of God said to the angel:
   Hail Michael, commander-in-chief, the minister of the invisible Father,
   hail Michael, commander-in-chief, associate of my Son, hail Michael,
   commander-in-chief, most dread of the six-winged, hail Michael,
   commander-in-chief, who rules through all things and art worthy to
   stand beside the throne of the Lord, hail Michael, commander-in-chief,
   who art about to sound the trumpet and awaken those who have been
   asleep for ages:  hail Michael, commander-in-chief, first of all unto
   the throne of God.

   II.  And having greeted all the angels in like manner, the highly
   favoured one prayed the commander-in-chief regarding the chastisements,
   saying:  Tell to me all things on the earth.  And the
   commander-in-chief said to her:  If thou askest me, highly favoured
   one, I will tell thee.  And the highly favoured one said to him:  How
   many are the chastisements with which the race of man is chastised?
   And the archangel said to her:  The chastisements are innumerable.  And
   the highly favoured one said to him:  Tell me the things in heaven and
   on the earth.

   III.  Then the commander-in-chief, Michael, commanded the Western
   angels that revelation should be made, and Hades opened, and she saw
   those who were chastised [3953] in Hades:  and there lay there a
   multitude of men and women, and there was a great lamentation.  And the
   highly favoured one asked the commander-in-chief:  Who are these and
   what is their sin?  And the commander-in-chief said:  These, all holy,
   are those who did not worship the Father and the Son and the Holy
   Spirit and for this cause they are thus chastised here.

   IV.  And she saw in another place [3954] a great darkness:  and the all
   holy said:  What is this darkness and who are they who are being
   chastised?  And the commander-in-chief said:  Many souls are lying in
   this darkness.  And the all holy one said:  Let this darkness be taken
   away in order that I may see this chastisement also.  And the
   commander-in-chief said to the highly favoured one:  It is not
   possible, all holy, that thou shouldst see this chastisement also.  And
   the angels guarding them answered and said:  We have a command from the
   invisible Father that they shall not see the light till thy blessed Son
   shall shine forth.  And plunged in grief the all holy lifted up her
   eyes to the angels touching the undefiled word of the Father, and
   said:  In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit let
   the darkness be taken away, that I may see this chastisement also.  And
   straightway that darkness was lifted up and covered the seven heavens:
   and there lay a great multitude of both men and women, and there arose
   a great lamentation and a great cry began.  And seeing them the all
   holy wept and said to them:  What are ye doing, wretched ones?  Who are
   ye?  And how are ye found there? and there was no voice or hearkening.
   And the angels guarding them said:  Why do ye not speak to the highly
   favoured one?  And those who were under chastisement said to her:  O
   highly favoured one, from eternity we see not the light, and we are not
   able to keep off that up there.  And splashing pitch flowed down upon
   them:  and seeing them the all holy wept.  And again those who were
   being chastised said to her:  How dost thou ask concerning us, holy
   lady, Mother of God?  Thy blessed Son came to The earth and did not
   make enquiry concerning us, neither Abraham the patriarch, nor John the
   Baptist, nor Moses the great prophet, nor the Apostle Paul, and unto us
   their light shone not:  and now, all holy Mother of God, the armour of
   the Christians, the bringer of great comfort on account of the
   Christians, how dost thou ask concerning us?  Then the all holy Mother
   of God said to Michael, the commander-in-chief:  What is their sin?
   And Michael, the commander-in-chief, said:  These are they who did not
   believe in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and did not
   confess thee [3955] to be the Mother of God, and that the Lord Jesus
   Christ was born of thee and took flesh, and for this cause they are
   chastised there.  And again weeping, the all holy Mother of God said to
   them:  Why did ye so greatly err, wretched ones?  Did ye not hear that
   the whole creation names my name?  And having said these words the
   darkness fell over them as it was from the beginning.

   V.   And the commander-in-chief said:  Whither wouldst thou go, highly
   favoured one? to the West or to the South?  And the highly favoured
   answered:  Let us go to the South.  And immediately there appeared the
   cherubim and the seraphim and four hundred angels, and led out the
   highly favoured one to the South, where came out the river of fire,
   [3956] and there there lay a multitude of men and women, some up to the
   girdle, others up to the neck, and others up to the crown of the head:
   and seeing them the all holy Mother of God cried out with a loud voice
   to the commander-in-chief and said:  Who are these, and what is their
   sin who stand in the fire up to the girdle?  And the commander-in-chief
   said:  These, all holy one, are they who inherited the curse of father
   and mother, and for this cause they are thus chastised here as
   accursed.

   VI.  And the all holy one said:  And who are these standing in the fire
   up to the breasts?  And the commander-in-chief said:  These are
   whosoever cast off their wives and defiled them in adultery, and for
   this cause they are thus chastised here.

   VII.  And the all holy one said to the commander-in-chief:  Who are
   these standing up to the neck in the flame of the fire?  And the
   commander-in-chief said:  These, all holy one, are whosoever ate of the
   flesh of men.  And the all holy one said:  And how is it possible for
   one man to eat of the flesh of another?  And the commander-in-chief
   said:  Listen, all holy one, and I will tell thee:  These are they
   whosoever brought down their own children out of their own wombs and
   cast them out [3957] as food for dogs, and whosoever gave up their
   brothers in the presence of kings and governors, these ate the flesh of
   man, and for this cause they are thus chastised.

   VIII.  And the all holy one said:  Who are these set in the fire up to
   the crown?  And the commander-in-chief said:  These, all holy one, are
   whosoever lay hold of the precious cross and swear to a lie:  by the
   power of the cross of the Lord.  The angels tremble and worship with
   fear, and men lay hold of it and swear to a lie and do not know what
   they testify:  and for this cause they are thus chastised here.

   IX.  And in another place the all holy one saw a man hung by the feet,
   [3958] and worms devoured him.  And she asked the commander-in-chief:
   Who is this and what is his sin?  And the commander-in-chief said:
   This is he who took usury [3959] for his gold, and for this cause he is
   thus chastised here.

   X.  And she saw a woman hanging by her two ears, and all the beasts
   [3960] came out of her mouth and gnawed her in pieces:  and the highly
   favoured one asked the commander-in-chief:  Who is she, and what is her
   sin?  And the commander-in-chief said:  She is she who turned aside
   into strange houses and those of her neighbours and spoke evil words to
   make strife, and for that cause she is thus chastised here.

   XI.  And seeing these things the all holy Mother of God wept and said
   to the commander-in-chief:  It were well for man that he had not been
   born.  And the commander-in-chief said:  Verily, all holy one, thou
   hast not seen the great chastisements.  And the all holy one said to
   the commander-in-chief:  Come, Michael, great commander-in-chief, and
   lead me that I may see all the chastisements.  And the
   commander-in-chief said:  Where dost thou wish, all holy one, that we
   should go?  And the highly favoured one answered:  To the West:  and
   straightway the cherubim appeared and led the highly favoured to the
   West.

   XII.  And she saw a cloud full of fire and in it there was a [3961]
   multitude of men and women.  And the all holy one said:  What was their
   sin?  And the commander-in-chief said:  These, all holy one, are they
   who on the morning of the Lord's day sleep like the dead, and for that
   reason they are thus chastised here.  And the all holy one said:  If
   anyone cannot rise, what shall he do?  And the commander-in-chief
   said:  Listen, all holy one:  if anyone's house is fastened on the four
   (sides?) and surrounds him and he cannot come out, he has forgiveness.

   XIII.  And she saw in another place burning benches of fire and on them
   sat a multitude of men and women and burned on them.  And the all holy
   one asked:  Who are these and what is their sin?  And the
   commander-in-chief said:  These, all holy one, are they who do not rise
   up to the presbyter when they enter into the church of God, and for
   this cause they are thus chastised here.

   XIV.  And the all holy one saw in another place an iron tree and it had
   branches of iron, and on it there hung a multitude of men and women by
   their tongues. [3962]   And seeing them the all holy one wept, and
   asked the commander-in-chief saying:  Who are these and what was their
   sin?  And the commander-in-chief said:  These are perjurers,
   blasphemers, slanderers, whosoever divided brothers from brothers.  And
   the all holy one said:  How is it possible to divide brothers from
   brothers?  And the commander-in-chief said:  Listen, all holy one, and
   I will tell thee about this:  When some from among the nations desired
   to be baptised, he would say to them one word:  Thou foul-feeding,
   unbelieving Gentile; because he thus blasphemed, he shall receive
   ceaseless retribution.

   XV.  And in another place the all holy one saw a man hanging from his
   four extremities, and from his nails blood gushed vehemently, and his
   tongue [3963] was tied in a flame of fire, and he was unable to groan
   and say the Kyrie eleïson me.  And when she had seen him the all holy
   one wept and herself said the Kyrie eleïson thrice:  and after the
   saying of the prayer, came the angel who had authority over the scourge
   and loosed the man's tongue:  and the all holy one asked the
   commander-in-chief:  Who is this wretched one who has this
   chastisement?  And the commander-in-chief said:  This, all holy one, is
   the steward who did not the will of God, but ate the things of the
   church and said:  "He who ministers to the altar shall be nourished
   from the altar": [3964]   and for this cause he is thus chastised
   here.  And the all holy one said:  Let it be unto him according to his
   faith.  And again he tied his tongue.

   XVI.  And Michael, the commander-in-chief said:  Come hither, all holy
   one, and I will show unto thee where the priests are chastised.  And
   the all holy one came out and saw presbyters hanging by their twenty
   nails, and fire came out of their heads.  And seeing them the all holy
   one asked the commander-in-chief:  Who are these and what is their
   sin?  And the commander-in-chief said:  These, all holy one, are they
   who stand beside the throne of God, and when they sang of the body of
   our Lord Jesus Christ, the pearls fell out, and the awful throne of
   heaven shook and the footstool of our Lord Jesus Christ trembled, and
   they did not perceive it:  and for this cause they are thus chastised
   here.

   XVII.  And the all holy one saw a man and a winged beast having three
   heads like flames of fire:  the two heads were towards his eyes and the
   third head towards his mouth.  And seeing him the all holy one asked
   the commander-in-chief:  Who is this, that he cannot save himself from
   the mouth of the dragon?  And the commander-in-chief said to her:
   This, all holy one, is the reader who does not practise in his own
   habits according to what is worthy of the holy Gospel:  and for this
   cause he is thus chastised here.

   XVIII.  And the commander-in-chief said:  Come hither, all holy one,
   and I will show thee where the angelic and archangelic form is
   chastised.  She proceeded and saw [3965] them lying in the fire and the
   sleepless worm gnawed them:  and the all holy one said:  Who are these,
   and what is their sin?  And the commander-in-chief said:  These, all
   holy one, are they who possessed the archangelic and apostolic form:
   hearken, all holy one, concerning this:  on earth they were called
   patriarchs and bishops, and they were not worthy of their name:  on
   earth they heard Bless (the Lord) ye saints,' and in heaven they were
   not called saints, because they did not act as bearers of the
   archangelic form:  and for this cause they are thus chastised here.

   XIX.  And she saw women hanging by their nails, and a flame of fire
   came out of their mouth and burned them:  and all the beasts [3966]
   coming out of the fire gnawed them to pieces, and groaning they cried
   out:  Have pity on us, have pity, for we are chastised worse than all
   those who are under chastisement.  And seeing them the all holy one
   wept, and asked the commander-in-chief, Michael:  Who are these and
   what is their sin?  And the commander-in-chief said:  These are the
   wives of presbyters who did not honour the presbyters, but after the
   death of the presbyter took husbands, and for this cause they are thus
   chastised here.

   XX.  And the all holy one saw after the same manner also a deaconess
   hanging from a crag and a beast with two heads devoured her breasts.
   And the all holy one asked:  What is her sin?  And the
   commander-in-chief said:  She, all holy one, is an archdeaconess who
   defiled her body in fornication, and for this cause she is thus
   chastised here.

   XXI.  And she saw other women hanging over the fire, and all the beasts
   devoured them.  And the all holy one asked the commander-in-chief:  Who
   are these and what is their sin?  And he said:  These are they who did
   not do the will of God, lovers of money and those who took interest
   [3967] on accounts, and the immodest.

   XXII.  And when she had heard these things the all holy one wept and
   said:  Woe unto sinners.  And the commander-in-chief said:  Why dost
   thou lament, all holy one?  Now verily thou hast not seen the great
   chastisements.  And the highly favoured one said:  Come, Michael, the
   great commander-in-chief of the powers above, tell me how I may see all
   the chastisements.  And the commander-in-chief said:  Where dost thou
   wish that we should go, all holy one? to the East or towards the left
   parts of Paradise?  And the all holy one said:  To the left parts of
   Paradise.

   XXIII.  And immediately when she had spoken, the cherubim and seraphim
   stood beside her and led the highly favoured one out to the left parts
   of Paradise.  And behold, there was a great river, and the appearance
   of the river was blacker than pitch, and in it there were a multitude
   [3968] of men and women:  it boiled like a furnace of forges, and its
   waves were like a wild sea over the sinners:  and when the waves rose,
   they sank the sinners ten thousand cubits and they were unable to keep
   it off and say:  Have mercy on us, thou just judge:  for the sleepless
   worm devoured them, and there was no reckoning of the number of those
   who devoured them.  And seeing the all holy Mother of God the angels
   [3969] who chastised them cried out with one voice:  Holy is God who
   has compassion on account of the Mother of God:  we give thee thanks, O
   Son of God, that from eternity we did not see the light, and to-day
   through the Mother of God we have seen the light:  and again they
   shouted with one voice, saying:  Hail, highly favoured Mother of God:
   Hail, lamp of the inaccessible light:  Hail to thee also, Michael, the
   commander-in-chief, thou that art ambassador from the whole creation:
   for we, seeing the chastisement of sinners are greatly grieved.  And
   the all holy one, when she saw the angels humbled on account of the
   sinners, lamented and said:  Woe to sinners and their neighbours.  And
   the all holy one said:  Let us see the sinners.  And the highly
   favoured one, coming with the archangel Michael and all the armies of
   the angels lifted up one voice saying:  Lord have mercy.  And after the
   making of the prayer earnestly, the wave of the river rested and the
   fiery waves grew calm, and the sinners appeared as a grain of
   mustard-seed:  and seeing them the all holy one lamented and said:
   What is this river, and what are its waves?  And the commander-in-chief
   said:  This river is the outer fire, and those who are being tortured
   are the Jews who crucified our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, and
   who refused holy baptism, and those who commit fornication and sin
   against the sweet and passionless perfume of marriage, and he who
   debauches mother and daughter, and the poisoners and those who slay
   with the sword, and the women who strangle their offspring.  And the
   all holy one said:  According to their faith so be it unto them.  And
   straightway the waves rose over the sinners and the darkness covered
   them.  And the commander-in-chief said:  Hearken, thou highly favoured
   one:  if anyone shall be cast into this darkness, [3970] his
   remembrance shall never be in the sight of God.  And the all holy
   Mother of God said:  Woe to sinners, because the flame of the fire is
   everlasting.

   XXIV.  And the commander-in-chief said:  Come hither, all holy one, and
   I will show unto thee the lake of fire:  and see thou where the race of
   the Christians is chastised. [3971]   And the all holy one proceeded
   and saw:  and some she heard, but others she did not see:  and she
   asked the commander-in-chief:  Who are these, and what is their sin?
   And the commander-in-chief said:  These, all holy one, are those who
   were baptised and arrayed under the oracle of Christ, but worked the
   works of the devil and wasted the time of their repentance:  and for
   this cause they are thus chastised here.

   XXV.  And she said:  I pray, one request will I make of thee, let me
   also be chastised with the Christians, because they are the children of
   my son.  And the commander-in-chief said:  Rest thou in Paradise, holy
   lady, Mother of God.  And the all holy one said:  I pray thee, move the
   fourteen firmaments and the seven heavens, and let us pray for the
   Christians that the Lord our God may hearken unto us and have mercy on
   them. [3972]   And the commander-in-chief said:  As the Lord God
   liveth, the great name, seven times a day and seven times a night, when
   we lead up the hymn of the Lord, we make remembrance for the sake of
   sinners, and the Lord accounts us as naught.

   XXVI.  And the all holy one said:  I pray thee, commander-in-chief,
   command the armies of the angels and let them place me on the height of
   heaven and let me into the presence of the invisible Father.  And
   immediately the commander-in-chief commanded, and the chariot of the
   cherubim and seraphim appeared, and they exalted the highly favoured
   one to the height of heaven and placed her in the presence of the
   invisible Father:  And she stretched forth her hands to the undefiled
   throne of the Father and said:  Have mercy, O Lord, on the Christian
   sinners, for I saw them being chastised and I cannot bear their
   complaint.  Let me go forth and be chastised myself for the
   Christians.  I do not pray, O Lord, for the unbelieving Jews, but for
   the Christians I entreat thy compassion.  And there came a second voice
   from the invisible Father saying:  How can I have mercy on them, when
   they did not have mercy on their own brothers? [3973]   And the all
   holy one said:  Lord, have mercy on the sinners:  behold the
   chastisements, for every creature on the earth calls upon my name:  and
   when the soul comes forth out of the body, it cries saying, "Holy Lady,
   Mother of God."  Then the Lord said to her:  Hearken, all holy Mother
   of God, if anyone names and calls upon thy name, I will not forsake
   him, either in heaven or on earth.

   XXVII.  And the all holy one said:  Where is Moses?  Where are all the
   prophets and fathers who never sinned?  Where art thou, holy Paul of
   God? where is the holy Lord's Day, the boast of the Christians? where
   is the power of the precious and life-giving cross, which delivered
   Adam and Eve from the ancient curse?  Then Michael and all the angels
   raised one voice saying:  Lord, have mercy on the sinners.  Then Moses
   also cried:  Have mercy, Lord, on those to whom I gave thy law.  Then
   John also called:  Have mercy, Lord, on those to whom I gave thy
   Gospel.  Then Paul cried:  Have mercy, Lord, on those to whom I brought
   thy epistles in the Church.  And the Lord God said:  Hearken, all ye
   righteous:  if according to the law which Moses gave, and according to
   the Gospel which John gave, and according to the epistles which Paul
   carried, they thus be judged.  And they had nothing to say except, Have
   mercy, O just judge.

   XXVIII.  And the all holy Mother of God said:  Have mercy, Lord, on the
   Christians, because they kept thy law and gave heed to thy gospel, but
   they were simple ones.  Then the Lord said to her:  Hearken, all holy
   one:  if anyone did evil to them and they did not requite him the evil,
   thou sayest well that they attended to both my law and my gospel, but
   if he did not do them wrong and they requited him evil, how may I say
   that these are holy men? now they shall be rewarded according to their
   wrongdoing.  Then all hearing the voice of the Lord had nothing to
   answer; and the all holy one, when she saw that the saints were at a
   loss, and their Lord did not hear, and his mercy was hidden from them,
   then the all holy one said:  Where is Gabriel, who announced unto me
   the "Hail, thou that from eternity shalt conceive him who is without
   beginning like the Father," and now does not look upon sinners?  Where
   is the great commander-in-chief? come hither, all ye saints whom God
   justified, and let us fall down in the presence of the invisible
   Father, in order that the Lord God may hear us, and have mercy on
   sinners.  Then Michael, the commander-in-chief, and all the saints fell
   on their faces in the presence of the invisible Father, saying:  Have
   mercy, Lord, on the Christian sinners.

   XXIX.  Then the Lord, seeing the prayer of the saints, had compassion
   and said:  Go down, my beloved son, and because of the prayer of the
   saints let thy face shine on earth to sinners.  Then the Lord came down
   from his undefiled throne:  and when they saw Him, those who were under
   chastisement raised one voice saying:  Have mercy on us, King of ages.
   Then the Lord of all things said:  Hearken, all ye sinners and
   righteous men:  I made paradise and made man after my image:  but he
   transgressed, and for his own sins was delivered to death:  but I did
   not suffer the works of my hands to be tyrannized over by the serpent:
   wherefore I bowed the heavens and came down and was born of Mary, the
   holy undefiled Mother of God, that I might set you free:  I was
   baptised in Jordan in order that I might save the creature (nature)
   which had grown old under sin:  I was nailed to the cross [3974] to
   free you from the ancient curse:  I asked for water and ye gave me
   vinegar mingled with gall:  I was laid in the grave:  I trampled on the
   enemy:  I raised up mine elect, and even thus ye would not hear me.
   But now, because [3975] of the prayer of my mother Mary, because she
   has wept much for your sake, and because of Michael my archangel, and
   because of the multitude of my saints, I grant you to have rest on the
   day of Pentecost to glorify the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

   XXX.  Then all the angels and archangels, thrones, lordships,
   authorities, governments, powers, and the many-eyed cherubim and the
   six-winged seraphim and all the apostles and prophets and martyrs and
   all the saints raised one voice, saying:  Glory to thee, O Lord:  glory
   to thee, lover of men:  glory to thee, King of ages:  glory be to thy
   compassion:  glory be to thy long suffering:  glory be to thy
   unspeakable justice of judgment, because thou hast been long-suffering
   with sinners and impious men:  Thine is it to pity and to save.  To him
   be the glory and the power to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy
   Spirit for ever and ever.  Amen.

   The Apocalypse of Sedrach.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The translation is from Mr. M. R. James's text in Texts and Studies,
   ii. 3, p. 130ff., published from a fifteenth century ms. in the
   Bodleian Library.  The original, Mr. James conjecturally assigns to the
   tenth or eleventh century.  It is notable for its close resemblance in
   several passages to 4 Esdras, to the Greek original of which the author
   seems to have had direct access.

   Like the Apocalypse of Esdras it deals with the subject of intercession
   for sinners and the reluctance of the seer to die.  The parallel
   passages in 4 Esdras and the Apocalypse of Esdras are pointed out in
   the margin of the translation.

   Chapter I. consists of a few lines from the beginning and end of a
   homily on love which appears in the ms. at the beginning of the
   Apocalypse, but which Mr. James regards as "quite unimportant and quite
   irrelevant."

   The Apocalypse of Sedrach.

   ------------------------

   The Word of the holy and blessed Sedrach concerning love and concerning
   repentance and Orthodox Christians, and concerning the Second Coming of
   our Lord Jesus Christ.  Lord give thy blessing.

   I.  Beloved, let us prefer nothing in honour except sincere love:  for
   in many things we stumble every day and night and hour.  And for this
   cause let us gain love, for it covereth a multitude of sins:  for what
   is the profit, my children, if we have all things, and have not saving
   love...

   O blessed love, supplier of all good things.  Blessed is the man who
   has gained the true faith and sincere love, according as the Master
   said, there is no greater love than this that a man should lay down his
   life for his friend.  Cf. John xv. 13.

   II.  And invisibly he received a voice in his ears:  Come hither,
   Sedrach, since thou wishest and desirest to converse with God and ask
   of him that he may reveal unto thee whatever thou wishest to ask.  And
   Sedrach said:  What, Sir?  And the voice said to him:  I was sent to
   thee to raise thee here into heaven.  And he said:  I desired to speak
   mouth to mouth with God:  I am not fit, Sir, to come into heaven.  And
   stretching out his wings he took him up and he came into heaven to the
   very flame, and he set him as high as the third heaven, and in it stood
   the flame of the divinity.

   III.  And the Lord saith to him:  Welcome, my beloved Sedrach:  What
   suit hast thou against God who created thee, that thou saidst, I
   desired to speak face to face with God?  Sedrach saith to him: [3976]
   Yea, verily, the son hath a suit with the Father:  my Lord, why didst
   thou make the earth?  The Lord saith to him:  For man's sake.  Sedrach
   saith:  And why didst Thou make the sea?  Why didst Thou scatter every
   good thing on the earth?  The Lord saith to him:  For man's sake.
   Sedrach saith to him: [3977]   If thou didst these things, [3978] why
   wilt Thou destroy him?  And the Lord said:  Man is my work and the
   creature of my hands, and I discipline him as I find good.

   IV.  Sedrach saith to him:  Chastisement and fire are thy discipline:
   they are bitter, my Lord: [3979]   it were well for man if he had not
   been born:  why then didst thou make him, my Lord?  Why didst thou
   weary thine undefiled hands [3980] and create man, since thou didst not
   intend to have mercy on him?  God saith to him:  I made Adam the first
   creature and placed him in Paradise in the midst of the tree of life
   and said to him:  Eat of all the fruits, but beware of the tree of
   life:  for if thou eat of it, thou shalt die the death.  But he
   transgressed my commandment, and being beguiled by the devil ate of the
   tree.

   V.  Sedrach saith to him:  Of thy will Adam was beguiled, my Lord:
   Thou commandest thine [3981] angels to make approach to Adam, and the
   first of the angels himself transgressed thy commandment and did not
   make approach to him, and Thou didst banish him, because he
   transgressed thy commandment and did not make any approach to the work
   of thine hands:  if thou lovedst man, why didst Thou not slay the
   devil, the worker of unrighteousness?  Who is able to fight an
   invisible spirit?  And he as a smoke enters into the hearts of men and
   teaches them every sin:  he fights against thee, the immortal God, and
   what can wretched man then do to him?  But have mercy, O Lord, and stop
   the chastisements:  but if not, count me also with the sinners:  if
   thou wilt have no mercy on the sinners, where are thy mercies, where is
   thy [3982] compassion, O Lord?

   VI.  God saith to him:  Be it known unto thee that I ordered all things
   to be placable to him:  I gave him understanding and made him the heir
   of heaven and earth, and I subjected all things to him, and every
   living thing flees from him and from before his face:  but he, having
   received of mine, became alien, adulterous, and sinful:  tell me, what
   father, having given his son his portion, when he takes his substance
   and leaves his father and goes away and becomes an alien and serves an
   alien, when the father sees that the son has deserted him, does not
   darken his heart, and does not the father go and take his substance and
   banish him from his glory because he deserted his father?  And how have
   I, the wonderful and jealous God, given him everything, and he having
   received these things has become an adulterer and a sinner?

   VII.  Sedrach saith to him:  Thou, O Lord, didst create man.  Thou
   knewest of what sort of mind he was and of what sort of knowledge we
   are, and thou makest it a cause for chastisement:  but cast him forth;
   for shall not I alone fill up the heavenly places?  But if that is not
   to be so save man too, O Lord.  He failed by thy will, wretched man.
   Why dost thou waste words on me, Sedrach?  I created Adam and his wife
   and the sun and said:  Behold each other how bright he is, and the wife
   of Adam is brighter in the beauty of the moon and he was the giver of
   her life. [3983]   Sedrach saith:  but of what profit are beauties if
   they die away into the earth?  How didst thou say, O Lord, Thou shalt
   not return evil for evil?  How is it, O Lord? the word of Thy divinity
   never lies, and why dost Thou retaliate on man? or dost thou not in so
   doing render evil for evil?  I know that among the quadrupeds there is
   no other so wily and unreasonable as the mule.  But we strike it with
   the bridle when we wish:  and thou hast angels:  send them forth to
   guard them, and when man inclines towards sin, to take hold of his foot
   and not let him go whither he would.

   VIII.  God saith to him:  If I catch him by the foot, he will say, Thou
   hast given me no joy in the world.  But I have left him to his own will
   because I loved him.  Wherefore I sent forth my righteous angels to
   guard him night and day.  Sedrach saith: [3984]   I know, O Lord, that
   of all thy creatures Thou chiefly lovedst man, of the quadrupeds the
   sheep, of woods the olive, of fruits the vine, of flying things the
   bee, of rivers the Jordan, of cities Jerusalem.  And all these man also
   loves, my Lord.  God saith to Sedrach:  I will ask thee one thing,
   Sedrach:  if thou answerest me, then I may fitly help thee, even though
   thou hast tempted thy creator.  Sedrach saith:  Speak. [3985]   The
   Lord God saith:  Since I made all things, how many men were born and
   how many died, and how many are to die and how many hairs have they?
   Tell me, Sedrach, [3986] since the heaven was created and the earth,
   how many trees grew in the world, and how many fell, and how many are
   to fall, and how many are to arise, and how many leaves have they?
   Tell me, Sedrach, since I made the sea, how many waves arose and how
   many fell, and how many are to arise, and how many winds blow along the
   margin of the sea?  Tell me, Sedrach, from the creation of the world of
   the æons, when the air rained, how many drops fell upon the world, and
   how many are to fall?  And Sedrach said:  Thou alone knowest all these
   things, O Lord; thou only understandest all these things:  only, I pray
   thee, deliver man from chastisement, and I shall not be separated from
   our race.

   IX.  And God said to his only begotten Son:  Go, [3987] take the soul
   of Sedrach my beloved, and place it in Paradise.  The only begotten Son
   saith to Sedrach:  Give me the trust which our Father deposited in the
   womb of thy mother in the holy tabernacle of thy body from a child.
   Sedrach saith:  I will not give thee my soul.  God saith to him:  And
   wherefore was I sent to come hither, and thou pleadest against me?  For
   I was commanded by my Father not to take thy soul with violence; but if
   not, (then) give me thy most greatly desired soul.

   X.  And Sedrach saith to God:  And whence dost Thou intend to take my
   soul, and from which limb?  And God saith to him:  Dost thou not know
   that it is placed in the midst of thy lungs and thy heart and is
   dispersed into all thy limbs?  It is brought up through the throat and
   gullet and the mouth and at whatever hour it is predestined to come
   forth, it is scattered, and brought together from the points of the
   nails and from all the limbs, and there is a great necessity that it
   should be separated from the body and parted from the heart.  When
   Sedrach had heard all these things and had considered the memory of
   death he was greatly astounded, and Sedrach said to God:  O Lord, give
   me a little respite that I may weep, for I have heard that tears are
   able to do much and much remedy comes to the lowly body of thy
   creature.

   XI.  And weeping and bewailing he began to say:  O marvellous head of
   heavenly adornment:  O radiant as the sun which shines on heaven and
   earth:  thy hairs are known from Teman, thine eyes from Bosor, thine
   ears from thunder, thy tongue from a trumpet, and thy brain is a small
   creation, thy head the energy of the whole body:  O friendly and most
   fair beloved by all, and now falling into the earth it must become
   forgotten.  O hands, mild, fair-fingered, worn with toil by which the
   body is nourished:  O hands, deftest of all, heaping up from all
   quarters ye made ready houses.  O fingers adorned and decked with gold
   and silver (rings):  and great worlds are led by the fingers:  the
   three joints enfold the palms, and heap up beautiful things:  and now
   ye must become aliens to the world.  O feet, skilfully walking about,
   self-running, most swift, unconquerable:  O knees, fitted together,
   because without you the body does not move:  the feet run along with
   the sun and the moon in the night and in the day, heaping up all
   things, foods and drinks, and nourishing the body:  O feet, most swift
   and fair runners, moving on the face of the earth, getting ready the
   house with every good thing:  O feet which bear up the whole body, that
   run up to the temples, making repentance and calling on the saints, and
   now ye are to remain motionless.  O head and hands and feet, until now
   I have kept you.  O soul, what sent thee into the humble and wretched
   body? and now being separated from it, thou art going up where the Lord
   calleth thee, and the wretched body goes away to judgment.  O body
   well-adorned, hair clothed with stars, head of heavenly adornment and
   dress:  O face well-anointed, light-bringing eyes, voice trumpet-like,
   tongue placable, chin fairly adorned, hairs like the stars, head high
   as heaven, body decked out, light-bringing eyes that know all
   things--and now you shall fall into the earth and under the earth your
   beauty shall disappear.

   XII.  Christ saith to him:  Stay, Sedrach; how long dost thou weep and
   groan?  Paradise is opened to thee, and, dying, thou shalt live.
   Sedrach saith to him:  Once more I will speak unto thee, O Lord:  How
   long shall I live before I die? and do not disregard my prayer.  The
   Lord saith to him:  Speak, O Sedrach.  Sedrach saith:  If a man shall
   live eighty or ninety or an hundred years, and live these years in sin,
   and again shall turn, and the man live in repentance, in how many days
   dost thou forgive him his sins?  God saith to him:  If he shall live an
   hundred or eighty years and shall turn and repent for three years and
   do the fruit of righteousness, and death shall overtake him, I will not
   remember all his sins.

   XIII.  Sedrach saith to him:  The three years are a long time, my Lord,
   lest death overtake him and he fulfil not his repentance:  have mercy,
   Lord, on thine image and have compassion, for the three years are
   many.  God saith to him:  If a man live an hundred years and remember
   his death and confess before men and I find him, after a time I will
   forgive all his sins.  Sedrach saith again:  I will again beseech thy
   compassion for thy creature.  The time is long lest death overtake him
   and snatch him suddenly.  The Saviour saith to him:  I will ask thee
   one word, Sedrach, my beloved, then thou shalt ask me in turn:  if the
   man shall repent for forty days I will not remember all his sins which
   he did.

   XIV.  And Sedrach saith [3988] to the archangel Michael:  Hearken to
   me, O powerful chief, and help thou me and be my envoy that God may
   have mercy on the world.  And falling on their faces, they besought the
   Lord and said:  O Lord, teach us how and by what sort of repentance and
   by what labour man shall be saved.  God saith:  By repentances, by
   intercessions, by liturgies, by tears in streams, in hot groanings.
   Dost thou not know that my prophet David was saved by tears, and the
   rest were saved in one moment?  Thou knowest, Sedrach, that there are
   nations which have not the law and which do the works of the law:  for
   if they are unbaptized and my divine spirit come unto them and they
   turn to my baptism, I also receive them with my righteous ones into
   Abraham's bosom.  And there are some who have been baptized with my
   baptism and who have shared in my divine part and become reprobate in
   complete reprobation and will not repent:  and I suffer them with much
   compassion and much pity and wealth [3989] in order that they may
   repent, but they do the things which my divinity hates, and did not
   hearken to the wise man asking (them), saying, we by no means justify a
   sinner.  Dost thou not most certainly know that it is written:  And
   those who repent never see chastisement?  And they did not hearken to
   the Apostles or to my word in the Gospels, and they grieve my angels,
   and verily they do not attend to my messenger in the assemblies (for
   communion) and in my services, and they do not stand in my holy
   churches, but they stand and do not fall down and worship in fear and
   trembling, but boast things which I do not accept, or my holy angels.

   XV.  Sedrach saith to God:  O Lord, Thou alone art sinless and very
   compassionate, having compassion and pity for sinners, but thy divinity
   said:  I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
   And the Lord said to Sedrach:  Dost thou not know, Sedrach, that the
   thief was saved in one moment to repent?  Dost thou not know that my
   apostle and evangelist was saved in one moment?  "Peccatores enim non
   salvantur," for their hearts are like rotten stone:  these are they who
   walk in impious ways and who shall be destroyed with Antichrist.
   Sedrach saith:  O my Lord, Thou also saidst:  My divine spirit entered
   into the nations which, not having the law, do the things of the law.
   So also the thief and the apostle and evangelist and the rest of those
   who have already got into thy Kingdom.  O my Lord; so likewise do Thou
   pardon those who have sinned to the last:  for life is very toilsome
   and there is no time for repentance.

   XVI.  The Lord saith to Sedrach:  I made man in three stages:  when he
   is young, I overlooked his stumblings as he was young:  and again when
   he was a man I considered his purpose:  and again when he grows old, I
   watch him till he repent.  Sedrach saith:  O Lord, Thou knowest and
   understandest all these things:  but have sympathy for sinners.  The
   Lord saith to him:  Sedrach, my beloved, I promise to have sympathy and
   bring down the forty days to twenty:  and whosoever shall remember thy
   name shall not see the place of chastisement, but shall be with the
   just in a place of refreshment and rest:  and if anyone shall record
   this wonderful word his sins shall not be reckoned against him for ever
   and ever. [3990]   And Sedrach saith:  O Lord, and if anyone shall
   bring enlightenment to thy servant, save him, O Lord, from all evil.
   And Sedrach, the servant of the Lord, saith:  Now take my soul, O
   Lord.  And God took him and placed him in Paradise with all the
   saints.  To whom be the glory and the power for ever and ever.  Amen.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The Greek text of both the recensions of this work is published for the
   first time in "Texts and Studies," Vol. II., No. 2 (Cambridge, 1892),
   by Montague Rhodes James, M.A.  None of the manuscripts are older than
   the thirteenth century; of the six which contain the longer version the
   best is a Paris ms. written 1315, and the principal ms. of the shorter
   recension (also in Paris) belongs to the fifteenth century.  There are
   also versions in Roumanian, Slavonic, Ethiopic, and Arabic.

   The work itself has hitherto been little noticed, and it is doubtful
   how far it was well known in ancient times.  It is perhaps that cited
   as "Abraham" in early lists of Apocryphal works, and some passages in
   early Christian writers may indicate their knowledge of such a work.
   The evidence for this is given in full by the editor of the Greek text
   in his introduction (pp. 7-29).  The conclusions drawn by him from
   these notices, and from the work itself, are "that it was written in
   the second century, that it embodies legends earlier than that century,
   that it received its present form perhaps in the ninth or tenth
   century."  Certain features in it also "seem to point to Egypt as its
   birthplace," such as the conception of Death in the longer recension,
   which has parallels in the Coptic Apocryphal books, the weighing of
   souls, and the presence of recording angels at the judgment scene.

   Neither of the two versions can be supposed to be true copies of the
   original work.  They differ from each other not only in length, but in
   arrangement.  The shorter recension may preserve more of the original
   language, but it transposes certain sections, thereby confusing the
   order of the narrative, and in this the Arabic version generally agrees
   with it.  The most essential discrepancy begins with Chap. X. of the
   longer recension, where Abraham, after being taken up on the cloud, is
   first shown the iniquities that take place on earth.  The shorter text
   places this at the end of his journey, quite destroying the original
   moral of the writer, who wishes to emphasize the mercy of God, and to
   show how Abraham's righteous indignation is replaced by feelings of
   compassion for the sinner.  The vision of judgment is then altered in
   the shorter version, the doubtful soul being there condemned, instead
   of being saved by the intercession of Abraham.  In this point the
   editor thinks that the shorter recension may have been influenced by
   the Apocalypse of Paul, as would also seem to be the case with
   Michael's reason for leaving Abraham in Chap. IV, which is quite
   different from the pretext given in the longer text.  It is also
   remarkable that in the shorter form there is no word. of Abraham's
   unwillingness to die, which is so prominent a feature of the other, and
   is no doubt original, as the idea is not otherwise unknown in
   Apocryphal literature.  The conclusion of the shorter version is very
   much curtailed, compared with the longer one.

   On account of these many differences between the recensions of this
   remarkable work, it has been judged best to give both of them entire,
   and so arranged that the reader can readily discover in what respects
   the one differs from the other.

   The tone of the work is perhaps rather Jewish than Christian, but as
   phrases and conceptions of a New Testament character appear in it,
   especially in the judgment scene, it is most probably to be assigned to
   a Jewish Christian, who for the substance of it drew partly on older
   legends, and partly on his own imagination.  Some of its features are
   very striking, and a few of them do not seem to occur elsewhere in
   literature of this class; it is possible that some of these do not go
   further back than the medieval editors of the text.  Among the most
   remarkable points may be noticed the age of Abraham, variously given in
   different mss., his hospitality, and the sending of Michael to announce
   his death (Chap. I.): Michael's refusal to mount a horse (Chap. II.):
   the tree speaking with a human voice (Chap. III.); the tears of Michael
   turning into precious stones (ibid.); and the devouring spirit sent to
   consume the food for him (Chap. IV.).  In Chap. VI. the narrative of
   Genesis is recalled by Sarah's recognizing Michael as one of the three
   who came to Abraham at the oak of Mamre, with the added circumstance of
   the calf rising up whole after being eaten.  The dream of Isaac in
   Chap. VII. is perhaps remotely suggested by that of Joseph.  The whole
   vision of judgment, with the presence of Adam and Abel, is very
   noteworthy, as also the conception of Death, and the explanation of his
   various forms.

   The Testament of Abraham.

   ------------------------

   Version I.

   I.  Abraham lived the measure of his life, nine hundred and ninety-five
   years, and having lived all the years of his life in quietness,
   gentleness, and righteousness, the righteous one was exceeding
   hospitable; for, pitching his tent in the cross-ways at the oak of
   Mamre, he received every one, both rich and poor, kings and rulers, the
   maimed and the helpless, friends and strangers, neighbors and
   travelers, all alike did the devout, all-holy, righteous, and
   hospitable Abraham entertain.  Even upon him, however, there came the
   common, inexorable, bitter lot of death, and the uncertain end of
   life.  Therefore the Lord God, summoning his archangel Michael, said to
   him:  Go down, chief-captain [3991] Michael, to Abraham and speak to
   him concerning his death, that he may set his affairs in order, for I
   have blessed him as the stars of heaven, and as the sand by the
   sea-shore, and he is in abundance of long life and many possessions,
   and is becoming exceeding rich.  Beyond all men, moreover, he is
   righteous in every goodness, hospitable and loving to the end of his
   life; but do thou, archangel Michael, go to Abraham, my beloved friend,
   and announce to him his death and assure him thus:  Thou shalt at this
   time depart from this vain world, and shalt quit the body, and go to
   thine own Lord among the good.

   II.  And the chief-captain departed from before the face of God, and
   went down to Abraham to the oak of Mamre, and found the righteous
   Abraham in the field close by, sitting beside yokes of oxen for
   ploughing, together with the sons of Masek and other servants, to the
   number of twelve.  And behold the chief-captain came to him, and
   Abraham, seeing the chief-captain Michael coming from afar, like to a
   very comely warrior, arose and met him as was his custom, meeting and
   entertaining all strangers.  And the chief-captain saluted him and
   said:  Hail, most honored father, righteous soul chosen of God, true
   son of the heavenly one.  Abraham said to the chief-captain:  Hail,
   most honored warrior, bright as the sun and most beautiful above all
   the sons of men; thou art welcome; therefore I beseech thy presence,
   tell me whence the youth of thy age has come; teach me, thy suppliant,
   whence and from what army and from what journey thy beauty has come
   hither.  The chief-captain said:  I, O righteous Abraham, come from the
   great city.  I have been sent by the great king to take the place of a
   good friend of his, for the king has summoned him.  And Abraham said,
   Come, my Lord, go with me as far as my field.  The chief-captain said:
   I come; and going into the field of the ploughing, they sat down beside
   the company.  And Abraham said to his servants, the sons of Masek:  Go
   ye to the herd of horses, and bring two horses, quiet, and gentle and
   tame, so that I and this stranger may sit thereon.  But the
   chief-captain said, Nay, my Lord, Abraham, let them not bring horses,
   for I abstain from ever sitting upon any four-footed beast.  Is not my
   king rich in much merchandise, having power both over men and all kinds
   of cattle? but I abstain from ever sitting upon any four-footed beast.
   Let us go, then, O righteous soul, walking lightly until we reach thy
   house.  And Abraham said, Amen, be it so.

   III.  And as they went on from the field toward his house, beside that
   way there stood a cypress tree, and by the command of the Lord the tree
   cried out with a human voice, saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
   that calls himself to those that love him; but Abraham hid the mystery,
   thinking that the chief-captain had not heard the voice of the tree.
   And coming nigh to the house they sat down in the court, and Isaac
   seeing the face of the angel said to Sarah his mother, My lady mother,
   behold, the man sitting with my father Abraham is not a son of the race
   of those that dwell on the earth.  And Isaac ran, and saluted him, and
   fell at the feet of the Incorporeal, and the Incorporeal blessed him
   and said, The Lord God will grant thee his promise that he made to thy
   father Abraham and to his seed, and will also grant thee the precious
   prayer of thy father and thy mother.  Abraham said to Isaac his son, My
   son Isaac, draw water from the well, and bring it me in the vessel,
   that we may wash the feet of this stranger, for he is tired, having
   come to us from off a long journey.  And Isaac ran to the well and drew
   water in the vessel and brought it to them, and Abraham went up and
   washed the feet of the chief captain Michael, and the heart of Abraham
   was moved, and he wept over the stranger.  And Isaac, seeing his father
   weeping, wept also, and the chief captain, seeing them weeping, also
   wept with them, and the tears of the chief captain fell upon the vessel
   into the water of the basin and became precious stones.  And Abraham
   seeing the marvel, and being astonished, took the stones secretly, and
   hid the mystery, keeping it by himself in his heart.

   IV.  And Abraham said to Isaac his son:  Go, my beloved son, into the
   inner chamber of the house and beautify it.  Spread for us there two
   couches, one for me and one for this man that is guest with us this
   day.  Prepare for us there a seat and a candlestick and a table with
   abundance of every good thing.  Beautify the chamber, my son, and
   spread under us linen and purple and fine linen.  Burn there every
   precious and excellent incense, and bring sweet-smelling plants from
   the garden and fill our house with them.  Kindle seven lamps full of
   oil, so that we may rejoice, for this man that is our guest this day is
   more glorious than kings or rulers, and his appearance surpasses all
   the sons of men.  And Isaac prepared all things well, and Abraham
   taking the archangel Michael went into the chamber, and they both sat
   down upon the couches, and between them he placed a table with
   abundance of every good thing.  Then the chief captain arose and went
   out, as if by constraint of his belly to make issue of water, and
   ascended to heaven in the twinkling of an eye, and stood before the
   Lord, and said to him:  Lord and Master, let thy power know that I am
   unable to remind that righteous man of his death, for I have not seen
   upon the earth a man like him, pitiful, hospitable, righteous,
   truthful, devout, refraining from every evil deed.  And now know, Lord,
   that I cannot remind him of his death.  And the Lord said:  Go down,
   chief-captain Michael, to my friend Abraham, and whatever he say to
   thee, that do thou also, and whatever he eat, eat thou also with him.
   And I will send my Holy Spirit upon his son Isaac, and will put the
   remembrance of his death into the heart of Isaac, so that even he in a
   dream may see the death of his father, and Isaac will relate the dream,
   and thou shalt interpret it, and he himself will know his end.  And the
   chief-captain said, Lord, all the heavenly spirits are incorporeal, and
   neither eat nor drink, and this man has set before me a table with
   abundance of all good things earthly and corruptible.  Now, Lord, what
   shall I do?  How shall I escape him, sitting at one table with him?
   The Lord said:  Go down to him, and take no thought for this, for when
   thou sittest down with him, I will send upon thee a devouring spirit,
   and it will consume out of thy hands and through thy mouth all that is
   on the table.  Rejoice together with him in everything, only thou shalt
   interpret well the things of the vision, that Abraham may know the
   sickle of death and the uncertain end of life, and may make disposal of
   all his possessions, for I have blessed him above the sand of the sea
   and as the stars of heaven.

   V.  Then the chief captain went down to the house of Abraham, and sat
   down with him at the table, and Isaac served them.  And when the supper
   was ended, Abraham prayed after his custom, and the chief-captain
   prayed together with him, and each lay down to sleep upon his couch.
   And Isaac said to his father, Father, I too would fain sleep with you
   in this chamber, that I also may hear your discourse, for I love to
   hear the excellence of the conversation of this virtuous man.  Abraham
   said, Nay, my son, but go to thy own chamber and sleep on thy own
   couch, lest we be troublesome to this man.  Then Isaac, having received
   the prayer from them, and having blessed them, went to his own chamber
   and lay down upon his couch.  But the Lord cast the thought of death
   into the heart of Isaac as in a dream, and about the third hour of the
   night Isaac awoke and rose up from his couch, and came running to the
   chamber where his father was sleeping together with the archangel.
   Isaac, therefore, on reaching the door cried out, saying, My father
   Abraham, arise and open to me quickly, that I may enter and hang upon
   thy neck, and embrace thee before they take thee away from me.  Abraham
   therefore arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered and hung upon his
   neck, and began to weep with a loud voice.  Abraham therefore being
   moved at heart, also wept with a loud voice, and the chief-captain,
   seeing them weeping, wept also.  Sarah being in her room, heard their
   weeping, and came running to them, and found them embracing and
   weeping.  And Sarah said with weeping, My Lord Abraham, what is this
   that ye weep?  Tell me, my Lord, has this brother that has been
   entertained by us this day brought thee tidings of Lot, thy brother's
   son, that he is dead? is it for this that ye grieve thus?  The
   chief-captain answered and said to her, Nay, my sister Sarah, it is not
   as thou sayest, but thy son Isaac, methinks, beheld a dream, and came
   to us weeping, and we seeing him were moved in our hearts and wept.

   VI.  Then Sarah, hearing the excellence of the conversation of the
   chief-captain, straightway knew that it was an angel of the Lord that
   spoke.  Sarah therefore signified to Abraham to come out towards the
   door, and said to him, My Lord Abraham, knowest thou who this man is?
   Abraham said, I know not.  Sarah said, Thou knowest, my Lord, the three
   men from heaven that were entertained by us in our tent beside the oak
   of Mamre, when thou didst kill the kid without blemish, and set a table
   before them.  After the flesh had been eaten, the kid rose again, and
   sucked its mother with great joy.  Knowest thou not, my Lord Abraham,
   that by promise they gave to us Isaac as the fruit of the womb?  Of
   these three holy men this is one.  Abraham said, O Sarah, in this thou
   speakest the truth.  Glory and praise from our God and the Father.  For
   late in the evening when I washed his feet in the basin I said in my
   heart, These are the feet of one of the three men that I washed then;
   and his tears that fell into the basin then became precious stones.
   And shaking them out from his lap he gave them to Sarah, saying, If
   thou believest me not, look now at these.  And Sarah receiving them
   bowed down and saluted and said, Glory be to God that showeth us
   wonderful things.  And now know, my Lord Abraham, that there is among
   us the revelation of some thing, whether it be evil or good!

   VII.  And Abraham left Sarah, and went into the chamber, and said to
   Isaac, Come hither, my beloved son, tell me the truth, what it was thou
   sawest and what befell thee that thou camest so hastily to us.  And
   Isaac answering began to say, I saw, my Lord, in this night the sun and
   the moon above my head, surrounding me with its rays and giving me
   light.  As I gazed at this and rejoiced, I saw the heaven opened, and a
   man bearing light descend from it, shining more than seven suns.  And
   this man like the sun came and took away the sun from my head, and went
   up into the heavens from whence he came, but I was greatly grieved that
   he took away the sun from me.  After a little, as I was still sorrowing
   and sore troubled, I saw this man come forth from heaven a second time,
   and he took away from me the moon also from off my head, and I wept
   greatly and called upon that man of light, and said, Do not, my Lord,
   take away my glory from me; pity me and hear me, and if thou takest
   away the sun from me, then leave the moon to me.  He said, Suffer them
   to be taken up to the king above, for he wishes them there.  And he
   took them away from me, but he left the rays upon me.  The
   chief-captain said, Hear, O righteous Abraham; the sun which thy son
   saw is thou his father, and the moon likewise is Sarah his mother.  The
   man bearing light who descended from heaven, this is the one sent from
   God who is to take thy righteous soul from thee.  And now know, O most
   honored Abraham, that at this time thou shalt leave this worldly life,
   and remove to God.  Abraham said to the chief captain O strangest of
   marvels! and now art thou he that shall take my soul from me?  The
   chief-captain said to him, I am the chief-captain Michael, that stands
   before the Lord, and I was sent to thee to remind thee of thy death,
   and then I shall depart to him as I was commanded.  Abraham said, Now I
   know that thou art an angel of the Lord, and wast sent to take my soul,
   but I will not go with thee; but do thou whatever thou art commanded.

   VIII.  The chief-captain hearing these words immediately vanished, and
   ascending into heaven stood before God, and told all that he had seen
   in the house of Abraham; and the chief-captain said this also to his
   Lord, Thus says thy friend Abraham, I will not go with thee, but do
   thou whatever thou art commanded; and now, O Lord Almighty, doth thy
   glory and immortal kingdom order aught?  God said to the chief-captain
   Michael, Go to my friend Abraham yet once again, and speak to him thus,
   Thus saith the Lord thy God, he that brought thee into the land of
   promise, that blessed thee above the sand of the sea and above the
   stars of heaven, that opened the womb of barrenness of Sarah, and
   granted thee Isaac as the fruit of the womb in old age, Verily I say
   unto thee that blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will
   multiply thy seed, and I will give thee all that thou shalt ask from
   me, for I am the Lord thy God, and besides me there is no other.  Tell
   me why thou hast rebelled against me, and why there is grief in thee,
   and why thou rebelled against my archangel Michael?  Knowest thou not
   that all who have come from Adam and Eve have died, and that none of
   the prophets has escaped death?  None of those that rule as kings is
   immortal; none of thy forefathers has escaped the mystery of death.
   They have all died, they have all departed into Hades, they are all
   gathered by the sickle of death.  But upon thee I have not sent death,
   I have not suffered any deadly disease to come upon thee, I have not
   permitted the sickle of death to meet thee, I have not allowed the nets
   of Hades to enfold thee, I have never wished thee to meet with any
   evil.  But for good comfort I have sent my chief-captain Michael to
   thee, that thou mayst know thy departure from the world, and set thy
   house in order, and all that belongs to thee, and bless Isaac thy
   beloved son.  And now know that I have done this not wishing to grieve
   thee.  Wherefore then hast thou said to my chief-captain, I will not go
   with thee?  Wherefore hast thou spoken thus?  Knowest thou not that if
   I give leave to death and he comes upon thee, then I should see whether
   thou wouldst come or not?

   IX.  And the chief-captain receiving the exhortations of the Lord went
   down to Abraham, and seeing him the righteous one fell upon his face to
   the ground as one dead, and the chief-captain told him all that he had
   heard from the Most High.  Then the holy and just Abraham rising with
   many tears fell at the feet of the Incorporeal, and besought him,
   saying, I beseech thee, chief-captain of the hosts above, since thou
   hast wholly deigned to come thyself to me a sinner and in all things
   thy unworthy servant, I beseech thee even now, O chief-captain, to
   carry my word yet again to the Most High, and thou shalt say to him,
   Thus saith Abraham thy servant, Lord, Lord, in every work and word
   which I have asked of thee thou hast heard me, and hast fulfilled all
   my counsel.  Now, Lord, I resist not thy power, for I too know that I
   am not immortal but mortal.  Since therefore to thy command all things
   yield, and fear and tremble at the face of thy power, I also fear, but
   I ask one request of thee, and now, Lord and Master, hear my prayer,
   for while still in this body I desire to see all the inhabited earth,
   and all the creations which thou didst establish by one word, and when
   I see these, then if I shall depart from life I shall be without
   sorrow.  So the chief-captain went back again, and stood before God,
   and told him all, saying, Thus saith thy friend Abraham, I desired to
   behold all the earth in my lifetime before I died.  And the Most High
   hearing this, again commanded the chief-captain Michael, and said to
   him, Take a cloud of light, and the angels that have power over the
   chariots, and go down, take the righteous Abraham upon a chariot of the
   cherubim, and exalt him into the air of heaven that he may behold all
   the earth.

   X.  And the archangel Michael went down and took Abraham upon a chariot
   of the cherubim, and exalted him into the air of heaven, and led him
   upon the cloud together with sixty angels, and Abraham ascended upon
   the chariot over all the earth.  And Abraham saw the world as it was in
   that day, some ploughing, others driving wains, in one place men
   herding flocks, and in another watching them by night, and dancing and
   playing and harping, in another place men striving and contending at
   law, elsewhere men weeping and having the dead in remembrance.  He saw
   also the newly-wedded received with honor, and in a word he saw all
   things that are done in the world, both good and bad.  Abraham
   therefore passing over them saw men bearing swords, wielding in their
   hands sharpened swords, and Abraham asked the chief-captain, Who are
   these?  The chief-captain said, These are thieves, who intend to commit
   murder, and to steal and burn and destroy.  Abraham said, Lord, Lord,
   hear my voice, and command that wild beasts may come out of the wood
   and devour them.  And even as he spoke there came wild beasts out of
   the wood and devoured them.  And he saw in another place a man with a
   woman committing fornication with each other, and said, Lord, Lord,
   command that the earth may open and swallow them, and straightway the
   earth was cleft and swallowed them.  And he saw in another place men
   digging through a house, and carrying away other men's possessions, and
   he said, Lord, Lord, command that fire may come down from heaven and
   consume them.  And even as he spoke, fire came down from heaven and
   consumed them.  And straightway there came a voice from heaven to the
   chief-captain, saying thus, O chief-captain Michael, command the
   chariot to stop, and turn Abraham away that he may not see all the
   earth, for if he behold all that live in wickedness, he will destroy
   all creation.  For behold, Abraham has not sinned, and has no pity on
   sinners, but I have made the world, and desire not to destroy any one
   of them, but wait for the death of the sinner, till he be converted and
   live.  But take Abraham up to the first gate of heaven, that he may see
   there the judgments and recompenses, and repent of the souls of the
   sinners that he has destroyed.

   XI.  So Michael turned the chariot and brought Abraham to the east, to
   the first gate of heaven; and Abraham saw two ways, the one narrow and
   contracted, the other broad and spacious, and there he saw two gates,
   the one broad on the broad way, and the other narrow on the narrow
   way.  And outside the two gates there he saw a man sitting upon a
   gilded throne, and the appearance of that man was terrible, as of the
   Lord. [3992]   And they saw many souls driven by angels and led in
   through the broad gate, and other souls, few in number, that were taken
   by the angels through the narrow gate.  And when the wonderful one who
   sat upon the golden throne saw few entering through the narrow gate,
   and many entering through the broad one, straightway that wonderful one
   tore the hairs of his head and the sides of his beard, and threw
   himself on the ground from his throne, weeping and lamenting.  But when
   he saw many souls entering through the narrow gate, then he arose from
   the ground and sat upon his throne in great joy, rejoicing and
   exulting.  And Abraham asked the chief-captain, My Lord chief-captain,
   who is this most marvelous man, adorned with such glory, and sometimes
   he weeps and laments, and sometimes he rejoices and exults?  The
   incorporeal one said:  This is the first-created Adam who is in such
   glory, and he looks upon the world because all are born from him, and
   when he sees many souls going through the narrow gate, then he arises
   and sits upon his throne rejoicing and exulting in joy, because this
   narrow gate is that of the just, that leads to life, and they that
   enter through it go into Paradise.  For this, then, the first-created
   Adam rejoices, because he sees the souls being saved.  But when he sees
   many souls entering through the broad gate, then he pulls out the hairs
   of his head, and casts himself on the ground weeping and lamenting
   bitterly, for the broad gate is that of sinners, which leads to
   destruction and eternal punishment.  And for this the first-formed Adam
   falls from his throne weeping and lamenting for the destruction of
   sinners, for they are many that are lost, and they are few that are
   saved, for in seven thousand there is scarcely found one soul saved,
   being righteous and undefiled.

   XII.  While he was yet saying these things to me, behold two angels,
   fiery in aspect, and pitiless in mind, and severe in look, and they
   drove on thousands of souls, pitilessly lashing them with fiery
   thongs.  The angel laid hold of one soul, and they drove all the souls
   in at the broad gate to destruction.  So we also went along with the
   angels, and came within that broad gate, and between the two gates
   stood a throne terrible of aspect, of terrible crystal, gleaming as
   fire, and upon it sat a wondrous man bright as the sun, like to the Son
   of God.  Before him stood a table like crystal, all of gold and fine
   linen, and upon the table there was lying a book, the thickness of it
   six cubits, and the breadth of it ten cubits, and on the right and left
   of it stood two angels holding paper and ink and pen.  Before the table
   sat an angel of light, holding in his hand a balance, and on his left
   sat an angel all fiery, pitiless, and severe, holding in his hand a
   trumpet, having within it all-consuming fire with which to try the
   sinners.  The wondrous man who sat upon the throne himself judged and
   sentenced the souls, and the two angels on the right and on the left
   wrote down, the one on the right the righteousness and the one on the
   left the wickedness.  The one before the table, who held the balance,
   weighed the souls, and the fiery angel, who held the fire, tried the
   souls.  And Abraham asked the chief-captain Michael, What is this that
   we behold?  And the chief-captain said, These things that thou seest,
   holy Abraham, are the judgment and recompense.  And behold the angel
   holding the soul in his hand, and he brought it before the judge, and
   the judge said to one of the angels that served him, Open me this book,
   and find me the sins of this soul.  And opening the book he found its
   sins and its righteousness equally balanced, and he neither gave it to
   the tormentors, nor to those that were saved, but set it in the midst.

   XIII.  And Abraham said, My Lord chief-captain, who is this most
   wondrous judge? and who are the angels that write down? and who is the
   angel like the sun, holding the balance? and who is the fiery angel
   holding the fire?  The chief-captain said, "Seest thou, most holy
   Abraham, the terrible man sitting upon the throne?  This is the son of
   the first created Adam, who is called Abel, whom the wicked Cain
   killed, and he sits thus to judge all creation, and examines righteous
   men and sinners.  For God has said, I shall not judge you, but every
   man born of man shall be judged.  Therefore he has given to him
   judgment, to judge the world until his great and glorious coming, and
   then, O righteous Abraham, is the perfect judgment and recompense,
   eternal and unchangeable, which no one can alter.  For every man has
   come from the first-created, and therefore they are first judged here
   by his son, and at the second coming they shall be judged by the twelve
   tribes of Israel, every breath and every creature.  But the third time
   they shall be judged by the Lord God of all, and then, indeed, the end
   of that judgment is near, and the sentence terrible, and there is none
   to deliver.  And now by three tribunals the judgment of the world and
   the recompense is made, and for this reason a matter is not finally
   confirmed by one or two witnesses, but by three witnesses shall
   everything be established.  The two angels on the right hand and on the
   left, these are they that write down the sins and the righteousness,
   the one on the right hand writes down the righteousness, and the one on
   the left the sins.  The angel like the sun, holding the balance in his
   hand, is the archangel, Dokiel the just weigher, and he weighs the
   righteousnesses and sins with the righteousness of God.  The fiery and
   pitiless angel, holding the fire in his hand, is the archangel Puruel,
   who has power over fire, and tries the works of men through fire, and
   if the fire consume the work of any man, the angel of judgment
   immediately seizes him, and carries him away to the place of sinners, a
   most bitter place of punishment.  But if the fire approves the work of
   anyone, and does not seize upon it, that man is justified, and the
   angel of righteousness takes him and carries him up to be saved in the
   lot of the just.  And thus, most righteous Abraham, all things in all
   men are tried by fire and the balance."

   XIV.  And Abraham said to the chief-captain, My Lord the chief-captain,
   the soul which the angel held in his hand, why was it adjudged to be
   set in the midst?  The chief-captain said, Listen, righteous Abraham.
   Because the judge found its sins. and its righteousnesses equal, he
   neither committed it to judgment nor to be saved, until the judge of
   all shall come.  Abraham said to the chief-captain, And what yet is
   wanting for the soul to be saved?  The chief-captain said, If it
   obtains one righteousness above its sins, it enters into salvation.
   Abraham said to the chief-captain, Come hither, chief-captain Michael,
   let us make prayer for this soul, and see whether God will hear us.
   The chief-captain said, Amen, be it so; and they made prayer and
   entreaty for the soul, and God heard them, and when they rose up from
   their prayer they did not see the soul standing there.  And Abraham
   said to the angel, Where is the soul that thou didst hold in the
   midst?  And the angel answered, It has been saved by thy righteous
   prayer, and behold an angel of light has taken it and carried it up
   into Paradise.  Abraham said, I glorify the name of God, the Most High,
   and his immeasurable mercy.  And Abraham said to the chief-captain, I
   beseech thee, archangel, hearken to my prayer, and let us yet call upon
   the Lord, and supplicate his compassion, and entreat his mercy for the
   souls of the sinners whom I formerly, in my anger, cursed and
   destroyed, whom the earth devoured, and the wild beasts tore in pieces,
   and the fire consumed through my words.  Now I know that I have sinned
   before the Lord our God.  Come then, O Michael, chief-captain of the
   hosts above, come, let us call upon God with tears that he may forgive
   me my sin, and grant them to me.  And the chief-captain heard him, and
   they made entreaty before the Lord, and when they had called upon him
   for a long space, there came a voice from heaven saying, Abraham,
   Abraham, I have hearkened to thy voice and thy prayer, and forgive thee
   thy sin, and those whom thou thinkest that I destroyed I have called up
   and brought them into life by my exceeding kindness, because for a
   season I have requited them in judgment, and those whom I destroy
   living upon earth, I will not requite in death.

   XV.  And the voice of the Lord said also to the chief-captain Michael,
   Michael, my servant, turn back Abraham to his house, for behold his end
   has come nigh, and the measure of his life is fulfilled, that he may
   set all things in order, and then take him and bring him to me.  So the
   chief-captain, turning the chariot and the cloud, brought Abraham to
   his house, and going into his chamber he sat upon his couch.  And Sarah
   his wife came and embraced the feet of the Incorporeal, and spoke
   humbly, saying, I give thee thanks, my Lord, that thou hast brought my
   Lord Abraham, for behold we thought he had been taken up from us.  And
   his son Isaac also came and fell upon his neck, and in the same way all
   his men-slaves and women-slaves surrounded Abraham and embraced him,
   glorifying God.  And the Incorporeal one said to them, Hearken,
   righteous Abraham.  Behold thy wife Sarah, behold also thy beloved son
   Isaac, behold also all thy men-servants and maid-servants round about
   thee.  Make disposition of all that thou hast, for the day has come
   nigh in which thou shalt depart from the body and go to the Lord once
   for all.  Abraham said, Has the Lord said it, or sayest thou this of
   thyself?  The chief-captain answered, Hearken, righteous Abraham.  The
   Lord has commanded, and I tell it thee.  Abraham said, I will not go
   with thee.  The chief-captain, hearing these words, straightway went
   forth from the presence of Abraham, and went up into the heavens, and
   stood before God the Most High, and said, Lord Almighty, behold I have
   hearkened to Thy friend Abraham in all he has said to Thee, and have
   fulfilled his requests.  I have shown to him Thy power, and all the
   earth and sea that is under heaven.  I have shown to him judgment and
   recompense by means of cloud and chariots, and again he says, I will
   not go with thee.  And the Most High said to the angel, Does my friend
   Abraham say thus again, I will not go with thee?  The archangel said,
   Lord Almighty, he says thus, and I refrain from laying hands on him,
   because from the beginning he is Thy friend, and has done all things
   pleasing in Thy sight.  There is no man like him on earth, not even Job
   the wondrous man, and therefore I refrain from laying hands on him.
   Command, therefore, Immortal King, what shall be done.

   XVI.  Then the Most High said, Call me hither Death that is called the
   shameless countenance and the pitiless look.  And Michael the
   Incorporeal went and said to Death, Come hither; the Lord of creation,
   the immortal king, calls thee.  And Death, hearing this, shivered and
   trembled, being possessed with great terror, and coming with great fear
   it stood before the invisible father, shivering, groaning and
   trembling, awaiting the command of the Lord.  Therefore the invisible
   God said to Death, Come hither, thou bitter and fierce name of the
   world, hide thy fierceness, cover thy corruption, and cast away thy
   bitterness from thee, and put on thy beauty and all thy glory, and go
   down to Abraham my friend, and take him and bring him to me.  But now
   also I tell thee not to terrify him, but bring him with fair speech,
   for he is my own friend.  Having heard this, Death went out from the
   presence of the Most High, and put on a robe of great brightness, and
   made his appearance like the sun, and became fair and beautiful above
   the sons of men, assuming the form of an archangel, having his cheeks
   flaming with fire, and he departed to Abraham.  Now the righteous
   Abraham went out of his chamber, and sat under the trees of Mamre,
   holding his chin in his hand, and awaiting the coming of the archangel
   Michael.  And behold, a smell of sweet odor came to him, and a flashing
   of light, and Abraham turned and saw Death coming towards him in great
   glory and beauty.  And Abraham arose and went to meet him, thinking
   that it was the chief-captain of God, and Death beholding him saluted
   him, saying, Rejoice, precious Abraham, righteous soul, true friend of
   the Most High God, and companion of the holy angels.  Abraham said to
   Death, Hail thou of appearance and form like the sun, most glorious
   helper, bringer of light, wondrous man, from whence does thy glory come
   to us, and who art thou, and whence comest thou?  Then Death said, Most
   righteous Abraham, behold I tell thee the truth.  I am the bitter lot
   of death.  Abraham said to him, Nay, but thou art the comeliness of the
   world, thou art the glory and beauty of angels and men, thou art fairer
   in form than every other, and sayest thou, I am the bitter lot of
   death, and not rather, I am fairer than every good thing.  Death said,
   I tell thee the truth.  What the Lord has named me, that also I tell
   thee.  Abraham said, For what art thou come hither?  Death said, For
   thy holy soul am I come.  Then Abraham said, I know what thou meanest,
   but I will not go with thee; and Death was silent and answered him not
   a word.

   XVII.  Then Abraham arose, and went into his house, and Death also
   accompanied him thither.  And Abraham went up into his chamber, and
   Death went up with him.  And Abraham lay down upon his couch, and Death
   came and sat by his feet.  Then Abraham said, Depart, depart from me,
   for I desire to rest upon my couch.  Death said, I will not depart
   until I take thy spirit from thee.  Abraham said to him, By the
   immortal God I charge thee to tell me the truth.  Art thou death?
   Death said to him, I am Death.  I am the destroyer of the world.
   Abraham said, I beseech thee, since thou art Death, tell me if thou
   comest thus to all in such fairness and glory and beauty?  Death said,
   Nay, my Lord Abraham, for thy righteousnesses, and the boundless sea of
   thy hospitality, and the greatness of thy love towards God has become a
   crown upon my head, and in beauty and great peace and gentleness I
   approach the righteous, but to sinners I come in great corruption and
   fierceness and the greatest bitterness and with fierce and pitiless
   look.  Abraham said, I beseech thee, hearken to me, and show me thy
   fierceness and all thy corruption and bitterness.  And Death said, Thou
   canst not behold my fierceness, most righteous Abraham.  Abraham said,
   Yes, I shall be able to behold all thy fierceness by means of the name
   of the living God, for the might of my God that is in heaven is with
   me.  Then Death put off all his comeliness and beauty, and all his
   glory and the form like the sun with which he was clothed, and put upon
   himself a tyrant's robe, and made his appearance gloomy and fiercer
   than all kind of wild beasts, and more unclean than all uncleanness.
   And he showed to Abraham seven fiery heads of serpents and fourteen
   faces, (one) of flaming fire and of great fierceness, and a face of
   darkness, and a most gloomy face of a viper, and a face of a most
   terrible precipice, and a face fiercer than an asp, and a face of a
   terrible lion, and a face of a cerastes and basilisk.  He showed him
   also a face of a fiery scimitar, and a sword-bearing face, and a face
   of lightning, lightening terribly, and a noise of dreadful thunder.  He
   showed him also another face of a fierce stormy sea, and a fierce
   rushing river, and a terrible three-headed serpent, and a cup mingled
   with poisons, and in short he showed to him great fierceness and
   unendurable bitterness, and every mortal disease as of the odor of
   Death.  And from the great bitterness and fierceness there died
   servants and maid-servants in number about seven thousand, and the
   righteous Abraham came into indifference of death so that his spirit
   failed him.

   XVIII.  And the all-holy Abraham, seeing these things thus, said to
   Death, I beseech thee, all-destroying Death, hide thy fierceness, and
   put on thy beauty and the shape which thou hadst before.  And
   straightway Death hid his fierceness, and put on his beauty which he
   had before.  And Abraham said to Death, Why hast thou done this, that
   thou hast slain all my servants and maidservants?  Has God sent thee
   hither for this end this day?  Death said, Nay, my Lord Abraham, it is
   not as thou sayest, but on thy account was I sent hither.  Abraham said
   to Death, How then have these died?  Has the Lord not spoken it?  Death
   said, Believe thou, most righteous Abraham, that this also is
   wonderful, that thou also wast not taken away with them.  Nevertheless
   I tell thee the truth, for if the right hand of God had not been with
   thee at that time, thou also wouldst have had to depart from this
   life.  The righteous Abraham said, Now I know that I have come into
   indifference of death, so that my spirit fails, but I beseech thee,
   all-destroying Death, since my servants have died before their time,
   come let us pray to the Lord our God that he may hear us and raise up
   those who died by thy fierceness before their time.  And Death said,
   Amen, be it so.  Therefore Abraham arose and fell upon the face of the
   ground in prayer, and Death together with him, and the Lord sent a
   spirit of life upon those that were dead and they were made alive
   again.  Then the righteous Abraham gave glory to God.

   XIX.  And going up into his chamber he lay down, and Death came and
   stood before him.  And Abraham said to him, Depart from me, for I
   desire to rest, because my spirit is in indifference.  Death said, I
   will not depart from thee until I take thy soul.  And Abraham with an
   austere countenance and angry look said to Death, Who has ordered thee
   to say this?  Thou sayest these words of thyself boastfully, and I will
   not go with thee until the chief-captain Michael come to me, and I
   shall go with him.  But this also I tell thee, if thou desirest that I
   shall accompany thee, explain to me all thy changes, the seven fiery
   heads of serpents and what the face of the precipice is, and what the
   sharp sword, and what the loud-roaring river, and what the tempestuous
   sea that rages so fiercely.  Teach me also the unendurable thunder, and
   the terrible lightning, and the evil-smelling cup mingled with
   poisons.  Teach me concerning all these.  And Death answered, Listen,
   righteous Abraham.  For seven ages I destroy the world and lead all
   down to Hades, kings and rulers, rich and poor, slaves and free men, I
   convoy to the bottom of Hades, and for this I showed thee the seven
   heads of serpents.  The face of fire I showed thee because many die
   consumed by fire, and behold death through a face of fire.  The face of
   the precipice I showed thee, because many men die descending from the
   tops of trees or terrible precipices and losing their life, and see
   death in the shape of a terrible precipice.  The face of the sword I
   showed thee because many are slain in wars by the sword, and see death
   as a sword.  The face of the great rushing river I showed thee because
   many are drowned and perish snatched away by the crossing of many
   waters and carried off by great rivers, and see death before their
   time.  The face of the angry raging sea I showed thee because many in
   the sea falling into great surges and becoming shipwrecked are
   swallowed up and behold death as the sea.  The unendurable thunder and
   the terrible lightning I showed thee because many men in the moment of
   anger meet with unendurable thunder and terrible lightning coming to
   seize upon men, and see death thus.  I showed thee also the poisonous
   wild beasts, asps and basilisks, leopards and lions and lions' whelps,
   bears and vipers, and in short the face of every wild beast I showed
   thee, most righteous one, because many men are destroyed by wild
   beasts, and others by poisonous snakes, serpents and asps and cerastes
   and basilisks and vipers, breathe out their life and die.  I showed
   thee also the destroying cups mingled with poison, because many men
   being given poison to drink by other men straightway depart
   unexpectedly.

   XX.  Abraham said, I beseech thee, is there also an unexpected death?
   Tell me.  Death said, Verily, verily, I tell thee in the truth of God
   that there are seventy-two deaths.  One is the just death, buying its
   fixed time, and many men in one hour enter into death being given over
   to the grave.  Behold, I have told thee all that thou hast asked, now I
   tell thee, most righteous Abraham, to dismiss all counsel, and cease
   from asking anything once for all, and come, go with me, as the God and
   judge of all has commanded me.  Abraham said to Death, Depart from me
   yet a little, that I may rest on my couch, for I am very faint at
   heart, for since I have seen thee with my eyes my strength has failed
   me, all the limbs of my flesh seem to me a weight as of lead, and my
   spirit is distressed exceedingly.  Depart for a little; for I have said
   I cannot bear to see thy shape.  Then Isaac his son came and fell upon
   his breast weeping, and his wife Sarah came and embraced his feet,
   lamenting bitterly.  There came also his men slaves and women slaves
   and surrounded his couch, lamenting greatly.  And Abraham came into
   indifference of death, and Death said to Abraham, Come, take my right
   hand, and may cheerfulness and life and strength come to thee.  For
   Death deceived Abraham, and he took his right hand, and straightway his
   soul adhered to the hand of Death.  And immediately the archangel
   Michael came with a multitude of angels and took up his precious soul
   in his hands in a divinely woven linen cloth, and they tended the body
   of the just Abraham with divine ointments and perfumes until the third
   day after his death, and buried him in the land of promise, the oak of
   Mamre, but the angels received his precious soul, and ascended into
   heaven, singing the hymn of "thrice holy" to the Lord the God of all,
   and they set it there to worship the God and Father.  And after great
   praise and glory had been given to the Lord, and Abraham bowed down to
   worship, there came the undefiled voice of the God and Father saying
   thus, Take therefore my friend Abraham into Paradise, where are the
   tabernacles of my righteous ones, and the abodes of my saints Isaac and
   Jacob in his bosom, where there is no trouble, nor grief, nor sighing,
   but peace and rejoicing and life unending.  (And let us, too, my
   beloved brethren, imitate the hospitality of the patriarch Abraham, and
   attain to his virtuous way of life, that we may be thought worthy of
   the life eternal, glorifying the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; to whom be
   glory and power forever.  Amen.).

   Version II.

   I.  It came to pass, when the days of the death of Abraham drew near,
   that the Lord said to Michael:  Arise and go to Abraham, my servant,
   and say to him, Thou shalt depart from life, for lo! the days of thy
   temporal life are fulfilled:  so that he may set his house in order
   before he die.

   II.  And Michael went and came to Abraham, and found him sitting before
   his oxen for ploughing, and he was exceeding old in appearance, and had
   his son in his arms.  Abraham, therefore, seeing the archangel Michael,
   rose from the ground and saluted him, not knowing who he was, and said
   to him:  The Lord preserve thee.  May thy journey be prosperous with
   thee.  And Michael answered him:  Thou art kind, good father.  Abraham
   answered and said to him:  Come, draw near to me, brother, and sit down
   a little while, that I may order a beast to be brought that we may go
   to my house, and thou mayest rest with me, for it is toward evening,
   and in the morning arise and go whithersoever thou wilt, lest some evil
   beast meet thee and do thee hurt.  And Michael enquired of Abraham,
   saying:  Tell me thy name, before I enter thy house, lest I be
   burdensome to thee.  Abraham answered and said, My parents called me
   Abram, and the Lord named me Abraham, saying:  Arise and depart from
   thy house, and from thy kindred, and go into the land which I shall
   show unto thee.  And when I went away into the land which the Lord
   showed me, he said to me:  Thy name shall no more be called Abram, but
   thy name shall be Abraham.  Michael answered and said to him:  Pardon
   me, my father, experienced man of God, for I am a stranger, and I have
   heard of thee that thou didst go forty furlongs and didst bring a goat
   and slay it, entertaining angels in thy house, that they might rest
   there.  Thus speaking together, they arose and went towards the house.
   And Abraham called one of his servants, and said to him:  Go, bring me
   a beast that the stranger may sit upon it, for he is wearied with his
   journey.  And Michael said:  Trouble not the youth, but let us go
   lightly until we reach the house, for I love thy company.

   III.  And arising they went on, and as they drew nigh to the city,
   about three furlongs from it, they found a great tree having three
   hundred branches, like to a tamarisk tree.  And they heard a voice from
   its branches singing, "Holy art thou, because thou hast kept the
   purpose for which thou wast sent."  And Abraham heard the voice, and
   hid the mystery in his heart, saying within himself, What is the
   mystery that I have heard?  As he came into the house, Abraham said to
   his servants, Arise, go out to the flocks, and bring three sheep, and
   slay them quickly, and make them ready that we may eat and drink, for
   this day is a feast for us.  And the servants brought the sheep, and
   Abraham called his son Isaac, and said to him, My son Isaac, arise and
   put water in the vessel that we may wash the feet of this stranger.
   And he brought it as he was commanded, and Abraham said, I perceive,
   and so it shall be, that in this basin I shall never again wash the
   feet of any man coming to us as a guest.  And Isaac hearing his father
   say this wept, and said to him, My father what is this that thou
   sayest, This is my last time to wash the feet of a stranger?  And
   Abraham seeing his son weeping, also wept exceedingly, and Michael
   seeing them weeping, wept also, and the tears of Michael fell upon the
   vessel and became a precious stone.

   IV.  When Sarah, being inside in her house, heard their weeping, she
   came out and said to Abraham, Lord, why is it that ye thus weep?
   Abraham answered, and said to her, It is no evil.  Go into thy house,
   and do thy own work, lest we be troublesome to the man.  And Sarah went
   away, being about to prepare the supper.  And the sun came near to
   setting, and Michael went out of the house, and was taken up into the
   heavens to worship before God, for at sunset all the angels worship God
   and Michael himself is the first of the angels.  And they all
   worshipped him, and went each to his own place, but Michael spoke
   before the Lord and said, Lord, command me to be questioned before thy
   holy glory!  And the Lord said to Michael, Announce whatsoever thou
   wilt!  And the Archangel answered and said, Lord, thou didst send me to
   Abraham to say to him, Depart from thy body, and leave this world; the
   Lord calls thee; and I dare not, Lord, reveal myself to him, for he is
   thy friend, and a righteous man, and one that receives strangers.  But
   I beseech thee, Lord, command the remembrance of the death of Abraham
   to enter into his own heart, and bid not me tell it him, for it is
   great abruptness to say, Leave the world, and especially to leave one's
   own body, for thou didst create him from the beginning to have pity on
   the souls of all men.  Then the Lord said to Michael, Arise and go to
   Abraham, and lodge with him, and whatever thou seest him eat, eat thou
   also, and wherever he shall sleep, sleep thou there also.  For I will
   cast the thought of the death of Abraham into the heart of Isaac his
   son in a dream.

   V.  Then Michael went into the house of Abraham on that evening, and
   found them preparing the supper, and they ate and drank and were
   merry.  And Abraham said to his son Isaac, Arise, my son, and spread
   the man's couch that he may sleep, and set the lamp upon the stand.
   And Isaac did as his father commanded him, and Isaac said to his
   father, I too am coming to sleep beside you.  Abraham answered him,
   Nay, my son, lest we be troublesome to this man, but go to thy own
   chamber and sleep.  And Isaac not wishing to disobey his father's
   command, went away and slept in his own chamber.

   VI.  And it happened about the seventh hour of the night Isaac awoke,
   and came to the door of his father's chamber, crying out and saying,
   Open, father, that I may touch thee before they take thee away from
   me.  Abraham arose and opened to him, and Isaac entered and hung upon
   his father's neck weeping, and kissed him with lamentations.  And
   Abraham wept together with his son, and Michael saw them weeping and
   wept likewise.  And Sarah hearing them weeping called from her
   bed-chamber, saying, My Lord Abraham, why is this weeping?  Has the
   stranger told thee of thy brother's son Lot that he is dead? or has
   aught else befallen us?  Michael answered and said to Sarah, Nay,
   Sarah, I have brought no tidings of Lot, but I knew of all your
   kindness of heart, that therein ye excel all men upon earth, and the
   Lord has remembered you.  Then Sarah said to Abraham, How durst thou
   weep when the man of God has come in to thee, and why have thy eyes
   [3993] shed tears for today there is great rejoicing?  Abraham said to
   her, How knowest thou that this is a man of God?  Sarah answered and
   said, Because I say and declare that this is one of the three men who
   were entertained by us at the oak of Mamre, when one of the servants
   went and brought a kid and thou didst kill it, and didst say to me,
   Arise, make ready that we may eat with these men in our house.  Abraham
   answered and said, Thou has perceived well, O woman, for I too, when I
   washed his feet knew in my heart that these were the feet which I had
   washed at the oak of Mamre, and when I began to enquire concerning his
   journey, he said to me, I go to preserve Lot thy brother from the men
   of Sodom, and then I knew the mystery.

   VII.  And Abraham said to Michael, Tell me, man of God, and show to me
   why thou hast come hither.  And Michael said, Thy son Isaac will show
   thee.  And Abraham said to his son, My beloved son, tell me what thou
   hast seen in thy dream today, and wast frightened.  Relate it to me.
   Isaac answered his father, I saw in my dream the sun and the moon, and
   there was a crown upon my head, and there came from heaven a man of
   great size, and shining as the light that is called the father of
   light.  He took the sun from my head, and yet left the rays behind with
   me.  And I wept and said, I beseech thee, my Lord, take not away the
   glory of my head, and the light of my house, and all my glory.  And the
   sun and the moon and the stars lamented, saying, Take not away the
   glory of our power.  And that shining man answered and said to me, Weep
   not that I take the light of thy house, for it is taken up from
   troubles into rest, from a low estate to a high one; they lift him up
   from a narrow to a wide place; they raise him from darkness to light.
   And I said to him, I beseech thee, Lord, take also the rays with it.
   He said to me, There are twelve hours of the day, and then I shall take
   all the rays.  As the shining man said this, I saw the sun of my house
   ascending into heaven, but that crown I saw no more, and that sun was
   like thee my father.  And Michael said to Abraham, Thy son Isaac has
   spoken truth, for thou shalt go, and be taken up into the heavens, but
   thy body shall remain on earth, until seven thousand ages are
   fulfilled, for then all flesh shall arise.  Now therefore, Abraham, set
   thy house in order, and thy children, for thou hast heard fully what is
   decreed concerning thee.  Abraham answered and said to Michael, I
   beseech thee, Lord, if I shall depart from my body, I have desired to
   be taken up in my body that I may see the creatures that the Lord my
   God has created in heaven and on earth.  Michael answered and said,
   This is not for me to do, but I shall go and tell the Lord of this, and
   if I am commanded I shall show thee all these things.

   VIII.  And Michael went up into heaven, and spoke before the Lord
   concerning Abraham, and the Lord answered Michael, Go and take up
   Abraham in the body, and show him all things, and whatsoever he shall
   say to thee do to him as to my friend.  So Michael went forth and took
   up Abraham in the body on a cloud, and brought him to the river of
   Ocean.

   XII.  And after Abraham had seen the place of judgment, the cloud took
   him down upon the firmament below, and Abraham, looking down upon the
   earth, saw a man committing adultery with a wedded woman.  And Abraham
   turning said to Michael, Seest thou this wickedness? but, Lord, send
   fire from heaven to consume them.  And straightway there came down fire
   and consumed them, for the Lord had said to Michael, Whatsoever Abraham
   shall ask thee to do for him, do thou.  Abraham looked again, and saw
   other men railing at their companions, and said, Let the earth open and
   swallow them, and as he spoke the earth swallowed them alive.  Again
   the cloud led him to another place, and Abraham saw some going into a
   desert place to commit murder, and he said to Michael, Seest thou this
   wickedness? but let wild beasts come out of the desert, and tear them
   in pieces, and that same hour wild beasts came out of the desert, and
   devoured them.  Then the Lord God spoke to Michael saying, Turn away
   Abraham to his own house, and let him not go round all the creation
   that I have made, because he has no compassion on sinners, but I have
   compassion on sinners that they may turn and live, and repent of their
   sins and be saved.

   (VIII.)  And Abraham looked and saw two gates, the one small and the
   other large, and between the two gates sat a man upon a throne of great
   glory, and a multitude of angels round about him, and he was weeping,
   and again laughing, but his weeping exceeded his laughter seven-fold.
   And Abraham said to Michael, Who is this that sits between the two
   gates in great glory; sometimes he laughs, and sometimes he weeps, and
   his weeping exceeds his laughter seven-fold?  And Michael said to
   Abraham, Knowest thou not who it is?  And he said, No, Lord.  And
   Michael said to Abraham, Seest thou these two gates, the small and the
   great?  These are they which lead to life and to destruction.  This man
   that sits between them is Adam, the first man whom the Lord created,
   and set him in this place to see every soul that departs from the body,
   seeing that all are from him.  When, therefore, thou seest him weeping,
   know that he has seen many souls being led to destruction, but when
   thou seest him laughing, he has seen many souls being led into life.
   Seest thou how his weeping exceeds his laughter?  Since he sees the
   greater part of the world being led away through the broad gate to
   destruction, therefore his weeping exceeds his laughter seven-fold.

   IX.  And Abraham said, And he that cannot enter through the narrow
   gate, can he not enter into life?  Then Abraham wept, saying, Woe is
   me, what shall I do? for I am a man broad of body, and how shall I be
   able to enter by the narrow gate, by which a boy of fifteen years
   cannot enter?  Michael answered and said to Abraham, Fear not, father,
   nor grieve, for thou shalt enter by it unhindered, and all those who
   are like thee.  And as Abraham stood and marveled, behold an angel of
   the Lord driving sixty thousand souls of sinners to destruction.  And
   Abraham said to Michael, Do all these go into destruction?  And Michael
   said to him, Yea, but let us go and search among these souls, if there
   is among them even one righteous.  And when they went, they found an
   angel holding in his hand one soul of a woman from among these sixty
   thousand, because he had found her sins weighing equally with all her
   works, and they were neither in motion nor at rest, but in a state
   between; but the other souls he led away to destruction.  Abraham said
   to Michael, Lord, is this the angel that removes the souls from the
   body or not?  Michael answered and said, This is death, and he leads
   them into the place of judgment, that the judge may try them.

   X.  And Abraham said, My Lord, I beseech thee to lead me to the place
   of judgment so that I too may see how they are judged.  Then Michael
   took Abraham upon a cloud, and led him into Paradise, and when he came
   to the place where the judge was, the angel came and gave that soul to
   the judge.  And the soul said, Lord have mercy on me.  And the judge
   said, How shall I have mercy upon thee, when thou hadst no mercy upon
   thy daughter which thou hadst, the fruit of thy womb?  Wherefore didst
   thou slay her?  It answered, Nay, Lord, slaughter has not been done by
   me, but my daughter has lied upon me.  But the judge commanded him to
   come that wrote down the records, and behold cherubim carrying two
   books.  And there was with them a man of exceeding great stature,
   having on his head three crowns, and the one crown was higher than the
   other two.  These are called the crowns of witness.  And the man had in
   his hand a golden pen, and the judge said to him, Exhibit the sin of
   this soul.  And that man, opening one of the books of the cherubim,
   sought out the sin of the woman's soul and found it.  And the judge
   said, O wretched soul, why sayest thou that thou hast not done murder?
   Didst thou not, after the death of thy husband, go and commit adultery
   with thy daughter's husband, and kill her?  And he convicted her also
   of her other sins, whatsoever she had done from her youth.  Hearing
   these things the woman cried out, saying, Woe is me, all the sins that
   I did in the world I forgot, but here they were not forgotten.  Then
   they took her away also and gave her over to the tormentors.

   XI.  And Abraham said to Michael, Lord, who is this judge, and who is
   the other, who convicts the sins?  And Michael said to Abraham, Seest
   thou the judge?  This is Abel, who first testified, and God brought him
   hither to judge, and he that bears witness here is the teacher of
   heaven and earth, and the scribe of righteousness, Enoch, for the Lord
   sent them hither to write down the sins and righteousnesses of each
   one.  Abraham said, And how can Enoch bear the weight of the souls, not
   having seen death? or how can he give sentence to all the souls?
   Michael said, If he gives sentence concerning the souls, it is not
   permitted; but Enoch himself does not give sentence, but it is the Lord
   who does so, and he has no more to do than only to write.  For Enoch
   prayed to the Lord saying, I desire not, Lord, to give sentence on the
   souls, lest I be grievous to anyone; and the Lord said to Enoch, I
   shall command thee to write down the sins of the soul that makes
   atonement and it shall enter into life, and if the soul make not
   atonement and repent, thou shalt find its sins written down and it
   shall be cast into punishment.  And about the ninth hour Michael
   brought Abraham back to his house.  But Sarah his wife, not seeing what
   had become of Abraham, was consumed with grief, and gave up the ghost,
   and after the return of Abraham he found her dead, and buried her.

   XIII.  But when the day of the death of Abraham drew nigh, the Lord God
   said to Michael, Death will not dare to go near to take away the soul
   of my servant, because he is my friend, but go thou and adorn Death
   with great beauty, and send him thus to Abraham, that he may see him
   with his eyes.  And Michael straightway, as he was commanded, adorned
   Death with great beauty, and sent him thus to Abraham that he might see
   him.  And he sat down near to Abraham, and Abraham seeing Death sitting
   near to him was afraid with a great fear.  And Death said to Abraham,
   Hail, holy soul! hail, friend of the Lord God! hail, consolation and
   entertainment of travelers!  And Abraham said, Thou art welcome,
   servant of the Most High. God.  I beseech thee, tell me who thou art;
   and entering into my house partake of food and drink, and depart from
   me, for since I have seen thee sitting near to me my soul has been
   troubled.  For I am not at all worthy to come near thee, for thou art
   an exalted spirit and I am flesh and blood, and therefore I cannot bear
   thy glory, for I see that thy beauty is not of this world.  And Death
   said to Abraham, I tell thee, in all the creation that God has made,
   there has not been found one like thee, for even the Lord himself by
   searching has not found such an one upon the whole earth.  And Abraham
   said to Death, How durst thou lie? for I see that thy beauty is not of
   this world.  And Death said to Abraham, Think not, Abraham, that this
   beauty is mine, or that I come thus to every man.  Nay, but if any one
   is righteous like thee, I thus take crowns and come to him, but if it
   is a sinner I come in great corruption, and out of their sin I make a
   crown for my head, and I shake them with great fear, so that they are
   dismayed.  Abraham therefore said to him, And whence comes thy beauty?
   And Death said, There is none other more full of corruption than I am.
   Abraham said to him, And art thou indeed he that is called Death?  He
   answered him and said, I am the bitter name.  I am weeping....

   XIV.  And Abraham said to Death, Show us thy corruption.  And Death
   made manifest his corruption; and he had two heads, the one had the
   face of a serpent and by it some die at once by asps, and the other
   head was like a sword; by it some die by the sword as by bows.  In that
   day the servants of Abraham died through fear of Death, and Abraham
   seeing them prayed to the Lord, and he raised them up. But God returned
   and removed the soul of Abraham as in a dream, and the archangel
   Michael took it up into the heavens.  And Isaac buried his father
   beside his mother Sarah, glorifying and praising God, for to him is due
   glory, honor and worship, of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, now and
   always and to all eternity.  Amen.

   The Acts of Xanthippe and Polyxena.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The original Greek text of this work is edited for the first time in
   Text and Studies, Vol. II., No. 3 (1893), by Montague Rhodes James,
   M.A., from the only ms. known to him, a Paris one of the eleventh
   century.  References to these Acts are not common in works dealing with
   the saints of the early church, and few writers seem to have known the
   work itself.

   In substance the Acts are a religious novel, similar in form, and to
   some extent in matter, to the Greek romances by Achilles Tatius,
   Heliodorus, and others, and based upon the belief that St. Paul
   actually did visit Spain, according to the intention expressed by him
   in Romans xv. 24.  The editor of the Greek text is inclined to assign
   its composition to about the middle of the third century, reasoning
   from its relations to the Acts of Paul, and those of other apostles,
   which its author apparently knew and made use of.  Thus a knowledge of
   the Acts of Paul and Thecla may be inferred from c. xxvi., of the Acts
   of Peter from c. xxiv., and of those of Andrew from cc. xxviii.-xxxi.

   The first and longest part of the story (from c. i. to xxi.) gives an
   account of the conversion of Xanthippe, wife of Probus, a man of rank
   in Spain.  In this part the narrative is less prominent than the
   speeches and prayers, which are numerous, and of considerable length.
   With c. xxii. a new section of the story begins, of which no previous
   warning has been given except in the title, containing the adventures
   of Polyxena, the sister of Xanthippe, who is carried off in the
   latter's absence.  The rest of the story is much more diversified than
   the early part, being full of incident and introducing a great variety
   of persons--the apostles Peter, Philip, and Andrew, an ass-driver, the
   Jewess Rebecca, a wicked prefect and his kind-hearted son, and finally
   Onesimus, who brings Polyxena back to Spain.

   This difference in the character of the narrative in the two parts
   causes also some difference in the language, which in the earlier
   section is more diffuse and more difficult of exact translation than in
   the later one.  The meaning of some words is also doubtful:  those
   translated "lamp-stand" and "destroyer," towards the end of c. xxi.,
   are so rendered in accordance with suggestions by his Exc. M.
   Gennadius, who also characterises the language of the text as full of
   errors.

   Life and Conduct of the Holy Women, Xanthippe, Polyxena, and Rebecca.

   ------------------------

   I.  When the blessed Paul was at Rome through the word of the Lord, it
   happened that a certain servant of a ruler of Spain came to Rome with
   letters of his master's, and heard the word of God from Paul, the truly
   golden and beautiful nightingale.  This servant being greatly touched,
   and being unable to remain and be filled with the divine word because
   he was hastened by the letters, returned into Spain in great grief, and
   being unable to show his desire to any one, because his master was an
   idolater, he was always pained at heart and sighing greatly.  Now this
   servant was honoured and faithful to his masters, and as time went
   past, the servant fell sick and grew lean of flesh, which his master
   perceiving said to him, What has happened to thee that thou art thus
   fallen together in countenance?  The servant said, here is a great pain
   in my heart, and I can in no way find rest.  His master said to him,
   And what is the pain that cannot receive healing from my chief
   physician?  The servant said, While I was still in Rome, this pain and
   its recurring mishap made itself known to me.  His master said, And
   knowest thou not of any who have fallen into this disease and been
   healed?  The servant said, Yes, but where that physician is I know not,
   for I left him in Rome.  So many as have been attended by that
   physician and have gone through the water m his hands, have received
   healing immediately.  His master said, I ought not to grudge to send
   thee yet again to Rome, if perchance thou mightest obtain healing.

   II.  And while they spoke thus, behold his mistress, by name Xanthippe,
   overhearing these words, and learning of the teaching of Paul, said,
   What is the name of that physician, and what is the healing to ward off
   such a disease?  The servant said to her, The calling upon a new name,
   and anointing with oil and washing with water.  By this treatment I
   have seen many that had incurable pains receive healings.  As he said
   this, the images of the idols that stood in the house began to be
   shaken and fall down.  And his mistress beckoned to him, saying, Seest
   thou, brother, the images of the idols being shaken, how they cannot
   endure the power of the word?  And his master, by name Probus, arose
   from his mid-day sleep with a very gloomy countenance, for the Devil
   had greatly disturbed him, because the knowledge of God had come into
   his house.  And he questioned the servant of everything in order, and
   the servant having been seized by sickness by the foreknowledge of God,
   disclosed to him the life of man, and Xanthippe was incurable in her
   soul concerning this teaching.  So Probus too was grieved for
   Xanthippe, because from that time she was wasting herself away with
   waking and abstinence and other austerities.

   III.  And Xanthippe going away to her couch and groaning, said, Woe is
   me, wretched one, lying in darkness, that I have not learned the name
   of the new teacher, that I might summon his prayer to help me, and what
   to say I know not.  Shall I call upon him by the name of his God? but I
   cannot say, The God that is preached by such a one.  Nevertheless I
   shall say thus by conjecture, O God, giving light in Hades, and guiding
   those in darkness, Lord of free men and kings, and preached by worthy
   servants in all the world, called upon as a brother by sinful men and
   quick to hear, to whom not even archangels can send up worthy songs of
   praise, who hast shown to me, humble and unworthy, the ever-living and
   abiding seed (though my ignorance permits me not to receive it), hasten
   also the things that concern me, Lord, since by thy will thou hast made
   thyself heard by me, and in thy compassion show me the proclamation of
   thy herald, that I may learn of him what is pleasing to thee.  Yea, I
   beseech thee look upon my ignorance, O God, and enlighten me with the
   light of thy countenance, thou that never overlookest any of those that
   call upon thee in truth.  Probus, her husband said to her, Why
   troublest thou thyself so much, lady, and dost not at all turn to
   sleep?  Xanthippe said, I cannot sleep, for there is in me an incurable
   pain.  Probus said to her, And what is thy pain or grief, O lady, that
   I am not sufficient to comfort thee?  All that thou hast wished unto
   this day I have served thee in, and now what is it that thou hast, and
   dost not tell me?  Xanthippe says to him, I beseech thee this thing
   only, my lord, permit me for a little and for this day only to sleep
   apart from thee.  And Probus said to her, Be it as thou wilt, lady;
   only leave off thy groaning.

   IV.  Then entering into her bed-chamber alone, she spoke thus with
   tears, In what way, my God, I shall act, or what counsel I shall take,
   I know not.  Shall I declare the thought that has come upon me?  I fear
   the madness and disorder of the city.  Shall I fly from this impious
   city?  I fear the contrivance of the devil for seizing the sheep.
   Shall I await the mercy and swiftness of the Lord?  Again I fear the
   untimely snatching away of life, for the death of sinners has no
   warning.  Shall I depart and flee away to Rome?  I fear the length of
   the journey, being unable to go on foot.  But while I say these things
   by conjecture, constrained by my desire (for I cannot speak with
   surety), may I find pardon with thee, my God, and do thou fulfil my
   desire with excess of right words, and think me but worthy to hear thy
   preacher, for if I say, to see his face, I ask a great thing.  Blessed
   is he that is found in the company of thy preachers, and is satisfied
   with their precious countenances.  Blessed are they that are yoked
   under the preaching of thy commandments.  Blessed are they that keep
   thy commandments; but where now, Lord, are thy mercies to our fathers,
   that we also may be their successors in love toward thee and heirs of
   faith.  But behold now, Lord, I cannot find any one that has love for
   thee, that communing with him I might even a little refresh my soul.
   Speed therefore, Lord, to yoke me in desire for thee, and keep me under
   the shadow of thy wings, for thou alone art God, glorified to all
   eternity.  Amen.

   V.  Therefore Xanthippe saying these words and others like them,
   groaned continually all the night, and Probus heard her and was greatly
   distressed, and arising from his couch when the morning came he went in
   to her, and seeing her eyes inflamed with tears, he said, Wherefore,
   lady, dost thou thus vex me, and wilt not tell me thy pain?  Tell it
   me, that I may do whatever is pleasing to thee, and distress me not
   with thy trouble.  Xanthippe says to him, Be of good cheer rather, my
   lord, and be not vexed, for my trouble shall not harm thee, but if I
   have found favour before thee, go forth now to the salutation, and
   allow me to indulge myself in it as I will, for it is not possible for
   man to take from me the insatiable pain.  And listening to her he went
   out immediately to receive the salutations of the men of the city, for
   he was the great man among them, and was also known to Nero, the
   Emperor.  And sitting down, great grief appeared in his countenance,
   and being asked the reason of his grief by the chief men of the city,
   he said to them that he had fallen into many and unfounded charges.

   VI.  And Xanthippe went out into the garden, that she might await there
   looking closely for certainty of her husband, and she saw the delight
   of the trees, and the various warbling of the birds, and said,
   groaning, O beauty of the world! for that which we hitherto thought to
   come of itself, we know now that all things are beautifully fashioned
   by the beautiful One.  O power and invention of wisdom! for not only
   has he placed in men a thousand tongues, but also in birds he has
   distinguished various voices, as if from anthems and responses to
   receive sweet-voiced and heart-stirring hymns from his own works.  O
   delightfulness of the air, declaring the inimitable creator!  Who shall
   turn my sorrow into rejoicing?  And again she said, God to whom praise
   is sung by all, give me peace and comfort.  As she said these things,
   Probus also came up from the street to break his fast, and when he saw
   her countenance altered by tears, he began to pull out the hairs of his
   head, but he dared not speak to her then so as not to mingle other
   trouble with her trouble.  So he went and fell upon his couch, and
   said, groaning, Alas, that I had not even the consolation of a child
   from her, but only acquire grief upon grief.  Two years are not yet
   full since I was wedded to her, and already she meditates divorce.

   VII.  But Xanthippe was always keeping watch through the doors into the
   streets of the city, and the blessed Paul, the preacher and teacher and
   illuminator of the world, left Rome and came even into Spain by the
   fore-knowledge of God.  And coming up to the gates of the city he stood
   and prayed, and crossing himself entered the city.  When Xanthippe saw
   the blessed Paul walking quietly and equally, and adorned with all
   virtue and understanding, she was greatly delighted in him and her
   heart leaped continually, and as possessed with an unexpected joy she
   said with herself, Why does my heart beat vehemently at the sight of
   this man?  Why is his walk quiet and equable, as of one who expects to
   take in his arms one that is pursued?  Why is his countenance kindly,
   as of one that tends the sick?  Why does he look so lovingly hither and
   thither, as one who desires to assist those who are seeking to flee
   from the mouths of dragons?  Who shall tell me that this is one from
   the flock of preachers?  If it were possible for me, I should wish to
   touch the hem of his garments, that I may behold his kindness and
   readiness to receive and sweet odour; for the servant had told her this
   also, that the hems of his garments had the odour of precious perfumes.

   VIII.  Now Probus heard her words, and straightway ran out by himself
   into the street, and laying hold of Paul's hand said to him, Man, who
   thou art I know not, but deign to enter into my house; perchance thou
   mayest be to me a cause of salvation.  Paul said to him, It will be
   well with thee, son, after thy request!  And they went in together to
   Xanthippe.  When Xanthippe therefore saw the great Paul, the
   intellectual eyes of her heart were uncovered, and she read upon his
   forehead, having as it were golden seals, these words, Paul the
   Preacher of God.  Then exulting and rejoicing she threw herself at his
   feet, and twisting her hair together she wiped his feet, saying,
   Welcome, O man of God, to us humble ones, that live as shadows among
   shadows.  For thou hast looked upon those who were running into Hades
   as into something beautiful, who addressed the crooked serpent and
   destroyer as provider and protector, who were running into the dark
   Hades as to their father, those that were fashioned with a rational
   nature but have become like irrational creatures.  Thou hast sought me,
   lowly one, having the sun of righteousness in my heart.  Now the poison
   is stayed, when I have seen thy precious face.  Now he that troubled me
   is flown away, when thy most beautiful counsel has appeared to me.  Now
   I shall be considered worthy of repentance, when I have received the
   seal of the preacher of the Lord.  Before now I have deemed many happy
   who met with you, but I say boldly that from this time forth I myself
   shall be called happy by others, because I have touched thy hem,
   because I have received thy prayers, because I have enjoyed thy sweet
   and honeyed teaching.  Thou hast not hesitated to come to us, thou that
   fishest the dry land in thy course, and gatherest the fish that fall in
   thy way into the net of the kingdom of heaven.

   IX.  The great Paul said to her, Arise, daughter, and look not upon me
   as having been sought out of thy ignorance by my foresight.  For
   Christ, the provider of the world, the searcher out of sinners and the
   lost, who has not only called to mind those upon earth, but also by his
   own presence has redeemed those in Hades, he himself has pitied thee,
   and sent me hither that he might visit and pity many others together
   with thee.  For this mercy and visitation are not of us, but are his
   injunction and command, even as we also have received mercy and been
   saved by him.  Probus hearing this was astonished at their words, for
   he was altogether ignorant of these things.  But Paul by force raised
   up Xanthippe from his feet, and she running set a new gilded chair for
   Paul to sit down upon.  The great Paul said to her, My daughter
   Xanthippe, do not thus, for ye have not yet accorded to the faith of
   Christ, but wait a little, till the Lord shall set in order what is
   necessary!  Xanthippe said to Paul, Sayest thou this to try me, O
   preacher of God, or hast thou any foreknowledge?  Paul said, No,
   daughter, but the devil, who hates the servants of God, sows wickedness
   in the hearts of his own servants, to oppose those that labour for
   Christ in preaching, for his wickedness has extended to the apostles
   and even to the Lord himself.  Therefore it is fitting to approach the
   unbelievers gently and kindly!  Xanthippe said to Paul, I beseech thee,
   if thou lovest thy servants, make prayer for Probus, and let me see if
   he that is hated by thee can work in him; let me see if he can even
   stand against thy prayer.  And Paul rejoiced exceedingly at the words
   of her faith, and said to her, Believe me, daughter, that by his
   suggestion and working I have not passed a single hour without chains
   and blows.  Xanthippe said to him, But thou sufferest these things by
   thy own free will, since thou hast not neglected thy preaching even to
   scourging, but this again I tell thee, that thy bonds shall be the
   defeat of the prompter, and thy humiliation their overthrow.

   X.  Now the report of his presence ran through the whole city and the
   country round about, for some of that city having been at Rome had seen
   the signs and wonders that were done by the blessed Paul, and came to
   see if this was he.  Many therefore came into the house of Probus, and
   he began to be annoyed and to say, I will not suffer my house to be
   made an inn.  Xanthippe knowing that the face of Probus had begun to be
   estranged, and that he spoke thus, was greatly distressed, saying,
   Alas, wretched me, that we are not thought fully worthy to keep this
   man in our house; for if Paul goes hence, the church also will be held
   elsewhere.  Then Xanthippe, considering these matters, put her hand on
   the foot of Paul, and taking dust she called Probus to her, and placing
   her hand on his breast said, O Lord, my God, who hast sought out me,
   lowly one and ignorant of thee, send what is fitting into this heart.
   And Paul perceived her prayer, and made the sign of the cross, and for
   several days the people entered unhindered, and as many as had sick and
   vexed by unclean spirits brought them, and all were healed.

   XI.  And Xanthippe said to Paul, Teacher, my heart is greatly consumed
   because I have not as yet received baptism.  And after this Probus
   being again moved by the devil, cast Paul out of the house and shut up
   Xanthippe in her chamber.  Then one of the chief men, Philotheus by
   name, besought the great Paul to come into his house, but the great
   Paul was unwilling to do so, saying, Lest Probus trouble thy house on
   my account.  Philotheus said to him, Nay, father, I am not at all
   subject to him, for in no other thing is he greater than me, except in
   rank, and that because the parents of Xanthippe are above me.  But if
   Probus come to me, I am above him in riches and in war.  Then Paul, the
   great apostle of the Lord, was persuaded, and went into the house of
   Philotheus the ex-prefect.  All this was done by the Evil one that
   Xanthippe might receive holy baptism with tribulation, and be
   faint-hearted concerning the commandments of Christ.

   XII.  Xanthippe therefore, with tears, said to her servants, Have ye
   learned where Paul is gone to?  They said, Yea, in the house of
   Philotheus the ex-prefect, and Xanthippe rejoiced greatly that
   Philotheus also believed, being able, as she said, to persuade Probus
   also.  Then Probus called Xanthippe to supper, and when she consented
   not, Probus said, Think not that in bed also thou wilt keep away from
   me.  But when he lay down to supper, Xanthippe bending her knees,
   prayed to the Lord, saying, Eternal and immortal God, that didst take
   dust from the ground, and didst not value it according to the nature of
   its creation, but didst call it the son of immortality, thou who didst
   come from the heart of the father to the heart of the earth for our
   sake, on whom the cherubim dare not fix their gaze, and for us wast
   hidden in the womb that by taking up thy abode in a mother thou
   mightest make good the offence of Eve.  Thou that didst drink gall and
   vinegar, and wast pierced in the side by a spear, that thou mightest
   heal the wound given by the rib to Adam.  For Eve being his rib wrought
   a blow for Adam, and through him for all the world.  Thou that gavest a
   sleep without perception to the serpent, so that he might not know thy
   Incarnation, remember also my groaning and tears, and grant fulfilment
   to my sleep, [3994] and bring sleep upon Probus until I shall be deemed
   worthy of the gift of holy baptism, for I vehemently desire to obtain
   this, to the glory and praise of thy holy name.

   XIII.  But Probus, while still at supper, commanded the doors of their
   house to be secured by cruel and wicked soldiers, and having given
   these orders, he straightway fell asleep upon the couch.  Then the
   servants came and announced this to Xanthippe that he might be
   awakened, but she said, Put out the lights, my children, and leave him
   thus.  And in the first sleep, taking three hundred pieces of gold, she
   went to the doors, saying with herself, Perchance the porter will be
   persuaded by the amount of money.  But he, being evil and froward,
   would not be persuaded to do this, and she, loosing also her girdle,
   which was set with precious stones and worth two hundred pieces of
   gold, gave it to him and went out saying, Lord, I win over my own
   slaves with money, that thy preacher Paul may not be oppressed by
   Probus.  And Xanthippe went on to the house of Philotheus the
   ex-prefect, as to a great and incredible work, running and praising
   God.  As she therefore passed through a certain place, the demons
   pursued her with fiery torches and lightnings, and she, turning, saw
   behind her this terrible sight, and being possessed with great fear
   said, What has happened to thee now, wretched soul?  Thou hast been
   deprived of thy desire.  Thou wast running to salvation, thou wast
   running to baptism, and thou hast fallen into the serpent and his
   ministers, and these things thy sins have prepared for thee.  Speaking
   thus she was even fainting at heart from great despair, but the great
   Paul being forewarned by God of the assault of the demons, immediately
   stood beside her, being also preceded by a beautiful youth.  And
   straightway the vision of the demons disappeared, and Paul said to her,
   Arise, daughter Xanthippe, and behold the Lord desired by thee, by
   whose flame the heavens are shaken and the deep is dried up, coming to
   thee and pitying and saving thee.  Behold him that accepts thy prayers
   and straightway gives ear.  See him coming in the shape of a man, and
   take courage against the demons.  Then she rising from the ground said
   to him, Master, why hast thou left me solitary?  Even now make haste to
   seal me, so that if death come upon me I may depart to him who is full
   of compassion and has no arrogance.

   XIV.  Therefore the great Paul straightway taking her hand, went into
   the house of Philotheus, and baptised her in the name of the Father and
   of the Son and the Holy Ghost.  Then taking bread also he gave her the
   eucharist saying, Let this be to thee for a remission of sins and for a
   renewing of thy soul.  Then the blessed Xanthippe, receiving the divine
   grace of holy baptism, returned to her own house, rejoicing and
   praising the Lord.  The porter seeing her complained loudly in violent
   words, that her going out might be deemed to have been without his will
   if Probus should notice it; but he that gave her light along with Paul
   kept the whole house, together with Probus, in a deep sleep, and they
   did not hear his words at all.  Then she went running into her
   bed-chamber, saying, What shall I say of thee, searcher out of sinners,
   who art most present with us in tribulations.  Thy goodness does these
   things, since for the sake of man whom thou didst make thou didst go
   down even to death, for, however much man stir thee to anger many
   times, yet thou, Lord, pourest out thy mercies upon him.  O depth of
   compassion and wealth of mercy; O immeasurable goodness and
   incomparable kindness; O treasure of good things, and giver of mercy,
   and enricher of all that believe in thee!  If, therefore, one who loves
   thee say, Be near me, Lord, thou hast already anticipated him.  If he
   say, I give thee thanks; hear my words, before they are spoken, thou
   understandest.  And as for those that ask of thee, thou givest to each
   after his asking.  Thy goodness seeks out those that know thee not, and
   thou runnest to sinners.  O cheerful look, filling the ways of sinners
   with mercy; O excellent watching and exhortation of the ignorant!  Who
   shall tell my lord Paul of the salvation that has now befallen me, that
   he might come and give words of thanksgiving for me to this protector
   of sinners?  Come many and behold and know the Lord, who hates sin, but
   has mercy on sinners.  Come, now, O Paul, preacher of God, for with
   thee even now I sit under instruction, and give words of thanksgiving
   for me, for I desire to keep silence, since human reason makes me
   afraid, lest I have not the grace of eloquence.  I desire to keep
   silence, and am compelled to speak, for some one inflames and sweetens
   me within.  If I say, I will shut my mouth, there is some one that
   murmurs in me.  Shall I say a great thing?  Is it not that teacher that
   is in Paul, without arrogance, filling the heavens, speaking within and
   waiting without, sitting on the throne with the father and stretched
   upon the cross by man.  What, therefore, I shall do I know not.  My
   worthless mind delights me, and is not unfolded to the end.  Thou that
   hadst thy hands fixed with nails and thy side pierced with the spear,
   thou star out of Jacob and lion's whelp out of Judah, thou rod out of
   Jesse, and man and God out of Mary, thou invisible God in the bosom of
   the Father, and that canst not be looked upon by cherubim, and art
   mocked in Israel, glory be to thee, who didst appear on the earth and
   wast taken by the people, hung upon the tree and by the report of the
   wicked falsely said to be stolen, and that hast bought us all together.

   XV.  While she was still speaking thus, there appeared a cross on the
   eastern wall, and straightway there entered through it a beautiful
   youth, having round about him trembling rays, and under him an extended
   light, on which also he walked.  And as he entered within, all the
   foundations of that house shook and sounded with a great trembling.
   Xanthippe seeing him cried out and fell to the ground as if dead; but
   he being pitiful and kind, changing immediately into the shape of Paul,
   raised her up, saying, Arise, Xanthippe, and fear not, for the servants
   of God are thus glorified.  Then Xanthippe arising, gazed upon him, and
   thinking it to be Paul said, How art thou come in hither, preacher of
   God, seeing that I have given five hundred pieces of gold to the
   porter, and that although he is my slave, while thou hast no money?
   The Lord said to her, My servant Paul is richer than all wealth, for
   whatsoever treasure he acquires here he sends it before him into the
   kingdom of heaven, that departing thither he may rest in the unending
   and eternal rest.  This is the treasure of Paul, thou and thy like.
   Then Xanthippe gazing upon him, desirous to say something, saw his face
   shining as the light; and being greatly amazed, and putting both her
   hands over her face she threw herself to the ground, and said, Hide
   thyself, Lord, from my bodily eyes and enlighten my understanding, for
   I know now who thou art.  Thou art he whose precursor was the cross,
   the only begotten son of the Father alone above, and only son of the
   Virgin alone below.  Thou art he who was pierced in the hands and who
   rent the rocks.  Thou art he whom none other can carry except the bosom
   of the Father.

   XVI.  And as she spoke thus the Lord was again hidden from her, and
   Xanthippe, coming to herself, said, Woe is me wretched one, that no one
   has told me what is the gratitude of slaves towards their master.  If
   Paul the preacher of the Lord were here, how could he give praise?  But
   perchance in the face of such favors and gifts they are silent,
   possessed only with tears, for it is not possible worthily to praise
   any one according to his favour.  Saying this she was seized with great
   faintness from lack of food, for having been strongly possessed with
   desire for Christ she had forgotten to take nourishment.  Therefore,
   being greatly exhausted by abstinence and the vision and want of sleep
   and other austerities, she was unable to rise from the ground.

   XVII.  And Probus arose from his couch with a very gloomy countenance,
   for in his sleep he had seen a dream, and was greatly troubled
   concerning it.  But the porter seeing him about to issue to the
   market-place, having his countenance thus troubled, was greatly afraid,
   Lest, said he, he know what has happened, and will miserably destroy
   me.  Probus, however, having gone forth and signified to those in the
   market what was fitting for the day and season, speedily returned into
   the house, and said to his servants, Call me quickly the wise men
   Barandus and Gnosteas.  When they were summoned he said to them, I have
   seen a very terrible vision, and what appeared in it is difficult for
   our power to interpret.  This, however, do ye disclose to me, as being
   the most excellent of all the world.  Expound it to me when I tell it
   you.  Barandus says to him, If the vision can be interpreted by our
   wisdom, we shall explain it to thee, but if it be of the faith that is
   now spoken of we cannot expound it to thee, for it is of another wisdom
   and understanding.  However, let our lord and master tell the dream,
   and let us see if there is any explanation for it.  Probus says to
   Gnosteas, Wherefore answerest thou nothing?  Gnosteas said, I have not
   heard the dream, and what can I say but whatever it may be, if it is by
   reason of Paul?  Tell me now, and thou wilt find it so.  Probus said, I
   thought I was standing in a certain unknown and strange country, and
   that there sat there an Ethiop king, who ruled over all the earth and
   seemed never to have any successor.  There stood beside him multitudes
   of servants, and all hastened to destruction and had mastery far and
   wide.  And when that Ethiop seemed to have gained his purpose, there
   arose a raven and standing above him croaked with a pitiful voice.  And
   straightway there arose from the eastern parts an eagle, and seized his
   kingdom, and his power was made vain, and those standing by him fled to
   the eagle.  Then that king strove against those that fled to the eagle,
   but the eagle carried it up into heaven, and, behold, there came a
   helper to those that fled to the eagle and left his staff to them.
   Then they laying hold of it were not overcome by the violence of that
   king.  So many as ran to those who had the staff, he washed them in
   pure water, and they that were washed had power over his kingdom.  And
   by that staff the enemies of the king were put to flight, therefore
   capable men laying hold of the staff turned to themselves great
   multitudes.  And that king strove against them, and had no might at
   all, but he hindered many from believing in him that sent out the men
   into the world to bear witness, and for that reason many were grieved.
   Nevertheless, this one did not constrain any like the other, for he
   himself was ruler of all light.  This then was the end.

   XVIII.  Then the wise Barandus said, By the grace of God I shall tell
   the things sent into the world by the Lord.  The king whom thou sawest
   is the Devil, and the multitudes of his servants are the demons, and
   the throngs about him are they that worship the gods.  Whereas he
   thought to have no successor, he looked not for the coming of Christ.
   The raven betokened the weakness of his kingdom, for the raven kept not
   obedience to the righteous Noah, but loved pitiful things.  The eagle
   that arose and took away his kingdom and carried it up into heaven, and
   that there came a protector of those that fled to the eagle, having a
   staff, that is the Lord Jesus Christ, who left to them his staff, that
   is, his precious cross; and that he washed those that fled to him
   signifies the invulnerable breast-plate of baptism, and therefore they
   were not overcome.  The capable men sent into the world with the cross
   are the preachers of God like Paul who is now with us, against whom
   that king has no power.  This was made known to thee because even on
   those who are hard of belief God has compassion in some way.  See
   therefore whether even thou wilt be able to injure Paul though thou
   desirest, for the mighty power that shields him has been shown thee by
   the Lord.  Therefore, understand what has been said to thee by me, and
   serve not that king of darkness, for as thou sawest his kingdom vanish
   away, so shall all his servants perish with him.  Come now, therefore,
   my Lord, let us go to Paul and receive baptism from him, lest Satan
   have mastery over us also.  Probus said, Let us first go to Xanthippe
   and see whether she still lives, for behold there are twenty-nine days
   since she has tasted anything; for I saw her face in the evening, and
   it was as of one prepared to depart.

   XIX.  And as they went into the chamber, they heard her singing.

   Praise the Lord ye sinners also, because he accepts your prayers also.
   Alleluia.

   Praise the Lord ye that have despaired like me, for many are his
   mercies.  Alleluia.

   Praise him ye ungodly, because for you he was crucified.  Alleluia.

   Praise him ye that strive for the salvation of sinners, because God
   loves you.  Alleluia.

   Praise him, ye that rejoice at the calling of sinners, because ye are
   fellow-citizens with the saints.  Alleluia.

   As she said these words and more than these with tears, the wise men
   Barandus and Gnosteas opening the door entered and fell at her feet,
   saying, Pray for us lowly ones, O servant of Christ, that he may bring
   us also into thy number.  But she said to them, Brethren, I am not Paul
   who remits sins, but neither is he far from you.  Therefore fall not
   before my knees, but go to him, who is also more able to benefit you.
   Then they came running to the house of Philotheus to Paul, and found
   him teaching a great multitude.  And Probus also came to hear Paul, and
   Xanthippe entered along with him to salute him, and coming near to Paul
   and bending her knees she did him reverence.  Probus seeing this
   marvelled that her so proud spirit had changed to so great humility,
   for she sat beside the feet of Paul on the ground humbly and as one of
   the worthless.  And Probus was greatly grieved, not yet attending to
   the hearing of the word, but was ever gazing and fixing his attention
   on Xanthippe.

   XX.  The great Paul was teaching thus, Let those that burn in the flesh
   observe lawful marriage, avoiding fornication, especially that with
   another's wife, and let those that are united keep to one another.
   Probus heard this teaching with delight, and said, O Paul, how
   excellently and wisely thou employest this teaching.  Why then has
   Xanthippe withdrawn from me?  And Paul said, My son Probus, they that
   foresee that the works of men shall be tried with fire, and that have
   always in their mind the inexorableness of death, cast out all desire
   that cleaves to the flesh.  But woe when the desire shall judge him
   that desired, then he shall gnash his teeth to no effect and in vain,
   for the amendment of repentance is past.  Hearing this Probus went up
   into his house marvelling, and tasted nothing that day, but went and
   lay down upon his bed.  And about the third hour of the night he arose
   and said, Alas, how wretched was the day in which I was wedded to
   Xanthippe.  Would that I had died and not seen her.  Saying this he
   arose and said, I shall pray to the God of Paul.  Perchance he will do
   to me also what is fitting, that I may not become a reproach in the
   world, being rejected by her.  And straightway falling upon the ground
   he said, O God of Paul, if, as I have heard from Xanthippe, thou dost
   seek after the ignorant and turn back those that are astray, do to me
   also what is fitting; for thou art the king of life and death, as I
   have heard, and hast dominion over things in heaven and on earth and
   under the earth, and over all the thoughts and desires of men, and to
   thee alone belongs glory to all eternity.  Amen.

   XXI.  Then Probus arising from the ground fell again upon the couch,
   and arising early he came to Paul, and finding him baptising many in
   the name of the life-giving Trinity, he said, My lord Paul, if only I
   were worthy to receive baptism, behold the hour.  Paul said to him,
   Son, behold the water is ready for the cleansing of those that come to
   Christ.  Therefore immediately taking off his garments, and Paul laying
   hold of him, he leapt into the water, saying, Jesus Christ, son of God,
   and everlasting God, let all my sins be taken away by this water.  And
   Paul said, We baptise thee in the name of the Father and Son and Holy
   Ghost.  After this he made him to receive the eucharist of Christ.
   Then Xanthippe, being greatly rejoiced, began in the house toward
   evening together with her husband to give good cheer to all those in
   the house, and to prepare a feast, and when they came, after giving
   orders for the supper to be magnificent she herself went up to the
   chamber.  And behold on the stairs a demon coming in the likeness of
   one of the actors, and standing in a dark corner, was desirous to
   frighten and terrify Xanthippe.  But she thinking it to be the actor
   that she ordinarily had, said in anger, Many a time have I said to him
   that I no longer care for toys, and he despises me as being a woman;
   and straightway seizing an iron lamp-stand, she hurled it at his face,
   and crushed all his features.  Then the demon cried out, saying, O
   violence, from this destroyer even women have received power to strike
   us.  But Xanthippe was greatly afraid.

   XXII.  After supper then Probus went forth to hear the word, but
   Xanthippe sitting in her bed-chamber was reading the prophets, her
   sister Polyxena lying upon the couch.  Xanthippe loved Polyxena
   exceedingly, because she was younger than herself, and beautiful in
   appearance, and Probus also loved her greatly.  And as Polyxena lay
   upon the couch she saw this dream, that a dragon, hideous in
   appearance, came and signified to her to come to him, and when she did
   not obey him to go to him, he came running and swallowed her.  From
   fear of this the girl leapt up trembling, and Xanthippe running to her
   said, What has happened to thee, dearest, that thou hast leapt up thus
   suddenly?  She for a long time was unable to speak; then coming to
   herself she said, Alas, my sister Xanthippe, what danger or tribulation
   awaits me, I know not; for I saw in my dream that a hideous dragon came
   and signed to me to go to him, and, when I would not go, he came
   running and swallowed me, beginning at my feet.  While I was terrified
   at this, there suddenly spoke out of the air, in the light of the sun,
   a beautiful youth, whom I thought to be the brother of Paul, saying,
   Verily, thou hast no power.  Who also took me by the hand and
   straightway drew me out of him, and straightway the dragon
   disappeared.  And behold his hand was full of sweet odour as of balsam
   or aught else for fragrance.  Xanthippe said to her, Truly thou must be
   greatly troubled, my sister Polyxena, but God has thee dear, seeing
   that he has shown thee strange and marvellous things.  Therefore arise
   quickly in the morning and receive the holy baptism, and ask in the
   baptism to be delivered from the snares of the dragon.

   XXIII.  Xanthippe, having said this to Polyxena, and having made a
   cross of wood, went to Paul, but Polyxena remained alone in the
   bed-chamber, her nurse having gone together with Xanthippe.  And about
   the middle of the night, a certain man, powerful in wealth and
   assistance, finding the doors open and using magical arts, entered
   within, desiring to carry away Polyxena.  She discovering this fled
   into the mill, but the magicians led by the demons found her.  And she,
   not finding any door to escape by, said, Alas that I am given over to
   this destroyer; for she had heard that he was at enmity with her
   suitor, and he did this to assail and vex him, being a man who was a
   robber and exceeding cruel.  Therefore seizing her they went out of the
   city, dragging her to the sea.  She looked round this way and that, but
   there was none to deliver her, and groaning she said, Alas, my sister
   Xanthippe, thou didst send seven hundred pieces of gold to Rome and buy
   books, that through them thou mightest prophesy by me; for this evening
   thou didst read, I looked to my right hand and beheld, but there was no
   one that knew me; flight perished from me and there is no one that
   seeketh out my soul. [3995]

   XXIV.  While she said these words, those that were dragging her away
   walked in haste, and coming to the shore they hired a ship and sailed
   for Babylonia, for he that carried her off had a brother there, a ruler
   of a district.  But the wind blew against them, so that they could not
   proceed by reason of it, and as they were rowing on the sea, behold the
   great apostle of the Lord, Peter, was sailing past in a ship, being
   urged by a dream to go to Rome, because when Paul departed for Spain
   there had entered into Rome a certain deceiver and magician, Simon by
   name, and had broken up the church which Paul had established.  And,
   behold, as he journeyed he heard a voice from heaven saying to him,
   Peter, to-morrow there will meet thee a ship coming from Spain; arise,
   therefore, and pray for the soul that is troubled in it.  As soon
   therefore as Peter saw the ship, remembering the dream, he said, O
   Jesus, that hast care for the troubled, whom the tribulation of those
   in a strange land moves to compassion, whom the weeping of those in
   captivity made to come upon the earth, who givest us at all time
   whatsoever we desire, and never turnest away from our request, show now
   also pity and assistance to the soul that is tossed about in that ship,
   because thou, O Lord, pitiest at all time those in pain.  The demons
   then, perceiving his prayer, said to the magicians, Avoid ye the course
   of that ship, for if we meet with it, we cannot move.

   XXV.  But the loving God taking care for Polyxena, the vessel arrived
   in Greece, the blessed Philip being there, and having come down to the
   shore by a vision, and there accompanied him also great multitudes of
   those who were being taught by him.  And behold the vessel wherein was
   Polyxena appeared, terribly tossed about.  And the blessed Philip said,
   Behold the vessel on account of which we came down here, in which there
   is a soul in trouble.  When the vessel arrived and all had disembarked
   upon the dry land, they lay as half dead, because they had been greatly
   tossed about in the sea.  But the apostle Philip ordered Polyxena to be
   lifted and taken to the place where he was lodging, and the rest to be
   looked to.  But he that had carried off Polyxena, recovering from the
   disorder of the sea, was desirous to take her again, for Philip, having
   entrusted Polyxena to one of those that were taught by him, went on his
   way rejoicing.  But he that had her said, She was committed to me by a
   holy man, and I cannot give her up to thee.  He, however, giving no
   heed to him and finding there a kinsman of his, a nobleman, prepared
   for war, gathering eight thousand men.  Polyxena, knowing this, went
   forth by night and departed, but he that had charge of Polyxena said,
   Taking the tunic of Philip, I shall go forth alone to meet them; but as
   he said this it was announced to him that the maid was not there.  Then
   he, leaving all thought of the war, ran into the bed-chamber, and not
   finding the maid threw himself on the ground, saying, Woe is me,
   wretched one, that have become an enemy of Philip.  What shall I answer
   him, when he asks the maiden from me?  His servants came and said to
   him, Arise, our lord, from the ground, for the forces have surrounded
   thy house, and the maid cannot be found.  He said, Leave me thus to die
   on her account.  Perhaps, even by this, Philip the servant of Christ
   may be fully satisfied, since I shall be found despising his command.
   Then the servants, seeing that he heeded them not, took counsel to flee
   from the enemies, but again after a little, being moved by the
   foreknowledge of God, they said, It is not right for our master to
   die.  Come, let us go forth to meet them, raising the sign of the
   cross.  Then raising the precious cross they went forth, about thirty
   men, upon the enemy, and slew five thousand, and the rest fled.  And
   they returned with victory to their master, praising God and saying,
   What God is so great as our God, who has not suffered his servant to be
   slain by the wicked?  And coming upon their lord, still weeping, they
   said to him, Arise, lord, and weep not, for it befits it to be not as
   we will, but as the Lord wills.

   XXVI.  Polyxena, however, going out of the city, and not knowing by
   what way she should walk, found herself in desert places of the hills,
   and sitting down said thus with tears, Woe is me, outcast and captive,
   that I cannot find even a wild beast's den to rest in.  Woe is me, left
   desolate, that not even Hades, that no one escapes, has devoured me.
   Woe is me, who at one time showed myself not even to my servants, and
   now display myself to demons.  Woe is me, that I am now made manifest
   to all those by whom I disdained to be seen.  Alas for me that was
   formerly devoted to idols; for this now even the mercy of God has
   passed me in silence.  Whom, then, shall I call upon to help me?  The
   God of Paul whom I have constantly offended?  But who shall help me
   now?  No one sees or heeds or hears my groaning.  Verily I shall
   beseech Him that sees the hidden things, for who is more pitiful and
   compassionate than He who always keeps watch over the oppressed?  But
   because my mouth is unclean and defiled, I dare not ask help from Him.
   Would that I were as one of the wild beasts that I might not know what
   captivity is.  Would that I had been drowned in the sea; perhaps having
   received the divine baptism I should have gone where no one is made
   captive.  What then shall I do, for death delays, and night has come
   on, and there is no help anywhere.  Having said thus, she arose and
   began to walk onwards, and passing through a small defile she fell into
   a wood very thick and large, and finding there a hollow in a tree,
   which was the den of a lioness, she sat down there, for the lioness had
   gone forth for her food.  And sitting down she said, O wretched
   begetting, O grievous hour in which I, unhappy one, came into this
   world; O mother that bore me, why, foreseeing my troubles and
   wanderings, didst thou name me Polyxena?  Has any other ever fallen
   into such tribulations and misfortunes?  Truly, my sister Xanthippe,
   didst thou read concerning me, unhappy one, saying, I have suffered
   affliction and been utterly bowed down (--Psalm xxxviii. 6).  These
   words thou didst utter with grief, while I lay upon the couch, thinking
   not at all of my sorrows.  On this account I have now come into the
   depths of evils, and pass the night in deserts like a wild beast.  But
   the beasts live with others of their kind, while I am left solitary, as
   not being of one race with mankind.

   XXVII.  And as she was saying these words, and more than these, the
   morning dawned, and the lioness came from her hunting.  Polyxena,
   seeing the wild beast, trembled and said, By the God of Paul, O wild
   beast, have compassion on me and tear me not until I receive baptism.
   And the wild beast, fearing the adjuration, immediately went away, and
   standing afar off gazed at her.  And she said, Behold, the beast has
   obeyed me; I will also retire from its dwelling.  And immediately she
   began to journey towards the east, and the beast went before her until
   she was come out of the wood.  Then Polyxena said, What shall I give to
   thee in return, O beast?  The God of Paul will repay thee this
   kindness; and the wild beast, hearing her prayer, immediately returned
   to its place.  Then she, descending, found a public road, and standing
   on it wept, not knowing whither she should go, and though many went
   past, she turned to none of them, but said, Perchance the God of Paul
   will remember me, and whoever shall have pity upon me, to him will I
   go.

   XXVIII.  As she said this, Andrew, the apostle of the Lord, also came
   journeying to that place, and as he drew near to Polyxena he felt in
   his heart some commotion arising in himself.  Standing, therefore, to
   pray, and folding his arms in the shape of the cross, he said, Lord
   Jesus Christ, partaker of light and knower of things hidden, from whom
   nothing on earth is hid, do unto me kindness and mercy, and make clear
   to me this commotion of heart, and calm my reason, thou that makest
   peace always with those that love peace.  Then Polyxena ran to him, and
   Andrew, the apostle of the Lord, said to her, Approach me not,
   daughter, but tell me who and whence thou art.  Polyxena said, My lord,
   I am a stranger here, but I see thy face is gracious, and thy words as
   the words of Paul, and I suppose thee to be of the same God.  Andrew
   understood that she spoke of the apostle Paul, and said to her, And
   whence dost thou know of Paul?  She said, From my own country, for I
   left him in Spain.  Andrew said to her, And how happenest thou to be
   here, the country being far distant?  She said, Because it was thus
   appointed for me, and came to pass; but I beseech thee and fall at thy
   feet, seal me, as Paul seals, by the baptism of regeneration, so that
   even I, lowly one, may be known by our God, for the kind God, seeing my
   tribulation and distress, sent thee to pity me.  Andrew, the great
   apostle of the Lord, said to her, Let us go, daughter, where there is
   water.

   XXIX.  And when they had gone no long way, they came to a well most
   transparent and pure.  And as the blessed Andrew stood to pray beside
   the well, behold a certain maiden named Rebecca, of the tribe of
   Israel, brought as a captive to that country, came to draw water at the
   well, and seeing the blessed Andrew, knew him by his appearance.  For
   Rebecca said, This is the appearance of a Prophet, and this is one of
   the apostles.  And bowing down to him she said, Have mercy on me,
   servant of the true God, who am captive and sold for the third time,
   who was once honored by prophets, and am now insulted by idolaters, and
   recall me, lowly one, thou that wast sent to call back many sinners.
   Andrew, the apostle of Christ, said, God will care for thee also,
   daughter, as well as for this stranger.  Therefore, receive ye now
   baptism, and be ye as of one people, glorifying God always.

   XXX.  Therefore the apostle standing prayed, and, behold, the lioness
   came running, and stood gazing upon him.  And Andrew the apostle of the
   Lord said, What then does this beast wish?  The lioness opening her
   mouth spoke with a human voice, Andrew, apostle of Christ, the prayer
   of her, that stands on thy right hand, has overtaken me.  Therefore
   confirm thou and instruct and admonish them in the right and true faith
   of Christ, for they greatly desire the name of the Lord.  And, behold,
   the wonderful condescension of God, that even on irrational and
   untamable beasts he has poured out his mercy.  The blessed Andrew
   weeping said, What shall I say or what shall I speak concerning thy
   mercy, O God, that thus thou at all times cleavest to the lowly, and
   takest care for those in ignorance, being without arrogance and full of
   mercy?  And having completed the prayer he baptised the maidens in the
   name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  Then the lioness immediately
   set off to the mountain, and the Apostle Andrew said to the maidens, Be
   zealous, daughters, to be of good repute before God by living well in a
   strange land, and separate not from each other, and God, that is always
   present to those that call upon him, keep you in holiness, driving away
   from you the Evil One.  And pray ye also for me.  Polyxena said, We
   will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.  The Apostle Andrew said,
   This was not made known to me by the Lord, daughters; therefore remain
   with peace, hoping in the Lord, and he will preserve you to the end.

   XXXI.  And Andrew went his way rejoicing and glorifying God.  Then said
   Polyxena, Whither shall we go, sister?  Rebecca said, Let us depart
   whither thou wilt, lest my mistress send and separate us.  Polyxena
   said, Come, let us depart into the mountain to the lioness.  Rebecca
   said, It is indeed better for us to live with wild beasts and perish of
   hunger than to be compelled by Greeks and idolaters to fall into the
   filth of marriage.  So they began to journey, and, behold, by the
   providence of God, they met a man driving asses, who seeing them said,
   Ye are not of this country, and, as I see, ye wear not its dress.
   Command therefore of your servant to eat bread and receive one piece of
   silver that ye may remember your servant when ye buy bread.  And he
   made haste and took the sacks off his asses and spread them on the
   ground, and made the maidens to sit upon them and said to them, Seeing
   that the wine which your servant carries is gathered by Greeks, tell me
   of what faith ye are, that thus we may taste of it.  Polyxena said, We,
   brother, taste no wine, and are of the God of Paul.  The ass-driver
   said. Is this God upon earth?  Polyxena said to him, God is everywhere,
   both in heaven and on earth.  The ass-driver, being desirous to learn
   clearly, said, Does this Paul then have the same God that is preached
   by Philip?  Polyxena, learning that he was a Christian, said, Yea,
   brother, this is the God of all, whom Paul and Philip preach.

   XXXII.  The ass-driver hearing this wept unceasingly, and Polyxena
   said, Has then the providence of God overtaken thee, that thou weepest
   thus?  The ass-driver said, If thou art desirous to learn wherefore I
   weep, hear the truth, for one ought not to grudge to tell the things of
   Christ.  I was a disciple of Philip, the apostle of Christ, and seeing
   how all his thought was towards the poor, I took all that I had and
   sold it.  And taking the price, I bought bread and wine, and divided
   them throughout the cities to those that had need, when therefore I had
   done this for some time in the neighbouring city, a certain maimed
   person cried out, saying (though it was not himself that spoke, but
   Satan through his mouth), I desire nothing, I take nothing from thee,
   because thou art a Christian.  Then the whole city arose against me and
   sought to take me, but some ran one way and some another, while I go
   through their midst and no one sees me.  And issuing from the city I
   gave praise and glory to God that thus I had been rewarded, and I
   prayed to my God that I should meet some one who knew his all-holy
   name, so that relating these things I might obtain relief.  For the men
   of this country will not hear at all concerning Christ, being full of
   impiety and filled with wickedness.  I exhort you therefore, take ye
   also one coin from me, and if it seem good, take ye rest also upon the
   asses.  Polyxena said, Mayest thou obtain mercy from God, brother.  But
   if thou wilt receive a full reward, save us as far as the sea, so that,
   if God wills, we may sail for Spain.

   XXXIII.  The ass-driver, as if commanded by the voice of God, eagerly
   receiving the maidens, went on his way rejoicing in the Lord.  And he
   said to Polyxena, Alter thy appearance to that of a man, lest for thy
   beauty's sake some one snatch thee away from me.  And coming to an inn,
   they stayed there, and on the morrow they went forward taking heed to
   the way.  And behold there came past a certain prefect journeying to
   Greece, who seeing the maidens ordered Polyxena to be carried off on
   his chariot.  Then the ass-driver followed, crying and saying, A
   prefect does violence to none.  Why do ye this?  Then they beat him and
   drove him away.

   XXXIV.  And he going on his way lamented, saying, Woe is me, wretched
   and abominable one.  Woe is me that thought to do good, but now I have
   wrought mischief.  Woe is me that my trouble and my running were
   unacceptable.  Would that I had died before yesterday, that I might not
   have met with these maidens at all.  But why troublest thou me, O
   wretched soul?  Let us go to Philip the apostle of God.  If there is
   not forgiveness for me, it is better for me to choose death in
   whatsoever fashion than to live with such evil and bitter conscience.
   So he went and found Philip the apostle of Christ, and said to him, O
   disciple and preacher of Christ, thus and thus it has happened to me
   and befallen me.  Has my soul salvation?  Philip the apostle of Christ
   said, Be not distressed concerning this, my son, it is impossible for
   them to be dishonoured, seeing that no one ever overcomes God; for this
   same Polyxena, when she first came from the sea, I entrusted to a
   certain brother, who also was greatly distressed because of her running
   away secretly from his house.  Him also I persuaded not to grieve, for
   through her tribulation and wanderings many shall know God.

   XXXV.  The prefect therefore carried Polyxena to the city where he
   stayed, and ordered her to be shut up in a chamber.  And one of the
   soldiers seized Rebecca, but the maid secretly escaping fled into the
   house of an old woman, who received the maiden kindly and entreated her
   well.  And sitting down she wept, saying, Alas, my sister Polyxena, I
   wretched one did not think that anyone was oppressed like myself, but
   now I am persuaded and know that all my misfortunes and tribulations do
   not compare with one day of thine.  And most grievous of all, behold I
   have been separated from thee and am again a captive, but do thou
   search for me even into the next world, my sister Polyxena.  The old
   woman said to her, What ails thee, daughter, that thou weepest thus
   bitterly?  Rebecca said, Suffer me, mother, to be distressed and to
   lament the great and incurable pain of my heart.  The old woman greatly
   compassionating her wept exceedingly, for the maid had told her all
   that had happened to her, and how through Polyxena she had believed in
   Christ.  So too Polyxena, shut up in the chamber, said, Woe is me,
   wretched one; alas for me miserable one; now I know clearly how the
   devil hates virginity, but O Lord Jesus Christ, God of all, since I
   dare not beseech thee of myself, I bring to thee the prayers of thy
   holy preacher Paul, that thou mayst not suffer my virginity to be
   destroyed by any one.

   XXXVI.  And as she was yet praying, the attendants came to lead her to
   the couch of the prefect.  But Polyxena said to them, Brethren, make
   not haste to any one's destruction, for this time shall quickly pass
   away, and they that work together with the destroyers shall perish with
   them.  Rather assist strangers, that ye be not found strangers to the
   angels of God.  The men, being shamed by these words, went to the
   prefect and said, The maid from fear is seized with a violent fever.
   And the prefect said, Let her alone.  And, behold, the son of the
   prefect came to Polyxena by night, and she seeing him was afraid, but
   the youth said to her, Fear not, girl.  I seek not to be wedded with
   thee as the bridegroom of destruction, for I know from thy prayer that
   thou art the bride of the God of heaven.  I know this God who is never
   overcome by any one, for a certain man of glorious countenance lately
   in Antioch preached this God, and a certain maid, whose name was
   Thecla, believing him followed him, and encountered dangers on account
   of her beauty, of whom I have heard that she was condemned to the wild
   beasts.  I therefore continually gazed upon the man, and he having
   observed me said to me, God give heed to thee, my son.  From that time
   therefore by the grace of Christ I have not gone into the sacrifices of
   idols, but sometimes feigning illness and sometimes involving myself in
   some business, my father said to me, Because thou hast no zeal for the
   sacrifices of the gods, therefore neither art thou in health, not being
   worthy of the gods.  But I rejoiced, hearing that I was not worthy of
   the sacrifices to idols; and, by the grace of God, art thou come hither
   as a providence to me.  Polyxena said, And what is the name of that
   man?  The youth said, Paul is his name.  Polyxena said, He is in my
   city.  The youth said, Come then, girl, put on my appearance, and go
   down to the shore and wait me there; I having taken money will come
   quickly.

   XXXVII.  And one of the servants overhearing them told all this to the
   prefect, who being filled with great anger condemned them to be cast to
   the wild beasts.  And when they were cast into the arena, a fierce
   lioness was let loose upon them, which ran and embraced the feet of
   Polyxena, and licked the soles of her feet.  Then the prefect and all
   the city, seeing this fearful and wonderful sight, gave praise and
   glory to the merciful God, saying, Of a truth thou art, and he, that is
   named by Polyxena, alone is God, for the gods of the heathen are the
   works of men's hands, unable to save or assist any one.  Let them
   perish now, both themselves and their makers.  And the prefect
   straightway taking his son and Polyxena into the palace, heard from
   them in order the faith and religion in Christ without omission, and he
   and all in the city believed, and there was great joy and giving of
   glory to God.  And Polyxena said to the prefect, Be of good cheer, my
   lord, for the man of God will quickly come, who will perfectly teach,
   exhort, instruct, and enlighten you in the knowledge of Christ.  She
   however prepared in all haste to depart into Spain.

   XXXVIII.  And as I, Onesimus, was sailing into Spain to Paul, I
   received from the Lord a revelation saying to me, Onesimus, the vessel
   in which thou now art will land in the parts of Greece, and thou wilt
   find on the shore of the harbour two maids and one youth.  Assist them
   and take them to Paul.  When we reached this place according to the
   command of the Lord, we found the maids together with the youth seeking
   a vessel.  When the maids saw us therefore, they knew that we were of
   the hope of Christ, and Polyxena running to us said, Verily the man of
   God cannot be concealed, for the grace and kindliness of his
   countenance makes him manifest.  And when we sought to sail away, the
   sea was troubled by the providence of God.  And there was with us a
   disciple of Paul, by name Lucius, capable in word to teach the city.
   Therefore we remained seven days, and God opened to that place a great
   door of faith, and twenty thousand believed, and there was great joy
   and rejoicing in all the city.  And when the season was favourable for
   us to sail the prefect again constrained us, and we stayed another
   seven days, until all believed and rejoiced in the Lord.

   XXXIX.  Thus now by the foreknowledge of Christ, the prefect sent us
   away with supplies for the voyage, sending also his son with us.  And
   when we had sailed twenty days, Polyxena was greatly exhausted, and we
   touched at a certain island for the sake of rest.  And behold, certain
   fierce and hardened men, coming down to us and seeing Polyxena,
   prepared for battle; but by the grace of Christ our men defended
   Polyxena and vanquished them, although the strangers were more numerous
   and more powerful.  Polyxena therefore fearing again to become a
   captive threw herself into the sea; but the pilot dragged her out,
   having suffered no harm.  Then we embarked in the vessel and fled, for
   the places were rough and wooded, and we were afraid to remain, and in
   twelve days we arrived in Spain, by the grace of God.

   XL.  And Paul seeing us rejoiced greatly, and said, Welcome ye that
   have been troubled.  And Polyxena, laying hold of his feet, said, It
   may be that this trouble came upon me because I would have blasphemed
   thee, but now I beseech and entreat that I may not again be delivered
   into such troubles and misfortunes.  And Paul said, weeping, Thus must
   we be troubled, my daughter, that we may know our defender, Jesus
   Christ.

   XLI.  And while we were giving the letters of the brethren to Paul, one
   ran and told Xanthippe of the arrival of Polyxena.  And she made haste
   and came to us, and seeing Polyxena, was overcome by an unspeakable joy
   and fell to the ground; but Polyxena embracing her and caressing her
   for a long time brought her back to life.  Then Xanthippe said to her,
   I, my true sister Polyxena, went not forth at all for forty days,
   praying much for thee to the loving God, that thy virginity might not
   be taken away.  And Paul, the preacher of God, said to me, Her
   virginity will not be taken away, and she will come quickly.  And
   Probus said to me, It was assigned to her by God to be thus afflicted.
   Seest thou how by many devices God saves many?  But now, my beloved
   sister, having unexpectedly seen thy face, now I shall willingly die.

   XLII.  Then he who had carried her away came up again and sought for
   Polyxena, but the great Paul persuaded him to refrain from her, and he
   also believed and was baptised by Paul, as also the suitor of Polyxena
   believed, and there was great joy in all that city of Spain for the
   recovery of Polyxena.  From that time forward she left not at all the
   blessed Paul in her fear of temptations.  These things then being thus,
   all rejoiced in the Lord, glorifying Father, Son and Holy Ghost, one
   God, to whom is glory and power, now and ever and to all eternity.
   Amen.

   The Narrative of Zosimus.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The Greek text of this work is printed for the first time in the same
   part of "Texts and Studies" as the Acts of Xanthippe and Polyxena.  The
   sources for it are two manuscripts--one in Paris, belonging to the
   twelfth century, and the other in Oxford, dating from the fifteenth or
   sixteenth.  The latter, however, only extends to the close of c. viii.,
   the copy used by the scribe having been imperfect.  There are versions
   of the work in Slavonic, Syriac, Ethiopic, and Arabic; in the former of
   these the Blessed Ones are called the Brachmani.

   From two passages in the poems of Commodian (c. 250 a.d.) it would seem
   that the work was known in his day, and the canon of Nicephoras (c. 850
   a.d.) places it among certain apocryphal books which are to be
   rejected.  At the same time, it is doubtful whether, in its present
   form, it can be put as far back as the earlier of these dates.

   It professes to be the account of a visit to the Makares, or Blessed
   Ones, given by a hermit, Zosimus, who was privileged to visit them.
   For forty years he had abstained from bread and wine and from seeing
   the face of man, always praying to be permitted to see the life of the
   Blessed.  With the second chapter the narrative begins in the first
   person, and is continued in this up to c. xxi., just where the angels
   come to receive the soul of Zosimus, and the work is then finished off
   by one of the hermits who were present at his last moments.

   While the style is inelegant and sometimes obscure, the matter of the
   book is very interesting, and shows considerable powers of
   imagination.  The land of the Blessed is reached by means of a camel,
   which comes from the desert, and then by a storm of wind, which carries
   Zosimus along with it.  He is addressed by the river to which he comes,
   as well as by the wall of cloud which rises above it, and is finally
   lifted across it by two trees.  The origin of the Blessed Ones is
   noteworthy, as connecting the story with early literature on the Lost
   Tribes.  They are the descendants of Rechab in the days of Jeremiah the
   prophet, who, for refusing to give up their observances, are cast into
   prison by the king.  From this they are delivered by an angel, and
   brought to the place they now inhabit,--a level land covered with
   flowers,--a view of Paradise which continues all through the Middle
   Ages.  The chapters (x.-xv.) in which the Blessed describe their life
   and death are of special merit, and form the best part of the whole.
   In striking contrast to its lofty tone is the appearance of Satan with
   his 1360 demons, whom Zosimus finally overcomes and drives away.

   To the various accounts of the Earthly Paradise, the story of Zosimus
   forms an important addition; on these it may, either directly or
   indirectly, have had considerable influence, although the difficulty of
   assigning a definite date to it makes this very uncertain.

   The Narrative of Zosimus Concerning the Life of the Blessed.

   ------------------------

   I.  About that time there was in the desert a certain man named
   Zosimus, who for forty years ate no bread, and drank no wine, and saw
   not the face of man.  This man was entreating God that he might see the
   way of life of the blessed, and behold an angel of the Lord was sent
   saying to him, Zosimus, man of God, behold I am sent by the Most High,
   the God of all, to tell thee that thou shalt journey to the blessed,
   but shalt not dwell with them.  But exalt not thy heart, saying, For
   forty years I have not eaten bread, for the word of God is more than
   bread, and the spirit of God is more than wine.  And as for thy saying,
   I have not seen the face of man, behold the face of the great king is
   nigh thee.  Zosimus said, I know that the Lord can do whatsoever he
   will.  The angel said to him, Know this also, that thou art not worthy
   of one of their delights, but arise and set out.

   II.  And I, Zosimus, issuing from my cave with God leading me, set out
   not knowing which way I went, and after I had travelled forty days my
   spirit grew faint and my body failed, and being exhausted I sat down,
   and continued praying in that place for three days.  And, behold, there
   came a beast from the desert, whose name is the camel, and placing its
   knees on the ground, it received me upon its neck and went into the
   desert and set me down.  There there was much howling of wild beasts,
   and gnashing of teeth, and deadly poison.  And becoming afraid, I
   prayed to the Lord, and there came in that place a great earthquake
   with noise, and a storm of wind blew and lifted me from the earth, and
   exalted me on its wing, and I was praying and journeying till it set me
   upon a place beside a river, and the name of the river is Eumeles.  And
   behold when I desired to cross the river, some one cried as if from the
   water, saying, Zosimus, man of God, thou canst not pass through me, for
   no man can divide my waters:  but look up from the waters to the
   heaven.  And looking up I saw a wall of cloud stretching from the
   waters to the heaven, and the cloud said, Zosimus, man of God, through
   me no bird passes out of this world, nor breath of wind, nor the sun
   itself, nor can the tempter in this world pass through me.

   III.  And I was astonished at these words, and at the voice that spake
   these things to me.  And as I prayed, behold two trees sprang up out of
   the earth, fair and beautiful, laden with fragrant fruits.  And the
   tree on this side bent down and received me on its top, and was lifted
   up exceedingly above the middle of the river, and the other tree met me
   and received me in its branches and bending down set me on the ground;
   and both trees were lifted up and set me away from the river on the
   other side.  In that place I rested three days, and arising again I
   went forward, whither I knew not, and that place was filled with much
   fragrance, and there was no mountain on either hand, but the place was
   level and flowery, all crowned with garlands, and all the land
   beautiful.

   IV.  And I saw there a naked man sitting, and said in myself, Surely
   this is not the tempter.  And I remembered the voice of the cloud that
   it said to me, Not even the tempter in this world passes through me.
   And thus taking courage I said to him, Hail, brother.  And he answering
   said to me, The grace of my God be with thee.  Again I said to him,
   Tell me, man of God, who thou art?  He answered and said to me, Who art
   thou rather?  And I answered and told him all concerning myself, and
   that I had prayed to God and he had brought me into that place.  He
   answered and said to me, I also know that thou art a man of God, for if
   not, thou couldst not have passed through the cloud and the river and
   the air.  For the breadth of the river is about thirty thousand paces,
   and the cloud reaches to heaven, and the depth of the river to the
   abyss.

   V.  And having ended this discourse the man spoke again, Hast thou come
   hither out of the vanity of the world?  I said to him, Wherefore art
   thou naked?  He said, How knowest thou that I am naked?  Thou wearest
   skins of the cattle of the earth, that decay together with thy body,
   but look up to the height of heaven and behold of what nature my
   clothing is.  And looking up into heaven I saw his face as the face of
   an angel, and his clothing as lightning, which passes from the east to
   the west, and I was greatly afraid, thinking that it was the son of
   God, and trembled, falling upon the ground.  And giving me his hand he
   raised me up, saying, Arise, I also am one of the blessed.  Come with
   me, that I may lead thee to the elders.  And laying hold of my hand he
   walked about with me and led me toward a certain crowd, and there were
   in that crowd elders like sons of God, and young men were standing
   beside the elders.  And as I came near to them, they said, This man has
   come hither out of the vanity of the world; come, let us beseech the
   Lord and he will reveal to us this mystery.  Surely the end is not at
   hand, that the man of vanity is come hither?  Then they arose and
   besought the Lord with one accord, and behold two angels came down from
   heaven and said, Fear not the man, for God has sent him, that he may
   remain seven days and learn your ways of life, and then he shall go
   forth and depart to his own place.  The angels of God having said this
   ascended into heaven before our eyes.

   VI.  Then the elders of the blessed gave me over to one of the
   attendants, saying, Keep him for seven days.  So the attendant
   receiving me led me to his cave, and we sat under a tree partaking of
   food.  For from the sixth hour even to the sixth, then we ate, and the
   water came out from the root of the tree sweeter than honey, and we
   drank our fill, and again the water sank down into its place.  And all
   the country of those there heard of me, that there had come thither a
   man out of the vanity of the world, and all the country was stirred up,
   and they came to see me because it seemed strange to them.  Therefore
   they were asking me all things and I was answering them, and I became
   faint in spirit and in body, and besought the man of God that served
   me, and said, I beseech thee, brother, if any come to see me, tell them
   He is not here, so that I may rest a little.  And the man of God cried
   out saying, Woe is me, that the story of Adam is summed up in me, for
   Satan deceived him through Eve, and this man by his flattery desires to
   make me a liar while he is here.  Take me away from hence, for I shall
   flee from the place.  For behold he wishes to sow in me seeds of the
   world of vanity.  And all the multitude and the elders rose up against
   me, and said, Depart from us, man; we know not whence thou art come to
   us.  But I lamented with great lamentation, and my senses left me, and
   I cried out to the elders, saying, Forgive me, my lords, and the elders
   stilled them and made quietness.  Then I related to them all from the
   beginning till that time, and said, I besought the Lord to come to you,
   and he deemed me worthy.  And the elders said, And now what wilt thou
   we should do to thee?  I said to them, I desire to learn of you your
   way of life.

   VII.  And they rejoiced with great joy, and taking up tables of stone
   they wrote on them with their nails, thus, Hear, ye sons of men, hear
   ye us who are become blessed, that we also are of you; for when the
   prophet Jeremiah proclaimed that the city of Jerusalem should be
   delivered into the hands of the destroyers, he rent his garments, and
   put sackcloth upon his loins, and sprinkled dust upon his head, and
   took earth upon his bed, and told all the people to turn from their
   wicked way.  And our father Rechab, the son of Aminadab, heard him and
   said to us, Ye sons and daughters of Rechab, hearken to your father,
   and put off your garments from your body, and drink no vessel of wine,
   and eat no bread from the fire, and drink not strong drink and honey
   until the Lord hear your entreaty.  And we said, All that he has
   commanded us we shall do and hearken.  So we cast away our clothing
   from our bodies, and we ate no bread from the fire, and drank no vessel
   of wine nor honey nor strong drink, and we lamented with a great
   lamentation and besought the Lord, and he heard our prayer and turned
   away his anger from the city of Jerusalem, and there came to the city
   of Jerusalem mercy from the Lord, and he pitied its people, and turned
   away his deadly anger.

   VIII.  And after these things the king of the city of Jerusalem died,
   and there arose another king.  And all the people gathered to him and
   informed him concerning us, and said, There are certain of thy people,
   who have changed their way from us.  Therefore the king summoned them,
   and asked them wherefore they had done this; and he sent for us and
   asked, Who are ye and of what worship and of what country?  And we said
   to him, We are the sons of thy servant, and our father is Rechab the
   son of Jonadab, and when Jeremiah the prophet preached in the days of
   thy father the king, he proclaimed death to the city of Jerusalem,
   saying, Yet three days and all the city shall be put to death.  And the
   king thy father hearing this repented of his sins, and issued a command
   to all to turn aside from their wicked way.  And our father thy servant
   hearing it charged us, saying, Drink no vessel of wine, and eat no
   bread from the fire, until the Lord shall hear your entreaty.  And we
   hearkened to the commandment of our father, and made naked our bodies,
   we drank no wine and ate no bread, and we prayed to the Lord for the
   city of Jerusalem, and the Lord pitied his people and turned away his
   anger, and we saw it and our soul was rejoiced, and we said, It is good
   for us to be so.

   IX.  And the king said to us, Ye have done well.  Now therefore mingle
   with my people, and eat bread and drink wine, and glorify your Lord,
   and ye shall be serving God and the king.  But we said, We will not
   disobey God.  Then the king was enraged and set us in prison, and we
   passed that night there.  And behold a light shone in the building, and
   an angel uncovered the prison and laid hold of the crowns of our heads,
   and took us out of the prison, and set us beside the water of the
   river, and said to us, Whithersoever the water goes, go ye also.  And
   we travelled with the water and with the angel.  When therefore he had
   brought us to this place, the river was dried up and the water was
   swallowed up by the abyss, and he made a wall round this country, and
   there came a wall of cloud, and shadowed above the water; and he did
   not scatter us over all the earth, but gave to us this country.

   X.  Hear, ye sons of men, hear the way of life of the blessed.  For God
   placed us in this land, for we are holy but not immortal.  For the
   earth produces most fragrant fruit, and out of the trunks of the trees
   comes water sweeter than honey, and these are our food and drink.  We
   are also praying night and day, and this is all our occupation.  Hear,
   ye sons of men; with us there is no vine, nor ploughed field, nor works
   of wood or iron, nor have we any house or building, nor fire nor sword,
   nor iron wrought or unwrought, nor silver nor gold, nor air too heavy
   or too keen.  Neither do any of us take to themselves wives, except for
   so long as to beget two children, and after they have produced two
   children they withdraw from each other and continue in chastity, not
   knowing that they were ever in the intercourse of marriage, but being
   in virginity as from the beginning.  And the one child remains for
   marriage, and the other for virginity.

   XI.  And there is no count of time, neither weeks nor months nor years,
   for all our day is one day.  In our caves lie the leaves of trees, and
   this is our couch under the trees.  But we are not naked of body, as ye
   wrongly imagine, for we have the garment of immortality and are not
   ashamed of each other.  At the sixth hour of every day we eat, for the
   fruit of the tree falls of itself at the sixth hour, and we eat and
   drink our fill, and again the water sinks into its place.  We also know
   you who are there in the world, and who are in sins, and your works,
   for every day the angels of the Lord come and tell them to us, and the
   number of your years.  But we pray for you to the Lord, because we also
   are of you and of your race, except that God has chosen us, and has set
   us in this place without sin.  And the angels of God dwell with us
   every day, and tell us all things concerning you, and we rejoice with
   the angels over the works of the just, but over the works of sinners we
   mourn and lament, praying to the Lord that he may cease from his anger
   and spare your offences.

   XII.  But when the time of the forty days comes, all the trees cease
   from their fruits, and the manna that he gave to our fathers rains down
   from heaven, and the manna is sweeter than honey.  Thus we know that
   the season of the year is changed.  But when the time of the holy
   passover comes, then again the trees put forth fragrant fruit, and thus
   we know that it is the beginning of the year.  But the feast of the
   resurrection of the Lord is performed with much watching, for we
   continue watching for three days and three nights.

   XIII.  We know also the time of our end, for we have no torment nor
   disease nor pain in our bodies, nor exhaustion nor weakness, but peace
   and great patience and love.  For our soul is not troubled by the
   angels to go forth, for the angels rejoice when they receive our souls,
   and the souls also rejoice with the angels when they behold them; as a
   bride receives the bridegroom, so our soul receives the announcement of
   the holy angels, saying nothing more than only this, The Lord calls
   thee.  Then the soul quits the body and goes to the angels, and the
   angels seeing the soul coming forth spotless rejoice, and spreading out
   their robes receive it.  Then the angels call it blessed, saying,
   Blessed art then, O soul, because the will of the Lord is fulfilled in
   thee.

   XIV.  The time of our life is this.  If one quits the body in his
   youth, the days of his life here are three hundred and sixty years, and
   he that quits the body in old age, the days of his life here are six
   hundred and eighty-eight years.  And the day of our completion is made
   known to us by the angels, and when the angels of God come to take us,
   we go with them, and the elders, seeing the angels, gather together all
   the people and we depart together with the angels, singing psalms,
   until the angels arrive at the place of our abode.  And because we have
   no tools, the angels of God themselves make the grave for our body, and
   thus he that is called by God goes down, and all salute him from small
   to great, sending him on his way and bidding him farewell.  Then the
   soul quits the body and the angels receive it, but we see the shape of
   the soul as a shape of light, perfect in all the body apart from the
   distinction of male and female.

   XV.  Then the angels taking it up sing a song and hymn, making melody
   to God, and again other troops of angels come in haste to meet them,
   saluting the soul that is coming and entering into the firmaments.  And
   when it has come to the place where it is to worship God, the son of
   God himself, together with the angels, receives the soul of the blessed
   one and bears it to the undefiled father of the ages, and again, when
   the angels sing above, we being below listen to them, and again we sing
   and they listen in heaven above, and thus between us and the angels
   there arises a giving of praise in hymns.  But when the soul of the
   blessed one, falling upon its face, worships the Lord, then we also
   falling down worship the Lord in that same hour, and when the Lord
   raises it up then we also arise; and when it goes to its appointed
   place, we also go into the church, fulfilling the eucharist of the
   Lord.

   Having written these things, and all the life of the blessed, we gave
   them to our brother Zosimus, and escorted him as far as the place of
   trees beside the river Eumeles.

   XVI.  And I, Zosimus, besought again the blessed ones to make entreaty
   for me to the Lord that the trees might receive me to take me across.
   And they all cried to the Lord and said, O God that hast shown us thy
   marvels and hast made thy servant Zosimus to come to us out of the
   world of vanity, set him again in his own place with peace, and command
   these trees to bow down and take up thy servant and set him on the
   further side.  And as they finished their prayer, the trees straightway
   bent down before them, and received me as on the second day before; and
   being set on the other side of the river I cried with a loud voice and
   said, Men of righteousness, who are brothers of the holy angels, grant
   me your prayer in peace, for behold I depart from you.  And making
   prayer they all cried out, saying, Peace, peace be with you, brother.

   XVII.  Then I prayed to the Lord, and there came to me a storm of wind,
   and received me upon its wings, and carried me to the place where it
   found me sitting, and left me there in peace.  And raising its voice
   the wind said to me, Blessed art thou, Zosimus, that thou hast been
   numbered with the blessed.  And the beast from the desert, whose name
   is the camel, came and received me upon its neck and carried me eighty
   and five stations, and set me in the place where it found me praying,
   and left me in peace, crying and saying, Blessed art thou, Zosimus,
   that thou hast been numbered with the blessed.

   XVIII.  But seeing me thus praised, Satan desired to tempt me and throw
   his dart at me from his station, but an angel of God came and said to
   me, Zosimus, behold Satan is coming to tempt thee, but the Lord will
   fight for thee, for the glory of thy faith must bind [3996] Satan.  And
   an angel of God appeared, crying and saying, Welcome, blessed one of
   Christ.  Come and I shall lead thee to the cave that is the
   dwelling-place of thy body, for thy cave shall be a testimony of the
   desert, a healing of the sick that come to it, a place of trial and
   touch-stone of demons.  And laying hold of my hand he strengthened me,
   and led me for forty days to the cave where I had dwelt.  And there was
   there a table of righteousness, and I spent the night with the angels
   of God.  And I placed the tablets that were given me by the holy
   blessed ones on the step of the altar in my cave.

   XIX.  And, behold, when the angels of God ascended, the Devil came,
   having a fierce shape, and possessed with anger and gall, and said to
   me, I knew that God would do with thee as with the blessed ones, and
   that they shall be free from sin and be above the angels, and therefore
   I brought in an evil design, and entered into the vessel of the
   serpent, an evil-doer added to evil-doer.  And by this I made the first
   man Adam to transgress and taste of the tree of life, since God had
   commanded him not to eat of it, that he might remain equal in glory to
   God and the holy angels; and thou again hast gone and brought this
   commandment, but now that they may not be without sin, I shall show
   thee how I shall destroy thee and all those that receive this
   commandment, so that they may not be without sin, and the book that
   thou hast brought.

   XX.  Saying these things the Devil departed from me, and after eight
   days he brought with him one thousand three hundred and sixty demons,
   and dragged me from the cave as I prayed, and they beat me, tossing me
   about between them, for forty days.  And after the forty days the devil
   lamented before me and said, Woe is me that through one man I have lost
   the world, for he has vanquished me by his prayer.  And he began to run
   from me, but I laying hold of him stayed him and said, Thou shalt not
   run away and flee from me until thou swearest to me never again to
   tempt man.  And lamenting with great and violent lamentation he swore
   to me by the firmament of heaven, So long as thy dwelling is here, and
   after thee, I will not come upon this place.  Then I let him go,
   sending him and the demons with him into eternal fire.  Then the angel
   came, who had companied with me at the table, and led me into my cave
   with great glory.

   XXI.  After this I lived thirty-six years, and communicated the way of
   life of the blessed to the fathers in the desert.  But the Devil wept
   because of the tables of the life of the blessed, saying, If this get
   abroad in the world, I shall be mocked, and these will remain without
   sin and I alone in folly.  And after the completion of the thirty-six
   years, the angels of God came to me as to the blessed.

   And all the monks were gathered together and all who heard it, and this
   testament was read to all of them, and in such life he gave up his soul
   to God.

   XXII.  And I, Cryseos, [3997] being one of those in the desert, spread
   it abroad and gave it to all that were willing to learn it and profit
   by it.  Therefore the angels of God helped to bury the body of Zosimus
   as a precious gift, and we saw the soul of the blessed one shining
   seven times brighter than the sun.  And straightway upon that place
   there came up seven palm-trees and overshadowed the cave.  There came
   up also a fountain of water in that place, holy water, and unto this
   day a healing and salvation to all the sick that come to it.  Peace be
   to all that have heard the memorial of the holy Zosimus; the Lord is
   the advocate and helper of all to the endless ages of ages.  Amen.

   Introductory Notice to 1st Clement.

   ------------------------

   [From Vol. I. of the Ante-Nicene Fathers.]

   The first Epistle, bearing the name of Clement, has been preserved to
   us in a single manuscript only.  Though very frequently referred to by
   ancient Christian writers, it remained unknown to the scholars of
   Western Europe until happily discovered in the Alexandrian manuscript.
   This ms. of the sacred Scriptures (known and generally referred to as
   Codex A) was presented in 1628 by Cyril, Patriarch of Constantinople,
   to Charles I., and is now preserved in the British Museum.  Subjoined
   to the books of the New Testament contained in it, there are two
   writings described as the Epistles of one Clement.  Of these, that now
   before us is the first.  It is tolerably perfect, but there are many
   slight lacunæ, or gaps, in the ms., and one whole leaf is supposed to
   have been lost towards the close.  These lacunæ, however, so numerous
   in some chapters, do not generally extend beyond a word or syllable,
   and can for the most part be easily supplied.

   Who the Clement was to whom these writings are ascribed, cannot with
   absolute certainty be determined.  The general opinion is, that he is
   the same as the person of that name referred to by St. Paul (Phil. iv.
   3).  The writings themselves contain no statement as to their author.
   The first, and by far the longer of them, simply purports to have been
   written in the name of the church at Rome to the church at Corinth.
   But in the catalogue of contents prefixed to the ms. they are both
   plainly attributed to one Clement; and the judgment of most scholars
   is, that, in regard to the first epistle at least, this statement is
   correct, and that it is to be regarded as an authentic production of
   the friend and fellow worker of St. Paul.  This belief may be traced to
   an early period in the history of the church.  It is found in the
   writings of Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 15), of Origen (Comm. in Joan.,
   i. 29), and others.  The internal evidence also tends to support this
   opinion.  The doctrine, style, and manner of thought are all in
   accordance with it; so that, although, as has been said, positive
   certainty cannot be reached on the subject, we may with great
   probability conclude that we have in this epistle a composition of that
   Clement who is known to us from Scripture as having been an associate
   of the great apostle.

   The date of this epistle has been the subject of considerable
   controversy.  It is clear from the writing itself that it was composed
   soon after some persecution (chap. i.) which the Roman church had
   endured; and the only question is, whether we are to fix upon the
   persecution under Nero or Domitian.  If the former, the date will be
   about the year 68; if the latter, we must place it towards the close of
   the first century or the beginning of the second.  We possess no
   external aid to the settlement of this question.  The lists of early
   Roman bishops are in hopeless confusion, some making Clement the
   immediate successor of St. Peter, others placing Linus, and others
   still Linus and Anacletus, between him and the apostle.  The internal
   evidence, again, leaves the matter doubtful, though it has been
   strongly pressed on both sides.  The probability seems, on the whole,
   to be in favour of the Domitian period, so that the epistle may be
   dated about a.d. 97.

   This epistle was held in very great esteem by the early church.  The
   account given of it by Eusebius (Hist. Eccl., iii. 16) is as follows:
   "There is one acknowledged epistle of this Clement (whom he has just
   identified with the friend of St. Paul), great and admirable, which he
   wrote in the name of the church of Rome to the church at Corinth,
   sedition having then arisen in the latter church.  We are aware that
   this epistle has been publicly read in very many churches, both in old
   times and also in our own day."  The epistle before us thus appears to
   have been read in numerous churches, as being almost on a level with
   the canonical writings.  And its place in the Alexandrian ms.,
   immediately after the inspired books, is in harmony with the position
   thus assigned it in the primitive church.  There does indeed appear a
   great difference between it and the inspired writings in many respects,
   such as the fanciful use sometimes made of Old Testament statements,
   the fabulous stories which are accepted by its author, and the general
   diffuseness and feebleness of style by which it is distinguished.  But
   the high tone of evangelical truth which pervades it, the simple and
   earnest appeals which it makes to the heart and conscience, and the
   anxiety which its writer so constantly shows to promote the best
   interests of the church of Christ, still impart an undying charm to
   this precious relic of later apostolic times.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Additional Introduction.

   Towards the close of 1875, at Constantinople, Philotheus Bryennius,
   Metropolitan of Serræ, published the first complete edition of the
   epistles ascribed to Clement.  This he was enabled to do by the
   discovery of a ms. in the library of the Holy Sepulchre at Fanari in
   Constantinople.  This ms., of vellum, consists of one hundred and
   twenty leaves in small octavo, nearly seven and a half inches in length
   and six in breadth.  The ms. bears the date 1056, and was written by
   one Leo.  Its contents are:

   1.  Chrysostom's Synopsis of the Old Testament (the New also being
   included in the title).

   2.  Epistle of Barnabas.

   3.  Clement to the Corinthians I.

   4.  Clement to the Corinthians II.

   5.  Teaching of the Twelve Apostles.

   6.  Ignatian Epistles.

   The ms. is written with comparative accuracy and clearness.  Internal
   evidence seems to establish its independent value; e.g., words
   carelessly omitted in the Codex Alexandrinus are found in this ms.  It
   also supplies the lacunæ, notably chapters 57 (concluding sentence)--63
   inclusive of the first Epistle and chapters 12 (concluding
   sentences)--20, being the close of the second Epistle.  Harnack seems
   to prove that the new ms. is as complete as the original Alexandrian.

   The lacuna of the first Epistle consists mainly of a prayer, the writer
   somewhat abruptly passing from the oratio obliqua to the oratio recta.
   The prayer is indicative of intense earnestness and emotion rather than
   official authority.  It is marked by wealth of quotation, especially
   from the Septuagint.  Perhaps, too, the nature of the sufferings
   referred to in the opening chapters may be inferred from the petitions
   of this prayer.

   In the Notes the old ms. is indicated by A, the recently discovered ms.
   by I.

   The First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians. [3998]

   ------------------------

   Chapter I.--The Salutation.  Praise of the Corinthians Before the
   Breaking Forth of Schism Among Them.

   The church of God which sojourns at Rome, to the church of God
   sojourning at Corinth, to them that are called and sanctified by the
   will of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ:  Grace unto you, and peace,
   from Almighty God through Jesus Christ, be multiplied.

   Owing, dear brethren, to the sudden and successive calamitous events
   [3999] which have happened to ourselves, we feel that we have been
   somewhat tardy in turning our attention to the points respecting which
   you consulted us; and especially to that shameful and detestable
   sedition, utterly abhorrent to the elect of God, which a few rash and
   self-confident persons have kindled to such a pitch of frenzy, that
   your venerable and illustrious name, worthy to be universally loved,
   has suffered grievous injury. [4000]   For who ever dwelt even for a
   short time among you, and did not find your faith to be as fruitful of
   virtue as it was firmly established? [4001]   Who did not admire the
   sobriety and moderation of your godliness in Christ?  Who did not
   proclaim the magnificence of your habitual hospitality?  And who did
   not rejoice over your perfect and well-grounded knowledge?  For ye did
   all things without respect of persons, and walked in the commandments
   of God, being obedient to those who had the rule over you, and giving
   all fitting honour to the presbyters among you.  Ye enjoined young men
   to be of a sober and serious mind, ye instructed your wives to do all
   things with a blameless, becoming, and pure conscience, loving their
   husbands as in duty bound; and ye taught them that, living in the rule
   of obedience, they should manage their household affairs becomingly,
   and be in every respect marked by discretion.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [3998] According to I, the title is "Clement's (Epistle) to the
   Corinthians."  A includes in a Table of Contents of the New Testament
   after the Apocalypse: "Clement's Epistle I." "Clement's Epistle II."
   The space for the title for the 1st Epistle is mutilated, and we find
   only "....Corinthians I.;" the 2d Epistle has no title. On the
   authority of Eusebius, Jerome, Georgius Syncellus, the earlier editions
   give the titles, "First Epistle of Saint Clement, Bishop of Rome, to
   the Corinthians, written in name of the Church of Rome," "Second
   Epistle of Saint Clement, Bishop of Rome, to the Corinthians."

   [3999] I, peristaseis (critical experiences).

   [4000] Literally "is greatly blasphemed."

   [4001] Literally, "did not prove your all-virtuous and firm faith."

   Chapter II.--Praise of the Corinthians Continued.

   Moreover, ye were all distinguished by humility, and were in no respect
   puffed up with pride, but yielded obedience rather than extorted it,
   [4002] and were more willing to give than to receive. [4003]   Content
   with the provision which God [4004] had made for you, and carefully
   attending to His words, ye were inwardly filled [4005] with His
   doctrine, and His sufferings were before your eyes.  Thus a profound
   and abundant peace was given to you all, and ye had an insatiable
   desire for doing good, while a full outpouring of the Holy Spirit was
   upon you all.  Full of holy designs, ye did, with true earnestness of
   mind and a godly confidence, stretch forth your hands to God Almighty,
   beseeching Him to be merciful unto you, if ye had been guilty of any
   involuntary transgression.  Day and night ye were anxious for the whole
   brotherhood, [4006] that the number of God's elect might be saved with
   mercy [4007] and a good conscience. [4008]   Ye were sincere and
   uncorrupted, and forgetful of injuries between one another.  Every kind
   of faction and schism was abominable in your sight.  Ye mourned over
   the transgressions of your neighbours:  their deficiencies you deemed
   your own.  Ye never grudged any act of kindness, being "ready to every
   good work." [4009]   Adorned by a thoroughly virtuous and religious
   life, ye did all things in the fear of God.  The commandments and
   ordinances of the Lord were written upon the tablets of your hearts.

   Chapter III.--The Sad State of the Corinthian Church After Sedition
   Arose in It from Envy and Emulation.

   Every kind of honour and happiness [4011] was bestowed upon you, and
   then was fulfilled that which is written, "My beloved did eat and
   drink, and was enlarged and became fat, and kicked." [4012]   Hence
   flowed emulation and envy, strife and sedition, persecution and
   disorder, war and captivity.  So the worthless rose up against the
   honoured, those of no reputation against such as were renowned, the
   foolish against the wise, the young against those advanced in years.
   For this reason righteousness and peace are now far departed from you,
   inasmuch as every one abandons the fear of God, and is become blind in
   His faith, [4013] neither walks in the ordinances of His appointment,
   nor acts a part becoming a Christian, [4014] but walks after his own
   wicked lusts, resuming the practice of an unrighteous and ungodly envy,
   by which death itself entered into the world. [4015]

   Chapter IV.--Many Evils Have Already Flowed from This Source in Ancient
   Times.

   For thus it is written:  "And it came to pass after certain days, that
   Cain brought of the fruits of the earth a sacrifice unto God; and Abel
   also brought of the firstlings of his sheep, and of the fat thereof.
   And God had respect to Abel and to his offerings, but Cain and his
   sacrifices He did not regard.  And Cain was deeply grieved, and his
   countenance fell.  And God said to Cain, Why art thou grieved, and why
   is thy countenance fallen?  If thou offerest rightly, but dost not
   divide rightly, hast thou not sinned?  Be at peace:  thine offering
   returns to thyself, and thou shalt again possess it.  And Cain said to
   Abel his brother, Let us go into the field.  And it came to pass, while
   they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and
   slew him." [4016]   Ye see, brethren, how envy and jealousy led to the
   murder of a brother.  Through envy, also, our father Jacob fled from
   the face of Esau his brother. [4017]   Envy made Joseph be persecuted
   unto death, and to come into bondage. [4018]   Envy compelled Moses to
   flee from the face of Pharaoh king of Egypt, when he heard these words
   from his fellow-countryman, "Who made thee a judge or a ruler over us?
   Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday?" [4019]
   On account of envy, Aaron and Miriam had to make their abode without
   the camp. [4020]   Envy brought down Dathan and Abiram alive to Hades,
   through the sedition which they excited against God's servant Moses.
   [4021]   Through envy, David not only underwent the hatred of
   foreigners, but was also persecuted by Saul king of Israel. [4022]

   [4016] Gen. iv. 3-8.  The writer here, as always, follows the reading

   Chapter V.--No Less Evils Have Arisen from the Same Source in the Most
   Recent Times.  The Martyrdom of Peter and Paul.

   But not to dwell upon ancient examples, let us come to the most recent
   spiritual heroes. [4023]   Let us take the noble examples furnished in
   our own generation.  Through envy [4024] and jealousy the greatest and
   most righteous pillars [of the church] have been persecuted and put to
   death. [4025]   Let us set before our eyes the illustrious [4026]
   apostles.  Peter, through unrighteous envy, endured not one or two, but
   numerous labours; and when he had at length suffered martyrdom,
   departed to the place of glory due to him.  Owing to envy, Paul also
   obtained [4027] the reward of patient endurance, after being seven
   times thrown into captivity, [4028] compelled [4029] to flee, and
   stoned.  After preaching both in the east and west, he gained the
   illustrious reputation due to his faith, having taught righteousness
   [4030] to the whole world, and come to the extreme limit of the west,
   [4031] and suffered martyrdom under the prefects. [4032]   Thus was he
   removed from the world, and went into the holy place, having proved
   himself a striking example of patience.

   Chapter VI.--Continuation.  Several Other Martyrs.

   To these men who spent their lives in the practice of holiness, there
   is to be added a great multitude of the elect, who, having through envy
   endured many indignities and tortures, furnished us with a most
   excellent example.  Through envy, those women, the Danaids [4033] and
   Dircæ, being persecuted, after they had suffered terrible and
   unspeakable torments, finished the course of their faith with
   stedfastness, [4034] and though weak in body, received a noble reward.
   Envy has alienated wives from their husbands, and changed that saying
   of our father Adam, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
   flesh." [4035]   Envy and strife have overthrown [4036] great cities,
   and rooted up mighty nations.

   Chapter VII.--An Exhortation to Repentance.

   These things, beloved, we write unto you, not merely to admonish you of
   your duty, but also to remind ourselves.  For we are struggling on the
   same arena, and the same conflict is assigned to both of us.  Wherefore
   let us give up vain and fruitless cares, and approach to the glorious
   and venerable rule of our holy calling. [4037]   Let us attend to what
   is good, pleasing, and acceptable in the sight of Him who formed us.
   Let us look stedfastly to the blood of Christ, and see how precious
   that blood is to God [4038] which, having been shed for our salvation,
   has set the grace of repentance before the whole world. [4039]   Let us
   turn to [4040] every age that has passed, and learn that, from
   generation to generation, the Lord has granted a place of repentance to
   all such as would be converted unto Him.  Noah preached repentance, and
   as many as listened to him were saved. [4041]   Jonah proclaimed
   destruction to the Ninevites; [4042] but they, repenting of their sins,
   propitiated God by prayer, and obtained salvation, although they were
   aliens [to the covenant] of God.

   Chapter VIII.--Continuation Respecting Repentance.

   The ministers of the grace of God have, by the Holy Spirit, spoken of
   repentance; and the Lord of all things has himself declared with an
   oath regarding it, "As I live, saith the Lord, I desire not the death
   of the sinner, but rather his repentance;" [4043] adding, moreover,
   this gracious declaration, "Repent, O house of Israel, of your
   iniquity." [4044]   Say to the children of my people, Though your sins
   reach from earth to heaven, and though they be redder [4045] than
   scarlet, and blacker than sack-cloth, yet if ye turn to me with your
   whole heart, and say, Father! I will listen to you, as to a holy [4046]
   people.  And in another place He speaks thus:  "Wash you and become
   clean; put away the wickedness of your souls from before mine eyes;
   cease from your evil ways, and learn to do well; seek out judgment,
   deliver the oppressed, judge the fatherless, and see that justice is
   done to the widow; and come, and let us reason together.  He declares,
   Though your sins be like crimson, I will make them white as snow;
   though they be like scarlet, I will whiten them like wool.  And if ye
   be willing and obey me, ye shall eat the good of the land; but if ye
   refuse, and will not hearken unto me, the sword shall devour you, for
   the mouth of the Lord hath spoken these things." [4047]   Desiring,
   therefore, that all His beloved should be partakers of repentance, He
   has, by His almighty will, established [these declarations].

   Wherefore, let us yield obedience to His excellent and glorious will;
   and imploring His mercy and loving-kindness, while we forsake all
   fruitless labours [4048] and strife, and envy, which leads to death,
   let us turn and have recourse to His compassions.  Let us stedfastly
   contemplate those who have perfectly ministered to his excellent
   glory.  Let us take (for instance) Enoch, who, being found righteous in
   obedience, was translated, and death was never known to happen to him.
   [4049]   Noah, being found faithful, preached regeneration to the world
   through his ministry; and the Lord saved by him the animals which, with
   one accord, entered into the ark.

   Chapter X.--Continuation of the Above.

   Abraham, styled "the friend," [4050] was found faithful, inasmuch as he
   rendered obedience to the words of God.  He, in the exercise of
   obedience, went out from his own country, and from his kindred, and
   from his father's house, in order that, by forsaking a small territory,
   and a weak family, and an insignificant house, he might inherit the
   promises of God.  For God said to him, "Get thee out from thy country,
   and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, into the land which
   I shall show thee.  And I will make thee a great nation, and will bless
   thee, and make thy name great, and thou shalt be blessed.  And I will
   bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee
   shall all the families of the earth be blessed." [4051]   And again, on
   his departing from Lot, God said to him, "Lift up thine eyes, and look
   from the place where thou now art, northward, and southward, and
   eastward, and westward; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will
   I give it, and to thy seed for ever.  And I will make thy seed as the
   dust of the earth, [so that] if a man can number the dust of the earth,
   then shall thy seed also be numbered." [4052]   And again [the
   Scripture] saith, "God brought forth Abram, and spake unto him, Look up
   now to heaven, and count the stars if thou be able to number them; so
   shall thy seed be.  And Abram believed God, and it was counted to him
   for righteousness." [4053]   On account of his faith and hospitality, a
   son was given him in his old age; and in the exercise of obedience, he
   offered him as a sacrifice to God on one of the mountains which He
   showed him. [4054]

   On account of his hospitality and godliness, Lot was saved out of Sodom
   when all the country round was punished by means of fire and brimstone,
   the Lord thus making it manifest that He does not forsake those that
   hope in Him, but gives up such as depart from Him to punishment and
   torture. [4055]   For Lot's wife, who went forth with him, being of a
   different mind from himself, and not continuing in agreement with him
   [as to the command which had been given them], was made an example of,
   so as to be a pillar of salt unto this day. [4056]   This was done that
   all might know that those who are of a double mind, and who distrust
   the power of God, bring down judgment on themselves [4057] and become a
   sign to all succeeding generations.

   Chapter XII.--The Rewards of Faith and Hospitality.  Rahab.

   On account of her faith and hospitality, Rahab the harlot was saved.
   For when spies were sent by Joshua, the son of Nun, to Jericho, the
   king of the country ascertained that they were come to spy out their
   land, and sent men to seize them, in order that, when taken, they might
   be put to death.  But the hospitable Rahab receiving them, concealed
   them on the roof of her house under some stalks of flax.  And when the
   men sent by the king arrived and said, "There came men unto thee who
   are to spy out our land; bring them forth, for so the king commands,"
   she answered them, "The two men whom ye seek came unto me, but quickly
   departed again and are gone," thus not discovering the spies to them.
   Then she said to the men, "I know assuredly that the Lord your God hath
   given you this city, for the fear and dread of you have fallen on its
   inhabitants.  When therefore ye shall have taken it, keep ye me and the
   house of my father in safety."  And they said to her, "It shall be as
   thou hast spoken to us.  As soon, therefore, as thou knowest that we
   are at hand, thou shalt gather all thy family under thy roof, and they
   shall be preserved, but all that are found outside of thy dwelling
   shall perish." [4058]   Moreover, they gave her a sign to this effect,
   that she should hang forth from her house a scarlet thread.  And thus
   they made it manifest that redemption should flow through the blood of
   the Lord to all them that believe and hope in God. [4059]   Ye see,
   beloved, that there was not only faith, but prophecy, in this woman.

   Chapter XIII.--An Exhortation to Humility.

   Let us therefore, brethren, be of humble mind, laying aside all
   haughtiness, and pride, and foolishness, and angry feelings; and let us
   act according to that which is written (for the Holy Spirit saith, "Let
   not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory
   in his might, neither let the rich man glory in his riches; but let him
   that glorieth glory in the Lord, in diligently seeking Him, and doing
   judgment and righteousness" [4060] ), being especially mindful of the
   words of the Lord Jesus which He spake teaching us meekness and
   long-suffering.  For thus He spoke:  "Be ye merciful, that ye may
   obtain mercy; forgive, that it may be forgiven to you; as ye do, so
   shall it be done unto you; as ye judge, so shall ye be judged; as ye
   are kind, so shall kindness be shown to you; with what measure ye mete,
   with the same it shall be measured to you." [4061]   By this precept
   and by these rules let us stablish ourselves, that we walk with all
   humility in obedience to His holy words.  For the holy word saith, "On
   whom shall I look, but on him that is meek and peaceable, and that
   trembleth at my words?" [4062]

   Chapter XIV.--We Should Obey God Rather Than the Authors of Sedition.

   It is right and holy therefore, men and brethren, rather to obey God
   than to follow those who, through pride and sedition, have become the
   leaders of a detestable emulation.  For we shall incur no slight
   injury, but rather great danger, if we rashly yield ourselves to the
   inclinations of men who aim at exciting strife and tumults, [4063] so
   as to draw us away from what is good.  Let us be kind one to another
   after the pattern of the tender mercy and benignity of our Creator.
   For it is written, "The kind-hearted shall inhabit the land, and the
   guiltless shall be left upon it, but transgressors shall be destroyed
   from off the face of it." [4064]   And again [the Scripture] saith, "I
   saw the ungodly highly exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of
   Lebanon:  I passed by, and, behold, he was not; and I diligently sought
   his place, and could not find it.  Preserve innocence, and look on
   equity:  for there shall be a remnant to the peaceable man." [4065]

   Let us cleave, therefore, to those who cultivate peace with godliness,
   and not to those who hypocritically profess to desire it.  For [the
   Scripture] saith in a certain place, "This people honoureth me with
   their lips, but their heart is far from me." [4066]   And again:  "They
   bless with their mouth, but curse with their heart." [4067]   And again
   it saith, "They loved Him with their month, and lied [4068] to Him with
   their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, neither were they
   faithful in His covenant." [4069]   "Let the deceitful lips become
   silent, [4070] [and "let the Lord destroy all the lying lips, [4071] ]
   and the boastful tongue of those who have said, Let us magnify our
   tongue:  our lips are our own; who is lord over us?  For the oppression
   of the poor, and for the sighing of the needy, will I now arise, saith
   the Lord:  I will place him in safety; I will deal confidently with
   him." [4072]

   Chapter XVI.--Christ as an Example of Humility.

   For Christ is of those who are humble-minded, and not of those who
   exalt themselves over His flock.  Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Sceptre of
   the majesty of God, did not come in the pomp of pride or arrogance,
   although He might have done so, but in a lowly condition, as the Holy
   Spirit had declared regarding Him.  For He says, "Lord, who hath
   believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?  We
   have declared [our message] in His presence:  He is, as it were, a
   child, and like a root in thirsty ground; He has no form nor glory,
   yea, we saw Him, and He had no form nor comeliness; but His form was
   without eminence, yea, deficient in comparison with the [ordinary] form
   of men.  He is a man exposed to stripes and suffering, and acquainted
   with the endurance of grief:  for His countenance was turned away; He
   was despised, and not esteemed.  He bears our iniquities, and is in
   sorrow for our sakes; yet we supposed that [on His own account] He was
   exposed to labour, and stripes, and affliction.  But He was wounded for
   our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities.  The chastisement
   of our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we were healed.  All we,
   like sheep, have gone astray; [every] man has wandered in his own way;
   and the Lord has delivered Him up for our sins, while He in the midst
   of His sufferings openeth not His mouth.  He was brought as a sheep to
   the slaughter, and as a lamb before her shearer is dumb, so He openeth
   not His mouth.  In His humiliation His judgment was taken away; who
   shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth.
   For the transgressions of my people was He brought down to death.  And
   I will give the wicked for His sepulchre, and the rich for His death,
   [4073] because He did no iniquity, neither was guile found in His
   mouth.  And the Lord is pleased to purify him by stripes. [4074]   If
   ye make [4075] an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived
   seed.  And the Lord is pleased to relieve Him of the affliction of His
   soul, to show Him light, and to form Him with understanding, [4076] to
   justify the Just One who ministereth well to many; and He Himself shall
   carry their sins.  On this account He shall inherit many, and shall
   divide the spoil of the strong; because His soul was delivered to
   death, and He was reckoned among the transgressors, and He bare the
   sins of many, and for their sins was He delivered." [4077]   And again
   He saith, "I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of
   the people.  All that see me have derided me; they have spoken with
   their lips; they have wagged their head, [saying] He hoped in God, let
   Him deliver Him, let Him save Him, since He delighteth in Him." [4078]
     Ye see, beloved, what is the example which has been given us; for if
   the Lord thus humbled Himself, what shall we do who have through Him
   come under the yoke of His grace?
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4073] The Latin of Cotelerius, adopted by Hefele and Dressel,
   translates this clause as follows:  "I will set free the wicked on
   account of His sepulchre, and the rich on account of His death."

   [4074] The reading of the ms., is tes pleges, "purify, or free Him,
   from stripes."  We have adopted the emendation of Junius.

   Let us be imitators also of those who in goat-skins and sheep-skins
   [4079] went about proclaiming the coming of Christ; I mean Elijah,
   Elisha, and Ezekiel among the prophets, with those others to whom a
   like testimony is borne [in Scripture].  Abraham was specially
   honoured, and was called the friend of God; yet he, earnestly regarding
   the glory of God, humbly declared, "I am but dust and ashes." [4080]
   Moreover, it is thus written of Job, "Job was a righteous man, and
   blameless, truthful, God-fearing, and one that kept himself from all
   evil." [4081]   But bringing an accusation against himself, he said,
   "No man is free from defilement, even if his life be but of one day."
   [4082]   Moses was called faithful in all God's house; [4083] and
   through his instrumentality, [4084] God punished Egypt with plagues and
   tortures.  Yet he, though thus greatly honoured, did not adopt lofty
   language, but said, when the divine oracle came to him out of the bush,
   "Who am I, that Thou sendest me?  I am a man of a feeble voice and a
   slow tongue." [4085]   And again he said, "I am but as the smoke of a
   pot." [4086]

   But what shall we say concerning David, to whom such testimony was
   borne, and of whom [4087] God said, "I have found a man after mine own
   heart, David the son of Jesse; and in everlasting mercy have I anointed
   him?" [4088]   Yet this very man saith to God, "Have mercy on me, O
   Lord, according to Thy great mercy; and according to the multitude of
   Thy compassions, blot out my transgression. [4089]   Wash me still more
   from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.  For I acknowledge mine
   iniquity, and my sin is ever before me.  Against Thee only have I
   sinned, and done that which is evil in Thy sight; that Thou mayest be
   justified in Thy sayings, and mayest overcome when Thou [4090] art
   judged.  For, behold, I was conceived in transgressions, and in sins
   did my mother conceive me.  For, behold, Thou hast loved truth; the
   secret and hidden things of wisdom hast Thou shown me.  Thou shalt
   sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed; Thou shalt wash me,
   and I shall be whiter than snow.  Thou shalt make me to hear joy and
   gladness; my bones, which have been humbled, shall exult.  Turn away
   Thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.  Create in me
   a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. [4091]   Cast
   me not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
   Restore to me the joy of Thy salvation, and establish me by Thy
   governing Spirit.  I will teach transgressors Thy ways, and the ungodly
   shall be converted unto Thee.  Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, [4092]
   O God, the God of my salvation:  my tongue shall exult in Thy
   righteousness.  O Lord, Thou shalt open my mouth, and my lips shall
   show forth Thy praise.  For if Thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would
   have given it; Thou wilt not delight in burnt-offerings.  The sacrifice
   [acceptable] to God is a bruised spirit; a broken and a contrite heart
   God will not despise." [4093]

   Chapter XIX.--Imitating These Examples, Let Us Seek After Peace.

   Thus the humility and godly submission of so great and illustrious men
   have rendered not only us, but also all the generations before us,
   better; even as many as have received His oracles in fear and truth.
   Wherefore, having so many great and glorious examples set before us,
   let us turn again to the practice of that peace which from the
   beginning was the mark set before us; [4094] and let us look stedfastly
   to the Father and Creator of the universe, and cleave to His mighty and
   surpassingly great gifts and benefactions of peace.  Let us contemplate
   Him with our understanding, and look with the eyes of our soul to His
   long-suffering will.  Let us reflect how free from the wrath He is
   towards all His creation.

   Chapter XX.--The Peace and Harmony of the Universe.

   The heavens, revolving under His government, are subject to Him in
   peace.  Day and night run the course appointed by Him, in no wise
   hindering each other.  The sun and moon, with the companies of the
   stars, roll on in harmony according to His command, within their
   prescribed limits, and without any deviation.  The fruitful earth,
   according to His will, brings forth food in abundance, at the proper
   seasons, for man and beast and all the living beings upon it, never
   hesitating, nor changing any of the ordinances which He has fixed.  The
   unsearchable places of abysses, and the indescribable arrangements of
   the lower world, are restrained by the same laws.  The vast
   unmeasurable sea, gathered together by His working into various basins,
   [4095] never passes beyond the bounds placed around it, but does as He
   has commanded.  For He said, "Thus far shalt thou come, and thy waves
   shall be broken within thee." [4096]   The ocean, impassable to man and
   the worlds beyond it, are regulated by the same enactments of the
   Lord.  The seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, peacefully
   give place [4097] to one another.  The winds in their several quarters
   [4098] fulfil, at the proper time, their service without hindrance.
   The ever-flowing fountains, formed both for enjoyment and health,
   furnish without fail their breasts for the life of men.  The very
   smallest of living beings meet together in peace and concord.  All
   these the great Creator and Lord of all has appointed to exist in peace
   and harmony; while He does good to all, but most abundantly to us who
   have fled for refuge to His compassions through Jesus Christ our Lord,
   to whom be glory and majesty for ever and ever.  Amen.

   Chapter XXI.--Let Us Obey God, and Not the Authors of Sedition.

   Take heed, beloved, lest His many kindnesses lead to the condemnation
   of us all.  [For thus it must be] unless we walk worthy of Him, and
   with one mind do those things which are good and well-pleasing in His
   sight.  For [the Scripture] saith in a certain place, "The Spirit of
   the Lord is a candle searching the secret parts of the belly." [4099]
   Let us reflect how near He is, and that none of the thoughts or
   reasonings in which we engage are hid from Him.  It is right,
   therefore, that we should not leave the post which His will has
   assigned us.  Let us rather offend those men who are foolish, and
   inconsiderate, and lifted up, and who glory in the pride of their
   speech, than [offend] God.  Let us reverence the Lord Jesus Christ,
   [4100] whose blood was given for us; let us esteem those who have the
   rule over us; [4101] let us honour the aged [4102] among us; let us
   train up the young men in the fear of God; let us direct our wives to
   that which is good.  Let them exhibit the lovely habit of purity [in
   all their conduct]; let them show forth the sincere disposition of
   meekness; let them make manifest the command which they have of their
   tongue, by their manner [4103] of speaking; let them display their
   love, not by preferring [4104] one to another, but by showing equal
   affection to all that piously fear God.  Let your children be partakers
   of true Christian training; let them learn of how great avail humility
   is with God--how much the spirit of pure affection can prevail with
   Him--how excellent and great His fear is, and how it saves all those
   who walk in [4105] it with a pure mind.  For He is a Searcher of the
   thoughts and desires [of the heart]:  His breath is in us; and when He
   pleases, He will take it away.

   hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the Lord. [4106]   What
   man is he that desireth life, and loveth to see good days?  Keep thy
   tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.  Depart from evil,
   and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.  The eyes of the Lord are upon
   the righteous, and His ears are [open] unto their prayers.  The face of
   the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of
   them from the earth.  The righteous cried, and the Lord heard him, and
   delivered him out of all his troubles." [4107]   "Many are the stripes
   [appointed for] the wicked; but mercy shall compass those about who
   hope in the Lord." [4108]

   The all-merciful and beneficent Father has bowels [of compassion]
   towards those that fear Him, and kindly and lovingly bestows His
   favours upon those who come to Him with a simple mind.  Wherefore let
   us not be double-minded; neither let our soul be lifted [4109] up on
   account of His exceedingly great and glorious gifts.  Far from us be
   that which is written, "Wretched are they who are of a double mind, and
   of a doubting heart; who say, These things we have heard even in the
   times of our fathers; but, behold, we have grown old, and none of them
   has happened unto us;" [4110] Ye foolish ones! compare yourselves to a
   tree; take [for instance] the vine.  First of all, it sheds its leaves,
   [4111] then it buds, next it puts forth leaves, and then it flowers;
   after that comes the sour grape, and then follows the ripened fruit.
   Ye perceive how in a little time the fruit of a tree comes to
   maturity.  Of a truth, soon and suddenly shall His will be
   accomplished, as the Scripture also bears witness, saying, "Speedily
   will He come, and will not tarry;" [4112] and, "The Lord shall suddenly
   come to His temple, even the Holy One, for whom ye look." [4113]

   Let us consider, beloved, how the Lord continually proves to us that
   there shall be a future resurrection, of which He has rendered the Lord
   Jesus Christ [4114] the first-fruits [4115] by raising Him from the
   dead.  Let us contemplate, beloved, the resurrection which is at all
   times [4116] taking place.  Day and night declare to us a
   resurrection.  The night sinks to sleep, and the day arises; the day
   [again] departs, and the night comes on.  Let us behold [4117] the
   fruits [of the earth], how the sowing of grain takes place.  The sower
   [4118] goes forth, and casts it into the ground, [4119] and the seed
   being thus scattered, though dry and naked when it fell upon the earth,
   is gradually dissolved.  Then out of its dissolution the mighty power
   of the providence of the Lord raises it up again, and from one seed
   many arise and bring forth fruit.

   Chapter XXV.--The Phoenix an Emblem of Our Resurrection.

   Let us consider that wonderful sign [of the resurrection] which takes
   place in eastern lands, that is, in Arabia and the countries round
   about.  There is a certain bird which is called a phoenix.  This is the
   only one of its kind, and lives five hundred years.  And when the time
   of its dissolution draws near that it must die, it builds itself a nest
   of frankincense, and myrrh, and other spices, into which, when the time
   is fulfilled, it enters and dies.  But as the flesh decays a certain
   kind of worm is produced, which, being nourished by the juices of the
   deed bird, brings forth feathers.  Then, when it has acquired strength,
   it takes up that nest in which are the bones of its parent, and bearing
   these it passes [4120] from the land of Arabia into Egypt, to the city
   called Heliopolis.  And, in open day, flying [4121] in the sight of all
   men, it places them on the altar of the sun, and having done this,
   hastens back to its former abode.  The priests then inspect the
   registers of the dates, and find that it has returned exactly as the
   five hundredth year was completed. [4122]

   Do we then deem it any great and wonderful thing for the Maker of all
   things to raise up again those that have piously served Him in the
   assurance of a good faith, when even by a bird He shows us the
   mightiness of His power to fulfil His promise? [4123]   For [the
   Scripture] saith in a certain place, "Thou shalt raise me up, and I
   shall confess unto Thee"; [4124] and again, "I laid me down, and
   slept"; "I awaked, because Thou art with me;" [4125] and again, Job
   says, "Thou shalt raise up this flesh of mine, which has suffered all
   these things." [4126]

   Having then this hope, let our souls be bound to Him who is faithful in

   to lie, shall much more Himself not lie; for nothing is impossible with
   God, except to lie. [4127]   Let His faith therefore be stirred up
   again within us, and let us consider that all things are nigh unto
   Him.  By the word of His might [4128] He established all things, and by
   His word He can overthrow them.  "Who shall say unto Him, What hast
   thou done? or, Who shall resist the power of His strength?" [4129]
   When, and as He pleases, He will do all things, and none of the things
   determined by Him shall pass away. [4130]   All things are open before
   Him, and nothing can be hidden from His counsel.  "The heavens [4131]
   declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handy-work.
   [4132]   Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth
   knowledge.  And there are no words or speeches of which the voices are

   [4135] so that, through His mercy, we may be protected from the
   judgments to come.  For whither can any of us flee from His mighty
   hand?  Or what world will receive any of those who run away from Him?
   For the Scripture saith in a certain place, "Whither shall I go, and
   where shall I be hid from Thy presence?  If I ascend into heaven, Thou
   art there; if I go away even to the uttermost parts of the earth, there
   is Thy right hand; [4136] if I make my bed in the abyss, there is Thy

   according to the number of the angels of God.  His people Jacob became
   the portion of the Lord, and Israel the lot of His inheritance. [4140]
     And in another place [the Scripture] saith, "Behold, the Lord taketh

   Those He Hates, that We May Be Blessed.

   Seeing, therefore, that we are the portion of the Holy One, [4142] let
   us do all those things which pertain to holiness, avoiding all
   evil-speaking, all abominable and impure embraces, together with all
   drunkenness, seeking after change, [4143] all abominable lusts,
   detestable adultery, and execrable pride.  "For God," [saith the
   Scripture], "resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble."
   [4144]   Let us cleave, then, to those to whom grace has been given by
   God.  Let us clothe ourselves with concord and humility, ever
   exercising self-control, standing far off from all whispering and
   evil-speaking, being justified by our works, and not our words.  For
   [the Scripture] saith, "He that speaketh much, shall also hear much in
   answer.  And does he that is ready in speech deem himself righteous?
   Blessed [4145] is he that is born of woman, who liveth but a short
   time:  be not given to much speaking." [4146]   Let our praise be in
   God, and not of ourselves; for God hateth those that commend
   themselves.  Let testimony to our good [4147] deeds be borne by others,
   as it was in the case of our righteous forefathers.  Boldness, and
   arrogance, and audacity belong to [4148] those that are accursed of
   God; but moderation, humility, and meekness to such as are blessed by
   Him.

   have taken place from the beginning.  For what reason was our father
   Abraham blessed?  Was it not because he wrought righteousness and truth
   through faith?  Isaac, [4151] with perfect confidence, as if knowing
   what was to happen, [4152] cheerfully yielded himself as a sacrifice.

   Chapter XXXII.--We are Justified Not by Our Own Works, But by Faith.

   Whosoever will candidly consider each particular, will recognise the
   greatness of the gifts which were given by him. [4155]   For from him
   [4156] have sprung the priests and all the Levites who minister at the
   altar of God.  From him also [was descended] our Lord Jesus Christ
   according to the flesh. [4157]   From him [arose] kings, princes, and
   rulers of the race of Judah.  Nor are his other tribes in small glory,
   [4158] inasmuch as God had promised, "Thy seed shall be as the stars of
   heaven." [4159]   All these, therefore, were highly honoured, and made
   great, not for their own sake, or for their own works, or for the
   righteousness which they wrought, but through the operation of His
   will.  And we, too, being called by His will [4160] in Christ Jesus,
   are not justified by ourselves, nor by our own wisdom, or
   understanding, or godliness, or works which we have wrought in holiness
   of heart; but by that faith through which, from the beginning, Almighty
   God has justified all men; to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

   Chapter XXXIII.--But Let Us Not Give Up the Practice of Good Works and
   Love.  God Himself is an Example to Us of Good Works.

   What shall we do, [4161] then, brethren?  Shall we become slothful in
   well-doing, and cease from the practice of love?  God forbid that any
   such course should be followed by us!  But rather let us hasten with
   all energy and readiness of mind to perform every good work.  For the
   Creator and Lord of all Himself rejoices in His works.  For by His
   infinitely great power He established the heavens, and by His
   incomprehensible wisdom He adorned them.  He also divided the earth
   from the water which surrounds it, and fixed it upon the immovable
   foundation of His own will.  The animals also which are upon it He
   commanded by His own word [4162] into existence.  So likewise, when He
   had formed [4163] the sea, and the living creatures which are in it, He
   enclosed them [within their proper bounds] by His own power.  Above
   all, [4164] with His holy and undefiled hands He formed man, the most
   excellent [of His creatures], and truly great through the understanding
   given him--the express likeness of His own image.  For thus says God:
   "Let us make man in our image, and after our likeness.  So God made
   man; male and female He created them." [4165]   Having thus finished
   all these things, He approved them, and blessed them, and said,
   "Increase and multiply." [4166]   We see, [4167] then, how all
   righteous men have been adorned with good works, and how the Lord
   Himself, adorning Himself with His works, rejoiced.  Having therefore
   such an example, let us without delay accede to His will, and let us
   work the work of righteousness with our whole strength.

   Chapter XXXIV.--Great is the Reward of Good Works with God.  Joined
   Together in Harmony, Let Us Implore that Reward from Him.

   The good servant [4168] receives the bread of his labour with
   confidence; the lazy and slothful cannot look his employer in the
   face.  It is requisite, therefore, that we be prompt in the practice of
   well-doing; for of Him are all things.  And thus He forewarns us:
   "Behold, the Lord [cometh], and His reward is before His face, to
   render to every man according to his work." [4169]   He exhorts us,
   therefore, [4170] with our whole heart to attend to this, [4171] that
   we be not lazy or slothful in any good work.  Let our boasting and our
   confidence be in Him.  Let us submit ourselves to His will.  Let us
   consider the whole multitude of His angels, how they stand ever ready
   to minister to His will.  For the Scripture saith, "Ten thousand times
   ten thousand stood around Him, and thousands of thousands ministered
   unto Him, [4172] and cried, Holy, holy, holy, [is] the Lord of Sabaoth;
   the whole creation [4173] is full of His glory." [4174]   And let us
   therefore, conscientiously gathering together in harmony, cry to Him
   earnestly, as with one mouth, that we may be made partakers of His
   great and glorious promises.  For [the Scripture] saith, "Eye hath not
   seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the
   things which He hath prepared for them that wait for [4175] Him."

   Creator and Father of all worlds, [4178] the Most Holy, [4179] alone
   knows their amount and their beauty.  Let us therefore earnestly strive
   to be found in the number of those that wait for Him, in order that we
   may share in His promised gifts.  But how, beloved, shall this be
   done?  If our understanding be fixed by faith towards God; if we
   earnestly seek the things [4180] which are pleasing and acceptable to
   Him; if we do the things which are in harmony with His blameless will;
   and if we follow the way of truth, casting away from us all
   unrighteousness and iniquity, [4181] along with all covetousness,
   [4182] strife, evil practices, deceit, whispering, and evil-speaking,
   all hatred of God, pride and haughtiness, vain glory and ambition.
   [4183]   For they that do such things are hateful to God; and not only
   they that do them, but also those that take pleasure in them that do
   them. [4184]   For the Scripture saith, "But to the sinner God said,
   Wherefore dost thou declare my statutes, and take my covenant into thy
   mouth, seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind
   thee?  When thou sawest a thief, thou consentedst with [4185] him, and
   didst make thy portion with adulterers.  Thy mouth has abounded with
   wickedness, and thy tongue contrived [4186] deceit.  Thou sittest, and
   speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest [4187] thine own mother's
   son.  These things thou hast done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest,
   wicked one, that I should be like to thyself.  But I will reprove thee,
   and set thyself before thee.  Consider now these things, ye that forget
   God, lest He tear you in pieces, like a lion, and there be none to
   deliver. [4188]   The sacrifice of praise will glorify me, and a way is
   there by which I will show him the salvation of God." [4189]

   This is the way, beloved, in which we find our Saviour, [4190] even
   Jesus Christ, the High Priest of all our offerings, the defender and
   helper of our infirmity.  By Him we look up to the heights of heaven.
   By Him we behold, as in a glass, His immaculate and most excellent
   visage.  By Him are the eyes of our hearts opened.  By Him our foolish
   and darkened understanding blossoms [4191] up anew towards His
   marvellous light.  By Him the Lord has willed that we should taste of
   immortal knowledge, [4192] "who, being the brightness of His majesty,
   is by so much greater than the angels, as He hath by inheritance
   obtained a more excellent name than they." [4193]   For it is thus
   written, "Who maketh His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of
   fire." [4194]   But concerning His Son [4195] the Lord spoke thus:
   "Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten Thee.  Ask of me, and I will
   give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of
   the earth for Thy possession." [4196]   And again He saith to Him, "Sit
   Thou at my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."

   Chapter XXXVII.--Christ is Our Leader, and We His Soldiers.

   Let us then, men and brethren, with all energy act the part of
   soldiers, in accordance with His holy commandments.  Let us consider
   those who serve under our generals, with what order, obedience, [4199]
   and submissiveness they perform the things which are commanded them.
   All are not prefects, nor commanders of a thousand, nor of a hundred,
   nor of fifty, nor the like, but each one in his own rank performs the
   things commanded by the king and the generals.  The great cannot
   subsist without the small, nor the small without the great.  There is a
   kind of mixture in all things, and thence arises mutual advantage.
   [4200]   Let us take our body for an example. [4201]   The head is
   nothing without the feet, and the feet are nothing without the head;
   yea, the very smallest members of our body are necessary and useful to
   the whole body.  But all work [4202] harmoniously together, and are
   under one common rule [4203] for the preservation of the whole body.

   deeds.  Let the humble not bear testimony to himself, but leave witness
   to be borne to him by another. [4207]   Let him that is pure in the
   flesh not grow proud [4208] of it, and boast, knowing that it was
   another who bestowed on him the gift of continence.  Let us consider,
   then, brethren, of what matter we were made,--who and what manner of
   beings we came into the world, as it were out of a sepulchre, and from
   utter darkness. [4209]   He who made us and fashioned us, having
   prepared His bountiful gifts for us before we were born, introduced us
   into His world.  Since, therefore, we receive all these things from
   Him, we ought for everything to give Him thanks; to whom be glory for
   ever and ever.  Amen.

   Foolish and inconsiderate [4210] men, who have neither wisdom [4211]
   nor instruction, mock and deride us, being eager to exalt themselves in
   their own conceits.  For what can a mortal man do, or what strength is
   there in one made out of the dust?  For it is written, "There was no
   shape before mine eyes, only I heard a sound, [4212] and a voice
   [saying], What then?  Shall a man be pure before the Lord?  Or shall
   such an one be [counted] blameless in his deeds, seeing He does not
   confide in His servants, and has charged [4213] even His angels with
   perversity?  The heaven is not clean in His sight:  how much less they
   that dwell in houses of clay, of which also we ourselves were made!  He
   smote them as a moth; and from morning even until evening they endure
   not.  Because they could furnish no assistance to themselves, they
   perished.  He breathed upon them, and they died, because they had no
   wisdom.  But call now, if any one will answer thee, or if thou wilt
   look to any of the holy angels; for wrath destroys the foolish man, and
   envy killeth him that is in error.  I have seen the foolish taking
   root, but their habitation was presently consumed.  Let their sons be
   far from safety; let them be despised [4214] before the gates of those
   less than themselves, and there shall be none to deliver.  For what was
   prepared for them, the righteous shall eat; and they shall not be
   delivered from evil." [4215]

   These things therefore being manifest to us, and since we look into the
   depths of the divine knowledge, it behoves us to do all things in
   [their proper] order, which the Lord has commanded us to perform at
   stated times. [4216]   He has enjoined offerings [to be presented] and
   service to be performed [to Him], and that not thoughtlessly or
   irregularly, but at the appointed times and hours.  Where and by whom
   He desires these things to be done, He Himself has fixed by His own
   supreme will, in order that all things, being piously done according to
   His good pleasure, may be acceptable unto Him. [4217]   Those,
   therefore, who present their offerings at the appointed times, are
   accepted and blessed; for inasmuch as they follow the laws of the Lord,
   they sin not.  For his own peculiar services are assigned to the high
   priest, and their own proper place is prescribed to the priests, and
   their own special ministrations devolve on the Levites.  The layman is
   bound by the laws that pertain to laymen.

   Let every one of you, brethren, give thanks [4218] to God in his own

   going beyond the rule of the ministry prescribed to him.  Not in every
   place, brethren, are the daily sacrifices offered, or the
   peace-offerings, or the sin-offerings and the trespass-offerings, but
   in Jerusalem only.  And even there they are not offered in any place,
   but only at the altar before the temple, that which is offered being
   first carefully examined by the high priest and the ministers already
   mentioned.  Those, therefore, who do anything beyond that which is
   agreeable to His will, are punished with death.  Ye see, [4219]
   brethren, that the greater the knowledge that has been vouchsafed to
   us, the greater also is the danger to which we are exposed.

   Chapter XLII.--The Order of Ministers in the Church.

   The apostles have preached the gospel to us from [4220] the Lord Jesus
   Christ; Jesus [4221] Christ [has done so] from God.  Christ therefore
   was sent forth by God, [4222] and the apostles by Christ.  Both these
   appointments, [4223] then, were made in an orderly way, according to
   the will of God.  Having therefore received their orders, and being
   fully assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
   established [4224] in the word of God, with full assurance of the Holy
   Ghost, they went forth proclaiming that the kingdom of God was at
   hand.  And thus preaching through countries and cities, they appointed
   the first fruits [of their labours], having first proved them by the
   Spirit, [4225] to be bishops and deacons of those who should afterwards
   believe.  Nor was this any new thing, since indeed many ages before it
   was written concerning bishops and deacons.  For thus saith the
   Scripture in a certain place, "I will appoint their bishops [4226] in
   righteousness, and their deacons [4227] in faith." [4228]

   Chapter XLIII.--Moses of Old Stilled the Contention Which Arose
   Concerning the Priestly Dignity.

   And what wonder is it if those in Christ who were entrusted with such a
   duty by God, appointed those [ministers] before mentioned, when the
   blessed Moses also, "a faithful servant in all his house," [4229] noted
   down in the sacred books all the injunctions which were given him, and
   when the other prophets also followed him, bearing witness with one
   consent to the ordinances which he had appointed?  For, when rivalry
   arose concerning the priesthood, and the tribes were contending among
   themselves as to which of them should be adorned with that glorious
   title, he commanded the twelve princes of the tribes to bring him their
   rods, each one being inscribed with the name [4230] of the tribe.  And
   he took them and bound them [together], and sealed them with the rings
   of the princes of the tribes, and laid them up in the tabernacle of
   witness on the table of God.  And having shut the doors of the
   tabernacle, he sealed the keys, as he had done the rods, and said to
   them, Men and brethren, the tribe whose rod shall blossom has God
   chosen to fulfil the office of the priesthood, and to minister unto
   Him.  And when the morning was come, he assembled all Israel, six
   hundred thousand men, and showed the seals to the princes of the
   tribes, and opened the tabernacle of witness, and brought forth the
   rods.  And the rod of Aaron was found not only to have blossomed, but
   to bear fruit upon it. [4231]   What think ye, beloved?  Did not Moses
   know beforehand that this would happen?  Undoubtedly he knew; but he
   acted thus, that there might be no sedition in Israel, and that the
   name of the true and only God might be glorified; to whom be glory for
   ever and ever.  Amen.

   Chapter XLIV.--The Ordinances of the Apostles, that There Might Be No
   Contention Respecting the Priestly Office.

   Our apostles also knew, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that there would
   be strife on account of the office [4232] of the episcopate.  For this
   reason, therefore, inasmuch as they had obtained a perfect
   fore-knowledge of this, they appointed those [ministers] already
   mentioned, and afterwards gave instructions, [4233] that when these
   should fall asleep, other approved men should succeed them in their
   ministry.  We are of opinion, therefore, that those appointed by them,
   [4234] or afterwards by other eminent men, with the consent of the
   whole church, and who have blamelessly served the flock of Christ, in a
   humble, peaceable, and disinterested spirit, and have for a long time
   possessed the good opinion of all, cannot be justly dismissed from the
   ministry.  For our sin will not be small, if we eject from the
   episcopate [4235] those who have blamelessly and holily fulfilled its
   duties. [4236]   Blessed are those presbyters who, having finished
   their course before now, have obtained a fruitful and perfect departure
   [from this world]; for they have no fear lest any one deprive them of
   the place now appointed them.  But we see that ye have removed some men
   of excellent behaviour from the ministry, which they fulfilled
   blamelessly and with honour.

   Chapter XLV.--It is the Part of the Wicked to Vex the Righteous.

   Ye are fond of contention, brethren, and full of zeal about things
   which do not pertain to salvation.  Look carefully into the Scriptures,
   which are the true utterances of the Holy Spirit.  Observe [4237] that
   nothing of an unjust or counterfeit character is written in them.
   There [4238] you will not find that the righteous were cast off by men
   who themselves were holy.  The righteous were indeed persecuted, but
   only by the wicked.  They were cast into prison, but only by the
   unholy; they were stoned, but only by transgressors; they were slain,
   but only by the accursed, and such as had conceived an unrighteous envy
   against them.  Exposed to such sufferings, they endured them
   gloriously.  For what shall we say, brethren?  Was Daniel [4239] cast
   into the den of lions by such as feared God?  Were Ananias, and
   Azarias, and Michael shut up in a furnace [4240] of fire by those who
   observed [4241] the great and glorious worship of the Most High?  Far
   from us be such a thought!  Who, then, were they that did such things?
   The hateful, and those full of all wickedness, were roused to such a
   pitch of fury, that they inflicted torture on those who served God with
   a holy and blameless purpose [of heart], not knowing that the Most High
   is the Defender and Protector of all such as with a pure conscience
   venerate [4242] His all-excellent name; to whom be glory for ever and
   ever.  Amen.  But they who with confidence endured [these things] are
   now heirs of glory and honour, and have been exalted and made
   illustrious [4243] by God in their memorial for ever and ever.  Amen.

   Chapter XLVI.--Let Us Cleave to the Righteous:  Your Strife is

   Such examples, therefore, brethren, it is right that we should follow;
   [4244] since it is written, "Cleave to the holy, for those that cleave
   to them shall [themselves] be made holy." [4245]   And again, in
   another place, [the Scripture] saith, "With a harmless man thou shalt
   prove [4246] thyself harmless, and with an elect man thou shalt be
   elect, and with a perverse man thou shalt show [4247] thyself
   perverse." [4248]   Let us cleave, therefore, to the innocent and
   righteous, since these are the elect of God.  Why are there strifes,
   and tumults, and divisions, and schisms, and wars [4249] among you?
   Have we not [all] one God and one Christ?  Is there not one Spirit of
   grace poured out upon us?  And have we not one calling in Christ?
   [4250]   Why do we divide and tear in pieces the members of Christ, and
   raise up strife against our own body, and have reached such a height of
   madness as to forget that "we are members one of another?" [4251]
   Remember the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, how [4252] He said, "Woe
   to that man [by whom [4253] offences come]!  It were better for him
   that he had never been born, than that he should cast a stumbling-block
   before one of my elect.  Yea, it were better for him that a millstone
   should be hung about [his neck], and he should be sunk in the depths of
   the sea, than that he should cast a stumbling-block before one of my
   little ones." [4254]   Your schism has subverted [the faith of] many,
   has discouraged many, has given rise to doubt in many, and has caused
   grief to us all.  And still your sedition continueth.

   Chapter XLVII.--Your Recent Discord is Worse Than the Former Which Took
   Place in the Times of Paul.

   Take up the epistle of the blessed Apostle Paul.  What did he write to
   you at the time when the gospel first began to be preached? [4255]
   Truly, under the inspiration [4256] of the Spirit, he wrote to you
   concerning himself, and Cephas, and Apollos, [4257] because even then
   parties [4258] had been formed among you.  But that inclination for one
   above another entailed less guilt upon you, inasmuch as your
   partialities were then shown towards apostles, already of high
   reputation, and towards a man whom they had approved.  But now reflect
   who those are that have perverted you, and lessened the renown of your
   far-famed brotherly love.  It is disgraceful, beloved, yea, highly
   disgraceful, and unworthy of your Christian profession, [4259] that
   such a thing should be heard of as that the most stedfast and ancient
   church of the Corinthians should, on account of one or two persons,
   engage in sedition against its presbyters.  And this rumour has reached
   not only us, but those also who are unconnected [4260] with us; so
   that, through your infatuation, the name of the Lord is blasphemed,
   while danger is also brought upon yourselves.

   Chapter XLVIII.--Let Us Return to the Practice of Brotherly Love.

   Let us therefore, with all haste, put an end [4261] to this [state of
   things]; and let us fall down before the Lord, and beseech Him with
   tears, that He would mercifully [4262] be reconciled to us, and restore
   us to our former seemly and holy practice of brotherly love.  For [such
   conduct] is the gate of righteousness, which is set open for the
   attainment of life, as it is written, "Open to me the gates of
   righteousness; I will go in by them, and will praise the Lord:  this is
   the gate of the Lord:  the righteous shall enter in by it." [4263]
   Although, therefore, many gates have been set open, yet this gate of
   righteousness is that gate in Christ by which blessed are all they that
   have entered in and have directed their way in holiness and
   righteousness, doing all things without disorder.  Let a man be
   faithful:  let him be powerful in the utterance of knowledge; let him
   be wise in judging of words; let him be pure in all his deeds; yet the
   more he seems to be superior to others [in these respects], the more
   humble-minded ought he to be, and to seek the common good of all, and
   not merely his own advantage.

   long-suffering in all things. [4265]   There is nothing base, nothing
   arrogant in love.  Love admits of no schisms:  love gives rise to no
   seditions:  love does all things in harmony.  By love have all the
   elect of God been made perfect; without love nothing is well-pleasing
   to God.  In love has the Lord taken us to Himself.  On account of the
   love He bore us, Jesus Christ our Lord gave His blood for us by the
   will of God; His flesh for our flesh, and His soul for our souls.

   Chapter L.--Let Us Pray to Be Thought Worthy of Love.

   Ye see, beloved, how great and wonderful a thing is love, and that
   there is no declaring its perfection.  Who is fit to be found in it,
   except such as God has vouchsafed to render so?  Let us pray, [4266]
   therefore, and implore of His mercy, that we may live [4267] blameless
   in love, free from all human partialities for one above another.  All
   the generations from Adam even unto this day have passed away; but
   those who, through the grace of God, have been made perfect in love,
   now possess a place among the godly, and shall be made manifest at the
   revelation [4268] of the kingdom of Christ. [4269]   For it is written,
   "Enter into thy secret chambers for a little time, until my wrath and
   fury pass away; and I will remember a propitious [4270] day, and will
   raise you up out of your graves." [4271]   Blessed are we, beloved, if
   we keep the commandments of God in the harmony of love; that so through
   love our sins may be forgiven us.  For it is written, "Blessed are they
   whose transgressions are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.  Blessed
   is the man whose sin the Lord will not impute to him, and in whose
   mouth there is no guile. [4272]   This blessedness cometh upon those
   who have been chosen by God through Jesus Christ our Lord; to whom be
   glory for ever and ever.  Amen.

   Let us therefore implore forgiveness for all those transgressions which
   through any [suggestion] of the adversary we have committed.  And these
   who have been the leaders of sedition and disagreement ought to have
   respect [4273] to the common hope.  For such as live in fear and love
   would rather that they themselves than their neighbours should be
   involved in suffering.  And they prefer to bear blame themselves,
   rather than that the concord which has been well and piously [4274]
   handed down to us should suffer.  For it is better that a man should
   acknowledge his transgressions than that he should harden his heart, as
   the hearts of those were hardened who stirred up sedition against Moses
   the servant [4275] of God, and whose condemnation was made manifest
   [unto all].  For they went down alive into Hades, and death swallowed
   them up. [4276]   Pharaoh with his army and all the princes of Egypt,
   and the chariots with their riders, were sunk in the depths of the Red
   Sea, and perished, [4277] for no other reason than that their foolish
   hearts were hardened, after so many signs and wonders had been wrought
   in the land of Egypt by Moses the servant of God.

   than a young bullock [4278] that hath horns and hoofs.  Let the poor
   see it, and be glad." [4279]   And again he saith, "Offer [4280] unto
   God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High.  And
   call upon me in the day of thy trouble:  I will deliver thee, and thou
   shalt glorify me." [4281]   For "the sacrifice of God is a broken

   Chapter LIII.--The Love of Moses Towards His People.

   Ye understand, beloved, ye understand well the sacred Scriptures, and
   ye have looked very earnestly into the oracles of God.  Call then these
   things to your remembrance.  When Moses went up into the mount, and
   abode there, with fasting and humiliation, forty days and forty nights,
   the Lord said unto him, "Moses, Moses, get thee down quickly from
   hence; for thy people whom thou didst bring out of the land of Egypt
   have committed iniquity.  They have speedily departed from the way in
   which I commanded them to walk, and have made to themselves molten
   images." [4283]   And the Lord said unto him, "I have spoken to thee
   once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a
   stiff-necked people:  let me destroy them, and blot out their name from
   under heaven; and I will make thee a great and wonderful nation, and
   one much more numerous than this." [4284]   But Moses said, "Far be it
   from Thee, Lord:  pardon the sin of this people; else blot me also out
   of the book of the living." [4285]   O marvellous [4286] love!  O
   insuperable perfection!  The servant [4287] speaks freely to his Lord,
   and asks forgiveness for the people, or begs that he himself might
   perish [4288] along with them.

   Who then among you is noble-minded? who compassionate? who full of
   love?  Let him declare, "If on my account sedition and disagreement and
   schisms have arisen, I will depart, I will go away whithersoever ye
   desire, and I will do whatever the majority [4289] commands; only let
   the flock of Christ live on terms of peace with the presbyters set over
   it."  He that acts thus shall procure to himself great glory in the
   Lord; [4290] and every place will welcome [4291] him.  For "the earth
   is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof." [4292]   These things they who

   Chapter LV.--Examples of Such Love.

   To bring forward some examples [4293] from among the heathen:  Many
   kings and princes, in times of pestilence, when they had been
   instructed by an oracle, have given themselves up to death, in order
   that by their own blood they might deliver their fellow-citizens [from
   destruction].  Many have gone forth from their own cities, that so
   sedition might be brought to an end within them.  We know many among
   ourselves who have given themselves up to bonds, in order that they
   might ransom others.  Many, too, have surrendered themselves to
   slavery, that with the price [4294] which they received for themselves,
   they might provide food for others.  Many women also, being
   strengthened by the grace of God, have performed numerous manly
   exploits.  The blessed Judith, when her city was besieged, asked of the
   elders permission to go forth into the camp of the strangers; and,
   exposing herself to danger, she went out for the love which she bare to
   her country and people then besieged; and the Lord delivered Holofernes
   into the hands of a woman. [4295]   Esther also, being perfect in
   faith, exposed herself to no less danger, in order to deliver the
   twelve tribes of Israel from impending destruction.  For with fasting
   and humiliation she entreated the everlasting [4296] God, who seeth all
   things; and He, perceiving the humility of her spirit, delivered the
   people for whose sake she had encountered peril. [4297]

   Chapter LVI.--Let Us Admonish and Correct One Another.

   Let us then also pray for those who have fallen into any sin, that
   meekness and humility may be given to them, so that they may submit,
   not unto us, but to the will of God.  For in this way they shall secure
   a fruitful and perfect remembrance from us, with sympathy for them,
   both in our prayers to God, and our mention of them to the saints.
   [4298]   Let us receive correction, beloved, on account of which no one
   should feel displeased.  Those exhortations by which we admonish one
   another are both good [in themselves], and highly profitable, for they
   tend to unite [4299] us to the will of God.  For thus saith the holy
   Word:  "The Lord hath severely chastened me, yet hath not given me over
   to death." [4300]   "For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and
   scourgeth every son whom He receiveth." [4301]   "The righteous,"
   [4302] saith it, "shall chasten me in mercy, and reprove me; but let
   not the oil of sinners make fat my head." [4303]   And again he saith,
   "Blessed is the man whom the Lord reproveth, and reject not thou the
   warning of the Almighty.  For He causes sorrow, and again restores [to
   gladness]; He woundeth, and His hands make whole.  He shall deliver
   thee in six troubles, yea, in the seventh no evil shall touch thee.  In
   famine He shall rescue thee from death, and in war He shall free thee
   from the power [4304] of the sword.  From the scourge of the tongue
   will He hide thee, and thou shalt not fear when evil cometh.  Thou
   shalt laugh at the unrighteous and the wicked, and shalt not be afraid
   of the beasts of the field.  For the wild beasts shall be at peace with
   thee:  then shalt thou know that thy house shall be in peace, and the
   habitation of thy tabernacle shall not fail. [4305]   Thou shalt know
   also that thy seed shall be great, and thy children like the grass of
   the field.  And thou shalt come to the grave like ripened corn which is
   reaped in its season, or like a heap of the threshing-floor which is
   gathered together at the proper time." [4306]   Ye see, beloved, that
   [4307] "protection is afforded to those that are chastened of the Lord;
   for since God is good, [4308] He corrects us, that we may be
   admonished" [4309] by His holy chastisement.

   Chapter LVII.--Let the Authors of Sedition Submit Themselves.

   Ye therefore, who laid the foundation of this sedition, submit
   yourselves to the presbyters, and receive correction so as to repent,
   bending the knees of your hearts.  Learn to be subject, laying aside
   the proud and arrogant self-confidence of your tongue.  For it is
   better for you that ye should occupy [4310] a humble but honourable
   place in the flock of Christ, than that, being highly exalted, ye
   should be cast out from the hope of His people. [4311]   For thus
   speaketh all-virtuous Wisdom:  "Behold, I will bring forth to you the
   words of my Spirit, and I will teach you my speech.  Since I called,
   and ye did not hear; I held forth my words, and ye regarded not, but
   set at naught my counsels, and yielded not at my reproofs; therefore I
   too will laugh at your destruction; yea, I will rejoice when ruin
   cometh upon you, and when sudden confusion overtakes you, when
   overturning presents itself like a tempest, or when tribulation and
   oppression [4312] fall upon you.  For it shall come to pass, that when
   ye call upon me, I will not hear you; the wicked shall seek me, and
   they shall not find me.  For they hated wisdom, and did not choose the
   fear of the Lord; nor would they listen to my counsels, but despised my
   reproofs.  Wherefore they shall eat the fruits of their own way, and
   they shall be filled [4313] with their own ungodliness. [4314] ...For,
   in punishment for the wrongs which they practised upon babes, shall
   they be slain, and inquiry will be death to the ungodly; but he that
   heareth me shall rest in hope and be undisturbed by the fear of any
   evil."

   Let us, therefore, flee from the warning threats pronounced by Wisdom
   on the disobedient, and yield submission to His all-holy and glorious
   name, that we may stay our trust upon the most hallowed name of His
   majesty.  Receive our counsel, and ye shall be without repentance.
   For, as God liveth, and as the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost
   live,--both the faith and hope of the elect, he who in lowliness of
   mind, with instant gentleness, and without repentance hath observed the
   ordinances and appointments given by God--the same shall obtain a place

   Christ, through whom is glory to Him for ever and ever.  Amen.

   If, however, any shall disobey the words spoken by Him through us, let
   them know that they will involve themselves in transgression and
   serious danger; but we shall be innocent of this sin, and, instant in
   prayer and supplication, shall desire that the Creator of all preserve
   unbroken the computed number of His elect in the whole world through
   His beloved Son Jesus Christ, through whom He called us from darkness
   to light, from ignorance to knowledge of the glory of His name, our
   hope resting on Thy name which is primal cause of every
   creature,--having opened the eyes of our heart to the knowledge of
   Thee, who alone "dost rest highest among the highest, holy among the
   holy," [4315] who "layest low the insolence of the haughty," [4316] who
   "destroyest the calculations of the heathen," [4317] who "settest the
   low on high and bringest low the exalted;" [4318] who "makest rich and
   makest poor," [4319] who "killest and makest to live," [4320] only
   Benefactor of spirits and God of all flesh, [4321] who beholdest the
   depths, the eye-witness of human works, the help of those in danger,
   the Saviour of those in despair, the Creator and Guardian of every
   spirit, who multipliest nations upon earth, and from all madest choice
   of those who love Thee through Jesus Christ, Thy beloved Son, through
   whom Thou didst instruct, sanctify, honour us.  We would have Thee,
   Lord, to prove our help and succour.  Those of us in affliction save,
   on the lowly take pity; the fallen raise; upon those in need arise; the
   sick [4322] heal; the wandering ones of Thy people turn; fill the
   hungry; redeem those of us in bonds; raise up those that are weak;
   comfort the faint-hearted; let all the nations know that Thou art God
   alone and Jesus Christ Thy Son, and we are Thy people and the sheep of
   Thy pasture.

   wonderful in strength and majesty, with wisdom creating and with
   understanding fixing the things which were made, who art good among
   them that are being saved [4323] and faithful among them whose trust is
   in Thee; O merciful and Compassionate One, forgive us our iniquities
   and offences and transgressions and trespasses.  Reckon not every sin
   of Thy servants and handmaids, but Thou wilt purify us with the
   purification of Thy truth; and direct our steps that we may walk in
   holiness of heart and do what is good and well-pleasing in Thy sight
   and in the sight of our rulers.  Yea, Lord, make Thy face to shine upon
   us for good in peace, that we may be shielded by Thy mighty hand and
   delivered from every sin by Thine uplifted arm, and deliver us from
   those who hate us wrongfully.  Give concord and peace to us and all who
   dwell upon the earth, even as Thou gavest to our fathers, when they
   called upon Thee in faith and truth, submissive as we are to Thine
   almighty and all-excellent Name.

   things that are on the earth; do Thou, Lord, direct their counsel
   according to that which is good and well-pleasing in Thy sight, that,
   devoutly in peace and meekness exercising the power given them by Thee,
   they may find Thee propitious.  O Thou, who only hast power to do these

   at sufficient length.  For concerning faith and repentance and true
   love and continence and soberness and patience, we have touched upon
   every passage, putting you in mind that you ought in righteousness and
   truth and long-suffering to be well-pleasing [4324] to Almighty God
   with holiness, being of one mind--not remembering evil--in love and
   peace with instant gentleness, even as also our fathers forementioned
   found favour by the humility of their thoughts towards the Father and
   God and Creator and all mankind.  And of these things we put you in
   mind with the greater pleasure, since we were well assured that we were
   writing to men who were faithful and of highest repute and had peered
   into the oracles of the instruction of God.

   Introductory Notice.

   ------------------------

   [From Vol. VII., p. 515 of the Ante-Nicene Fathers.]

   The first certain reference which is made by any early writer to this
   so-called Epistle of Clement is found in these words of Eusebius (Hist.
   Eccl., iii. 38):  "We must know that there is also a second Epistle of
   Clement.  But we do not regard it as being equally notable with the
   former, since we know of none of the ancients that have made use of
   it."  Several critics in modern times have endeavoured to vindicate the
   authenticity of this epistle.  But it is now generally regarded. as one
   of the many writings which have been falsely ascribed to Clement.
   Besides the want of external evidence, indicated even by Eusebius in
   the above extract, the diversity of style clearly points to a different
   writer from that of the first epistle.  A commonly accepted opinion
   among critics at the present day is, that this is not an epistle at
   all, but a fragment of one of the many homilies falsely ascribed to
   Clement.  There can be no doubt, however, that in the catalogue of
   writings contained in the Alexandrian ms. it is both styled an epistle,
   and, as well as the other which accompanies it, is attributed to
   Clement.  As the ms. is certainly not later than the fifth century, the
   opinion referred to must by that time have taken firm root in the
   Church; but in the face of internal evidence, and in want of all
   earlier testimony, such a fact goes but a small way to establish its
   authenticity.

   ------------------------

   The second epistle differs from the first in several respects.  The
   range of Scriptural quotation is wider, the quotations of the first
   epistle being taken mainly from the Septuagint version of the Old
   Testament.  The attitude of the writer is in accordance with this fact;
   it is distinctively Gentile.  For example, Chapter XII. contains a
   report of words purporting to have been spoken by the Lord; these,
   Clemens Alexandrinus states, are taken from the Apocryphal Gospel
   according to the Egyptians, not now extant.  The reference in Chapter
   XIV. to the spiritual church, recalling Eph. i. 3-5, is parallel to the
   Pastor of Hermas, Vision II. 4.  These passages help to determine the
   date; for the quotation from the Apocryphal Gospel would not have been
   made after the four gospels of the New Testament obtained exclusive
   authority--toward the close of the second century; while similarity of
   idea and exposition would seem to make the second epistle and the

   The conclusion of the second epistle, as in the recently discovered
   ms., goes to establish the speculation made before this ms. was
   discovered, that it is a homily to be read in churches.

   The Second Epistle of Clement. [4328]

   ------------------------

   Chapter I.--We Ought to Think Highly of Christ.

   Brethren, it is fitting that you should think of Jesus Christ as of
   God,--as the Judge of the living and the dead.  And it does not become
   us to think lightly of our salvation; for if we think little of Him, we
   shall also hope but to obtain little [from Him].  And those of us who
   hear carelessly of these things, as if they were of small importance,
   commit sin, not knowing whence we have been called, and by whom, and to
   what place, and how much Jesus Christ submitted to suffer for our
   sakes.  What return, then, shall we make to Him, or what fruit that
   shall be worthy of that which He has given to us?  For, indeed, how
   great are the benefits [4329] which we owe to Him!  He has graciously
   given us light; as a Father, He has called us sons; He has saved us
   when we were ready to perish.  What praise, then, shall we give to Him,
   or what return shall we make for the things which we have received?
   [4330]   We were deficient [4331] in understanding, worshipping stones
   and wood, and gold, and silver, and brass, the works of men's hands;
   [4332] and our whole life was nothing else than death.  Involved in
   blindness, and with such darkness [4333] before our eyes, we have
   received sight, and through His will have laid aside that cloud by
   which we were enveloped.  For He had compassion on us, and mercifully
   saved us, observing the many errors in which we were entangled, as well
   as the destruction to which we were exposed, [4334] and that we had no
   hope of salvation except it came to us from Him.  For He called us when
   we were not, [4335] and willed that out of nothing we should attain a
   real existence. [4336]

   Chapter II.--The Church, Formerly Barren, is Now Fruitful.

   "Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that
   travailest not; for she that is desolate hath many more children than
   she that hath an husband." [4337]   In that He said, "Rejoice, thou
   barren that bearest not," He referred to us, for our church was barren
   before that children were given to her.  But when He said, "Cry out,
   thou that travailest not," He means this, that we should sincerely
   offer up our prayers to God, and should not, like women in travail,
   show signs of weakness. [4338]   And in that He said, "For she that is
   desolate hath many more children than she that hath an husband," [He
   means] that our people seemed to be outcast from God, but now, through
   believing, have become more numerous than those who are reckoned to
   possess God. [4339]   And another Scripture saith, "I came not to call
   the righteous, but sinners." [4340]   This means that those who are
   perishing must be saved.  For it is indeed a great and admirable thing
   to establish not the things which are standing, but those that are
   falling.  Thus also did Christ [4341] desire to save the things which
   were perishing, [4342] and has saved many by coming and calling us when
   hastening to destruction. [4343]

   Chapter III.--The Duty of Confessing Christ.

   Since, then, He has displayed so great mercy towards us, and especially
   in this respect, that we who are living should not offer sacrifices to
   gods that are dead, or pay them worship, [4344] but should attain
   through Him to the knowledge of the true Father, [4345] whereby shall
   we show that we do indeed know Him, [4346] but by not denying Him
   through whom this knowledge has been attained?  For He himself
   declares, "Whosoever shall confess me before men, him will I confess
   before my Father." [4347]   This, then, is our reward if we shall
   confess Him by whom we have been saved.  But in what way shall we
   confess Him?  By doing what He says, and not transgressing His
   commandments, and by honouring Him not with our lips only, but with all
   our heart and all our mind. [4348]   For He says in Isaiah, "This
   people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me."

   Chapter IV.--True Confession of Christ.

   Let us, then, not only call Him Lord, for that will not save us.  For
   He saith, "Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall be saved,
   but he that worketh righteousness." [4350]   Wherefore, brethren, let
   us confess Him by our works, by loving one another, by not committing
   adultery, or speaking evil of one another, or cherishing envy; but by
   being continent, compassionate, and good.  We ought also to sympathize
   with one another, and not be avaricious.  By such works let us confess
   Him, [4351] and not by those that are of an opposite kind.  And it is
   not fitting that we should fear men, but rather God.  For this reason,
   if we should do such [wicked] things, the Lord hath said, "Even though
   ye were gathered together to [4352] me in my very bosom, yet if ye were
   not to keep my commandments, I would cast you off, and say unto you,
   Depart from me; I know you not whence ye are, ye workers of iniquity."

   the second comp., Matt. vii. 23; Luke xiii. 27.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter V.--This World Should Be Despised.

   Wherefore, brethren, leaving [willingly] our sojourn in this present
   world, let us do the will of Him that called us, and not fear to depart
   out of this world.  For the Lord saith, "Ye shall be as lambs in the
   midst of wolves." [4354]   And Peter answered and said unto Him, [4355]
   "What, then, if the wolves shall tear in pieces the lambs?"  Jesus said
   unto Peter, "The lambs have no cause after they are dead to fear [4356]
   the wolves; and in like manner, fear not ye them that kill you, and can
   do nothing more unto you; but fear Him who, after you are dead, has
   power over both soul and body to cast them into hell-fire." [4357]
   And consider, [4358] brethren, that the sojourning in the flesh in this
   world is but brief and transient, but the promise of Christ is great
   and wonderful, even the rest of the kingdom to come, and of life
   everlasting. [4359]   By what course of conduct, then, shall we attain
   these things, but by leading a holy and righteous life, and by deeming
   these worldly things as not belonging to us, and not fixing our desires
   upon them?  For if we desire to possess them, we fall away from the
   path of righteousness.

   Chapter VI.--The Present and Future Worlds are Enemies to Each Other.

   Now the Lord declares, "No servant can serve two masters." [4360]   If
   we desire, then, to serve both God and mammon, it will be unprofitable
   for us.  "For what will it profit if a man gain the whole world, and
   lose his own soul?" [4361]   This world and the next are two enemies.
   The one urges [4362] to adultery and corruption, avarice and deceit;
   the other bids farewell to these things.  We cannot, therefore, be the
   friends of both; and it behoves us, by renouncing the one, to make sure
   [4363] of the other.  Let us reckon [4364] that it is better to hate
   the things present, since they are trifling, and transient, and
   corruptible; and to love those [which are to come,] as being good and
   incorruptible.  For if we do the will of Christ, we shall find rest;
   otherwise, nothing shall deliver us from eternal punishment, if we
   disobey His commandments.  For thus also saith the Scripture in
   Ezekiel, "If Noah, Job, and Daniel should rise up, they should not
   deliver their children in captivity." [4365]   Now, if men so eminently
   righteous are not able by their righteousness to deliver their
   children, how [4366] can we hope to enter into the royal residence
   [4367] of God unless we keep our baptism holy and undefiled?  Or who
   shall be our advocate, unless we be found possessed of works of
   holiness and righteousness?

   Chapter VII.--We Must Strive in Order to Be Crowned.

   Wherefore, then, my brethren, let us struggle with all earnestness,
   knowing that the contest is [in our case] close at hand, and that many
   undertake long voyages to strive for a corruptible reward; [4368] yet
   all are not crowned, but those only that have laboured hard and striven
   gloriously.  Let us therefore so strive, that we may all be crowned.
   Let us run the straight [4369] course, even the race that is
   incorruptible; and let us in great numbers set out [4370] for it, and
   strive that we may be crowned.  And should we not all be able to obtain
   the crown, let us at least come near to it.  We must remember [4371]
   that he who strives in the corruptible contest, if he be found acting
   unfairly, [4372] is taken away and scourged, and cast forth from the
   lists.  What then think ye?  If one does anything unseemly in the
   incorruptible contest, what shall he have to bear?  For of those who do
   not preserve the seal [4373] [unbroken], [the Scripture] saith, "Their
   worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched, and they
   shall be a spectacle to all flesh." [4374]

     __________________________________________________________________

   Chapter VIII.--The Necessity of Repentance While We are on Earth.

   As long, therefore, as we are upon earth, let us practise repentance,
   for we are as clay in the hand of the artificer.  For as the potter, if
   he make a vessel, and it be distorted or broken in his hands, fashions
   it over again; but if he have before this cast it into the furnace of
   fire, can no longer find any help for it:  so let us also, while we are
   in this world, repent with our whole heart of the evil deeds we have
   done in the flesh, that we may be saved by the Lord, while we have yet
   an opportunity of repentance.  For after we have gone out of the world,
   no further power of confessing or repenting will there belong to us.
   Wherefore, brethren, by doing the will of the Father, and keeping the
   flesh holy, and observing the commandments of the Lord, we shall obtain
   eternal life.  For the Lord saith in the Gospel, "If ye have not kept
   that which was small, who will commit to you the great?  For I say unto
   you, that he that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also
   in much." [4375]   This, then, is what He means:  "Keep the flesh holy
   and the seal undefiled, that [4376] ye may receive eternal life."

   Chapter IX.--We Shall Be Judged in the Flesh.

   And let no one of you say that this very flesh shall not be judged, nor
   rise again.  Consider ye in what [state] ye were saved, in what ye
   received sight, [4378] if not while ye were in this flesh.  We must
   therefore preserve the flesh as the temple of God.  For as ye were
   called in the flesh, ye shall also come [to be judged] in the flesh.
   As Christ [4379] the Lord who saved us, though He was first a Spirit
   [4380] became flesh, and thus called us, so shall we also receive the
   reward in this flesh.  Let us therefore love one another, that we may
   all attain to the kingdom of God.  While we have an opportunity of
   being healed, let us yield ourselves to God that healeth us, and give
   to Him a recompense.  Of what sort?  Repentance out of a sincere heart;
   for He knows all things beforehand, and is acquainted with what is in
   our hearts.  Let us therefore give Him praise, not with the mouth only,
   but also with the heart, that He may accept us as sons.  For the Lord
   has said, "Those are my brethren who do the will of my Father." [4381]

   Chapter X.--Vice is to Be Forsaken, and Virtue Followed.

   Wherefore, my brethren, let us do the will of the Father who called us,
   that we may live; and let us earnestly [4382] follow after virtue, but
   forsake every wicked tendency [4383] which would lead us into
   transgression; and flee from ungodliness, lest evils overtake us.  For
   if we are diligent in doing good, peace will follow us.  On this
   account, such men cannot find it [i.e. peace] as are [4384] influenced
   by human terrors, and prefer rather present enjoyment [4385] to the
   promise which shall afterwards be fulfilled.  For they know not what
   torment present enjoyment incurs, or what felicity is involved in the
   future promise.  And if, indeed, they themselves only did such things,
   it would be [the more] tolerable; but now they persist in imbuing
   innocent souls with their pernicious doctrines, not knowing that they
   shall receive a double condemnation, both they and those that hear
   them.

   Chapter XI.--We Ought to Serve God, Trusting in His Promises.

   Let us therefore serve God with a pure heart, and we shall be
   righteous; but if we do not serve Him, because we believe not the
   promise of God, we shall be miserable.  For the prophetic word also
   declares, "Wretched are those of a double mind, and who doubt in their
   heart, who say, All these things [4386] have we heard even in the times
   of our fathers; but though we have waited day by day, we have seen none
   of them [accomplished].  Ye fools! compare yourselves to a tree; take,
   for instance, the vine.  First of all it sheds its leaves, then the bud
   appears; after that the sour grape, and then the fully-ripened fruit.
   So, likewise, my people have borne disturbances and afflictions, but
   afterwards shall they receive their good things." [4387]   Wherefore,
   my brethren, let us not be of a double mind, but let us hope and
   endure, that we also may obtain the reward.  For He is faithful who has
   promised that He will bestow on every one a reward according to his
   works.  If, therefore, we shall do righteousness in the sight of God,
   we shall enter into His kingdom, and shall receive the promises, which
   "ear hath not heard, nor eye seen, neither have entered into the heart
   of man." [4388]

   Chapter XII.--We are Constantly to Look for the Kingdom of God.

   Let us expect, therefore, hour by hour, the kingdom of God in love and
   righteousness, since we know not the day of the appearing of God.  For
   the Lord Himself, being asked by one when His kingdom would come,
   replied, "When two shall be one, that which is without as that which is
   within, and the male with the female, neither male nor female." [4389]
     Now, two are one when we speak the truth one to another, and there is
   unfeignedly one soul in two bodies.  And "that which is without as"
   that which is within meaneth this:  He calls the soul "that which is
   within," and the body "that which is without."  As, then, thy body is
   visible to sight, so also let thy soul be manifest by good works.  And
   "the male, with the female, neither male nor female," this [4390] He
   saith, that brother seeing sister may have no thought concerning her as
   female, and that she may have no thought concerning him as male.  "If
   ye do these things," saith He, "the kingdom of my Father shall come."

   Chapter XIII.--God's Name Not to Be Blasphemed.

   Brethren, then, let us now at length repent, let us soberly turn to
   that which is good; for we are full of abundant folly and wickedness.
   Let us wipe out from us our former sins, and repenting from the heart
   be saved; and let us not be men-pleasers, nor be willing to please one
   another only, but also the men without, for righteousness sake, that
   the name may not be, because of us, blasphemed.  For the Lord saith,
   "Continually my name is blasphemed among all nations," and "Wherefore
   my name is blasphemed; blasphemed in what?  In your not doing the
   things which I wish." [4392]   For the nations, hearing from our mouth
   the oracles of God, marvel at their excellence and worth; thereafter
   learning that our deeds are not worthy of the words which we
   speak,--receiving this occasion they turn to blasphemy, saying that
   they are a fable and a delusion.  For, whenever they hear from us that
   God saith, "No thank have ye, if ye love them which love you, but ye
   have thank, if ye love your enemies and them which hate you" [4393]
   --whenever they hear these words, they marvel at the surpassing measure
   of their goodness; but when they see, that not only do we not love
   those who hate, but that we love not even those who love, they laugh us
   to scorn, and the name is blasphemed.

   Chapter XIV.--The Church Spiritual.

   So, then, brethren, if we do the will of our Father God, we shall be
   members of the first church, the spiritual,--that which was created
   before sun and moon; but if we shall not do the will of the Lord, we
   shall come under the Scripture which saith, "My house became a den of
   robbers." [4394]   So, then, let us elect to belong to the church of
   life, [4395] that we may be saved.  I think not that ye are ignorant
   that the living church is the body of Christ (for the Scripture, saith,
   "God created man male and female;" [4396] the male is Christ, the
   female the church,) and that the Books [4397] and the Apostles teach
   that the church is not of the present, but from the beginning.  For it
   was spiritual, as was also our Jesus, and was made manifest at the end
   of the days in order to save you. [4398]   The church being spiritual,
   was made manifest in the flesh of Christ, signifying to us that if any
   one of us shall preserve it in the flesh and corrupt it not, he shall
   receive it in the Holy Spirit.  For this flesh is the type of the
   spirit; no one, therefore, having corrupted the type, will receive
   afterwards the antitype.  Therefore is it, then, that He saith,
   brethren, "Preserve ye the flesh, that ye may become partakers of the
   spirit."  If we say that the flesh is the church and the spirit Christ,
   then it follows that he who shall offer outrage to the flesh is guilty
   of outrage on the church.  Such an one, therefore, will not partake of
   the spirit, which is Christ.  Such is the life and immortality, which
   this flesh may afterwards receive, the Holy Spirit cleaving to it; and
   no one can either express or utter what things the Lord hath prepared
   for His elect. [4399]

   Chapter XV.--He Who Saves and He Who is Saved.

   I think not that I counted trivial counsel concerning continence;
   following it, a man will not repent thereof, but will save both himself
   and me who counselled. [4400]   For it is no small reward to turn back
   a wandering and perishing soul for its salvation. [4401]   For this
   recompense we are able to render to the God who created us, if he who
   speaks and hears both speak and hear with faith and love.  Let us,
   therefore, continue in that course in which we, righteous and holy,
   believed, that with confidence we may ask God who saith, "Whilst thou
   art still speaking, I will say, Here I am." [4402]   For these words
   are a token of a great promise, for the Lord saith that He is more
   ready to give than he who asks.  So great, then, being the goodness of
   which we are partakers, let us not grudge one another the attainment of
   so great blessings.  For in proportion to the pleasure with which these
   words are fraught to those who shall follow them, in that proportion is
   the condemnation with which they are fraught to those who shall refuse
   to hear.

   Chapter XVI.--Preparation for the Day of Judgment.

   So, then, brethren, having received no small occasion to repent, while
   we have opportunity, let us turn to God who called us, while yet we
   have One to receive us.  For if we renounce these indulgences and
   conquer the soul by not fulfilling its wicked desires, we shall be
   partakers of the mercy of Jesus.  Know ye that the day [4403] of
   judgment draweth nigh like a burning oven, and certain of the heavens
   and all the earth will melt, like lead melting in fire; and then will
   appear the hidden and manifest deeds of men.  Good, then, is alms as
   repentance from sin; better is fasting than prayer, and alms than both;
   "charity covereth a multitude of sins," [4404] and prayer out of a good
   conscience delivereth from death.  Blessed is every one that shall be
   found complete in these; for alms lightens the burden of sin.

   Chapter XVII.--Same Subject Continued.

   Let us, then, repent with our whole heart, that no one of us may perish
   amiss.  For if we have commands and engage in withdrawing from idols
   and instructing others, how much more ought a soul already knowing God
   not to perish.  Rendering, therefore, mutual help, let us raise the
   weak also in that which is good, that all of us may be saved and
   convert one another and admonish.  And not only now let us seem to
   believe and give heed, when we are admonished by the elders; [4405] but
   also when we take our departure home, let us remember the commandments
   of the Lord, and not be allured back by worldly lusts, but let us often
   and often draw near and try to make progress in the Lord's commands,
   that we all having the same mind may be gathered together for life.
   For the Lord said, "I come to gather all nations [kindreds] and
   tongues." [4406]   This means the day of His appearing, when He will
   come and redeem us--each one according to his works.  And the
   unbelievers will see His glory and might, and, when they see the empire
   of the world in Jesus, they will be surprised, saying, "Woe to us,
   because Thou wast, and we knew not and believed not and obeyed not the
   elders [4407] who show us plainly of our salvation."  And "their worm
   shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be
   a spectacle unto all flesh." [4408]   It is of the great day of
   judgment He speaks, when they shall see those among us who were guilty
   of ungodliness and erred in their estimate of the commands of Jesus
   Christ.  The righteous, having succeeded both in enduring the trials
   and hating the indulgences of the soul, whenever they witness how those
   who have swerved and denied Jesus by words or deeds are punished with
   grievous torments in fire unquenchable, will give glory to their God
   and say, "There will be hope for him who has served God with his whole
   heart."

   And let us, then, be of the number of those who give thanks, who have
   served God, and not of the ungodly who are judged.  For I myself,
   though a sinner every whit and not yet fleeing temptation but
   continuing in the midst of the tools of the devil, study to follow

   Chapter XIX.--Reward of the Righteous, Although They May Suffer.

   So then, brothers and sisters, [4409] after the God of truth [4410] I
   address to you an appeal that ye may give heed to the words written,
   [4411] that ye may save both yourselves and him who reads an address in
   your midst.  For as a reward I ask of you repentance with the whole
   heart, while ye bestow upon yourselves salvation and life.  For by so
   doing we shall set a mark for all the young who wish to be diligent in
   godliness and the goodness of God.  And let not us, in our folly, feel
   displeasure and indignation, whenever any one admonishes us and turns
   us from unrighteousness to righteousness.  For there are some wicked
   deeds which we commit, and know it not, because of the
   double-mindedness and unbelief present in our breasts, and our
   understanding is darkened by vain desires.  Let us, therefore, work
   righteousness, that we may be saved to the end.  Blessed are they who
   obey these commandments, even if for a brief space they suffer in this
   world, and they will gather the imperishable fruit of the
   resurrection.  Let not the godly man, therefore, grieve; if for the
   present he suffer affliction, blessed is the time that awaits him
   there; rising up to life again with the fathers he will rejoice for
   ever without a grief.

   Chapter XX.--Godliness, Not Gain, the True Riches.

   But let it not even trouble your mind, that we see the unrighteous
   possessed of riches and the servants of God straitened.  Let us,
   therefore, brothers and sisters, believe; in a trial of the living God
   we strive and are exercised in the present life, that we may obtain the
   crown in that which is to come.  No one of the righteous received fruit
   speedily, but waiteth for it.  For if God tendered the reward of the
   righteous in a trice, straightway were it commerce that we practised,
   and not godliness.  For it were as if we were righteous by following
   after not godliness but gain; and for this reason the divine judgment
   baffled [4412] the spirit that is unrighteous and heavily weighed the
   fetter.

   To the only God, invisible, Father of truth, who sent forth to us the
   Saviour and Author of immortality, through whom He also manifested to
   us the truth and the heavenly life, to Him be glory for ever and ever.
   Amen.

   The Apology of Aristides.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The Church Histories, hitherto in dealing with early Christian
   literature, have given Aristides along with Quadratus the first place
   in the list of lost apologists.  It was known that there had been such
   early defenders of the faith, and that Quadratus had seen persons who
   had been miraculously healed by Christ; but beyond this little more
   could be said.  To Justin Martyr, who flourished about a.d. 150,
   belonged the honour of heading the series of apologists whose works are
   extant, viz., Tatian, Melito, Athenagoras, Theophilus, the author of
   the Epistle to Diognetus, who all belonged to the second century and
   wrote in Greek; and Tertullian, Minucius Felix, Arnobius, and
   Lactantius, who wrote in Latin, and Clement and Origen who wrote in
   Greek, during the third century.  While Christianity was winning its
   way to recognition in the Roman empire, these writers tried to disprove
   the gross calumnies current about Christians, to enlighten rulers and
   magistrates as to the real character and conduct of the adherents of
   the new religion, and to remove the prejudice which led to the violent
   persecutions of the populace.  They also endeavoured to commend
   Christianity to "the cultured among its despisers," by showing that it
   is philosophy as well as revelation, that it can supply the answers
   sought by philosophy, and is unlike human wisdom in being certain
   because divinely revealed.  At the same time they demonstrated the
   folly of polytheism and pointed out its disastrous effects on
   morality.  This faithful company of the defenders of the faith has now
   regained Aristides as their leader in place of Justin Martyr.  It will
   be well to recount briefly what was previously known about Aristides,
   and to tell how the lost Apology has been found.

   Eusebius, in his History of the Church, written during the reign of
   Constantine, a.d. 306-337, has a chapter (bk. iv., c. 3) headed "The
   authors that wrote in defence of the faith in the reign of Hadrian,
   a.d. 117-138."  After describing and quoting the Apology of Quadratus,
   he adds:

   "Aristides also, a man faithfully devoted to the religion we profess,
   like Quadratus, has left to posterity a defence of the faith, addressed
   to Hadrian.  This work is also preserved by a great number, even to the
   present day."

   The same Eusebius in his Chronicon states that the Emperor Hadrian
   visited Athens in the eighth year of his reign (i.e., a.d. 125 ) and
   took part in the Eleusinian mysteries.  In the same connection the
   historian mentions the presentation of Apologies to the Emperor by
   Quadratus and Aristides, "an Athenian philosopher;" and implies that
   Hadrian was induced by these appeals, coupled with a letter from
   Serenius Granianus, proconsul of Asia, to issue an Imperial rescript
   forbidding the punishment of Christians without careful investigation
   and trial.

   About a century later Jerome (died a.d. 420) tells us that Aristides
   was a philosopher of Athens, that he retained his philosopher's garb
   after his conversion to Christianity, and that he presented a defence
   of the faith to Hadrian at the same time as Quadratus.  This Apology,
   he says, was extant in his day, and was largely composed of the
   opinions of philosophers ("contextum philosophorum sententiis"), and
   was afterwards imitated by Justin Martyr.

   After this date Aristides passes out of view.  In the mediæval
   martyrologies there is a faint reflection of the earlier testimony, as,
   e.g., the 31st of August is given as the saint's day "of the blessed
   Aristides, most renowned for faith and wisdom, who presented books on
   the Christian religion to the prince Hadrian, and most brilliantly
   proclaimed in the presence of the Emperor himself how that Christ Jesus
   is the only God."

   In the seventeenth century there were rumours that the missing Apology
   of Aristides was to be found in various monastic libraries in Greece;
   and Spon, a French traveller, made a fruitless search for it.  The book
   had apparently disappeared for ever.

   But in recent times Aristides has again "swum into our ken."  Armenian
   literature, which has done service to Christendom by preserving so many
   of its early documents, supplied also the first news of the recovery of
   Aristides.  In the Mechitarite convent of S. Lazarus at Venice there is
   a body of Armenian monks who study Armenian and other literature.  In
   1878 these Armenians surprised the learned world by publishing a Latin
   translation of an Armenian fragment (the first two chapters) of the
   lost Apology of Aristides.  Renan at once set it down as spurious
   because it contained theological terms of a later age, e.g., "bearer of
   God" applied to the Virgin Mary.  These terms were afterwards seen to
   be due to the translator.  At what time the translation from Greek into
   Armenian was made is not apparent; but it may reasonably be connected
   with the work begun by the famous Armenian patriarch Mesrobes.  This
   noble Christian invented an alphabet for his country, established
   schools, and sent a band of young Armenians to Edessa, Athens, and
   elsewhere with instructions to translate into Armenian the best sacred
   and classical books.  And in spite of Mohammedans and Turks Armenia has
   remained Christian, and now restores to the world the treasures
   committed to its keeping in the early centuries.

   Opinions as to the Armenian fragment of Aristides remained undecided
   till 1889.  In the spring of that year Professor J. Rendel Harris, of
   Cambridge, had the honour of discovering a Syriac version of the whole
   Apology in the library of the Convent of St. Catharine, on Mount
   Sinai.  He found the Apology of Aristides among a collection of Syriac
   treatises of an ethical character; and he refers the ms. to the seventh
   century.  Professor Harris has translated the Syriac into English, and
   has carefully edited the Syriac text with minute discussions of every
   point of interest. [4413]

   The recovery of the Syriac version by Professor Harris placed the
   genuineness of the Armenian fragment beyond question.  It also led to
   the strange reappearance of the greater part of the original Greek.
   Professor J. A. Robinson, the general editor of the Cambridge Texts and
   Studies, having read the translation of the Syriac version, discovered
   that the Apology of Aristides is incorporated in the early Christian
   Romance entitled, The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat.

   Some account must be given of this remarkable book in order to show its
   connection with the Apology of Aristides.  Its author is said to be
   John of Damascus, who died about a.d. 760.  Whoever wrote it, the book
   soon became very popular.  In the East it was translated into Arabic,
   Ethiopic, Armenian, and Hebrew; in the West there are versions of it in
   nearly a dozen languages, including an English metrical rendering.  As
   early as 1204 a king of Norway had it translated into Icelandic.  It is
   now known to be the story of Buddha in a Christian setting, furnished
   with fables and parables which have migrated from the far East and can
   be traced back to an extreme antiquity.

   The outline of the story is as follows:  A king in India, Abenner by
   name, who is an enemy of the Christians, has an only son Josaphat (or
   Joasaph).  At his birth the astrologers predict that he will become
   great, but will embrace the new doctrine.  To prevent this, his father
   surrounds the prince with young and beautiful attendants, and takes
   care that Josaphat shall see nothing of illness, old age, or death.  At
   length Josaphat desires his freedom, and then follow the excursions as
   in the case of Buddha.  Josaphat seeing so much misery possible in life
   is sunk in despair.  In this state he is visited by a Christian
   hermit--Barlaam by name.  Josaphat is converted to Christianity, and
   Barlaam withdraws again to the desert.

   To undo his son's conversion the king arranges that a public
   disputation shall be held; one of the king's sages, Nachor by name, is
   to personate Barlaam and to make a very weak statement of the Christian
   case, and so be easily refuted by the court orators.  When the day
   comes, the prince Josaphat charges Nachor, the fictitious monk, to do
   his best on pain of torture.  Thus stimulated, Nachor begins, and "like
   Balaam's ass he spake that which he had not purposed to speak; and he
   said, I, O king, in the providence of God,' etc."  He then recites the
   Apology of Aristides to such purpose that he converts himself, the
   king, and all his people.  Josaphat finally relinquishes his kingdom,
   and retires into the desert with the genuine Barlaam for prayer and
   meditation.  Not only so, but the churches of the Middle Ages,
   forgetting the fabulous character of the story, raised Barlaam and
   Josaphat to the rank of saints, with a holy day in the Christian
   calendar.  Thus the author of Barlaam and Josaphat caused Christianity
   unwittingly to do honour to the founder of Buddhism under the name of
   St. Josaphat; and also to read the Apology of Aristides in nearly
   twenty languages without suspecting what it was.

   The speech of Nachor in Greek, that is to say, the greater part of the
   original Greek of the Apology of Aristides, has been extracted from
   this source by Professor Robinson and is published in Texts and
   Studies, Vol. I., so that there is now abundant material for making an
   estimate of Aristides.

   It may be asked whether we have in any of our three sources the actual
   words of Aristides.  The circumstances under which the Apology was
   incorporated in The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat are such as to render
   it unlikely that the author of the Romance should copy with the
   faithfulness of a scribe; but examination proves that very few
   modifications hare been made.  The Greek divides men into three races
   (the Syriac and Armenian into four); the introductory accounts of these
   races are in the Greek blended with the general discussion; and at the
   close the description of early Christian customs is shortened.  These
   few differences from the Syriac are all explained by the fact that the
   Apology had to be adapted to the circumstances of an Indian court in a
   later age.  On the other hand, when the Syriac is compared. with the
   Greek and Armenian in passages where these two agree, it is found that
   explanatory clauses are added; and there is throughout a cumbrous
   redundancy of pronouns in the Syriac.  In short, the actual words of
   Aristides may be restored with tolerable certainty--a task which has
   been already accomplished by a German scholar, Lic. Edgar Hennecke.
   [4414]   In any case we have the substance of the Apology of Aristides
   with almost verbal precision.

   In regard to the date of Aristides, Eusebius says expressly that the
   Apology was presented to Hadrian while he was in Athens about the year
   a.d. 125.  The only ground for questioning this statement is the second
   superscription given in the Syriac version, which implies that the
   Apology was presented to Antoninus Pius, a.d. 138-161.  This heading is
   accepted by Professor Harris as the true one; and he assigns the
   Apology to "the early years of the reign of Antoninus Pius; and it is
   at least conceivable," he adds, "that it may have been presented to the
   Emperor along with other Christian writings during an unrecorded visit
   of his to his ancient seat of government at Smyrna."  But this requires
   us to suppose that Eusebius was wrong; that Jerome copied his error;
   that the Armenian version curiously fell into the same mistake; and
   that the Syriac translator is at this point exceptionally faithful.  So
   perhaps it is better with Billius, "not to trust more in one's own
   suspicions, than in Christian charity which believeth all things," and
   to rest in the comfortable hypothesis that Eusebius spoke the truth.

   Writing in a.d. 125, or even twenty years later, Aristides becomes an
   important witness as to the nature of early Christianity.  His Apology
   contains no express quotation from Scripture; but the Emperor is
   referred for information to a gospel which is written.  Various echoes
   of New Testament expressions will at once be recognized; and "the
   language moulding power of Christianity" is discernible in the new
   meaning given to various classical words.  Some topics are conspicuous
   by their absence.  Aristides has no trace of ill-feeling to the Jews;
   no reference to the Logos doctrine, nor to the distinctive ideas of the
   Apostle Paul; he has no gnosticism or heresy to denounce, and he makes
   no appeal to miracle and prophecy.  Christianity, in his view, is
   worthy of a philosophic emperor because it is eminently reasonable, and
   gives an impulse and power to live a good life.  On the whole,
   Aristides represents that type of Christian practice which is found in
   the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles; and to this he adds a simple
   Christian philosophy which may be compared with that of St. Paul at
   Athens.  Although the details about the elements and the heathen gods
   are discussed with tedious minuteness, still his closing section
   describing the lives of the early Christians should always be good
   reading.

   The translation of the Syriac given here is independently made from the
   Syriac text, edited by Professor Harris [4415] .  Full advantage has
   been taken of his notes and apparatus criticus, but no use has been
   made of his translation.  In obscure passages the German translation of
   Dr. Richard Raabe [4416] has been compared; and the Text-Rekonstruktion
   of Hennecke has been consulted on textual points in both translations.
   The Greek translation is made from the text edited by Professor
   Robinson. [4417]   The translations from the Greek and from the Syriac
   are arranged side by side, so that their relation to one another is
   apparent at a glance.  No attempt has been made to force the same
   English words from passages which are evidently meant to be identical
   in the two languages; but the literal tenour of each has been allowed
   to assert itself.

   The Apology of Aristides

   as it is preserved in the history of

   Barlaam and Josaphat.

   Translated from the Greek.

   ------------------------

   I.  I, O King in the providence of God came into the world; and when I
   had considered the heaven and the earth, the sun and the moon and the
   rest, I marvelled at their orderly arrangement.

   And when I saw that the universe and all that is therein is moved by
   necessity, I perceived that the mover and controller is God.

   For everything which causes motion is stronger than that which is
   moved, and that which controls is stronger than that which is
   controlled.

   The self-same being, then, who first established and now controls the
   universe--him do I affirm to be God who is without beginning and
   without end, immortal and self-sufficing, above all passions and
   infirmities, above anger and forgetfulness and ignorance and the rest.

   Through Him too all things consist.  He requires not sacrifice and
   libation nor anyone of the things that appear to sense; but all men
   stand in need of Him.

   II.  Having thus spoken concerning God, so far as it was possible for
   me to speak of Him, [4418] let us next proceed to the human race, that
   we may see which of them participate in the truth and which of them in
   error.

   For it is clear to us, O King, [4419] that there are three [4420]
   classes of men in this world; these being the worshippers of the gods
   acknowledged among you, and Jews, and Christians.  Further they who pay
   homage to many gods are themselves divided into three classes,
   Chaldæans namely, and Greeks, and Egyptians; for these have been guides
   and preceptors to the rest of the nations in the service and worship of
   these many-titled deities.

   III.  Let us see then which of them participate in truth and which of
   them in error.

   The Chaldæans, then, not knowing God went astray after the elements and
   began to worship the creation more than their Creator.

   And of these they formed certain shapes and styled them a
   representation of the heaven and the earth and the sea, of the sun too
   and the moon and the other primal bodies or luminaries.  And they shut
   them up together in shrines, and worship them, calling them gods, even
   though they have to guard them securely for fear they should be stolen
   by robbers.  And they did not perceive that anything which acts as
   guard is greater than that which is guarded, and that he who makes is
   greater than that which is made.  For if their gods are unfit to look
   after their own safety, how shall they bestow protection upon others?
   Great then is the error into which the Chaldæans wandered in adoring
   lifeless and good-for-nothing images.

   And it occurs to me as surprising, O King, how it is that their
   so-called philosophers have quite failed to observe that the elements
   themselves are perishable.  And if the elements are perishable and
   subject to necessity, how are they gods?  And if the elements are not
   gods, how do the images made in their honour come to be gods?

   IV.  Let us proceed then, O King, to the elements themselves that we
   may show in regard to them that they are not gods, but perishable and
   mutable, produced out of that which did not exist at the command of the
   true God, who is indestructible and immutable and invisible; yet He
   sees all things and as He wills, modifies and changes things.  What
   then shall I say concerning the elements?

   They err who believe that the sky is a god.  For we see that it
   revolves and moves by necessity and is compacted of many parts, being
   thence called the ordered universe (Kosmos).  Now the universe is the
   construction of some designer; and that which has been constructed has
   a beginning and an end.  And the sky with its luminaries moves by
   necessity.  For the stars are carried along in array at fixed intervals
   from sign to sign, and, some setting, others rising, they traverse
   their courses in due season so as to mark off summers and winters, as
   it has been appointed for them by God; and obeying the inevitable
   necessity of their nature they transgress not their proper limits,
   keeping company with the heavenly order.  Whence it is plain that the
   sky is not a god but rather a work of God.

   They erred also who believed the earth to be a goddess.  For we see
   that it is despitefully used and tyrannized over by men, and is
   furrowed and kneaded and becomes of no account.  For, if it be burned
   with fire, it becomes devoid of life; for nothing will grow from the
   ashes.  Besides if there fall upon it an excess of rain it dissolves
   away, both it and its fruits.  Moreover it is trodden under foot of men
   and the other creatures; it is dyed with the blood of the murdered; it
   is dug open and filled with dead bodies and becomes a tomb for
   corpses.  In face of all this, it is inadmissible that the earth is a
   goddess but rather it is a work of God for the use of men.

   V.  They also erred who believed the water to be a god.  For it, too,
   has been made for the use of men, and is controlled by them; it is
   defiled and destroyed and suffers change on being boiled and dyed with
   colours; and it is congealed by the frost, and polluted with blood, and
   is introduced for the washing of all unclean things.  Wherefore it is
   impossible that water should be a god, but it is a work of God.

   They also err who believe that fire is a god.  For fire was made for
   the use of men, and it is controlled by them, being carried about from
   place to place for boiling and roasting all kinds of meat, and even for
   (the burning of) dead bodies.  Moreover it is extinguished in many
   ways, being quenched through man's agency.  So it cannot be allowed
   that fire is a god, but it is a work of God.

   They also err who think the blowing of the winds is a goddess.  For it
   is clear that it is under the dominion of another; and for the sake of
   man it has been designed by God for the transport of ships and the
   conveyance of grain and for man's other wants.  It rises too and falls
   at the bidding of God, whence it is concluded that the blowing of the
   winds is not a goddess but only a work of God.

   VI.  They also err who believe the sun to be a god.  For we see that it
   moves by necessity and revolves and passes from sign to sign, setting
   and rising so as to give warmth to plants and tender shoots for the use
   of man.

   Besides it has its part in common with the rest of the stars, and is
   much smaller than the sky; it suffers eclipse of its light and is not
   the subject of its own laws.  Wherefore it is concluded that the sun is
   not a god, but only a work of God.  They also err who believe that the
   moon is a goddess.  For we see that it moves by necessity and revolves
   and passes from sign to sign, setting and rising for the benefit of
   men; and it is less than the sun and waxes and wanes and has eclipses.
   Wherefore it is concluded that the moon is not a goddess but a work of
   God.

   VII.  They also err who believe that man [4421] is a god.  For we see
   that he is moved by necessity, and is made to grow up, and becomes old
   even though he would not.  And at one time he is joyous, at another he
   is grieved when he lacks food and drink and clothing.  And we see that
   he is subject to anger and jealousy and desire and change of purpose
   and has many infirmities.  He is destroyed too in many ways by means of
   the elements and animals, and by ever-assailing death.  It cannot be
   admitted, then, that man is a god, but only a work of God.

   Great therefore is the error into which the Chaldæans wandered,
   following after their own desires.

   For they reverence the perishable elements and lifeless images, and do
   not perceive that they themselves make these things to be gods.

   VIII.  Let us proceed then to the Greeks, that we may see whether they
   have any discernment concerning God.  The Greeks, indeed, though they
   call themselves wise proved more deluded than the Chaldæans in alleging
   that many gods have come into being, some of them male, some female,
   practised masters in every passion and every variety of folly.  [And
   the Greeks themselves represented them to be adulterers and murderers,
   wrathful and envious and passionate, slayers of fathers and brothers,
   thieves and robbers, crippled and limping, workers in magic, and
   victims of frenzy.  Some of them died (as their account goes), and some
   were struck by thunderbolts, and became slaves to men, and were
   fugitives, and they mourned and lamented, and changed themselves into
   animals for wicked and shameful ends.] [4422]

   Wherefore, O King, they are ridiculous and absurd and impious tales
   that the Greeks have introduced, giving the name of gods to those who
   are not gods, to suit their unholy desires, in order that, having them
   as patrons of vice, they might commit adultery and robbery and do
   murder and other shocking deeds.  For if their gods did such deeds why
   should not they also do them?

   So that from these misguided practices it has been the lot of mankind
   to have frequent wars and slaughters and bitter captivities.

   IX.  But, further, if we be minded to discuss their gods individually,
   you will see how great is the absurdity; for instance, how Kronos is
   brought forward by them as a god above all, and they sacrifice their
   own children to him.  And he had many sons by Rhea, and in his madness
   devoured his own offspring.  And they say that Zeus cut off his members
   and cast them into the sea, whence Aphrodite is said in fable to be
   engendered.  Zeus, then, having bound his own father, cast him into
   Tartaros.  You see the error and brutality which they advance against
   their god?  Is it possible, then, that a god should be manacled and
   mutilated?  What absurdity!  Who with any wit would ever say so?

   Next Zeus is introduced, and they say that he was king of their gods,
   and that he changed himself into animals that he might debauch mortal
   women.

   For they allege that he transformed himself into a bull for Europe, and
   into gold for Danae, and into a swan for Leda, and into a satyr for
   Antiope, and into a thunderbolt for Semele.  Then by these there were
   many children, Dionysos and Zethus and Amphion and Herakles and Apollo
   and Artemis and Perseus, Kastor and Helenes and Polydeukes and Minos
   and Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon, and the nine daughters whom they called
   the Muses.  Then too they bring forward statements about the matter of
   Ganymedes.

   Hence it happened, O King, to mankind to imitate all these things and
   to become adulterous men and lascivious women, and to be workers of
   other terrible iniquities, through the imitation of their god.  Now how
   is it possible that a god should be an adulterer or an obscene person
   or a parricide?

   X.  Along with him, too, they bring forward one Hephaistos as a god,
   and they say that he is lame and wields a hammer and tongs, working as
   a smith for his living.

   Is he then badly off?  But it cannot be admitted that a god should be a
   cripple, and besides be dependent on mankind.

   Then they bring forward Hermes as a god, representing him to be
   lustful, and a thief, and covetous, and a magician (and maimed) and an
   interpreter of language.  But it cannot be admitted that such an one is
   a god.

   They also bring forward Asklepios as a god who is a doctor and prepares
   drugs and compounds plasters for the sake of a living.  For he was
   badly off.  And afterwards he was struck, they say, with a thunderbolt
   by Zeus on account of Tyndareos, son of Lacedaimon; and so was killed.
   Now if Asklepios in spite of his divinity could not help himself when
   struck by lightning, how will he come to the rescue of others?

   Again Ares is represented as a god, fond of strife and given to
   jealousy, and a lover of animals and other such things.  And at last
   while corrupting Aphrodite, he was bound by the youthful Eros and by
   Hephaistos.  How then was he a god who was subject to desire, and a
   warrior, and a prisoner and an adulterer?

   They allege that Dionysos also is a god who holds nightly revels and
   teaches drunkenness, and carries off the neighbours' wives, and goes
   mad and takes to flight.  And at last he was put to death by the
   Titans.  If then Dionysos could not save himself when he was being
   killed, and besides used to be mad, and drunk with wine, and a
   fugitive, how should he be a god?

   They allege also that Herakles got drunk and went mad and cut the
   throats of his own children, then he was consumed by fire and so died.
    Now how should he be a god, who was drunk and a slayer of children and
   burned to death? or how will he come to the help of others, when he was
   unable to help himself?

   XI.  They represent Apollo also as a jealous god, and besides as the
   master of the bow and quiver, and sometimes of the lyre and flute, and
   as divining to men for pay?  Can he then be very badly off?  But it
   cannot be admitted that a god should be in want, and jealous, and a
   harping minstrel.

   They represent Artemis also as his sister, who is a huntress and has a
   bow with a quiver; and she roams alone upon the hills with the dogs to
   hunt the stag or the wild boar.  How then should such a woman, who
   hunts and roams with her dogs, be a divine being?

   Even Aphrodite herself they affirm to be a goddess who is adulterous.
   For at one time she had Ares as a paramour, and at another time
   Anchises and again Adonis, whose death she also laments, feeling the
   want of her lover.  And they say that she even went down to Hades to
   purchase back Adonis from Persephone.  Did you ever see, O King,
   greater folly than this, to bring forward as a goddess one who is
   adulterous and given to weeping and wailing?

   And they represent that Adonis is a hunter god, who came to a violent
   end, being wounded by a wild boar and having no power to help himself
   in his distress.  How then will one who is adulterous and a hunter and
   mortal give himself any concern for mankind?

   All this and much more of a like nature, and even far more disgraceful
   and offensive details, have the Greeks narrated, O King, concerning
   their gods;--details which it is not proper either to state or for a
   moment to remember.  And hence mankind, taking an impulse from their
   gods, practised all lawlessness and brutality and impiety, polluting
   both earth and air by their awful deeds.

   XII.  The Egyptians, again, being more stupid and witless than these
   have gone further astray than all the nations.  For they were not
   content with the objects of worship of the Chaldæans and the Greeks,
   but in addition to these brought forward also brute creatures as gods,
   both land and water animals, and plants and herbs; and they were
   defiled with all madness and brutality more deeply than all the nations
   on the earth.

   For originally they worshipped Isis, who had Osiris as brother and
   husband.  He was slain by his own brother Typhon; and therefore Isis
   with Horos her son fled for refuge to Byblus in Syria, mourning for
   Osiris with bitter lamentation, until Horos grew up and slew Typhon.
   So that neither had Isis power to help her own brother and husband; nor
   could Osiris defend himself when he was being slain by Typhon; nor did
   Typhon, the slayer of his brother, when he was perishing at the hands
   of Horos and Isis, find means to rescue himself from death.  And though
   they were revealed in their true character by such mishaps, they were
   believed to be very gods by the simple Egyptians, who were not
   satisfied even with these or the other deities of the nations, but
   brought forward also brute creatures as gods.  For some of them
   worshipped the sheep, and some the goat; another tribe (worshipped) the
   bull and the pig; others again, the raven and the hawk, and the vulture
   and the eagle; and others the crocodile; and some the cat and the dog,
   and the wolf and the ape, and the dragon and the asp; and others the
   onion and the garlic and thorns and other created things.  And the poor
   creatures do not perceive about all these that they are utterly
   helpless.  For though they see their gods eaten by men of other tribes,
   and burnt as offerings and slain as victims and mouldering in decay,
   they have not perceived that they are not gods.

   XIII.  So the Egyptians and the Chaldæans and the Greeks made a great
   error in bringing forward such beings as gods, and in making images of
   them, and in deifying dumb and senseless idols.

   And I wonder how they saw their gods sawn out and hacked and docked by
   the workmen, and besides aging with time and falling to pieces, and
   being cast from metal, and yet did not discern concerning them that
   they were not gods.

   For when they have no power to see to their own safety, how will they
   take forethought for men?

   But further, the poets and philosophers, alike of the Chaldæans and the
   Greeks and the Egyptians, while they desired by their poems and
   writings to magnify the gods of their countries, rather revealed their
   shame, and laid it bare before all men.  For if the body of man while
   consisting of many parts does not cast off any of its own members, but
   preserving an unbroken unity in all its members, is harmonious with
   itself, how shall variance and discord be so great in the nature of
   God?

   For if there had been a unity of nature among the gods, then one god
   ought not to have pursued or slain or injured another.  And if the gods
   were pursued by gods, and slain, and kidnapped and struck with
   lightning by them, then there is no longer any unity of nature, but
   divided counsels, all mischievous.  So that not one of them is a god.
   It is clear then, O King, that all their discourse on the nature of the
   gods is an error.

   But how did the wise and erudite men of the Greeks not observe that
   inasmuch as they make laws for themselves they are judged by their own
   laws?  For if the laws are righteous, their gods are altogether
   unrighteous, as they have committed transgressions of laws, in slaying
   one another, and practising sorceries, and adultery and thefts and
   intercourse with males.  If they were right in doing these things, then
   the laws are unrighteous, being framed contrary to the gods.  Whereas
   in fact, the laws are good and just, commending what is good and
   forbidding what is bad.  But the deeds of their gods are contrary to
   law.  Their gods, therefore, are lawbreakers, and all liable to the
   punishment of death; and they are impious men who introduce such gods.
   For if the stories about them be mythical, the gods are nothing more
   than mere names; and if the stories be founded on nature, still they
   who did and suffered these things are no longer gods; and if the
   stories be allegorical, they are myths and nothing more.

   It has been shown then, O King, that all these polytheistic objects of
   worship are the works of error and perdition.  For it is not right to
   give the name of gods to beings which may be seen but cannot see; but
   one ought to reverence the invisible and all-seeing and all-creating
   God.

   XIV.  Let us proceed then, O King, to the Jews also, that we may see
   what truth there is in their view of God.  For they were descendants of
   Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and migrated to Egypt.  And thence God
   brought them forth with a mighty hand and an uplifted arm through
   Moses, their lawgiver; and by many wonders and signs He made known His
   power to them.  But even they proved stubborn and ungrateful, and often
   served the idols of the nations, and put to death the prophets and just
   men who were sent to them.  Then when the Son of God was pleased to
   come upon the earth, they received him with wanton violence and
   betrayed him into the hands of Pilate the Roman governor; and paying no
   respect to his good deeds and the countless miracles he wrought among
   them, they demanded a sentence of death by the cross.

   And they perished by their own transgression; for to this day they
   worship the one God Almighty, but not according to knowledge.  For they
   deny that Christ is the Son of God; and they are much like to the
   heathen, even although they may seem to make some approach to the truth
   from which they have removed themselves.  So much for the Jews.

   XV.  Now the Christians [4423] trace their origin from the Lord Jesus
   Christ.  And He is acknowledged by the Holy Spirit to be the son of the
   most high God, who came down from heaven for the salvation of men.  And
   being born of a pure virgin, unbegotten and immaculate, He assumed
   flesh and revealed himself among men that He might recall them to
   Himself from their wandering after many gods.  And having accomplished
   His wonderful dispensation, by a voluntary choice He tasted death on
   the cross, fulfilling an august dispensation.  And after three days He
   came to life again and ascended into heaven.  And if you would read, O
   King, you may judge the glory of His presence from the holy gospel
   writing, as it is called among themselves.  He had twelve disciples,
   who after His ascension to heaven went forth into the provinces of the
   whole world, and declared His greatness.  As for instance, one of them
   traversed the countries about us, proclaiming the doctrine of the
   truth.  From this it is, that they who still observe the righteousness
   enjoined by their preaching are called Christians.

   And these are they who more than all the nations on the earth have
   found the truth.  For they know God, the Creator and Fashioner of all
   things through the only-begotten Son and the Holy Spirit [4424] ; and
   beside Him they worship no other God.  They have the commands of the
   Lord Jesus Christ Himself graven upon their hearts; and they observe
   them, looking forward to the resurrection of the dead and life in the
   world to come.  They do not commit adultery nor fornication, nor bear
   false witness, nor covet the things of others; they honour father and
   mother, and love their neighbours; they judge justly, and they never do
   to others what they would not wish to happen to themselves; they appeal
   to those who injure them, and try to win them as friends; they are
   eager to do good to their enemies; they are gentle and easy to be
   entreated; they abstain from all unlawful conversation and from all
   impurity; they despise not the widow, nor oppress the orphan; and he
   that has, gives ungrudgingly for the maintenance of him who has not.

   If they see a stranger, they take him under their roof, and rejoice
   over him as over a very brother; for they call themselves brethren not
   after the flesh but after the spirit.

   And they are ready to sacrifice their lives for the sake of Christ; for
   they observe His commands without swerving, and live holy and just
   lives, as the Lord God enjoined upon them.

   And they give thanks unto Him every hour, for all meat and drink and
   other blessings.

   XVI.  Verily then, this is the way of the truth which leads those who
   travel therein to the everlasting kingdom promised through Christ in
   the life to come.  And that you may know, O King, that in saying these
   things I do not speak at my own instance, if you deign to look into the
   writings of the Christians, you will find that I state nothing beyond
   the truth.  Rightly then, did thy son [4425] apprehend, and justly was
   he taught to serve the living God and to be saved for the age that is
   destined to come upon us.  For great and wonderful are the sayings and
   deeds of the Christians; for they speak not the words of men but those
   of God.  But the rest of the nations go astray and deceive themselves;
   for they walk in darkness and bruise themselves like drunken men.

   XVII.  Thus far, O King, extends my discourse to you, which has been
   dictated in my mind by the Truth. [4426]   Wherefore let thy foolish
   sages cease their idle talk against the Lord; for it is profitable for
   you to worship God the Creator, and to give ear to His incorruptible
   words, that ye may escape from condemnation and punishment, and be
   found to be heirs of life everlasting.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4418] The Greek might be rendered, "so far as there was room for me to
   speak of Him," i.e., the attributes of the Deity are not further
   relevant to the discussion--as the translator into Syriac takes it.
   The Armenian adopts the other meaning, viz., the theme is beyond man's
   power to discuss.  As translated by F. C. Conybeare, the Armenian is in
   these words:  "Now by the grace of God it was given me to speak wisely
   concerning Him.  So far as I have received the faculty I will speak,
   yet not according to the measure of the inscrutability of His greatness
   shall I be able to do so, but by faith alone do I glorify and adore
   Him."

   [4419] The "King" in the Greek is Abenner, the father of Josaphat; in
   the Syriac, as in the Greek originally, he is the Roman Emperor,
   Hadrian.

   [4420] The Armenian and Syriac agree in giving four races, which was
   probably the original division.  To a Greek, men were either Greeks or
   Barbarians; to a Greek Christian it would seem necessary to add two new
   peoples, Jews and Christians.  The Greek calls the Barbarians
   "Chaldæans."  This change of classification is probably the cause of
   the omission in the Greek of the preliminary accounts of the four
   classes.  The Greek blends the summaries with the fuller accounts.

   [4421] "I do not think it out of place here to mention Antinous of our
   day [a slave of the Emperor Hadrian], whom all, not withstanding they
   knew who and whence he was, yet affected to worship as a god."--Justin
   Martyr quoted in Eusebius Hist. Bk. IV., c. 8.

   [4422] The passage in brackets occurs earlier in "Barlaam and
   Josaphat," and is restored to its place by J. A. Robinson.

   [4423] This, the "Christological" passage, occurs earlier in the
   Syriac.  Chap. II.

   [4424] The Armenian agrees with the Greek against the Syriac.  "Uná cum
   Spiritu Sancto" Arm.

   [4425] The reference is to Josaphat, son of Abenner, who was taught to
   be a Christian by the monk Barlaam.

   [4426] Nachor, the fictitious monk who represented Barlaam, intended to
   make a weak defence of Christianity, but, according to the story, he
   was constrained to speak what he had not intended.  It is evidently the
   author's intention to make it an instance of "suggestio verborum" or
   plenary inspiration, in the case of the fictitious monk.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The Apology of Aristides the Philosopher.

   Translated from the Syriac.

   ------------------------

   Aristedes.

   Here follows the defence which Aristides the philosopher made before
   Hadrian the King on behalf of reverence for God.

   ...All-powerful Cæsar Titus Hadrianus Antoninus, venerable and
   merciful, from Marcianus Aristides, an Athenian philosopher. [4427]

   I.  I, O King, by the grace of God came into this world; and when I had
   considered the heaven and the earth and the seas, and had surveyed the
   sun and the rest of creation, I marvelled at the beauty of the world.
   And I perceived that the world and all that is therein are moved by the
   power of another; and I understood that he who moves them is God, who
   is hidden in them, and veiled by them.  And it is manifest that that
   which causes motion is more powerful than that which is moved.  But
   that I should make search concerning this same mover of all, as to what
   is his nature (for it seems to me, he is indeed unsearchable in his
   nature), and that I should argue as to the constancy of his government,
   so as to grasp it fully,--this is a vain effort for me; for it is not
   possible that a man should fully comprehend it.  I say, however,
   concerning this mover of the world, that he is God of all, who made all
   things for the sake of mankind.  And it seems to me that this is
   reasonable, that one should fear God and should not oppress man.

   I say, then, that God is not born, not made, an ever-abiding nature
   without beginning and without end, immortal, perfect, and
   incomprehensible.  Now when I say that he is "perfect," this means that
   there is not in him any defect, and he is not in need of anything but
   all things are in need of him.  And when I say that he is "without
   beginning," this means that everything which has beginning has also an
   end, and that which has an end may be brought to an end.  He has no
   name, for everything which has a name is kindred to things created.
   Form he has none, nor yet any union of members; for whatsoever
   possesses these is kindred to things fashioned.  He is neither male nor
   female. [4428]   The heavens do not limit him, but the heavens and all
   things, visible and invisible, receive their bounds from him.
   Adversary he has none, for there exists not any stronger than he.
   Wrath and indignation he possesses not, for there is nothing which is
   able to stand against him.  Ignorance and forgetfulness are not in his
   nature, for he is altogether wisdom and understanding; and in Him
   stands fast all that exists.  He requires not sacrifice and libation,
   nor even one of things visible; He requires not aught from any, but all
   living creatures stand in need of him.

   II.  Since, then, we have addressed you concerning God, so far as our
   discourse can bear upon him, let us now come to the race of men, that
   we may know which of them participate in the truth of which we have
   spoken, and which of them go astray from it.

   This is clear to you, O King, that there are four classes of men in
   this world:--Barbarians and Greeks, Jews and Christians.  The
   Barbarians, indeed, trace the origin of their kind of religion from
   Kronos and from Rhea and their other gods; the Greeks, however, from
   Helenos, who is said to be sprung from Zeus.  And by Helenos there were
   born Aiolos and Xuthos; and there were others descended from Inachos
   and Phoroneus, and lastly from the Egyptian Danaos and from Kadmos and
   from Dionysos.

   The Jews, again, trace the origin of their race from Abraham, who begat
   Isaac, of whom was born Jacob.  And he begat twelve sons who migrated
   from Syria to Egypt; and there they were called the nation of the
   Hebrews, by him who made their laws; and at length they were named
   Jews.

   The Christians, then, trace the beginning of their religion from Jesus
   the Messiah; and he is named the Son of God Most High.  And it is said
   that God came down from heaven, and from a Hebrew virgin assumed and
   clothed himself with flesh; and the Son of God lived in a daughter of
   man.  This is taught in the gospel, as it is called, which a short time
   ago was preached among them; and you also if you will read therein, may
   perceive the power which belongs to it.  This Jesus, then, was born of
   the race of the Hebrews; and he had twelve disciples in order that the
   purpose of his incarnation [4429] might in time be accomplished.  But
   he himself was pierced by the Jews, and he died and was buried; and
   they say that after three days he rose and ascended to heaven.
   Thereupon these twelve disciples went forth throughout the known parts
   of the world, and kept showing his greatness with all modesty and
   uprightness.  And hence also those of the present day who believe that
   preaching are called Christians, and they are become famous.

   So then there are, as I said above, four classes of men:--Barbarians
   and Greeks, Jews and Christians.

   Moreover the wind is obedient to God, and fire to the angels; the
   waters also to the demons and the earth to the sons of men. [4430]

   III.  Let us begin, then, with the Barbarians, and go on to the rest of
   the nations one after another, that we may see which of them hold the
   truth as to God and which of them hold error.

   The Barbarians, then, as they did not apprehend God, went astray among
   the elements, and began to worship things created instead of their
   Creator; [4431] and for this end they made images and shut them up in
   shrines, and lo! they worship them, guarding them the while with much
   care, lest their gods be stolen by robbers.  And the Barbarians did not
   observe that that which acts as guard is greater than that which is
   guarded, and that everyone who creates is greater than that which is
   created.  If it be, then, that their gods are too feeble to see to
   their own safety, how will they take thought for the safety of men?
   Great then is the error into which the Barbarians wandered in
   worshipping lifeless images which can do nothing to help them.  And I
   am led to wonder, O King, at their philosophers, how that even they
   went astray, and gave the name of gods to images which were made in
   honour of the elements; and that their sages did not perceive that the
   elements also are dissoluble and perishable.  For if a small part of an
   element is dissolved or destroyed, the whole of it may be dissolved and
   destroyed.  If then the elements themselves are dissolved and destroyed
   and forced to be subject to another that is more stubborn than they,
   and if they are not in their nature gods, why, forsooth, do they call
   the images which are made in their honour, God?  Great, then, is the
   error which the philosophers among them have brought upon their
   followers.

   IV.  Let us turn now, O King, to the elements in themselves, that we
   may make clear in regard to them, that they are not gods, but a created
   thing, liable to ruin and change, which is of the same nature as man;
   whereas God is imperishable and unvarying, and invisible, while yet He
   sees, and overrules, and transforms all things.

   Those then who believe concerning the earth that it is a god have
   hitherto deceived themselves, since it is furrowed and set with plants
   and trenched; and it takes in the filthy refuse of men and beasts and
   cattle.  And at times it becomes unfruitful, for if it be burnt to
   ashes it becomes devoid of life, for nothing germinates from an earthen
   jar.  And besides if water be collected upon it, it is dissolved
   together with its products.  And it is trodden under foot of men and
   beast, and receives the bloodstains of the slain; and it is dug open,
   and filled with the dead, and becomes a tomb for corpses.  But it is
   impossible that a nature, which is holy and worthy and blessed and
   immortal, should allow of anyone of these things.  And hence it appears
   to us that the earth is not a god but a creation of God.

   V.  In the same way, again, those erred who believed the waters to be
   gods.  For the waters were created for the use of man, and are put
   under his rule in many ways.  For they suffer change and admit
   impurity, and are destroyed and lose their nature while they are boiled
   into many substances.  And they take colours which do not belong to
   them; they are also congealed by frost and are mingled and permeated
   with the filth of men and beasts, and with the blood of the slain.  And
   being checked by skilled workmen through the restraint of aqueducts,
   they flow and are diverted against their inclination, and come into
   gardens and other places in order that they may be collected and issue
   forth as a means of fertility for man, and that they may cleanse away
   every impurity and fulfil the service man requires from them.
   Wherefore it is impossible that the waters should be a god, but they
   are a work of God and a part of the world.

   In like manner also they who believed that fire is a god erred to no
   slight extent.  For it, too, was created for the service of men, and is
   subject to them in many ways:--in the preparation of meat, and as a
   means of casting metals, and for other ends whereof your Majesty is
   aware.  At the same time it is quenched and extinguished in many ways.

   Again they also erred who believed the motion of the winds to be a
   god.  For it is well known to us that those winds are under the
   dominion of another, at times their motion increases, and at times it
   fails and ceases at the command of him who controls them.  For they
   were created by God for the sake of men, in order to supply the
   necessity of trees and fruits and seeds; and to bring over the sea
   ships which convey for men necessaries and goods from places where they
   are found to places where they are not found; and to govern the
   quarters of the world.  And as for itself, at times it increases and
   again abates; and in one place brings help and in another causes
   disaster at the bidding of him who rules it.  And mankind too are able
   by known means to confine and keep it in check in order that it may
   fulfil for them the service they require from it.  And of itself it has
   not any authority at all.  And hence it is impossible that the winds
   should be called gods, but rather a thing made by God.

   VI.  So also they erred who believed that the sun is a god.  For we see
   that it is moved by the compulsion of another, and revolves and makes
   its journey, and proceeds from sign to sign, rising and setting every
   day, so as to give warmth for the growth of plants and trees, and to
   bring forth into the air where with it (sunlight) is mingled every
   growing thing which is upon the earth.  And to it there belongs by
   comparison a part in common with the rest of the stars in its course;
   and though it is one in its nature it is associated with many parts for
   the supply of the needs of men; and that not according to its own will
   but rather according to the will of him who rules it.  And hence it is
   impossible that the sun should be a god, but the work of God; and in
   like manner also the moon and the stars.

   VII.  And those who believed of the men of the past, that some of them
   were gods, they too were much mistaken.  For as you yourself allow, O
   King, man is constituted of the four elements and of a soul and a
   spirit (and hence he is called a microcosm), [4432] and without anyone
   of these parts he could not consist.  He has a beginning and an end,
   and he is born and dies.  But God, as I said, has none of these things
   in his nature, but is uncreated and imperishable.  And hence it is not
   possible that we should set up man to be of the nature of God:--man, to
   whom at times when he looks for joy, there comes trouble, and when he
   looks for laughter there comes to him weeping,--who is wrathful and
   covetous and envious, with other defects as well.  And he is destroyed
   in many ways by the elements and also by the animals.

   And hence, O King, we are bound to recognize the error of the
   Barbarians, that thereby, since they did not find traces of the true
   God, they fell aside from the truth, and went after the desire of their
   imagination, serving the perishable elements and lifeless images, and
   through their error not apprehending what the true God is.

   VIII.  Let us turn further to the Greeks also, that we may know what
   opinion they hold as to the true God.  The Greeks, then, because they
   are more subtle than the Barbarians, have gone further astray than the
   Barbarians; inasmuch as they have introduced many fictitious gods, and
   have set up some of them as males and some as females; and in that some
   of their gods were found who were adulterers, and did murder, and were
   deluded, and envious, and wrathful and passionate, and parricides, and
   thieves, and robbers.  And some of them, they say, were crippled and
   limped, and some were sorcerers, and some actually went mad, and some
   played on lyres, and some were given to roaming on the hills, and some
   even died, and some were struck dead by lightning, and some were made
   servants even to men, and some escaped by flight, and some were
   kidnapped by men, and some, indeed, were lamented and deplored by men.
   And some, they say, went down to Sheol, and some were grievously
   wounded, and some transformed themselves into the likeness of animals
   to seduce the race of mortal women, and some polluted themselves [4433]
   by lying with males.  And some, they say, were wedded to their mothers
   and their sisters and their daughters.  And they say of their gods that
   they committed adultery with the daughters of men; and of these there
   was born a certain race which also was mortal.  And they say that some
   of the females disputed about beauty, and appeared before men for
   judgment.  Thus, O King, have the Greeks put forward foulness, and
   absurdity, and folly about their gods and about themselves, in that
   they have called those that are of such a nature gods, who are no
   gods.  And hence mankind have received incitements to commit adultery
   and fornication, and to steal and to practise all that is offensive and
   hated and abhorred.  For if they who are called their gods practised
   all these things which are written above, how much more should men
   practise them--men, who believe that their gods themselves practised
   them.  And owing to the foulness of this error there have happened to
   mankind harassing wars, and great famines, and bitter captivity, and
   complete desolation.  And lo! it was by reason of this alone that they
   suffered and that all these things came upon them; and while they
   endured those things they did not perceive in their mind that for their
   error those things came upon them.

   IX.  Let us proceed further to their account of their gods that we may
   carefully demonstrate all that is said above.  First of all, the Greeks
   bring forward as a god Kronos, that is to say Chiun [4434] (Saturn).
   And his worshippers sacrifice their children to him, and they burn some
   of them alive in his honour.  And they say that he took to him among
   his wives Rhea, and begat many children by her.  By her too he begat
   Dios, who is called Zeus.  And at length he (Kronos) went mad, and
   through fear of an oracle that had been made known to him, he began to
   devour his sons.  And from him Zeus was stolen away without his
   knowledge; and at length Zeus bound him, and mutilated the signs of his
   manhood, and flung them into the sea.  And hence, as they say in fable,
   there was engendered Aphrodite, who is called Astarte.  And he (Zeus)
   cast out Kronos fettered into darkness.  Great then is the error and
   ignominy which the Greeks have brought forward about the first of their
   gods, in that they have said all this about him, O King.  It is
   impossible that a god should be bound or mutilated; and if it be
   otherwise, he is indeed miserable.

   And after Kronos they bring forward another god Zeus.  And they say of
   him that he assumed the sovereignty, and was king over all the gods.
   And they say that he changed himself into a beast and other shapes in
   order to seduce mortal women, and to raise up by them children for
   himself.  Once, they say, he changed himself into a bull through love
   of Europe and Pasiphae. [4435]   And again he changed himself into the
   likeness of gold through love of Danae, and to a swan through love of
   Leda, and to a man through love of Antiope, and to lightning through
   love of Luna, [4436] and so by these he begat many children.  For by
   Antiope, they say, that he begat Zethus and Amphion, and by Luna
   Dionysos, by Alcmena Hercules, and by Leto, Apollo and Artemis, and by
   Danae Perseus, and by Leda, Castor and Polydeuces, and Helene and
   Paludus, [4437] and by Mnemosyne he begat nine daughters whom they
   styled the Muses, and by Europe, Minos and Rhadamanthos and Sarpedon.
   And lastly he changed himself into the likeness of an eagle through his
   passion for Ganydemos (Ganymede) the shepherd.

   By reason of these tales, O King, much evil has arisen among men, who
   to this day are imitators of their gods, and practise adultery and
   defile themselves with their mothers and their sisters, and by lying
   with males, and some make bold to slay even their parents.  For if he
   who is said to be the chief and king of their gods do these things how
   much more should his worshippers imitate him?  And great is the folly
   which the Greeks have brought forward in their narrative concerning
   him.  For it is impossible that a god should practise adultery or
   fornication or come near to lie with males, or kill his parents; and if
   it be otherwise, he is much worse than a destructive demon.

   X.  Again they bring forward as another god Hephaistos.  And they say
   of him, that he is lame, and a cap is set on his head, and he holds in
   his hands firetongs and a hammer; and he follows the craft of iron
   working, that thereby he may procure the necessaries of his
   livelihood.  Is then this god so very needy?  But it cannot be that a
   god should be needy or lame, else he is very worthless.

   And further they bring in another god and call him Hermes.  And they
   say that he is a thief, [4438] a lover of avarice, and greedy for gain,
   and a magician and mutilated and an athlete, and an interpreter of
   language.  But it is impossible that a god should be a magician or
   avaricious, or maimed, or craving for what is not his, or an athlete.
   And if it be otherwise, he is found to be useless.

   And after him they bring forward as another god Asklepios.  And they
   say that he is a physician and prepares drugs and plaster that he may
   supply the necessaries of his livelihood.  Is then this god in want?
   And at length he was struck with lightning by Dios on account of
   Tyndareos of Lacedæmon, and so he died.  If then Asklepios were a god,
   and, when he was struck with lightning, was unable to help himself, how
   should he be able to give help to others?  But that a divine nature
   should be in want or be destroyed by lightning is impossible.

   And again they bring forward another as a god, and they call him Ares.
   And they say that he is a warrior, and jealous, and covets sheep and
   things which are not his.  And he makes gain by his arms.  And they say
   that at length he committed adultery with Aphrodite, and was caught by
   the little boy Eros and by Hephaistos the husband of Aphrodite.  But it
   is impossible that a god should be a warrior or bound or an adulterer.

   And again they say of Dionysos that he forsooth! is a god, who arranges
   carousals by night, and teaches drunkenness, and carries off women who
   do not belong to him.  And at length, they say, he went mad and
   dismissed his handmaidens and fled into the desert; and during his
   madness he ate serpents.  And at last he was killed by Titanos.  If
   then Dionysos were a god, and when he was being killed was unable to
   help himself, how is it possible that he should help others?

   Herakles next they bring forward and say that he is a god, who hates
   detestable things, a tyrant, [4439] and warrior and a destroyer of
   plagues.  And of him also they say that at length he became mad and
   killed his own children, and cast himself into a fire and died.  If
   then Herakles is a god, and in all these calamities was unable to
   rescue himself, how should others ask help from him?  But it is
   impossible that a god should be mad, or drunken or a slayer of his
   children, or consumed by fire.

   XI.  And after him they bring forward another god and call him
   Apollon.  And they say that he is jealous and inconstant, and at times
   he holds the bow and quiver, and again the lyre and plectron.  And he
   utters oracles for men that he may receive rewards from them.  Is then
   this god in need of rewards?  But it is an insult that all these things
   should be found with a god.

   And after him they bring forward as a goddess Artemis, the sister of
   Apollo; and they say that she was a huntress and that she herself used
   to carry a bow and bolts, and to roam about upon the mountains, leading
   the hounds to hunt stags or wild boars of the field.  But it is
   disgraceful that a virgin maid should roam alone upon the hills or hunt
   in the chase for animals.  Wherefore it is impossible that Artemis
   should be a goddess.

   Again they say of Aphrodite that she indeed is a goddess.  And at times
   she dwells with their gods, but at other times she is a neighbour to
   men.  And once she had Ares as a lover, and again Adonis who is
   Tammuz.  Once also, Aphrodite was wailing and weeping for the death of
   Tammuz, and they say that she went down to Sheol that she might redeem
   Adonis from Persephone, who is the daughter of Sheol (Hades).  If then
   Aphrodite is a goddess and was unable to help her lover at his death,
   how will she find it possible to help others?  And this cannot be
   listened to, that a divine nature should come to weeping and wailing
   and adultery.

   And again they say of Tammuz that he is a god.  And he is, forsooth! a
   hunter and an adulterer.  And they say that he was killed by a wound
   from a wild boar, without being able to help himself.  And if he could
   not help himself, how can he take thought for the human race?  But that
   a god should be an adulterer or a hunter or should die by violence is
   impossible.

   Again they say of Rhea that she is the mother of their gods.  And they
   say that she had once a lover Atys, and that she used to delight in
   depraved men.  And at last she raised a lamentation and mourned for
   Atys her lover.  If then the mother of their gods was unable to help
   her lover and deliver him from death, how can she help others?  So it
   is disgraceful that a goddess should lament and weep and take delight
   in depraved men.

   Again they introduce Kore and say that she is a goddess, and she was
   stolen away by Pluto, and could not help herself.  If then she is a
   goddess and was unable to help herself how will she find means to help
   others?  For a god who is stolen away is very powerless.

   All this, then, O King, have the Greeks brought forward concerning
   their gods, and they have invented and declared it concerning them.
   And hence all men received an impulse to work all profanity and all
   defilements; and hereby the whole earth was corrupted.

   XII.  The Egyptians, moreover, because they are more base and stupid
   than every people that is on the earth, have themselves erred more than
   all.  For the deities (or religion) of the Barbarians and the Greeks
   did not suffice for them, but they introduced some also of the nature
   of the animals, and said thereof that they were gods, and likewise of
   creeping things which are found on the dry land and in the waters.  And
   of plants and herbs they said that some of them were gods.  And they
   were corrupted by every kind of delusion and defilement more than every
   people that is on the earth.  For from ancient times they worshipped
   Isis, and they say that she is a goddess whose husband was Osiris her
   brother.  And when Osiris was killed by Typhon his brother, Isis fled
   with Horos her son to Byblus in Syria, and was there for a certain time
   till her son was grown.  And he contended with Typhon his uncle, and
   killed him.  And then Isis returned and went about with Horos her son
   and sought for the dead body of Osiris her lord, bitterly lamenting his
   death.  If then Isis be a goddess, and could not help Osiris her
   brother and lord, how can she help another?  But it is impossible that
   a divine nature should be afraid, and flee for safety, or should weep
   and wail; or else it is very miserable.

   And of Osiris also they say that he is a serviceable god.  And he was
   killed by Typhon and was unable to help himself.  But it is well known
   that this cannot be asserted of divinity.  And further, they say of his
   brother Typhon that he is a god, who killed his brother and was killed
   by his brother's son and by his bride, being unable to help himself.
   And how, pray, is he a god who does not save himself ?

   As the Egyptians, then, were more stupid than the rest of the nations,
   these and such like gods did not suffice for them.  Nay, but they even
   apply the name of gods to animals in which there is no soul at all.
   For some of them worship the sheep and others the calf; and some the
   pig and others the shad fish; and some the crocodile and the hawk and
   the fish and the ibis and the vulture and the eagle and the raven.
   Some of them worship the cat, and others the turbotfish, some the dog,
   some the adder, and some the asp, and others the lion; and others the
   garlic and onions and thorns, and others the tiger and other such
   things.  And the poor creatures do not see that all these things are
   nothing, although they daily witness their gods being eaten and
   consumed by men and also by their fellows; while some of them are
   cremated, and some die and decay and become dust, without their
   observing that they perish in many ways.  So the Egyptians have not
   observed that such things which are not equal to their own deliverance,
   are not gods.  And if, forsooth, they are weak in the case of their own
   deliverance, whence have they power to help in the case of deliverance
   of their worshippers?  Great then is the error into which the Egyptians
   wandered;--greater, indeed, than that of any people which is upon the
   face of the earth.

   XIII.  But it is a marvel, O King, with regard to the Greeks, who
   surpass all other peoples in their manner of life and reasoning, how
   they have gone astray after dead idols and lifeless images.  And yet
   they see their gods in the hands of their artificers being sawn out,
   and planed and docked, and hacked short, and charred, and ornamented,
   and being altered by them in every kind of way.  And when they grow
   old, and are worn away through lapse of time, and when they are molten
   and crushed to powder, how, I wonder, did they not perceive concerning
   them, that they are not gods?  And as for those who did not find
   deliverance for themselves, how can they serve the distress of men?

   But even the writers and philosophers among them have wrongly alleged
   that the gods are such as are made in honour of God Almighty.  And they
   err in seeking to liken (them) to God whom man has not at any time seen
   nor can see unto what He is like.  Herein, too (they err) in asserting
   of deity that any such thing as deficiency can be present to it; as
   when they say that He receives sacrifice and requires burnt-offering
   and libation and immolations of men, and temples.  But God is not in
   need, and none of these things is necessary to Him; and it is clear
   that men err in these things they imagine.

   Further their writers and their philosophers represent and declare that
   the nature of all their gods is one.  And they have not apprehended God
   our Lord who while He is one, is in all.  They err therefore.  For if
   the body of a man while it is many in its parts is not in dread, one
   member of another, but, since it is a united body, wholly agrees with
   itself; even so also God is one in His nature.  A single essence is
   proper to Him, since He is uniform in His nature and His essence; and
   He is not afraid of Himself.  If then the nature of the gods is one, it
   is not proper that a god should either pursue or slay or harm a god.
   If, then, gods be pursued and wounded by gods, and some be kidnapped
   and some struck dead by lightning, it is obvious that the nature of
   their gods is not one.  And hence it is known, O King, that it is a
   mistake when they reckon and bring the natures of their gods under a
   single nature.  If then it becomes us to admire a god which is seen and
   does not see, how much more praiseworthy is it that one should believe
   in a nature which is invisible and all-seeing?  And if further it is
   fitting that one should approve the handiworks of a craftsman, how much
   more is it fitting that one should glorify the Creator of the
   craftsman?

   For behold! when the Greeks made laws they did not perceive that by
   their laws they condemn their gods.  For if their laws are righteous,
   their gods are unrighteous, since they transgressed the law in killing
   one another, and practising sorcery, and committing adultery, and in
   robbing and stealing, and in lying with males, and by their other
   practises as well.  For if their gods were right in doing all these
   things as they are described, then the laws of the Greeks are
   unrighteous in not being made according to the will of their gods.  And
   in that case the whole world is gone astray.

   For the narratives about their gods are some of them myths, and some of
   them nature-poems (lit:  natural:--phusikai), and some of them hymns
   and elegies.  The hymns indeed and elegies are empty words and noise.
   But these nature-poems, even if they be made as they say, still those
   are not gods who do such things and suffer and endure such things.  And
   those myths are shallow tales with no depth whatever in them.

   XIV.  Let us come now, O King, to the history of the Jews also, and see
   what opinion they have as to God.  The Jews then say that God is one,
   the Creator of all, and omnipotent; and that it is not right that any
   other should be worshipped except this God alone.  And herein they
   appear to approach the truth more than all the nations, especially in
   that they worship God and not His works.  And they imitate God by the
   philanthropy which prevails among them; for they have compassion on the
   poor, and they release the captives, and bury the dead, and do such
   things as these, which are acceptable before God and well-pleasing also
   to men,--which (customs) they have received from their forefathers.

   Nevertheless they too erred from true knowledge.  And in their
   imagination they conceive that it is God they serve; whereas by their
   mode of observance it is to the angels and not to God that their
   service is rendered:--as when they celebrate sabbaths and the beginning
   of the months, and feasts of unleavened bread, and a great fast; and
   fasting and circumcision and the purification of meats, which things,
   however, they do not observe perfectly.

   XV.  But the Christians, O King, while they went about and made search,
   [4440] have found the truth; and as we learned from their writings,
   they have come nearer to truth and genuine knowledge than the rest of
   the nations.  For they know and trust in God, the Creator of heaven and
   of earth, in whom and from whom are all things, to whom there is no
   other god as companion, from whom they received commandments which they
   engraved upon their minds and observe in hope and expectation of the
   world which is to come.  Wherefore they do not commit adultery nor
   fornication, nor bear false witness, nor embezzle what is held in
   pledge, nor covet what is not theirs.  They honour father and mother,
   and show kindness to those near to them; and whenever they are judges,
   they judge uprightly.  They do not worship idols (made) in the image of
   man; and whatsoever they would not that others should do unto them,
   they do not to others; and of the food which is consecrated to idols
   they do not eat, for they are pure.  And their oppressors they appease
   (lit:  comfort) and make them their friends; they do good to their
   enemies; and their women, O King, are pure as virgins, and their
   daughters are modest; and their men keep themselves from every unlawful
   union and from all uncleanness, in the hope of a recompense to come in
   the other world.  Further, if one or other of them have bondmen and
   bondwomen or children, through love towards them they persuade them to
   become Christians, and when they have done so, they call them brethren
   without distinction.  They do not worship strange gods, and they go
   their way in all modesty and cheerfulness.  Falsehood is not found
   among them; and they love one another, and from widows they do not turn
   away their esteem; and they deliver the orphan from him who treats him
   harshly.  And he, who has, gives to him who has not, without boasting.
   And when they see a stranger, they take him in to their homes and
   rejoice over him as a very brother; for they do not call them brethren
   after the flesh, but brethren after the spirit and in God.  And
   whenever one of their poor passes from the world, each one of them
   according to his ability gives heed to him and carefully sees to his
   burial.  And if they hear that one of their number is imprisoned or
   afflicted on account of the name of their Messiah, all of them
   anxiously minister to his necessity, and if it is possible to redeem
   him they set him free.  And if there is among them any that is poor and
   needy, and if they have no spare food, they fast two or three days in
   order to supply to the needy their lack of food.  They observe the
   precepts of their Messiah with much care, living justly and soberly as
   the Lord their God commanded them.  Every morning [4441] and every hour
   they give thanks and praise to God for His loving-kindnesses toward
   them; and for their food and their drink they offer thanksgiving to
   Him.  And if any righteous man among them passes from the world, they
   rejoice and offer thanks to God; and they escort his body as if he were
   setting out from one place to another near.  And when a child has been
   born to one of them, they give thanks to God; and if moreover it happen
   to die in childhood, they give thanks to God the more, as for one who
   has passed through the world without sins.  And further if they see
   that anyone of them dies in his ungodliness or in his sins, for him
   they grieve bitterly, and sorrow as for one who goes to meet his doom.

   XVI.  Such, O King, is the commandment of the law of the Christians,
   and such is their manner of life.  As men who know God, they ask from
   Him petitions which are fitting for Him to grant and for them to
   receive.  And thus they employ their whole lifetime.  And since they
   know the loving-kindnesses of God toward them, behold! for their sake
   the glorious things which are in the world flow forth to view.  And
   verily, they are those who found the truth when they went about and
   made search for it; and from what we considered, we learned that they
   alone come near to a knowledge of the truth.  And they do not proclaim
   in the ears of the multitude the kind deeds they do, but are careful
   that no one should notice them; and they conceal their giving just as
   he who finds a treasure and conceals it.  And they strive to be
   righteous as those who expect to behold their Messiah, and to receive
   from Him with great glory the promises made concerning them.  And as
   for their words and their precepts, O King, and their glorying in their
   worship, and the hope of earning according to the work of each one of
   them their recompense which they look for in another world, you may
   learn about these from their writings.  It is enough for us to have
   shortly informed your Majesty concerning the conduct and the truth of
   the Christians.  For great indeed, and wonderful is their doctrine to
   him who will search into it and reflect upon it.  And verily, this is a
   new people, and there is something divine (lit:  a divine admixture) in
   the midst of them.

   Take, then, their writings, and read therein, and lo! you will find
   that I have not put forth these things on my own authority, nor spoken
   thus as their advocate; but since I read in their writings I was fully
   assured of these things as also of things which are to come.  And for
   this reason I was constrained to declare the truth to such as care for
   it and seek the world to come.  And to me there is no doubt but that
   the earth abides through the supplication of the Christians.  But the
   rest of the nations err and cause error in wallowing before the
   elements of the world, since beyond these their mental vision will not
   pass.  And they search about as if in darkness because they will not
   recognize the truth; and like drunken men they reel and jostle one
   another and fall.

   XVII.  Thus far, O King, I have spoken; for concerning that which
   remains, as is said above, [4442] there are found in their other
   writings things which are hard to utter and difficult for one to
   narrate,--which are not only spoken in words but also wrought out in
   deeds.

   Now the Greeks, O King, as they follow base practises in intercourse
   with males, and a mother and a sister and a daughter, impute their
   monstrous impurity in turn to the Christians.  But the Christians are
   just and good, and the truth is set before their eyes, and their spirit
   is long-suffering; and, therefore, though they know the error of these
   (the Greeks), and are persecuted by them, they bear and endure it; and
   for the most part they have compassion on them, as men who are
   destitute of knowledge.  And on their side, they offer prayer that
   these may repent of their error; and when it happens that one of them
   has repented, he is ashamed before the Christians of the works which
   were done by him; and he makes confession to God, saying, I did these
   things in ignorance.  And he purifies his heart, and his sins are
   forgiven him, because he committed them in ignorance in the former
   time, when he used to blaspheme and speak evil of the true knowledge of
   the Christians.  And assuredly the race of the Christians is more
   blessed than all the men who are upon the face of the earth.

   Henceforth let the tongues of those who utter vanity and harass the
   Christians be silent; and hereafter let them speak the truth.  For it
   is of serious consequence to them that they should worship the true God
   rather than worship a senseless sound.  And verily whatever is spoken
   in the mouth of the Christians is of God; and their doctrine is the
   gateway of light.  Wherefore let all who are without the knowledge of
   God draw near thereto; and they will receive incorruptible words, which
   are from all time and from eternity.  So shall they appear before the
   awful judgment which through Jesus the Messiah is destined to come upon
   the whole human race.

   The Apology of Aristides the Philosopher is finished.

   absent from the Greek as we have it; the Armenian has "To the Emperor
   Cæsar Hadrian from Aristides."  Various explanations are offered.  (a)
   Both emperors, as colleagues, may be meant.  In support of this the
   Syriac adjectives for "venerable and merciful" are marked plural; the
   phrase "Your majesty" occurring later has a plural suffix; and two
   Imperatives, "Take and read," are plural.  On the other hand "O King"
   occurs constantly in the singular; and the emperors were colleagues
   only for a few months in the year a.d. 138. (b)  The longer heading is
   the true one--the shorter being due perhaps to a scribe who had a
   collection of works to copy.  In that case the word "Hadrian" has been
   selected from the full title of Antonine, and the two adjectives
   "venerable and merciful" are proper names, Augustus Pius.  (Harris.)
   (c)  The shorter heading has the support of Eusebius and the Armenian
   version; and the translator into Syriac may have amplified. (***)
   Almighty is separated from the word for "God" by a pause, and is not an
   attribute which a Christian would care to apply to a Roman emperor.
   pantokrator may have been confounded with au tokrator.  Raabe supplies
   *** giving the sense "qui imperium (postatem) habet," as an epithet of
   Cæsar.  If *** ="Renewed, or dedicated again to...Antoninus Pius,"
   could be read, both headings might be retained.

   [4428] The Armenian adds, "For that which is subject to this
   distinction is moved by passions."

   [4429] Literally:  "a certain dispensation of his."  The Greek term
   oikonomia, "dispensation," suggests to the translator into Syriac the
   idea of the Incarnation, familiar, as it seems, by his time.  Professor
   Sachau reads the equivalent of thaumaste instead of *** (tis).  In the
   translation given *** is taken adverbially = aliquamdiu.

   [4430] This irrelevant sentence is found in the Armenian version also,
   and therefore was probably in the original Greek.  It seems to be an
   obiter dictum.  Men fall into four groups, and, by the way, so do the
   elements, air, fire, earth, and water; and the powers that govern
   them.  One quaternion suggests others.

   [4431] Cf. Rom. i. 25 and Col. ii. 8.

   [4432] Or "and hence the world also gets its name kosmos."  The Syriac
   is the equivalent of the Greek "dio kai kosmos kaleitai," which occurs
   (Chap. IV.) in discussing the supposed divinity of the sky or heaven.

   [4433] Professor Nöldeke's emendation, ***, in place of *** ="they were
   reviled," is adopted in the translation given.

   [4434] Cf. Amos v. 26, "Chiun, your star god," and Acts vii. 43.

   [4435] Pasiphae's unnatural passion for Taurus is not in the Greek
   mythology charged to Zeus.

   [4436] The visit of Zeus to Semele (not Selene) is evidently referred
   to.  Selene Luna would give the Syriac ***.

   [4437] Professor Rendel Harris pronounces "Paludus" a vox nihili, and
   explains its presence as due to a corrupt repetition of the preceding
   Polydeuces.  The Syriac word in the text suggests Pollux--the Latin
   equivalent of Polydeuces.  Clytemnestra is the name required.

   [4438] Adopting Professor Harris's emendation *** = kleptes instead of
   *** = vir.

   [4439] "Tyrant," ***, seems out of place when connected with Herakles.
   Perhaps *** = ebrius, which occurs at the close of the paragraph,
   should be read here.  Cf. also the Greek.

   [4440] The same two words are used of Isis.  The Christians are unlike
   her in finding what they sought.

   [4441] Cf. Pliny's letter to the Emperor Trajan, a.d. 112, "The
   Christians are wont to meet at dawn on an appointed day, and to sing a
   hymn to Christ as God."

   [4442] The Christian Scriptures are previously referred to as a source
   of information, not as containing difficulties.  cf. 2 Peter iii. 16.

   The Passion of the Scillitan Martyrs.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   The Scillitan Martyrs were condemned and executed at Carthage on the
   17th July, a.d. 180.  The martyrs belonged to Scili, a place in that
   part of Numidia which belonged to proconsular Africa.  The proconsul at
   the time, who is said by Tertullian to have been the first to draw the
   sword against the Christians there, was P. Vigellius Saturninus.  The
   consuls for the year were Præsens II. and Condianus.  Marcus Aurelius
   had died only a few months before.

   The exact date of the martyrdom was long under dispute, and the
   question has recently arisen whether the Acts were originally written
   in Latin or Greek.  Baronius placed the date as late as 202.  The text
   had become corrupt in passing through various Latin and Greek versions
   and transcriptions, and it was long impossible to recognize the names
   of the consuls for the year in the first line of the piece.  But M.
   Leon Renier conjectured that the word bis pointed to a consul's name
   underlying the word preceding it, and suggested the year 180, when
   Præsens and Condianus were consuls.  This conjecture was confirmed by
   Usener's publication in 1881 of a Greek version from a ninth century
   ms. in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris, though even here the names,
   though recognizable, were in a corrupt form.  Usener believed this
   version to be a translation from a Latin original, and his theory has
   been confirmed by Mr. Armitage Robinson's discovery of a Latin ms. of
   the ninth century in the British Museum, containing the Acts of the
   Scillitan Martyrs in a form briefer than any of the other versions and
   believed to be the original.  Mr. A. Robinson's translation which
   follows, is from the Latin which he discovered, and which is printed in
   Texts and Studies, vol. i., No. 2.

   The Passion of the Scillitan Martyrs.

   ------------------------

   When Præsens, for the second time, and Claudianus were the consuls, on
   the seventeenth day of July, at Carthage, there were set in the
   judgment-hall Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus, Donata, Secunda and
   Vestia.

   Saturninus the proconsul said:  Ye can win the indulgence of our lord
   the Emperor, if ye return to a sound mind.

   Speratus said:  We have never done ill, we have not lent ourselves to
   wrong, we have never spoken ill, but when ill-treated we have given
   thanks; because we pay heed to our Emperor.

   Saturninus the proconsul said:  We too are religious, and our religion
   is simple, and we swear by the genius of our lord the Emperor, and pray
   for his welfare, as ye also ought to do.

   Speratus said:  If thou wilt peaceably lend me thine ears, I can tell
   thee the mystery of simplicity.

   Saturninus said:  I will not lend mine ears to thee, when thou
   beginnest to speak evil things of our sacred rites; but rather swear
   thou by the genius of our lord the Emperor.

   Speratus said:  The empire of this world I know not; but rather I serve
   that God, whom no man hath seen, nor with these eyes can see. [4443]
   I have committed no theft; but if I have bought anything I pay the tax;
   because I know my Lord, the King of kings and Emperor of all nations.

   Saturninus the proconsul said to the rest:  Cease to be of this
   persuasion.

   Speratus said:  It is an ill persuasion to do murder, to speak false
   witness.

   Saturninus the proconsul said:  Be not partakers of this folly.

   Cittinus said:  We have none other to fear, save only our Lord God, who
   is in heaven.

   Donata said:  Honour to Cæsar as Cæsar:  but fear to God. [4444]

   Vestia said:  I am a Christian.

   Secunda said:  What I am, that I wish to be.

   Saturninus the proconsul said to Speratus:  Dost thou persist in being
   a Christian?

   Speratus said:  I am a Christian.  And with him they all agreed.

   Saturninus the proconsul said:  Will ye have a space to consider?

   Speratus said:  In a matter so straightforward there is no considering.

   Saturninus the proconsul said:  What are the things in your chest?

   Speratus said:  Books and epistles of Paul, a just man.

   Saturninus the proconsul said:  Have a delay of thirty days and bethink
   yourselves.

   Speratus said a second time:  I am a Christian.  And with him they all
   agreed.

   Saturninus the proconsul read out the decree from the tablet:
   Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus, Donata, Vestia, Secunda and the rest
   having confessed that they live according to the Christian rite, since
   after opportunity offered them of returning to the custom of the Romans
   they have obstinately persisted, it is determined that they be put to
   the sword.

   Speratus said:  We give thanks to God.

   Nartzalus said:  To-day we are martyrs in heaven; thanks be to God.

   Saturninus the proconsul ordered it to be declared by the herald:
   Speratus, Nartzalus, Cittinus, Veturius, Felix, Aquilinus, Lætantius,
   Januaria, Generosa, Vestia, Donata and Secunda, I have ordered to be
   executed.

   They all said:  Thanks be to God.

   And so they all together were crowned with martyrdom; and they reign
   with the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever.
   Amen.

   Origen's Commentary

   on the

   Gospel of John.

   Commentaries of Origen.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   For a general account of Origen and of his works we may refer to Dr.
   Crombie's Life of Origen, in vol. iv. of this series (xxiii. in Clark's
   issue).  The principal facts of his career are as follows:  He was born
   of Christian parents at Alexandria about the year 185 a.d., and from
   his earliest youth devoted himself to the study of Scripture in such a
   way as to suggest that he was destined for a great career.  His father
   suffered martyrdom in the year 202, and Origen very soon afterwards
   succeeded the great Clement as head of the school at Alexandria.
   Thirteen years after, the persecution of Caracalla drove him from his
   own country to Cæsarea, where though still a layman he preached at
   church meetings.  Recalled to Alexandria, he laboured there for fifteen
   years further as teacher and author, till in the year 231 his
   ordination at Cæsarea to the office of presbyter drew upon him the
   condemnation of the bishop of Alexandria and became the occasion of his
   permanent withdrawal from the place of his birth.  At Cæsarea he now
   formed a new school of Christian training similar to that from which he
   had been driven.  At this time, as well as in the earlier period of his
   life, he made various journeys to different parts of the world.  His
   death was brought about by sufferings inflicted on him in the
   persecution of Decius, and took place at Tyre, probably in the year
   254.

   Part of the Commentary on John, the first great work of Christian
   interpretation, and part of that on Matthew, written by the father at a
   later period of his life, are here presented to the reader; and a few
   words of introduction may be added on Origen's work as an expositor and
   on these two works in particular.

   Though Origen was the first great interpreter of Scripture in the
   Church, commentaries had been written before his.  He speaks of those
   who had preceded him in this activity; and though but little survives
   of the labours of these earlier expositors, we know that the work of
   commenting on Scripture was zealously carried on in the Gnostic
   churches in the latter part of the second century, and several of the
   older exegetes in the Church are also known to us by name and
   reputation.  Heracleon the Gnostic commentator on John, who is often
   cited and often rather unfairly dealt with by Origen, as he follows him
   over the same ground, belonged to the Valentinian school.  Many of his
   comments the reader will find to be very just and shrewd; but the
   tenets of his school led him into many extravagances.  Of Pantænus,
   head of the catechetical school at Alexandria in the end of the second
   and early years of the third century, we hear that he interpreted many
   of the books of Scripture.  We also learn that he preceded Clement and
   Origen, his successors in office, in the application of Gentile
   learning to Christian studies; the broad and liberal tone of
   Alexandrian theology may be due in part to his influence.  Much of his
   exegetical work was still extant in the days of Jerome, who, however,
   reports that he did more for the Church as a teacher than as a writer.
   Only fragments of his Commentaries now remain.  In Clement's works, on
   the contrary, we find, if not any set commentaries, various extended
   discussions of particular texts.  We also find in him a theory of
   Scripture, its inspiration and its nature, which is followed also by
   Origen, and which determines the whole character of Alexandrian
   exegesis.  In accordance with the general tendency of that age, which
   witnessed a reaction from the independence of philosophy and an appeal
   in many quarters to the authority of ancient oracles and writings, the
   Alexandrian school treats Scripture as an inspired and infallible
   storehouse of truth,--of truth, however, not patent to the simple
   reader, but requiring the spiritual man to discern its mystic import.
   Clement discusses the question why divine things are wrapped up in
   mysteries, and holds that all who have spoken of such things have dealt
   with them in this way.  Everything in Scripture, therefore, has a
   mystical in addition to its obvious meaning.  Every minute particular
   about the tabernacle and its furniture is charged with an unseen
   truth.  The effect of such a view of Scripture on exegesis is
   necessarily that the interpreter finds in the inspired words not what
   they plainly convey, but what most interests his own mind.  In
   assigning to each verse its spiritual meaning, he is neither guided nor
   restrained by any rule or system, but enjoys complete liberty.  The
   natural good sense of these great scholars curbed to some extent the
   licence of their theory; but with such a view of Scripture they could
   not but run into many an extravagance; and the allegorical method of
   interpretation, which so long prevailed in Christendom and is still
   practised in some quarters, dates from Alexandria.  The roots of it lie
   further back, in Jewish rabbinical treatment of the Old Testament, and
   in the Greek philosophy of Alexandria.  In Philo, the great
   contemporary of Christ at Alexandria, rabbinical and Greek learning
   met, and Scripture being a divine authority and having to furnish
   evidence of Greek philosophical doctrines, the allegorical method of
   interpretation was called to perform large services.  To Philo's eyes
   all wisdom was contained in the Pentateuch, and many an idea of which
   Moses never dreamed had to be extracted from that ancient record.  The
   method was older than Clement and Origen, but it was through them that
   it became so firmly established in the Church.

   In Origen we first find a great teacher who deliberately sets himself
   to the task of explaining Scripture.  He became, at the early age of
   eighteen, the head of the catechetical school at Alexandria, an
   institution which not only trained catechumens but provided open
   lectures, on every part of Christian learning, and from that time to
   his death, at the age of sixty-nine, he was constantly engaged in the
   work of public exposition.  At Alexandria his expositions took place in
   the school, but at Cæsarea they formed part of the church services, so
   that the reports of those belonging to the Cæsarean period provide us
   with the earliest examples we possess of the discourse at Christian
   meetings.  In an activity which he practised so much Origen acquired
   extraordinary skill and facility, and gained the highest reputation,
   even beyond the limits of the Church.  It is no wonder, therefore, if
   he succeeded in treating nearly the whole Bible in this way, a thing
   which might no doubt be said of many a Christian teacher since his day;
   for he was not one who was apt to repeat himself, but was constantly
   pressing on to break new ground.

   But the reported homilies form only a part--and that not the most
   important part--of his exegetical works.  What he gave in his homilies
   was necessarily designed for edification; it had to be plain enough to
   be understood by a mixed audience, and serviceable to their needs.
   Origen believed, however, that there was very much in Scripture that
   lay beyond the capacity of the ordinary mind, and that the highest way
   of treating Scripture was not that of practical application, but that
   of searching after its hidden sense.  In the fourth book of his De
   Principiis (vol. x. of Clark's set) he sets forth his views about the
   Scriptures.  "As man," he there says, "consists of body, soul, and
   spirit, so in the same way does Scripture, which has been arranged to
   be given by God for the salvation of man."  Scripture, therefore, has
   three senses, the bodily (somatic) or the obvious matter-of-fact sense,
   the psychical or moral sense, which serves for edification of the
   pious, and, highest of all, the spiritual sense.  For this latter sense
   of Scripture Origen has many names,--as many as forty have been
   counted,--he calls it the heavenly sense, the intellectual, the
   anagogical, the mystic, the hidden.  This is what chiefly engages his
   interest in the work of expounding.  Scripture is to him full of
   mysteries, every jot and tittle has its secret, and to read these
   heavenly mysteries is the highest object of the interpreter.  In
   addition, therefore, to his oral expositions (homiliai) and the short
   notes (semeioseis) which are generally reckoned as a third class of his
   exegetical works, we have the written commentaries, books, or tomoi of
   Origen, in which he discusses Scripture without being hampered by the
   requirements of edification, according to the method which alone he
   recognizes as adequate.  He was enabled to devote himself to this
   labour by the generosity of a rich friend, Ambrosius, who urged him to
   undertake it, and provided funds for the payment of shorthand writers
   and copyists.  We are told that seven of the former were at one time
   placed at his disposal.  The work which he was thus led to undertake
   Origen felt to be very responsible and burdensome; it was not to be
   approached without fervent prayer, and he sometimes complains that it
   is too much for him, and that it is only the urgent commands of
   Ambrosius that make him go on with it.  (See the opening chapters of
   the various books on John.)

   What has been said will to some extent explain the nature of these
   commentaries, parts of which are now for the first time presented to
   the English reader.  There is a side of them, however, of which we have
   not yet spoken.  Origen was a great scholar as well as a great
   theologian; and he thought it right, as the reader may see from the
   letter to Gregory also here given, that scholarship should contribute
   all it could to the study of Scripture.  Of his multifarious knowledge
   and of his easy command of all the science and philosophy of his day,
   the reader may judge for himself even from what is now presented to
   him.  His work on the words of Scripture has a value quite
   independently of his theological views.  Some of the most important
   qualifications of the worthy interpreter of Scripture he possesses in a
   supreme degree.  His knowledge of Scripture is extraordinary both for
   its range and its minute accuracy.  He had no concordance to help him;
   but he was himself a concordance.  Whatever word occurs he is able to
   bring from every part of Scripture the passages in which it is used.
   He quotes passages, it is true, which are only verbally connected with
   the text before him and have no affinity of idea; the wealth of
   illustration he has at his command does not always assist, but
   sometimes, as the reader will see, impedes his progress:  yet the
   wonder is not diminished of such a knowledge of all parts of the Bible
   as is probably without parallel.  It has to be added that he is strong
   in grammar, and has a true eye for the real meaning of his text; the
   discussions in which he does this often leave nothing to be desired.
   In defining his terms he often goes far astray; he has to define them
   according to the science of his day; but he is not guilty of loose
   construction of sentences.  Another matter in which he is distinguished
   is that of textual criticism.  He is the first great textual critic of
   the Church.  That his name occurs more frequently than that of any
   other father in the digests of early readings of the text of the New
   Testament, is due no doubt to the fact that he is the earliest writer
   of commentaries which have been preserved; his commentaries contain
   complete texts of the portions of Scripture commented on, as well as
   copious quotations from other parts of Scripture.  But he was keenly
   interested in the text of the New Testament for its own sake.  He tells
   us that many variations already existed in his day in different
   copies.  And he preserves many readings which afterwards disappeared
   from the Bible.  It has also to be said that he often quotes the same
   text differently in different passages, so that it appears probable
   that he used several copies of the N.T. books, and that these copies
   differed from each other.  If, therefore, as Tischendorf suggests,
   Origen made a collation of the various texts of the N.T. with which he
   was acquainted, as he did with his texts of the O.T. in his Hexapla, he
   had no strong views as to which text was to be followed.  He sometimes
   expresses an opinion as to which is the true reading (pp. 368 sq.), but
   he does so on grounds which the textual critics of the present day
   could not approve.

   It may be stated here that the translators of Origen in this volume
   have sought to represent their author's critical position with regard
   to Scripture by translating his Scripture quotations from his text.  As
   he used the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, many of his
   quotations from that part of Scripture appear in a form unfamiliar to
   the English reader.  In the New Testament, also, his text is also very
   different from that which afterwards prevailed in the Church.

   The weakness of Origen as an interpreter is his want of historical
   feeling or of any conception of such a thing as growth or development
   in revelation.  His mind slips incessantly away from the real scenes
   and events recorded in Scripture, to the ideal region where he
   conceives that the truths reside which these prefigure.  Scripture is
   to him not a record of actual occurrences which took place as they are
   narrated, but a storehouse of types of heavenly things, which alone are
   real.  He scoffs at the notion that historical facts should be regarded
   as the chief outcome of a Scripture narrative (John, book x. 15-17, pp.
   389-394).  When he does treat the facts as facts he has many a shrewd
   observation and many a beautiful application.  But the facts are to a
   large extent in his way; they have to give place to something more
   important.  He sees very well how the synoptic narratives clash with
   that of John; no better demonstration of this need be looked for than
   he gives in the tenth book of his John; from this, however, he infers
   not that the books must have had different sources of information, but
   that the literal meaning of the passages must be altogether
   disregarded, and their true purport looked for, not in the things of
   history, but in the things of the Spirit.  The water-pots at the feast
   in Cana (De Principiis), the shoe latchet of the Saviour (John, book
   vi. 17), the ass and foal (John, book x. 18), each must receive a
   transcendent application.

   It follows from this that the commentaries are deficient in order and
   sequence.  The method which calls the writer to look at every step for
   spiritual meanings, combined with his own extraordinary fertility of
   imagination and wealth of matter, makes these books very disconnected.
   At each point a number of questions suggests itself as to possible
   meanings; a host of texts is brought at once from every part of
   Scripture to afford illustration, and these again have to be
   considered.  Very modestly are the questions and themes introduced.
   The tone is as far as possible from being ex cathedra; it is rather
   that of a student groping his way, and asking at each step for
   assistance.  And the great mass of the questions thus raised is left,
   apparently, unanswered.  So that the work as a whole is rather a great
   collection of materials for future consideration than a finished
   treatise.

   Such being the characteristics of Origen's commentaries, they have by
   many been regarded as unsuitable for the general reader, and
   unfavourably compared with those of later writers, to whom the
   interpretation of Scripture was not weighted with such difficulties as
   Origen had to contend with.  Our author does not carry us along in his
   commentaries with a stream of golden eloquence; his interests are
   intellectual more than literary or practical, his work is scientific
   rather than popular.  Perhaps the historical student has more to gain
   from them than the preacher.  But among the pages which witness chiefly
   to restless intellectual energy and unwearied diligence, there are also
   many passages of rare and touching beauty, when the writer realizes the
   greatness of the Christian salvation, or when the heavenly things to
   the search for which all his labour is devoted shine by their own
   brightness on his sight.

   The Commentaries on John are the earliest work of Christian exegesis
   which has come down to us, and are therefore placed in this volume
   before those on Matthew.  The first five books on John were written at
   Alexandria before Origen's compulsory withdrawal from that city to
   Cæsarea in 231.  In chaps. 4 and 8 of the first book he speaks of this
   work as being the first fruits of his activity as a writer on Holy
   Scripture.  The sixth book, as he tells us in vi. 1, had been begun at
   Alexandria, but the manuscript had been left behind, so that a new
   beginning had to be made at Cæsarea.  The work was again interrupted by
   the persecution of Maximian in 238; the volumes from the twenty-second
   to the last were written after that date.  At the end of the
   thirty-second volume, which is the last we now possess, the writer has
   only reached John xiii. 33, but he tells us in his Commentary on
   Matthew that he has spoken of the two thieves in his work on John.  In
   the time of Eusebius only twenty-two books survived out of the whole
   number, which seems to have been thirty-nine.  We now possess books i.,
   ii., vi., x., xiii., xix., xx., xxviii., xxxii., some of which,
   however, are not complete, and a few fragments.  The thirteenth book
   begins in the middle of the story of the Samaritan woman.  Ambrosius
   had wished that story to be completed in the twelfth book, but Origen
   did not like to make his books too long, and on this point disregarded
   the authority of his mentor.  The nineteenth and twentieth books are
   both occupied with the eighth chapter of John, which, if it was all
   treated on the same scale, must have occupied two more books in
   addition to these.  The thirty-second book scarcely completes the
   thirteenth chapter of the Gospel; and if the remaining chapters only
   occupied seven books, the treatment of these must have been much more
   condensed.

   Two Latin translations of Origen's John were made in the sixteenth
   century, one by Ambrosius Ferrarius of Milan from the Venice Codex, the
   other by Joachim Perionius.

   The Commentaries on John and on Matthew are both embraced in several
   manuscripts.  Of those on John, Mr. A. E. Brooke (Texts and Studies,
   vol. i. No. 4; The Fragments of Heracleon, pp. 1-30; "the mss. of
   Origen's Commentaries on S. John") enumerates eight or nine.  The
   Munich ms. of the thirteenth century is the source of all the rest.
   Huet, the first editor (1668), used the Codex Regius (Paris) of the
   sixteenth century, which is in many passages mutilated and disfigured.
   The brothers Delarue (1733-1759) used the mss. Barberinus and
   Bodleianus, which are more complete, and Lommatzsch (1831) follows his

   Letter of Origen to Gregory.

   ------------------------

   When and to whom the Learning derived from Philosophy may be of Service
   for the Exposition of the Holy Scriptures; with a lively Personal
   Appeal.

   This letter to Gregory, afterwards bishop of Cæsarea, and called
   Thaumaturgus, was preserved in the Philocalia, or collection of
   extracts from Origen's works drawn up by Gregory of Nyssa and Basil of
   Cæsarea.  It is printed by Delarue and Lommatzsch in the forefront of
   their editions of the works.  It forms a good preface to the
   commentaries, as it shows how Origen considered the study of Scripture
   to be the highest of all studies, and how he regarded scientific
   learning, in which he was himself a master, as merely preparatory for
   this supreme learning.  Dräseke [4446] has shown that it was written
   about 235, when Origen, after having had Gregory as his pupil at
   Cæsarea for some years, had fled before the persecution under Maximinus
   Thrax to Cappadocia; while Gregory, to judge from the tenor of this
   Epistle, had gone to Egypt.  The Panegyric on Origen, [4447] pronounced
   by Gregory at Cæsarea about 239, when the school had reassembled there
   after the persecution, shows that the master's solicitude for his
   pupil's true advancement was not disappointed.

   1.  Gregory is Urged to Apply His Gentile Learning to the Study of
   Scripture.

   All hail to thee in God, most excellent and reverend Sir, son Gregory,
   from Origen.  A natural quickness of understanding is fitted, as you
   are well aware, if it be diligently exercised, to produce a work which
   may bring its owner so far as is possible, if I may so express myself,
   to the consummation of the art the which he desires to practise, and
   your natural aptitude is sufficient to make you a consummate Roman
   lawyer and a Greek philosopher too of the most famous schools.  But my
   desire for you has been that you should direct the whole force of your
   intelligence to Christianity as your end, and that in the way of
   production.  And I would wish that you should take with you on the one
   hand those parts of the philosophy of the Greeks which are fit, as it
   were, to serve as general or preparatory studies for Christianity, and
   on the other hand so much of Geometry and Astronomy as may be helpful
   for the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures.  The children of the
   philosophers speak of geometry and music and grammar and rhetoric and
   astronomy as being ancillary to philosophy; and in the same way we
   might speak of philosophy itself as being ancillary to Christianity.

   2.  This Procedure is Typified by the Story of the Spoiling of the
   Egyptians.

   It is something of this sort perhaps that is enigmatically indicated in
   the directions God is represented in the Book of Exodus [4448] as
   giving to the children of Israel.  They are directed to beg from their
   neighbours and from those dwelling in their tents vessels of silver and
   of gold, and raiment; thus they are to spoil the Egyptians, and to
   obtain materials for making the things they are told to provide in
   connection with the worship of God.  For out of the things of which the
   children of Israel spoiled the Egyptians the furniture of the Holy of
   Holies was made, the ark with its cover, and the cherubim and the
   mercy-seat and the gold jar in which the manna, that bread of angels,
   was stored.  These probably were made from the finest of the gold of
   the Egyptians, and from a second quality, perhaps, the solid golden
   candlestick which stood near the inner veil, and the lamps on it, and
   the golden table on which stood the shewbread, and between these two
   the golden altar of incense.  And if there was gold of a third and of a
   fourth quality, the sacred vessels were made of it.  And of the
   Egyptian silver, too, other things were made; for it was from their
   sojourn in Egypt that the children of Israel derived the great
   advantage of being supplied with such a quantity of precious materials
   for the use of the service of God.  Out of the Egyptian raiment
   probably were made all those requisites named in Scripture in
   embroidered work; the embroiderers working [4449] with the wisdom of
   God, [4450] such garments for such purposes, to produce the hangings
   and the inner and outer courts.  This is not a suitable opportunity to
   enlarge on such a theme or to show in how many ways the children of
   Israel found those things useful which they got from the Egyptians.
   The Egyptians had not made a proper use of them; but the Hebrews used
   them, for the wisdom of God was with them, for religious purposes.
   Holy Scripture knows, however, that it was an evil thing to descend
   from the land of the children of Israel into Egypt; and in this a great
   truth is wrapped up.  For some it is of evil that they should dwell
   with the Egyptians, that is to say, with the learning of the world,
   after they have been enrolled in the law of God and in the Israelite
   worship of Him.  Ader the Edomite, [4451] as long as he was in the land
   of Israel and did not taste the bread of the Egyptians, made no idols;
   but when he fled from the wise Solomon and went down into Egypt, as one
   who had fled from the wisdom of God he became connected with Pharaoh,
   marrying the sister of his wife, and begetting a son who was brought up
   among the sons of Pharaoh.  Therefore, though he did go back to the
   land of Israel, he came back to it to bring division into the people of
   God, and to cause them to say to the golden calf, "These are thy gods,
   O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt."  I have
   learned by experience and can tell you that there are few who have
   taken of the useful things of Egypt and come out of it, and have then
   prepared what is required for the service of God; but Ader the Edomite
   on the other hand has many a brother.  I mean those who, founding on
   some piece of Greek learning, have brought forth heretical ideas, and
   have as it were made golden calves in Bethel, which is, being
   interpreted, the house of God.  This appears to me to be intended to
   convey that such persons set up their own images in the Scriptures in
   which the Word of God dwells, and which therefore are tropically called
   Bethel.  The other image is said in the word to have been set up in
   Dan.  Now the borders of Dan are at the extremities and are contiguous
   to the country of the heathens, as is plainly recorded in the Book of
   Jesus, son of Nave.  Some of these images, then, are close to the
   borders of the heathen, which the brothers, as we showed, of Ader have
   devised.

   3.  Personal Appeal.

   Do you then, sir, my son, study first of all the divine Scriptures.
   Study them I say.  For we require to study the divine writings deeply,
   lest we should speak of them faster than we think; and while you study
   these divine works with a believing and God-pleasing intention, knock
   at that which is closed in them, and it shall be opened to thee by the
   porter, of whom Jesus says, [4452] "To him the porter openeth."  While
   you attend to this divine reading seek aright and with unwavering faith
   in God the hidden sense which is present in most passages of the divine
   Scriptures.  And do not be content with knocking and seeking, for what
   is most necessary for understanding divine things is prayer, and in
   urging us to this the Saviour says not only, [4453] "Knock, and it
   shall be opened to you," and "Seek, and ye shall find," but also "Ask,
   and it shall be given you."  So much I have ventured on account of my
   fatherly love to you.  Whether I have ventured well or not, God knows,
   and His Christ, and he who has part of the Spirit of God and the Spirit
   of Christ.  May you partake in these; may you have an always increasing
   share of them, so that you may be able to say not only, "We are
   partakers of Christ," [4454] but also "We are partakers of God."

   Origen's Commentary on the Gospel of John.

   ------------------------

   Book I.

   1.  How Christians are the Spiritual Israel.

   That people which was called of old the people of God was divided into
   twelve tribes, and over and above the other tribes it had the levitical
   order, which itself again carried on the service of God in various
   priestly and levitical suborders.  In the same manner, it appears to me
   that the whole people of Christ, when we regard it in the aspect of the
   hidden man of the heart, [4455] that people which is called "Jew
   inwardly," and is circumcised in the spirit, has in a more mystic way
   the characteristics of the tribes.  This may be more plainly gathered
   from John in his Apocalyse, though the other prophets also do not by
   any means conceal the state of matters from those who have the faculty
   of hearing them.  John speaks as follows: [4456]   "And I saw another
   angel ascending from the sunrising, having the seal of the living God,
   and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given
   to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not either the earth, or
   the sea, or the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on
   their foreheads.  And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a
   hundred and forty-four thousand who were sealed, out of every tribe of
   the children of Israel; of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve
   thousand, of the tribe of Roubem twelve thousand."  And he mentioned
   each of the tribes singly, with the exception of Dan.  Then, some way
   further on, [4457] he continues:  "And I saw, and behold the Lamb
   standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand,
   having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.
   And I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters, and as the
   voice of a great thunder.  And the voice which I heard was as the voice
   of harpers harping with their harps; and they sing a new song before
   the throne and before the four beasts and the elders, and no one could
   learn the song but the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been
   purchased from the earth.  These are they which were not defiled with
   women, for they are virgins.  These are they who follow the Lamb
   whithersover He goeth.  These were purchased from among men, a first
   fruits to God and to the Lamb; and in their mouth was found no lie, for
   they are without blemish."  Now this is said in John with reference to
   those who have believed in Christ, for they also, even if their bodily
   descent cannot be traced to the seed of the Patriarchs, are yet
   gathered out of the tribes.  That this is so we may conclude from what
   is further said about them:  "Hurt not," he says, "the earth, nor the
   sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God on
   their foreheads.  And I heard the number of them that were sealed, a
   hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from every tribe of the
   children of Israel."

   2.  The 144,000 Sealed in the Apocalypse are Converts to Christ from
   the Gentile World.

   These, then, who are sealed on their foreheads [4458] from every tribe
   of the children of Israel, are a hundred and forty-four thousand in
   number; and these hundred and forty-four thousand are afterwards said
   in John to have the name of the Lamb and of His Father written on their
   foreheads, and to be virgins, not having defiled themselves with
   women.  What else could the seal be which is on their foreheads but the
   name of the Lamb and the name of His Father?  In both passages their
   foreheads are said to have the seal; in one the seal is spoken of, in
   the other it appears to contain the letters forming the name of the
   Lamb, and the name of His Father.  Now these taken from the tribes are,
   as we showed before, the same persons as the virgins.  But the number
   of believers is small who belong to Israel according to the flesh; one
   might venture to assert that they would not nearly make up the number
   of a hundred and forty-four thousand.  It is clear, therefore, that the
   hundred and forty-four thousand who have not defiled themselves with
   women must be made up of those who have come to the divine word out of
   the Gentile world.  In this way the truth of the statement may be
   upheld that the first fruits of each tribe are its virgins.  For the
   passage goes on:  "These were brought from among men to be a first
   fruits to God and to the Lamb; and in their mouth was found no guile,
   for they are without blemish."  The statement about the hundred and
   forty-four thousand no doubt admits of mystical interpretation; but it
   is unnecessary at this point, and would divert us from our purpose, to
   compare with it those passages of the prophets in which the same lesson
   is taught regarding those who are called from among the Gentiles.

   3.  In the Spiritual Israel the High-Priests are Those Who Devote
   Themselves to the Study of Scripture.

   But what is the bearing of all this for us?  So you will ask when you
   read these words, Ambrosius, thou who art truly a man of God, a man in
   Christ, and who seekest to be not a man only, but a spiritual man.
   [4459]   The bearing is this.  Those of the tribes offer to God,
   through the levites and priests, tithes and first fruits; not
   everything which they possess do they regard as tithe or first fruit.
   The levites and priests, on the other hand, have no possessions but
   tithes and first fruits; yet they also in turn offer tithes to God
   through the high-priests, and, I believe, first fruits too.  The same
   is the case with those who approach Christian studies.  Most of us
   devote most of our time to the things of this life, and dedicate to God
   only a few special acts, thus resembling those members of the tribes
   who had but few transactions with the priest, and discharged their
   religious duties with no great expense of time.  But those who devote
   themselves to the divine word and have no other employment but the
   service of God may not unnaturally, allowing for the difference of
   occupation in the two cases, be called our levites and priests.  And
   those who fulfil a more distinguished office than their kinsmen [4460]
   will perhaps be high-priests, according to the order of Aaron, not that
   of Melchisedek.  Here some one may object that it is somewhat too bold
   to apply the name of high-priests to men, when Jesus Himself is spoken
   of in many a prophetic passage as the one great priest, as [4461] "We
   have a great high-priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the
   Son of God."  But to this we reply that the Apostle clearly defined his
   meaning, and declared the prophet to have said about the Christ, "Thou
   [4462] art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedek,"
   and not according to the order of Aaron.  We say accordingly that men
   can be high-priests according to the order of Aaron, but according to
   the order of Melchisedek only the Christ of God.

   4.  The Study of the Gospels is the First Fruits Offered by These
   Priests of Christianity.

   Now our whole activity is devoted to God, and our whole life, since we
   are bent on progress in divine things.  If, then, it be our desire to
   have the whole of those first fruits spoken of above which are made up
   of the many first fruits, if we are not mistaken in this view, in what
   must our first fruits consist, after the bodily separation we have
   undergone from each other, but in the study of the Gospel?  For we may
   venture to say that the Gospel is the first fruits of all the
   Scriptures.  Where, then, could be the first fruits of our activity,
   since the time when we came to Alexandria, but in the first fruits of
   the Scriptures?  It must not be forgotten, however, that the first
   fruits are not the same as the first growth.  For the first fruits
   [4463] are offered after all the fruits (are ripe), but the first
   growth [4464] before them all.  Now of the Scriptures which are current
   and are believed to be divine in all the churches, one would not be
   wrong in saying that the first growth is the law of Moses, but the
   first fruits the Gospel.  For it was after all the fruits of the
   prophets who prophesied till the Lord Jesus, that the perfect word shot
   forth.

   5.  All Scripture is Gospel; But the Gospels are Distinguished Above
   Other Scriptures.

   Here, however, some one may object, appealing to the notion just put
   forward of the unfolding of the first fruits last, and may say that the
   Acts and the letters of the Apostles came after the Gospels, and that
   this destroys our argument to the effect that the Gospel is the first
   fruits of all Scripture.  To this we must reply that it is the
   conviction of men who are wise in Christ, who have profited by those
   epistles which are current, and who see them to be vouched for by the
   testimonies deposited in the law and the prophets, [4465] that the
   apostolic writings are to be pronounced wise and worthy of belief, and
   that they have great authority, but that they are not on the same level
   with that "Thus sayeth the Lord Almighty." [4466]   Consider on this
   point the language of St. Paul.  When he declares that [4467] "Every
   Scripture is inspired of God and profitable," does he include his own
   writings?  Or does he not include his dictum, [4468] "I say, and not
   the Lord," and [4469] "So I ordain in all the churches," and [4470]
   "What things I suffered at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra," and similar
   things which he writes in virtue of his own authority, and which do not
   quite possess the character of words flowing from divine inspiration.
   Must we also show that the old Scripture is not Gospel, since it does
   not point out the Coming One, but only foretells Him and heralds His
   coming at a future time; but that all the new Scripture is the Gospel.
   It not only says as in the beginning of the Gospel, [4471] "Behold the
   Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world;" it also contains
   many praises of Him, and many of His teachings, on whose account the
   Gospel is a Gospel.  Again, if God set in the Church [4472] apostles
   and prophets and evangelists (gospellers), pastors and teachers, we
   must first enquire what was the office of the evangelist, and mark that
   it is not only to narrate how the Saviour cured a man who was blind
   from his birth, [4473] or raised up a dead man who was already
   stinking, [4474] or to state what extraordinary works he wrought; and
   the office of the evangelist being thus defined, we shall not hesitate
   to find Gospel in such discourse also as is not narrative but hortatory
   and intended to strengthen belief in the mission of Jesus; and thus we
   shall arrive at the position that whatever was written by the Apostles
   is Gospel.  As to this second definition, it might be objected that the
   Epistles are not entitled "Gospel," and that we are wrong in applying
   the name of Gospel to the whole of the New Testament.  But to this we
   answer that it happens not unfrequently in Scripture when two or more
   persons or things are named by the same name, the name attaches itself
   most significantly to one of those things or persons.  Thus the Saviour
   says, [4475] "Call no man Master upon the earth;" while the Apostle
   says that Masters [4476] have been appointed in the Church.  These
   latter accordingly will not be Masters in the strict sense of the
   dictum of the Gospel.  In the same way the Gospel in the Epistles will
   not extend to every word of them, when it is compared with the
   narrative of Jesus' actions and sufferings and discourses.  No:  the
   Gospel is the first fruits of all Scripture, and to these first fruits
   of the Scriptures we devote the first fruits of all those actions of
   ours which we trust to see turn out as we desire.

   6.  The Fourfold Gospel.  John's the First Fruits of the Four.
   Qualifications Necessary for Interpreting It.

   Now the Gospels are four.  These four are, as it were, the elements of
   the faith of the Church, out of which elements the whole world which is
   reconciled to God in Christ is put together; as Paul says, [4477] "God
   was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself;" of which world Jesus
   bore the sin; for it is of the world of the Church that the word is
   written, [4478] "Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
   the world."  The Gospels then being four, I deem the first fruits of
   the Gospels to be that which you [4479] have enjoined me to search into
   according to my powers, the Gospel of John, that which speaks of him
   whose genealogy had already been set forth, but which begins to speak
   of him at a point before he had any genealogy.  For Matthew, writing
   for the Hebrews who looked for Him who was to come of the line of
   Abraham and of David, says: [4480]   "The book of the generation of
   Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."  And Mark, knowing
   what he writes, narrates the beginning of the Gospel; we may perhaps
   find what he aims at in John; in the beginning the Word, God the Word.
   But Luke, though he says at the beginning of Acts, "The former treatise
   did I make about all that Jesus began to do and to teach," yet leaves
   to him who lay on Jesus' breast the greatest and completest discourses
   about Jesus.  For none of these plainly declared His Godhead, as John
   does when he makes Him say, "I am the light of the world," "I am the
   way and the truth and the life," "I am the resurrection," "I am the
   door," "I am the good shepherd;" and in the Apocalypse, "I am the Alpha
   and the Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last."  We
   may therefore make bold to say that the Gospels are the first fruits of
   all the Scriptures, but that of the Gospels that of John is the first
   fruits.  No one can apprehend the meaning of it except he have lain on
   Jesus' breast and received from Jesus Mary to be his mother also.  Such
   an one must he become who is to be another John, and to have shown to
   him, like John, by Jesus Himself Jesus as He is.  For if Mary, as those
   declare who with sound mind extol her, had no other son but Jesus, and
   yet Jesus says to His mother, "Woman, behold thy son," [4481] and not
   "Behold you have this son also," then He virtually said to her, "Lo,
   this is Jesus, whom thou didst bear."  Is it not the case that every
   one who is perfect lives himself no longer, [4482] but Christ lives in
   him; and if Christ lives in him, then it is said of him to Mary,
   "Behold thy son Christ."  What a mind, then, must we have to enable us
   to interpret in a worthy manner this work, though it be committed to
   the earthly treasure-house of common speech, of writing which any
   passer-by can read, and which can be heard when read aloud by any one
   who lends to it his bodily ears?  What shall we say of this work?  He
   who is accurately to apprehend what it contains should be able to say
   with truth, [4483] "We have the mind of Christ, that we may know those
   things which are bestowed on us by God."  It is possible to quote one
   of Paul's sayings in support of the contention that the whole of the
   New Testament is Gospel.  He writes in a certain place: [4484]
   "According to my Gospel."  Now we have no written work of Paul which is
   commonly called a Gospel.  But all that he preached and said was the
   Gospel; and what he preached and said he was also in the habit of
   writing, and what he wrote was therefore Gospel.  But if what Paul
   wrote was Gospel, it follows that what Peter wrote was also Gospel, and
   in a word all that was said or written to perpetuate the knowledge of
   Christ's sojourn on earth, and to prepare for His second coming, or to
   bring it about as a present reality in those souls which were willing
   to receive the Word of God as He stood at the door and knocked and
   sought to come into them.

   7.  What Good Things are Announced in the Gospels.

   But it is time we should inquire what is the meaning of the designation
   "Gospel," and why these books have this title.  Now the Gospel is a
   discourse containing a promise of things which naturally, and on
   account of the benefits they bring, rejoice the hearer as soon as the
   promise is heard and believed.  Nor is such a discourse any the less a
   Gospel that we define it with reference to the position of the hearer.
   A Gospel is either a word which implies the actual presence to the
   believer of something that is good, or a word promising the arrival of
   a good which is expected.  Now all these definitions apply to those
   books which are named Gospels.  For each of the Gospels is a collection
   of announcements which are useful to him who believes them and does not
   misinterpret them; it brings him a benefit and naturally makes him glad
   because it tells of the sojourn with men, on account of men, and for
   their salvation, of the first-born of all creation, [4485] Christ
   Jesus.  And again each Gospel tells of the sojourn of the good Father
   in the Son with those minded to receive Him, as is plain to every
   believer; and moreover by these books a good is announced which had
   been formerly expected, as is by no means hard to see.  For John the
   Baptist spoke in the name almost of the whole people when he sent to
   Jesus and asked, [4486] "Art thou He that should come or do we look for
   another?"  For to the people the Messiah was an expected good, which
   the prophets had foretold, and they all alike, though under the law and
   the prophets, fixed their hopes on Him, as the Samaritan woman bears
   witness when she says: [4487]   "I know that the Messiah comes, who is
   called Christ; when He comes He will tell us all things."  Simon and
   Cleopas too, when talking to each other about all that had happened to
   Jesus Christ Himself, then risen, though they did not know that He had
   risen from the dead, speak thus, [4488] "Dost thou sojourn alone in
   Jerusalem, and knowest not the things which have taken place there in
   these days?  And when he said what things? they answered, The things
   concerning Jesus of Nazareth, [4489] which was a prophet, mighty in
   deed and in word before God and all the people, and how the chief
   priests and our rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death and
   crucified Him.  But we hoped that it was He which should redeem
   Israel."  Again, Andrew the brother of Simon Peter found his own
   brother Simon and said to him, [4490] "We have found the Messiah, which
   is, being interpreted, Christ."  And a little further on Philip finds
   Nathanael and says to him, [4491] "We have found Him of whom Moses in
   the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus the son of Joseph, from
   Nazareth."

   8.  How the Gospels Cause the Other Books of Scripture Also to Be
   Gospel.

   Now an objection might be raised to our first definition, because it
   would embrace books which are not entitled Gospels.  For the law and
   the prophets also are to our eyes books containing the promise of
   things which, from the benefit they will confer on him, naturally
   rejoice the hearer as soon as he takes in the message.  To this it may
   be said that before the sojourn of Christ, the law and the prophets,
   since He had not come who interpreted the mysteries they contained, did
   not convey such a promise as belongs to our definition of the Gospel;
   but the Saviour, when He sojourned with men and caused the Gospel to
   appear in bodily form, by the Gospel caused all things to appear as
   Gospel.  Here I would not think it beside the purpose to quote the
   example of Him who...a few things...and yet all. [4492]   For when he
   had taken away the veil which was present in the law and the prophets,
   and by His divinity had proved the sons of men that the Godhead was at
   work, He opened the way for all those who desired it to be disciples of
   His wisdom, and to understand what things were true and real in the law
   of Moses, of which things those of old worshipped the type and the
   shadow, and what things were real of the things narrated in the
   histories which "happened to them in the way of type," [4493] but these
   things "were written for our sakes, upon whom the ends of the ages have
   come."  With whomsoever, then, Christ has sojourned, he worships God
   neither at Jerusalem nor on the mountain of the Samaritans; he knows
   that God is a spirit, and worships Him spiritually, in spirit and in
   truth; no longer by type does he worship the Father and Maker of all.
   Before that Gospel, therefore, which came into being by the sojourning
   of Christ, none of the older works was a Gospel.  But the Gospel, which
   is the new covenant, having delivered us from the oldness of the
   letter, lights up for us, by the light of knowledge, [4494] the newness
   of the spirit, a thing which never grows old, which has its home in the
   New Testament, but is also present in all the Scriptures.  It was
   fitting, therefore, that that Gospel, which enables us to find the
   Gospel present, even in the Old Testament, should itself receive, in a
   special sense, the name of Gospel.

   9.  The Somatic and the Spiritual Gospel.

   We must not, however, forget that the sojourning of Christ with men
   took place before His bodily sojourn, in an intellectual fashion, to
   those who were more perfect and not children, and were not under
   pedagogues and governors.  In their minds they saw the fulness of the
   time to be at hand--the patriarchs, and Moses the servant, and the
   prophets who beheld the glory of Christ.  And as before His manifest
   and bodily coming He came to those who were perfect, so also, after His
   coming has been announced to all, to those who are still children,
   since they are under pedagogues and governors and have not yet arrived
   at the fulness of the time, forerunners of Christ have come to sojourn,
   discourses (logoi) suited for minds still in their childhood, and
   rightly, therefore, termed pedagogues.  But the Son Himself, the
   glorified God, the Word, has not yet come; He waits for the preparation
   which must take place on the part of men of God who are to admit His
   deity.  And this, too, we must bear in mind, that as the law contains a
   shadow of good things to come, which are indicated by that law which is
   announced according to truth, so the Gospel also teaches a shadow of
   the mysteries of Christ, the Gospel which is thought to be capable of
   being understood by any one.  What John calls the eternal Gospel, and
   what may properly be called the spiritual Gospel, presents clearly to
   those who have the will to understand, all matters concerning the very
   Son of God, both the mysteries presented by His discourses and those
   matters of which His acts were the enigmas.  In accordance with this we
   may conclude that, as it is with Him who is a Jew outwardly and
   circumcised in the flesh, so it is with the Christian and with
   baptism.  Paul and Peter were, at an earlier period, Jews outwardly and
   circumcised, but later they received from Christ that they should be so
   in secret, too; so that outwardly they were Jews for the sake of the
   salvation of many, and by an economy they not only confessed in words
   that they were Jews, but showed it by their actions.  And the same is
   to be said about their Christianity.  As Paul could not benefit those
   who were Jews according to the flesh, without, when reason shows it to
   be necessary, circumcising Timothy, and when it appears the natural
   course getting himself shaved and making a vow, and, in a word, being
   to the Jews a Jew that he might gain the Jews--so also it is not
   possible for one who is responsible for the good of many to operate as
   he should by means of that Christianity only which is in secret.  That
   will never enable him to improve those who are following the external
   Christianity, or to lead them on to better and higher things.  We must,
   therefore, be Christians both somatically and spiritually, and where
   there is a call for the somatic (bodily) Gospel, in which a man says to
   those who are carnal that he knows nothing but Jesus Christ and Him
   crucified, so we must do.  But should we find those who are perfected
   in the spirit, and bear fruit in it, and are enamoured of the heavenly
   wisdom, these must be made to partake of that Word which, after it was
   made flesh, rose again to what it was in the beginning, with God.

   10.  How Jesus Himself is the Gospel.

   The foregoing inquiry into the nature of the Gospel cannot be regarded
   as useless; it has enabled us to see what distinction there is between
   a sensible Gospel and an intellectual and spiritual one.  What we have
   now to do is to transform the sensible Gospel into a spiritual one.

   For what would the narrative of the sensible Gospel amount to if it
   were not developed to a spiritual one?  It would be of little account
   or none; any one can read it and assure himself of the facts it
   tells--no more.  But our whole energy is now to be directed to the
   effort to penetrate to the deep things of the meaning of the Gospel and
   to search out the truth that is in it when divested of types.  Now what
   the Gospels say is to be regarded in the light of promises of good
   things; and we must say that the good things the Apostles announce in
   this Gospel are simply Jesus.  One good thing which they are said to
   announce is the resurrection; but the resurrection is in a manner
   Jesus, for Jesus says: [4495]   "I am the resurrection."  Jesus
   preaches to the poor those things which are laid up for the saints,
   calling them to the divine promises.  And the holy Scriptures bear
   witness to the Gospel announcements made by the Apostles and to that
   made by our Saviour.  David says of the Apostles, perhaps also of the
   evangelists: [4496]   "The Lord shall give the word to those that
   preach with great power; the King of the powers of the beloved;"
   teaching at the same time that it is not skilfully composed discourse,
   nor the mode of delivery, nor well practised eloquence that produces
   conviction, but the communication of divine power.  Hence also Paul
   says: [4497]   "I will know not the word that is puffed up, but the
   power; for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power."  And in
   another passage: [4498]   "And my word and my preaching were not
   persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of
   power."  To this power Simon and Cleophas bear witness when they say:
   [4499]   "Was not our heart burning within us by the way, as he opened
   to us the Scriptures?"  And the Apostles, since the quantity of the
   power is great which God supplies to the speakers, had great power,
   according to the word of David:  "The Lord will give the word to the
   preachers with great power."  Isaiah too says: [4500]   "How beautiful
   are the feet of them that proclaim good tidings;" he sees how beautiful
   and how opportune was the announcement of the Apostles who walked in
   Him who said, "I am the way," and praises the feet of those who walk in
   the intellectual way of Christ Jesus, and through that door go in to
   God.  They announce good tidings, those whose feet are beautiful,
   namely, Jesus.

   11.  Jesus is All Good Things; Hence the Gospel is Manifold.

   Let no one wonder if we have understood Jesus to be announced in the
   Gospel under a plurality of names of good things.  If we look at the
   things by the names of which the Son of God is called, we shall
   understand how many good things Jesus is, whom those preach whose feet
   are beautiful.  One good thing is life; but Jesus is the life.  Another
   good thing is the light of the world, when it is true light, and the
   light of men; and all these things the Son of God is said to be.  And
   another good thing which one may conceive to be in addition to life or
   light is the truth.  And a fourth in addition to time is the way which
   leads to the truth.  And all these things our Saviour teaches that He
   is, when He says: [4501]   "I am the way and the truth and the life."
   Ah, is not that good, to shake off earth and mortality, and to rise
   again, obtaining this boon from the Lord, since He is the resurrection,
   as He says: [4502]   "I am the resurrection."  But the door also is a
   good, through which one enters into the highest blessedness.  Now
   Christ says: [4503]   "I am the door."  And what need is there to speak
   of wisdom, which "the Lord created [4504] the first principle of His
   ways, for His works," in whom the father of her rejoiced, delighting in
   her manifold intellectual beauty, seen by the eyes of the mind alone,
   and provoking him to love who discerns her divine and heavenly charm?
   A good indeed is the wisdom of God, proclaimed along with the other
   good foresaid by those whose feet are beautiful.  And the power of God
   is the eighth good we enumerate, which is Christ.  Nor must we omit to
   mention the Word, who is God after the Father of all.  For this also is
   a good, less than no other.  Happy, then, are those who accept these
   goods and receive them from those who announce the good tidings of
   them, those whose feet are beautiful.  Indeed even one of the
   Corinthians to whom Paul declared that he knew nothing but Jesus Christ
   and Him crucified, should he learn Him who for our sakes became man,
   and so receive Him, he would become identified with the beginning of
   the good things we have spoken of; by the man Jesus he would be made a
   man of God, and by His death he would die to sin.  For "Christ, [4505]
   in that He died, died unto sin once."  But from His life, since "in
   that He liveth, He liveth unto God," every one who is conformed to His
   resurrection receives that living to God.  But who will deny that
   righteousness, essential righteousness, is a good, and essential
   sanctification, and essential redemption?  And these things those
   preach who preach Jesus, saying [4506] that He is made to be of God
   righteousness and sanctification and redemption.  Hence we shall have
   writings about Him without number, showing that Jesus is a multitude of
   goods; for from the things which can scarcely be numbered and which
   have been written we may make some conjecture of those things which
   actually exist in Him in whom [4507] "it pleased God that the whole
   fulness of the Godhead should dwell bodily," and which are not
   contained in writings.  Why should I say, "are not contained in
   writings"?  For John speaks of the whole world in this connection, and
   says: [4508]   "I suppose that not even the world itself would contain
   the books which would be written."  Now to say that the Apostles preach
   the Saviour is to say that they preach these good things.  For this is
   He who received from the good Father that He Himself should be these
   good things, so that each man receiving from Jesus the thing or things
   he is capable of receiving may enjoy good things.  But the Apostles,
   whose feet were beautiful, and those imitators of them who sought to
   preach the good tidings, could not have done so had not Jesus Himself
   first preached the good tidings to them, as Isaiah says: [4509]   "I
   myself that speak am here, as the opportunity on the mountains, as the
   feet of one preaching tidings of peace, as one preaching good things;
   for I will make My salvation to be heard, saying, God shall reign over
   thee, O Zion!"  For what are the mountains on which the speaker
   declares that He Himself is present, but those who are less than none
   of the highest and the greatest of the earth?  And these must be sought
   by the able ministers of the New Covenant, in order that they may
   observe the injunction which says: [4510]   Go up into a high mountain,
   thou that preachest good tidings to Zion; thou that preachest good
   tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength!"  Now it is not
   wonderful if to those who are to preach good tidings Jesus Himself
   preaches good tidings of good things, which are no other than Himself;
   for the Son of God preaches the good tidings of Himself to those who
   cannot come to know Him through others.  And He who goes up into the
   mountains and preaches good things to them, being Himself instructed by
   His good Father, [4511] who "makes His sun to rise on the evil and on
   the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust," He does not
   despise those who are poor in soul.  To them He preaches good tidings,
   as He Himself bears witness to us when He takes Isaiah [4512] and
   reads:  "The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for the Lord hath anointed
   me to preach good tidings to the poor, He hath sent me to proclaim
   liberty to the captives, and sight to the blind.  For closing the book
   He handed it to the minister and sat down.  And when the eyes of all
   were fastened upon Him, He said, This day is this Scripture fulfilled
   in your ears."

   12.  The Gospel Contains the Ill Deeds Also Which Were Done to Jesus.

   It ought not to be forgotten that in such a Gospel as this there is
   embraced every good deed which was done to Jesus; as, for example, the
   story of the woman [4513] who had been a sinner and had repented, and
   who, having experienced a genuine recovery from her evil state, had
   grace to pour her ointment over Jesus so that every one in the house
   smelt the sweet savour.  Hence, too, the words, "Wherever this Gospel
   shall be preached among all the nations, there also this that she has
   done shall be spoken of, for a memorial of her."  And it is clear that
   whatever is done to the disciples of Jesus is done to Him.  Pointing to
   those of them who met with kind treatment, He says to those who were
   kind to them, [4514] "What ye did to these, ye did to Me."  So that
   every good deed we do to our neighbours is entered in the Gospel, that
   Gospel which is written on the heavenly tablets and read by all who are
   worthy of the knowledge of the whole of things.  But on the other side,
   too, there is a part of the Gospel which is for the condemnation of the
   doers of the ill deeds which have been done to Jesus.  The treachery of
   Judas and the shouts of the wicked crowd when it said, [4515] "Away
   with such a one from the earth," and "Crucify Him, crucify Him," the
   mockings of those who crowned Him with thorns, and everything of that
   kind, is included in the Gospels.  And as a consequence of this we see
   that every one who betrays the disciples of Jesus is reckoned as
   betraying Jesus Himself.  To Saul, [4516] when still a persecutor it is
   said, "Saul Saul, why persecutest thou Me?" and, "I am Jesus whom thou
   persecutest."  There are those who still have thorns with which they
   crown and dishonour Jesus, those, namely, who are choked by the cares,
   and riches, and pleasures of life, and though they have received the
   word of God, do not bring it to perfection. [4517]   We must beware,
   therefore, lest we also, as crowning Jesus with thorns of our own,
   should be entered in the Gospel and read of in this character by those
   who learn the Jesus, who is in all and is present in all rational and
   holy lives, learn how He is anointed with ointment, is entertained, is
   glorified, or how, on the other side, He is dishonoured, and mocked,
   and beaten.  All this had to be said; it is part of our demonstration
   that our good actions, and also the sins of those who stumble, are
   embodied in the Gospel, either to everlasting life or to reproach and
   everlasting shame.

   13.  The Angels Also are Evangelists.

   Now if there are those among men who are honoured with the ministry of
   evangelists, and if Jesus Himself brings tidings of good things, and
   preaches the Gospel to the poor, surely those messengers who were made
   spirits by God, [4518] those who are a flame of fire, ministers of the
   Father of all, cannot have been excluded from being evangelists also.
   Hence an angel standing over the shepherds made a bright light to shine
   round about them, and said: [4519]   "Fear not; behold I bring you good
   tidings of great joy, which shall be to all the people; for there is
   born to you, this day, a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord, in the city
   of David."  And at a time when there was no knowledge among men of the
   mystery of the Gospel, those who were greater than men and inhabitants
   of heaven, the army of God, praised God, saying, "Glory to God in the
   highest, and on earth peace, good will among men." [4520]   And having
   said this, the angels go away from the shepherds into heaven, leaving
   us to gather how the joy preached to us through the birth of Jesus
   Christ is glory in the highest to God; they humbled themselves even to
   the ground, and then returned to their place of rest, to glorify God in
   the highest through Jesus Christ.  But the angels also wonder at the
   peace which is to be brought about on account of Jesus on the earth,
   that seat of war, on which Lucifer, star of the morning, fell from
   heaven, to be warred against and destroyed by Jesus.

   14.  The Old Testament, Typified by John, is the Beginning of the
   Gospel.

   In addition to what we have said, there is also this to be considered
   about the Gospel, that in the first instance it is that of Christ
   Jesus, the head of the whole body of the saved; as Mark says, [4521]
   "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ."  Then also it is the
   Gospel of the Apostles; whence Paul [4522] says, "According to my
   Gospel."  But the beginning of the Gospel--for in respect of its extent
   it has a beginning, a continuation, a middle, and an end--is nothing
   but the whole Old Testament.  John is, in this respect, a type of the
   Old Testament, or, if we regard the connection of the New Testament
   with the Old, John represents the termination of the Old.  For the same
   Mark says: [4523]   "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, as it
   is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold I send my messenger before thy
   face, who shall prepare thy way.  The voice of one crying in the
   wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight."
   And here I must wonder how the dissentients [4524] can connect the two
   Testaments with two different Gods.  These words, were there no others,
   are enough to convict them of their error.  For how can John be the
   beginning of the Gospel if they suppose he belongs to a different God,
   if he belongs to the demiurge, and, as they hold, is not acquainted
   with the new deity?  And the angels are not entrusted with but one
   evangelical ministry, and that a short one, not only with that
   addressed to the shepherds.  For at the end an exalted and flying
   angel, having the Gospel, will preach it to every nation, for the good
   Father has not entirely deserted those who have fallen away from Him.
   John, son of Zebedee, says in his Apocalypse: [4525]   "And I saw an
   angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the Eternal Gospel, to
   preach it to those who dwell upon the earth, and to every nation, and
   tribe, and tongue, and people, saying, with a loud voice, Fear God and
   give Him glory, for the hour of His judgment hath come, and worship Him
   that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the fountains of
   waters."

   15.  The Gospel is in the Old Testament, and Indeed in the Whole
   Universe.  Prayer for Aid to Understand the Mystical Sense of the Work
   in Hand.

   As, then, we have shown that the beginning of the Gospel, according to
   one interpretation, is the whole Old Testament, and is signified by the
   person of John, we shall add, lest this should be called a mere
   unsupported assertion, what is said in the Acts [4526] about the eunuch
   of the queen of the Ethiopians and Philip.  Philip, it is said, began
   at the passage of Isaiah:  "He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and
   as a lamb before his shearer is dumb," and so preached to him the Lord
   Jesus.  How can he begin with the prophet and preach Jesus, if Isaiah
   was not a part of the beginning of the Gospel?  From this we may derive
   a proof of the assertion made at the outset, that every divine
   Scripture is Gospel.  If he who preaches the Gospel preaches good
   things, and all those who spoke before the sojourn of Jesus in the
   flesh preach Christ, who is as we saw good things, then the words
   spoken by all of them alike are in a sense a part of the Gospel.  And
   when the Gospel is said to be declared throughout the whole world, we
   infer that it is actually preached in the whole world, not, that is to
   say, in this earthly district only, but in the whole system of heaven
   and earth, or from heaven and earth.  And why should we discuss any
   further what the Gospel is?  What we have said is enough.  Besides the
   passages we have adduced, passages by no means inept or unsuited for
   our purpose,--much to the same effect might be collected from the
   Scriptures, so that it is clearly seen what is the glory of the good
   things in Jesus Christ shed forth by the Gospel, the Gospel ministered
   by men and angels, and, I believe, also by authorities and powers,
   [4527] and thrones and dominions, and every name that is named, not
   only in this world, but also in the world to come, and indeed even by
   Christ Himself.  Here, then, let us bring to a close what has to be
   said before proceeding to read the work itself.  And now let us ask God
   to assist us through Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit, so that we may be
   able to unfold the mystical sense which is treasured up in the words
   before us.

   16.  Meaning of "Beginning."  (1) in Space.

   "In the beginning was the Word." [4528]   It is not only the Greeks who
   consider the word "beginning" to have many meanings.  Let any one
   collect the Scripture passages in which the word occurs, and with a
   view to an accurate interpretation of it note what it stands for in
   each passage, and he will find that the word has many meanings in
   sacred discourse also.  We speak of a beginning in reference to a
   transition.  Here it has to do with a road and with length.  This
   appears in the saying: [4529]   "The beginning of a good way is to do
   justice."  For since the good way is long, there have first to be
   considered in reference to it the question connected with action, and
   this side is presented in the words "to do justice;" the contemplative
   side comes up for consideration afterwards.  In the latter the end of
   it comes to rest at last in the so-called restoration of all things,
   since no enemy is left them to fight against, if that be true which is
   said: [4530]   "For He must reign until He have placed His enemies
   under His feet.  But the last enemy to be destroyed is death."  For
   then but one activity will be left for those who have come to God on
   account of His word which is with Him, that, namely, of knowing God, so
   that, being found by the knowledge of the Father, they may all be His
   Son, as now no one but the Son knows the Father.  For should any one
   enquire carefully at what time those are to know the Father to whom He
   who knows the Father reveals Him, and should he consider how a man now
   sees only through a glass and in a riddle, never having learned to know
   as he ought to know, he would be justified in saying that no one, no
   apostle even, and no prophet had known the Father, but when he became
   one with Him as a son and a father are one.  And if any one says that
   it is a digression which has led us to this point, our consideration of
   that one meaning of the word beginning, we must show that the
   digression is necessary and useful for the end we have in view.  For if
   we speak of a beginning in the case of a transition, and of a way and
   its length, and if we are told that the beginning of a good way is to
   do justice, then it concerns us to know in what manner every good way
   has for its beginning to do justice, and how after such beginning it
   arrives at contemplation, and in what manner it thus arrives at
   contemplation.

   17.  (2) in Time.  The Beginning of Creation.

   Again, there is a beginning in a matter of origin, as might appear in
   the saying: [4531]   "In the beginning God made the heaven and the
   earth."  This meaning, however, appears more plainly in the Book of Job
   in the passage: [4532]   "This is the beginning of God's creation, made
   for His angels to mock at."  One would suppose that the heavens and the
   earth were made first, of all that was made at the creation of the
   world.  But the second passage suggests a better view, namely, that as
   many beings were framed with a body, the first made of these was the
   creature called dragon, but called in another passage [4533] the great
   whale (leviathan) which the Lord tamed.  We must ask about this;
   whether, when the saints were living a blessed life apart from matter
   and from any body, the dragon, falling from the pure life, became fit
   to be bound in matter and in a body, so that the Lord could say,
   speaking through storm and clouds, "This is the beginning of the
   creation of God, made for His angels to mock at."  It is possible,
   however, that the dragon is not positively the beginning of the
   creation of the Lord, but that there were many creatures made with a
   body for the angels to mock at, and that the dragon was the first of
   these, while others could subsist in a body without such reproach.  But
   it is not so.  For the soul of the sun is placed in a body, and the
   whole creation, of which the Apostle says: [4534]   "The whole creation
   groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now," and perhaps the
   following is about the same:  "The creation was made subject to vanity,
   not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it for hope;" so
   that bodies might be in vanity, and doing the things of the body, as he
   who is in the body must. [4535] ...One who is in the body does the
   things of the body, though unwillingly.  Wherefore the creation was
   made subject to vanity, not willingly, but he who does unwillingly the
   things of the body does what he does for the sake of hope, as if we
   should say that Paul desired to remain in the flesh, not willingly, but
   on account of hope.  For though he thought it better [4536] to be
   dissolved and to be with Christ, it was not unreasonable that he should
   wish to remain in the flesh for the sake of the benefit to others and
   of advancement in the things hoped for, not only by him, but also by
   those benefited by him.  This meaning of the term "beginning," as of
   origin, will serve us also in the passage in which Wisdom speaks in the
   Proverbs. [4537]   "God," we read, "created me the beginning of His
   ways, for His works."  Here the term could be interpreted as in the
   first application we spoke of, that of a way:  "The Lord," it says,
   "created me the beginning of His ways."  One might assert, and with
   reason, that God Himself is the beginning of all things, and might go
   on to say, as is plain, that the Father is the beginning of the Son;
   and the demiurge the beginning of the works of the demiurge, and that
   God in a word is the beginning of all that exists.  This view is
   supported by our:  "In the beginning was the Word."  In the Word one
   may see the Son, and because He is in the Father He may be said to be
   in the beginning.

   18.  (3) of Substance.

   In the third place a beginning may be that out of which a thing comes,
   the underlying matter from which things are formed.  This, however, is
   the view of those who hold matter itself to be uncreated, a view which
   we believers cannot share, since we believe God to have made the things
   that are out of the things which are not, as the mother of the seven
   martyrs in the Maccabees teaches, [4538] and as the angel of repentance
   in the Shepherd inculcated. [4539]

   19.  (4) of Type and Copy.

   In addition to these meanings there is that in which we speak of an
   arche, [4540] according to form; thus if the first-born of every
   creature [4541] is the image of the invisible God, then the Father is
   his arche.  In the same way Christ is the arche of those who are made
   according to the image of God.  For if men are according to the image,
   but the image according to the Father; in the first case the Father is
   the arche of Christ, and in the other Christ is the arche of men, and
   men are made, not according to that of which he is the image, but
   according to the image.  With this example our passage will agree:  "In
   the arche was the Word."

   20.  (5) of Elements and What is Formed from Them.

   There is also an arche in a matter of learning, as when we say that the
   letters are the arche of grammar.  The Apostle accordingly says: [4542]
     "When by reason of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need
   again that some one teach you what are the elements of the arche of the
   oracles of God."  Now the arche spoken of in connection with learning
   is twofold; first in respect of its nature, secondly in its relation to
   us; as we might say of Christ, that by nature His arche is deity, but
   that in relation to us who cannot, for its very greatness, command the
   whole truth about Him, His arche is His manhood, as He is preached to
   babes, "Jesus Christ and Him crucified."  In this view, then, Christ is
   the arche of learning in His own nature, because He is the wisdom and
   power of God; but for us, the Word was made flesh, that He might
   tabernacle among us who could only thus at first receive Him.  And
   perhaps this is the reason why He is not only the firstborn of all
   creation, but is also designated the man, Adam.  For Paul says He is
   Adam: [4543]   "The last Adam was made a life-giving spirit."

   21.  (6) of Design and Execution.

   Again we speak of the arche of an action, in which there is a design
   which appears after the beginning.  It may be considered whether wisdom
   is to be regarded as the arche of the works of God because it is in
   this way the principle of them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   22.  The Word Was in the Beginning, I.e., in Wisdom, Which Contained
   All Things in Idea, Before They Existed.  Christ's Character as Wisdom
   is Prior to His Other Characters.

   So many meanings occur to us at once of the word arche.  We have now to
   ask which of them we should adopt for our text, "In the beginning was
   the Word."  It is plain that we may at once dismiss the meaning which
   connects it with transition or with a road and its length.  Nor, it is
   pretty plain, will the meaning connected with an origin serve our
   purpose.  One might, however, think of the sense in which it points to
   the author, to that which brings about the effect, if, as we read,
   [4544] "God commanded and they were created."  For Christ is, in a
   manner, the demiurge, to whom the Father says, "Let there be light,"
   and "Let there be a firmament."  But Christ is demiurge as a beginning
   (arche), inasmuch as He is wisdom.  It is in virtue of His being wisdom
   that He is called arche.  For Wisdom says in Solomon: [4545]   "God
   created me the beginning of His ways, for His works," so that the Word
   might be in an arche, namely, in wisdom.  Considered in relation to the
   structure of contemplation and thoughts about the whole of things, it
   is regarded as wisdom; but in relation to that side of the objects of
   thought, in which reasonable beings apprehend them, it is considered as
   the Word.  And there is no wonder, since, as we have said before, the
   Saviour is many good things, if He comprises in Himself thoughts of the
   first order, and of the second, and of the third.  This is what John
   suggested when he said about the Word: [4546]   "That which was made
   was life in Him."  Life then came in the Word.  And on the one side the
   Word is no other than the Christ, the Word, He who was with the Father,
   by whom all things were made; while, on the other side, the Life is no
   other than the Son of God, who says: [4547]   "I am the way and the
   truth and the life."  As, then, life came into being in the Word, so
   the Word in the arche.  Consider, however, if we are at liberty to take
   this meaning of arche for our text:  "In the beginning was the Word,"
   so as to obtain the meaning that all things came into being according
   to wisdom and according to the models of the system which are present
   in his thoughts.  For I consider that as a house or a ship is built and
   fashioned in accordance with the sketches of the builder or designer,
   the house or the ship having their beginning (arche) in the sketches
   and reckonings in his mind, so all things came into being in accordance
   with the designs of what was to be, clearly laid down by God in
   wisdom.  And we should add that having created, so to speak, ensouled
   [4548] wisdom, He left her to hand over, from the types which were in
   her, to things existing and to matter, the actual emergence of them,
   their moulding and their forms. [4549]   But I consider, if it be
   permitted to say this, that the beginning (arche) of real existence was
   the Son of God, saying: [4550]   "I am the beginning and the end, the A
   and the O, the first and the last."  We must, however, remember that He
   is not the arche in respect of every name which is applied to Him.  For
   how can He be the beginning in respect of His being life, when life
   came in the Word, and the Word is manifestly the arche of life?  It is
   also tolerably evident that He cannot be the arche in respect of His
   being the first-born from the dead.  And if we go through all His
   titles carefully we find that He is the arche only in respect of His
   being wisdom.  Not even as the Word is He the arche, for the Word was
   in the arche.  And so one might venture to say that wisdom is anterior
   to all the thoughts that are expressed in the titles of the first-born
   of every creature.  Now God is altogether one and simple; but our
   Saviour, for many reasons, since God [4551] set Him forth a
   propitiation and a first fruits of the whole creation, is made many
   things, or perhaps all these things; the whole creation, so far as
   capable of redemption, stands in need of Him. [4552]   And, hence, He
   is made the light of men, because men, being darkened by wickedness,
   need the light that shines in darkness, and is not overtaken by the
   darkness; had not men been in darkness, He would not have become the
   light of men.  The same thing may be observed in respect of His being
   the first-born of the dead.  For supposing the woman had not been
   deceived, and Adam had not fallen, and man created for incorruption had
   obtained it, then He would not have descended into the grave, nor would
   He have died, there being no sin, nor would His love of men have
   required that He should die, and if He had not died, He could not have
   been the first-born of the dead.  We may also ask whether He would ever
   have become a shepherd, had man not been thrown together with the
   beasts which are devoid of reason, and made like to them.  For if God
   saves man and beasts, He saves those beasts which He does save, by
   giving them a shepherd, since they cannot have a king.  Thus if we
   collect the titles of Jesus, the question arises which of them were
   conferred on Him later, and would never have assumed such importance if
   the saints had begun and had also persevered in blessedness.  Perhaps
   Wisdom would be the only remaining one, or perhaps the Word would
   remain too, or perhaps the Life, or perhaps the Truth, not the others,
   which He took for our sake.  And happy indeed are those who in their
   need for the Son of God have yet become such persons as not to need Him
   in His character as a physician healing the sick, nor in that of a
   shepherd, nor in that of redemption, but only in His characters as
   wisdom, as the word and righteousness, or if there be any other title
   suitable for those who are so perfect as to receive Him in His fairest
   characters.  So much for the phrase "In the beginning."

   23.  The Title "Word" Is to Be Interpreted by the Same Method as the
   Other Titles of Christ.  The Word of God is Not a Mere Attribute of
   God, But a Separate Person.  What is Meant When He is Called the Word.

   Let us consider, however, a little more carefully what is the Word
   which is in the beginning.  I am often led to wonder when I consider
   the things that are said about Christ, even by those who are in earnest
   in their belief in Him.  Though there is a countless number of names
   which can be applied to our Saviour, they omit the most of them, and if
   they should remember them, they declare that these titles are not to be
   understood in their proper sense, but tropically.  But when they come
   to the title Logos (Word), and repeat that Christ alone is the Word of
   God, they are not consistent, and do not, as in the case of the other
   titles, search out what is behind the meaning of the term "Word."  I
   wonder at the stupidity of the general run of Christians in this
   matter.  I do not mince matters; it is nothing but stupidity.  The Son
   of God says in one passage, "I am the light of the world," and in
   another, "I am the resurrection," and again, "I am the way and the
   truth and the life."  It is also written, "I am the door," and we have
   the saying, "I am the good shepherd," and when the woman of Samaria
   says, "We know the Messiah is coming, who is called Christ; when He
   comes, He will tell us all things," Jesus answers, "I that speak unto
   thee am He."  Again, when He washed the disciples' feet, He declared
   Himself in these words [4553] to be their Master and Lord:  "You call
   Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am."  He also distinctly
   announces Himself as the Son of God, when He says, [4554] "He whom the
   Father sanctified and sent unto the world, to Him do you say, Thou
   blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?" and [4555] "Father,
   the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that the Son also may glorify
   Thee."  We also find Him declaring Himself to be a king, as when He
   answers Pilate's question, [4556] "Art Thou the King of the Jews?" by
   saying, "My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this
   world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to
   the Jews, but now is My kingdom not from hence."  We have also read the
   words, [4557] "I am the true vine and My Father is the husbandman," and
   again, "I am the vine, ye are the branches."  Add to these testimonies
   also the saying, [4558] "I am the bread of life, that came down from
   heaven and giveth life to the world."  These texts will suffice for the
   present, which we have picked up out of the storehouse of the Gospels,
   and in all of which He claims to be the Son of God.  But in the
   Apocalypse of John, too, He says, [4559] "I am the first and the last,
   and the living One, and I was dead.  Behold, I am alive for evermore."
   And again, [4560] "I am the A and the O, and the first and the last,
   the beginning and the end."  The careful student of the sacred books,
   moreover, may gather not a few similar passages from the prophets, as
   where He calls Himself [4561] a chosen shaft, and a servant of God,
   [4562] and a light of the Gentiles. [4563]   Isaiah also says, [4564]
   "From my mother's womb hath He called me by my name, and He made my
   mouth as a sharp sword, and under the shadow of His hand did He hide
   me, and He said to me, Thou art My servant, O Israel, and in thee will
   I be glorified."  And a little farther on:  "And my God shall be my
   strength, and He said to me, This is a great thing for thee to be
   called My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob and to turn again the
   diaspora of Israel.  Behold I have set thee for a light of the
   Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the
   earth."  And in Jeremiah too [4565] He likens Himself to a lamb, as
   thus:  "I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter."  These
   and other similar sayings He applies to Himself.  In addition to these
   one might collect in the Gospels and the Apostles and in the prophets a
   countless number of titles which are applied to the Son of God, as the
   writers of the Gospels set forth their own views of what He is, or the
   Apostles extol Him out of what they had learned, or the prophets
   proclaim in advance His coming advent and announce the things
   concerning Him under various names.  Thus John calls Him the Lamb of
   God, saying, [4566] "Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins
   of the world," and in these words he declares Him as a man, [4567]
   "This is He about whom I said, that there cometh after me a man who is
   there before me; for He was before me."  And in his Catholic Epistle
   John says that He is a Paraclete for our souls with the Father, as
   thus: [4568]   "And if any one sin, we have a Paraclete with the
   Father, Jesus Christ the righteous," and he adds that He is a
   propitiation for our sins, and similarly Paul says He is a
   propitiation: [4569]   "Whom God set forth as a propitiation through
   faith in His blood, on account of forgiveness of the forepast sins, in
   the forbearance of God."  According to Paul, too, He is declared to be
   the wisdom and the power of God, as in the Epistle to the Corinthians:
   [4570]   "Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."  It is added
   that He is also sanctification and redemption:  "He was made to us of
   God," he says, "wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and
   redemption."  But he also teaches us, writing to the Hebrews, that
   Christ is a High-Priest: [4571]   "Having, therefore, a great
   High-Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God,
   let us hold fast our profession."  And the prophets have other names
   for Him besides these.  Jacob in his blessing of his sons [4572] says,
   "Judah, thy brethren shall extol thee; thy hands are on the necks of
   thine enemies.  A lion's whelp is Judah, from a shoot, my son, art thou
   sprung up; thou hast lain down and slept as a lion; who shall awaken
   him?"  We cannot now linger over these phrases, to show that what is
   said of Judah applies to Christ.  What may be quoted against this view,
   viz., "A ruler shall not part from Judah nor a leader from his loins,
   until He come for whom it is reserved;" this can better be cleared up
   on another occasion.  But Isaiah knows Christ to be spoken of under the
   names of Jacob and Israel, when he says, [4573] "Jacob is my servant, I
   will help Him; Israel is my elect, my soul hath accepted Him.  He shall
   declare judgment to the Gentiles.  He shall not strive nor cry, neither
   shall any one hear His voice on the streets.  A bruised rod shall He
   not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He bring forth
   judgment from victory, and in His name shall the nations hope."  That
   it is Christ about whom such prophecies are made, Matthew shows in his
   Gospel, where he quotes from memory and says: [4574]   "That the saying
   might be fulfilled, He shall not strive nor cry," etc.  David also is
   called Christ, as where Ezekiel in his prophecy to the shepherds adds
   as from the mouth of God: [4575]   "I will raise up David my servant,
   who shall be their shepherd."  For it is not the patriarch David who is
   to rise and be the shepherd of the saints, but Christ.  Isaiah also
   called Christ the rod and the flower: [4576]   "There shall come forth
   a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of this
   root, and the spirit of God shall rest upon Him, the spirit of wisdom
   and understanding, the spirit of counsel and of might, the spirit of
   knowledge and of godliness, and He shall be full of the spirit of the
   fear of the Lord."  And in the Psalms our Lord is called the stone, as
   follows: [4577]   "The stone which the builders rejected is made the
   head of the corner.  It is from the Lord, and it is wonderful in our
   eyes."  And the Gospel shows, as also does Luke in the Acts, that the
   stone is no other than Christ; the Gospel as follows: [4578]   "Have ye
   never read, the stone which the builders rejected is made the head of
   the corner.  Whosoever falls on this stone shall be broken, but on
   whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust."  And Luke
   writes in Acts: [4579]   "This is the stone, which was set at naught of
   you the builders, which has become the head of the corner."  And one of
   the names applied to the Saviour is that which He Himself does not
   utter, but which John records;--the Word who was in the beginning with
   God, God the Word.  And it is worth our while to fix our attention for
   a moment on those scholars who omit consideration of most of the great
   names we have mentioned and regard this as the most important one.  As
   to the former titles, they look for any account of them that any one
   may offer, but in the case of this one they proceed differently and
   ask, What is the Son of God when called the Word?  The passage they
   employ most is that in the Psalms, [4580] "My heart hath produced a
   good Word;" and they imagine the Son of God to be the utterance of the
   Father deposited, as it were, in syllables, and accordingly they do not
   allow Him, if we examine them farther, any independent hypostasis, nor
   are they clear about His essence.  I do not mean that they confuse its
   qualities, but the fact of His having an essence of His own.  For no
   one can understand how that which is said to be "Word" can be a Son.
   And such an animated Word, not being a separate entity from the Father,
   and accordingly as it, having no subsistence. is not a Son, or if he is
   a Son, let them say that God the Word is a separate being and has an
   essence of His own.  We insist, therefore, that as in the case of each
   of the titles spoken of above we turn from the title to the concept it
   suggests and apply it and demonstrate how the Son of God is suitably
   described by it, the same course must be followed when we find Him
   called the Word.  What caprice it is, in all these cases, not to stand
   upon the term employed, but to enquire in what sense Christ is to be
   understood to be the door, and in what way the vine, and why He is the
   way; but in the one case of His being called the Word, to follow a
   different course.  To add to the authority, therefore, of what we have
   to say on the question, how the Son of God is the Word, we must begin
   with those names of which we spoke first as being applied to Him.
   This, we cannot deny, will seem to some to be superfluous and a
   digression, but the thoughtful reader will not think it useless to ask
   as to the concepts for which the titles are used; to observe these
   matters will clear the way for what is coming.  And once we have
   entered upon the theology concerning the Saviour, as we seek with what
   diligence we can and find the various things that are taught about Him,
   we shall necessarily understand more about Him not only in His
   character as the Word, but in His other characters also.

   24.  Christ as Light; How He, and How His Disciples are the Light of
   the World.

   He said, then, that He was the light of the world; and we have to
   examine, along with this title, those which are parallel to it; and,
   indeed, are thought by some to be not merely parallel, but identical
   with it.  He is the true light, and the light of the Gentiles.  In the
   opening of the Gospel now before us He is the light of men:  "That
   which was made," [4581] it says, "was life in Him, and the life was the
   light of men; and the light shines in darkness, and the darkness did
   not overtake it."  A little further on, in the same passage, He is
   called the true light: [4582]   "The true light, which lightens every
   man, was coming into the world."  In Isaiah, He is the light of the
   Gentiles, as we said before.  "Behold, [4583] I have set Thee for a
   light of the Gentiles, that Thou shouldest be for salvation to the end
   of the earth."  Now the sensible light of the world is the sun, and
   after it comes very worthily the moon, and the same title may be
   applied to the stars; but those lights of the world are said in Moses
   to have come into existence on the fourth day, and as they shed light
   on the things on the earth, they are not the true light.  But the
   Saviour shines on creatures which have intellect and sovereign reason,
   that their minds may behold their proper objects of vision, and so he
   is the light of the intellectual world, that is to say, of the
   reasonable souls which are in the sensible world, and if there be any
   beings beyond these in the world from which He declares Himself to be
   our Saviour.  He is, indeed, the most determining and distinguished
   part of that world, and, as we may say, the sun who makes the great day
   of the Lord.  In view of this day He says to those who partake of His
   light, "Work [4584] while it is day; the night cometh when no man can
   work.  As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
   Then He says to His disciples, [4585] "Ye are the light of the world,"
   and "Let your light shine before men."  Thus we see the Church, the
   bride, to present an analogy to the moon and stars, and the disciples
   have a light, which is their own or borrowed from the true sun, so that
   they are able to illuminate those who have no command of any spring of
   light in themselves.  We may say that Paul and Peter are the light of
   the world, and that those of their disciples who are enlightened
   themselves, but are not able to enlighten others, are the world of
   which the Apostles were the light.  But the Saviour, being the light of
   the world, illuminates not bodies, but by His incorporeal power the
   incorporeal intellect, to the end that each of us, enlightened as by
   the sun, may be able to discern the rest of the things of the mind.
   And as when the sun is shining the moon and the stars lose their power
   of giving light, so those who are irradiated by Christ and receive His
   beams have no need of the ministering apostles and prophets--we must
   have courage to declare this truth--nor of the angels; I will add that
   they have no need even of the greater powers when they are disciples of
   that first-born light.  To those who do not receive the solar beams of
   Christ, the ministering saints do afford an illumination much less than
   the former; this illumination is as much as those persons can receive,
   and it completely fills them.  Christ, again, the light of the world,
   is the true light as distinguished from the light of sense; nothing
   that is sensible is true.  Yet though the sensible is other than the
   true, it does not follow that the sensible is false, for the sensible
   may have an analogy with the intellectual, and not everything that is
   not true can correctly be called false.  Now I ask whether the light of
   the world is the same thing with the light of men, and I conceive that
   a higher power of light is intended by the former phrase than by the
   latter, for the world in one sense is not only men.  Paul shows that
   the world is something more than men when he writes to the Corinthians
   in his first Epistle: [4586]   "We are made a spectacle unto the world,
   and to angels, and to men."  In one sense, too, it may be considered,
   [4587] the world is the creation which is being delivered from the
   bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of
   God, whose earnest expectation is waiting for the manifestation of the
   sons of God.  We also draw attention to the comparison which may be
   drawn between the statement, "I am the light of the world," and the
   words addressed to the disciples, "Ye are the light of the world."
   Some suppose that the genuine disciples of Jesus are greater than other
   creatures, some seeking the reason of this in the natural growth of
   these disciples, others inferring it from their harder struggle.  For
   those beings which are in flesh and blood have greater labours and a
   life more full of dangers than those which are in an ethereal body, and
   the lights of heaven might not, if they had put on bodies of earth,
   have accomplished this life of ours free from danger and from error.
   Those who incline to this argument may appeal to those texts of
   Scripture which say the most exalted things about men, and to the fact
   that the Gospel is addressed directly to men; not so much is said about
   the creation, or, as we understand it, about the world.  We read,
   [4588] "As I and Thou are one, that they also may be one in Us," and
   [4589] "Where I am, there will also My servant be."  These sayings,
   plainly, are about men; while about the creation it is said that it is
   delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory
   of the children of God.  It might be added that not even when it is
   delivered will it take part in the glory of the sons of God.  Nor will
   those who hold this view forget that the first-born of every creature,
   honouring man above all else, became man, and that it was not any of
   the constellations existing in the sky, but one of another order,
   appointed for this purpose and in the service of the knowledge of
   Jesus, that was made to be the Star of the East, whether it was like
   the other stars or perchance better than they, to be the sign of Him
   who is the most excellent of all.  And if the boasting of the saints is
   in their tribulations, since [4590] "tribulation worketh patience, and
   patience probation, and probation hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,"
   then the afflicted creation cannot have the like patience with man, nor
   the like probation, nor the like hope, but another degree of these,
   since [4591] "the creation was made subject to vanity, not willingly,
   but on account of Him who subjected it, for hope."  Now he who shrinks
   from conferring such great attributes on man will turn to another
   direction and say that the creature being subjected to vanity groans
   and suffers greater affliction than those who groan in this tabernacle,
   for has she not suffered for the utmost extent of time in her service
   of vanity--nay, many times as long as man?  For why does she do this
   not willingly, but that it is against her nature to be subject to
   vanity, and not to have the best arrangement of her life, that which
   she shall receive when she is set free, when the world is destroyed and
   released even from the vanity of bodies.  Here, however, we may appear
   to be stretching too far, and aiming at more than the question now
   before us requires.  We may return, therefore, to the point from which
   we set out, and ask for what reason the Saviour is called the light of
   the world, the true light, and the light of men.  Now we saw that He is
   called the true light with reference to the sensible light of the
   world, and that the light of the world is the same thing as the light
   of men, or that we may at least enquire whether they are the same.
   This discussion is not superfluous.  Some students do not take anything
   at all out of the statement that the Saviour is the Word; and it is
   important for us to assure ourselves that we are not chargeable with
   caprice in fixing our attention on that notion.  If it admits of being
   taken in a metaphorical sense we ought not to take it literally. [4592]
     When we apply the mystical and allegorical method to the expression
   "light of the world" and the many analogous terms mentioned above, we
   should surely do so with this expression also.

   25.  Christ as the Resurrection.

   Now He is called the light of men and the true light and the light of
   the word, because He brightens and irradiates the higher parts of men,
   or, in a word, of all reasonable beings.  And similarly it is from and
   because of the energy with which He causes the old deadness to be put
   aside and that which is par excellence life to be put on, so that those
   who have truly received Him rise again from the dead, that He is called
   the resurrection.  And this He does not only at the moment at which a
   man says, [4593] "We are buried with Christ through baptism and have
   risen again with Him," but much rather when a man, having laid off all
   about him that belongs to death, walks in the newness of life which
   belongs to Him, the Son, while here.  We always [4594] "carry about in
   our body the dying of the Lord Jesus," and thus we reap the vast
   advantage, "that the life of the Lord Jesus might be made manifest in
   our bodies."

   26.  Christ as the Way.

   But that progress too, which is in wisdom and which is found by those
   who seek their salvation in it to do for them what they require both in
   respect of exposition of truth in the divine word and in respect of
   conduct according to true righteousness, it lets us understand how
   Christ is the way.  In this way we have to take nothing with us, [4595]
   neither wallet nor coat; we must travel without even a stick, nor must
   we have shoes on our feet.  For this road is itself sufficient for all
   the supplies of our journey; and every one who walks on it wants
   nothing.  He is clad with a garment which is fit for one who is setting
   out in response to an invitation to a wedding; and on this road he
   cannot meet anything that can annoy him.  "No one," Solomon says,
   [4596] "can find out the way of a serpent upon a rock."  I would add,
   or that of any other beast.  Hence there is no need of a staff on this
   road, on which there is no trace of any hostile creature, and the
   hardness of which, whence also it is called rock (petra), makes it
   incapable of harbouring anything hurtful.

   27.  Christ as the Truth.

   Further, the Only-begotten is the truth, because He embraces in Himself
   according to the Father's will the whole reason of all things, and that
   with perfect clearness, and being the truth communicates to each
   creature in proportion to its worthiness.  And should any one enquire
   whether all that the Father knows, according to the depth of His riches
   and His wisdom and His knowledge, is known to our Saviour also, and
   should he, imagining that he will thereby glorify the Father, show that
   some things known to the Father are unknown to the Son, although He
   might have had an equal share of the apprehensions of the unbegotten
   God, we must remind him that it is from His being the truth that He is
   Saviour, and add that if He is the truth complete, then there is
   nothing true which He does not know; truth must not limp for the want
   of the things which, according to those persons, are known to the
   Father only.  Or else let it be shown that some things are known to
   which the name of truth does not apply, but which are above the truth.
     __________________________________________________________________

   28.  Christ as Life.

   It is clear also that the principle of that life which is pure and
   unmixed with any other element, resides in Him who is the first-born of
   all creation, taking from which those who have a share in Christ live
   the life which is true life, while all those who are thought to live
   apart from this, as they have not the true light, have not the true
   life either.
     __________________________________________________________________

   29.  Christ as the Door and as the Shepherd.

   But as one cannot be in the Father or with the Father except by
   ascending from below upwards and coming first to the divinity of the
   Son, through which one may be led by the hand and brought to the
   blessedness of the Father Himself, so the Saviour has the inscription
   "The Door."  And as He is a lover of men, and approves the impulse of
   human souls to better things, even of those who do not hasten to reason
   (the Logos), but like sheep have a weakness and gentleness apart from
   all accuracy and reason, so He is the Shepherd.  For the Lord saves men
   and beasts, [4597] and Israel and Juda are sowed with the seed not of
   men only but also of beasts. [4598]

   30.  Christ as Anointed (Christ) and as King.

   In addition to these titles we must consider at the outset of our work
   that of Christ, and we must also consider that of King, and compare
   these two so as to find out the difference between them.  Now it is
   said in the forty-fourth Psalm, [4599] "Thou hast loved righteousness
   and hated iniquity, whence Thou art anointed (Christ) above Thy
   fellows."  His loving righteousness and hating iniquity were thus added
   claims in Him; His anointing was not contemporary with His being nor
   inherited by Him from the first.  Anointing is a symbol of entering on
   the kingship, and sometimes also on the priesthood; and must we
   therefore conclude that the kingship of the Son of God is not inherited
   nor congenital to Him?  But how is it conceivable that the First-born
   of all creation was not a king and became a king afterwards because He
   loved righteousness, when, moreover, He Himself was righteousness?  We
   cannot fail to see that it is as a man that He is Christ, in respect of
   His soul, which was human and liable to be troubled and sore vexed, but
   that He is conceived as king in respect of the divine in Him.  I find
   support for this in the seventy-first Psalm, [4600] which says, "Give
   the king Thy judgment, O God, and Thy righteousness to the king's Son,
   to judge Thy people in righteousness and Thy poor in judgment."  This
   Psalm, though addressed to Solomon, is evidently a prophecy of Christ,
   and it is worth while to ask to what king the prophecy desires judgment
   to be given by God, and to what king's Son, and what king's
   righteousness is spoken of.  I conceive, then, that what is called the
   King is the leading nature of the First-born of all creation, to which
   judgment is given on account of its eminence; and that the man whom He
   assumed, formed and moulded by that nature, according to righteousness,
   is the King's Son.  I am the more led to think that this is so, because
   the two beings are here brought together in one sentence, and are
   spoken of as if they were not two but one.  For the Saviour made both
   one, [4601] that is, He made them according to the prototype of the two
   which had been made one in Himself before all things.  The two I refer
   to human nature, since each man's soul is mixed with the Holy Spirit,
   and each of those who are saved is thus made spiritual.  Now as there
   are some to whom Christ is a shepherd, as we said before, because of
   their meek and composed nature, though they are less guided by reason;
   so there are those to whom He is a king, those, namely, who are led in
   their approach to religion rather by the reasonable part of their
   nature.  And among those who are under a king there are differences;
   some experience his rule in a more mystic and hidden and more divine
   way, others in a less perfect fashion.  I should say that those who,
   led by reason, apart from all agencies of sense, have beheld
   incorporeal things, the things which Paul speaks of as "invisible," or
   "not seen," that they are ruled by the leading nature of the
   Only-begotten, but that those who have only advanced as far as the
   reason which is conversant with sensible things, and on account of
   these glorify their Maker, that these also are governed by the Word, by
   Christ.  No offence need be taken at our distinguishing these notions
   in the Saviour; we draw the same distinctions in His substance.

   31.  Christ as Teacher and Master.

   It is plain to all how our Lord is a teacher and an interpreter for
   those who are striving towards godliness, and on the other hand a
   master of those servants who have the spirit of bondage to fear, [4602]
   who make progress and hasten towards wisdom, and are found worthy to
   possess it.  For [4603] "the servant knoweth not what the master
   wills," since he is no longer his master, but has become his friend.
   The Lord Himself teaches this, for He says to hearers who were still
   servants: [4604]   "You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for
   so I am," but in another passage, [4605] "I call you no longer
   servants, for the servant knoweth not what is the will of his master,
   but I call you friends," because [4606] "you have continued with Me in
   all My temptations."  They, then, who live according to fear, which God
   exacts from those who are not good servants, as we read in Malachi,
   [4607] "If I am a Master, where is My fear?" are servants of a master
   who is called their Saviour.

   32.  Christ as Son.

   None of these testimonies, however, sets forth distinctly the Saviour's
   exalted birth; but when the words are addressed to Him, "Thou art My
   Son, this day have I begotten Thee," [4608] this is spoken to Him by
   God, with whom all time is to-day, for there is no evening with God, as
   I consider, and there is no morning, nothing but time that stretches
   out, along with His unbeginning and unseen life.  The day is to-day
   with Him in which the Son was begotten, and thus the beginning of His
   birth is not found, as neither is the day of it.

   33.  Christ the True Vine, and as Bread.

   To what we have said must be added how the Son is the true vine.  Those
   will have no difficulty in apprehending this who understand, in a
   manner worthy of the prophetic grace, the saying: [4609]   "Wine maketh
   glad the heart of man."  For if the heart be the intellectual part, and
   what rejoices it is the Word most pleasant of all to drink which takes
   us off human things, makes us feel ourselves inspired, and intoxicates
   us with an intoxication which is not irrational but divine, that, I
   conceive, with which Joseph made his brethren merry, [4610] then it is
   very clear how He who brings wine thus to rejoice the heart of man is
   the true vine.  He is the true vine, because the grapes He bears are
   the truth, the disciples are His branches, and they, also, bring forth
   the truth as their fruit.  It is somewhat difficult to show the
   difference between the vine and bread, for He says, not only that He is
   the vine, but that He is the bread of life.  May it be that as bread
   nourishes and makes strong, and is said to strengthen the heart of man,
   but wine, on the contrary, pleases and rejoices and melts him, so
   ethical studies, bringing life to him who learns them and reduces them
   to practice, are the bread of life, but cannot properly be called the
   fruit of the vine, while secret and mystical speculations, rejoicing
   the heart and causing those to feel inspired who take them in,
   delighting in the Lord, and who desire not only to be nourished but to
   be made happy, are called the juice of the true vine, because they flow
   from it.

   34.  Christ as the First and the Last; He is Also What Lies Between
   These.

   Further, we have to ask in what sense He is called in the Apocalypse
   the First and the Last, and how, in His character as the First, He is
   not the same as the Alpha and the beginning, while in His character as
   the Last He is not the same as the Omega and the end.  It appears to
   me, then, that the reasonable beings which exist are characterized by
   many forms, and that some of them are the first, some the second, some
   the third, and so on to the last.  To pronounce exactly, however, which
   is the first, what kind of a being the second is, which may truly be
   designated third, and to carry this out to the end of the series, this
   is not a task for man, but transcends our nature.  We shall yet
   venture, such as we are, to stand still a little at this point, and to
   make some observations on the matter.  There are some gods of whom God
   is god, as we hear in prophecy, [4611] "Thank ye the God of gods," and
   [4612] "The God of gods hath spoken, and called the earth."  Now God,
   according to the Gospel, [4613] "is not the God of the dead but of the
   living."  Those gods, then, are living of whom God is god.  The
   Apostle, too, writing to the Corinthians, says: [4614]   "As there are
   gods many and lords many," and so we have spoken of these gods as
   really existing.  Now there are, besides the gods of whom God is god,
   certain others, who are called thrones, and others called dominions,
   lordships, also, and powers in addition to these.  The phrase, [4615]
   "above every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in
   that which is to come," leads us to believe that there are yet others
   besides these which are less familiar to us; one kind of these the
   Hebrews called Sabai, from which Sabaoth was formed, who is their
   ruler, and is none other than God.  Add to all these the reasonable
   being who is mortal, man.  Now the God of all things made first in
   honour some race of reasonable beings; this I consider to be those who
   are called gods, and the second order, let us say, for the present, are
   the thrones, and the third, undoubtedly, the dominions.  And thus we
   come down in order to the last reasonable race, which, perhaps, cannot
   be any other than man.  The Saviour accordingly became, in a diviner
   way than Paul, all things to all, that He might either gain all or
   perfect them; it is clear that to men He became a man, and to the
   angels an angel.  As for His becoming man no believer has any doubt,
   but as to His becoming an angel, we shall find reason for believing it
   was so, if we observe carefully the appearances and the words of the
   angels, in some of which the powers of the angels seem to belong to
   Him.  In several passages angels speak in such a way as to suggest
   this, as when [4616] "the angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of
   fire.  And he said, I am the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of
   Jacob."  But Isaiah also says: [4617]    "His name is called Angel of
   Great Counsel."  The Saviour, then, is the first and the last, not that
   He is not what lies between, but the extremities are named to show that
   He became all things.  Consider, however, whether the last is man, or
   the things said to be under the earth, of which are the demons, all of
   them or some.  We must ask, too, about those things which the Saviour
   became which He speaks of through the prophet David, [4618] "And I
   became as a man without any to help him, free among the dead."  His
   birth from the Virgin and His life so admirably lived showed Him to be
   more than man, and it was the same among the dead.  He was the only
   free person there, and His soul was not left in hell.  Thus, then, He
   is the first and the last.  Again, if there be letters of God, as such
   there are, by reading which the saints may say they have read what is
   written on the tablets of heaven, these letters, by which heavenly
   things are to be read, are the notions, divided into small parts, into
   A and so on to O, the Son of God.  Again, He is the beginning and the
   end, but He is this not in all His aspects equally.  For He is the
   beginning, as the Proverbs teach us, inasmuch as He is wisdom; it is
   written:  "The Lord founded Me in the beginning of His ways, for His
   works."  In the respect of His being the Logos He is not the
   beginning.  "The Word was in the beginning."  Thus in His aspects one
   comes first and is the beginning, and there is a second after the
   beginning, and a third, and so on to the end, as if He had said, I am
   the beginning. inasmuch as I am wisdom, and the second, perhaps,
   inasmuch as I am invisible, and the third in that I am life, for "what
   was made was life in Him."  One who was qualified to examine and to
   discern the sense of Scripture might, no doubt, find many members of
   the series; I cannot say if he could find them all.  "The beginning and
   the end" is a phrase we usually apply to a thing that is a completed
   unity; the beginning of a house is its foundation and the end the
   parapet.  We cannot but think of this figure, since Christ is the stone
   which is the head of the corner, to the great unity of the body of the
   saved.  For Christ the only-begotten Son is all and in all, He is as
   the beginning in the man He assumed, He is present as the end in the
   last of the saints, and He is also in those between, or else He is
   present as the beginning in Adam, as the end in His life on earth,
   according to the saying:  "The last Adam was made a quickening
   spirit."  This saying harmonizes well with the interpretation we have
   given of the first and the last.

   35.  Christ as the Living and the Dead.

   In what has been said about the first and the last, and about the
   beginning and the end, we have referred these words at one point to the
   different forms of reasonable beings, at another to the different
   conceptions of the Son of God.  Thus we have gained a distinction
   between the first and the beginning, and between the last and the end,
   and also the distinctive meaning of A and O.  It is not hard to see why
   he is called [4619] "the Living and the Dead," and after being dead He
   that is alive for evermore.  For since we were not helped by His
   original life, sunk as we were in sin, He came down into our deadness
   in order that, He having died to sin, we, [4620] bearing about in our
   body the dying of Jesus. might then receive that life of His which is
   for evermore.  For those who always carry about in their body the dying
   of Jesus shall obtain the life of Jesus also, manifested in their
   bodies.

   36.  Christ as a Sword.

   The texts of the New Testament, which we have discussed, are things
   said by Himself about Himself.  Isaiah, however, He said [4621] that
   His mouth had been set by His Father as a sharp sword, and that He was
   hidden under the shadow of His hand, made like to a chosen shaft and
   kept close in the Father's quiver, called His servant by the God of all
   things, and Israel, and Light of the Gentiles.  The mouth of the Son of
   God is a sharp sword, for [4622] "The word of God is living, and
   active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing to the
   dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to
   discern the thoughts and intents of the heart."  And indeed He came not
   to bring peace on the earth, that is, to corporeal and sensible things,
   but a sword, and to cut through, if I may say so, the disastrous
   friendship of soul and body, so that the soul, committing herself to
   the spirit which was against the flesh, may enter into friendship with
   God.  Hence, according to the prophetic word, He made His mouth as a
   sword, as a sharp sword.  Can any one behold so many wounded by the
   divine love, like her in the Song of Songs, who complained that she was
   wounded: [4623]   "I am wounded with love," and find the dart that
   wounded so many souls for the love of God, in any but Him who said, "He
   hath made Me as a chosen shaft."

   37.  Christ as a Servant, as the Lamb of God, and as the Man Whom John
   Did Not Know.

   Again, let any one consider how Jesus was to His disciples, not as He
   who sits at meat, but as He who serves, and how though the Son of God
   He took on Him the form of a servant for the sake of the freedom of
   those who were enslaved in sin, and he will be at no loss to account
   for the Father's saying to Him: [4624]   "Thou art My servant," and a
   little further on:  "It is a great thing that thou shouldst be called
   My servant."  For we do not hesitate to say that the goodness of Christ
   appears in a greater and more divine light, and more according to the
   image of the Father, because [4625] "He humbled Himself, becoming
   obedient unto death, even the death of the cross," than if He had
   judged it a thing to be grasped to be equal with God, and had shrunk
   from becoming a servant for the salvation of the world.  Hence He says,
   [4626] desiring to teach us that in accepting this state of servitude
   He had received a great gift from His Father:  "And My God shall be My
   strength.  And He said to Me, It is a great thing for Thee to be called
   My servant."  For if He had not become a servant, He would not have
   raised up the tribes of Jacob, nor have turned the heart of the
   diaspora of Israel, and neither would He have become a light of the
   Gentiles to be for salvation to the ends of the earth.  And it is no
   great thing for Him to become a servant, even if it is called a great
   thing by His Father, for this is in comparison with His being called
   with an innocent sheep and with a lamb.  For the Lamb of God became
   like an innocent sheep being led to the slaughter, that He may take
   away the sin of the world.  He who supplies reason (logos) to all is
   made like a lamb which is dumb before her shearer, that we might be
   purified by His death, which is given as a sort of medicine against the
   opposing power, and also against the sin of those who open their minds
   to the truth.  For the death of Christ reduced to impotence those
   powers which war against the human race, and it set free from sin by a
   power beyond our words the life of each believer.  Since, then, He
   takes away sin until every enemy shall be destroyed and death last of
   all, in order that the whole world may be free from sin, therefore John
   points to Him and says: [4627]   "Behold the Lamb of God which taketh
   away the sin of the world."  It is not said that He will take it away
   in the future, nor that He is at present taking it, nor that He has
   taken it, but is not taking it away now.  His taking away sin is still
   going on, He is taking it away from every individual in the world, till
   sin be taken away from the whole world, and the Saviour deliver the
   kingdom prepared and completed to the Father, a kingdom in which no sin
   is left at all, and which, therefore, is ready to accept the Father as
   its king, and which on the other hand is waiting to receive all God has
   to bestow, fully, and in every part, at that time when the saying
   [4628] is fulfilled, "That God may be all in all."  Further, we hear of
   a man who is said to be coming after John, who was made before him and
   was before him.  This is to teach us that the man also of the Son of
   God, the man who was mixed with His divinity, was older than His birth
   from Mary.  John says he does not know this man, but must he not have
   known Him when he leapt for joy when yet a babe unborn in Elisabeth's
   womb, as soon as the voice of Mary's salutation sounded in the ears of
   the wife of Zacharias?  Consider, therefore, if the words "I know Him
   not" may have reference to the period before the bodily existence.
   Though he did not know Him before He assumed His body, yet he knew Him
   when yet in his mother's womb, and perhaps he is here learning
   something new about Him beyond what was known to him before, namely,
   that on whomsoever the Holy Spirit shall descend and abide on him, that
   is he who is to baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire.  He knew
   him from his mother's womb, but not all about Him.  He did not know
   perhaps that this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with
   fire, when he saw the Spirit descending and abiding on Him.  Yet that
   He was indeed a man, and the first man, John did not know.

   38.  Christ as Paraclete, as Propitiation, and as the Power of God.

   But none of the names we have mentioned expresses His representation of
   us with the Father, as He pleads for human nature, and makes atonement
   for it; the Paraclete, and the propitiation, and the atonement.  He has
   the name Paraclete in the Epistle of John: [4629]   "If any man sin, we
   have a Paraclete with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous."  And He
   is said in the same epistle to be the atonement [4630] for our sins.
   Similarly, in the Epistle to the Romans, He is called a propitiation:
   [4631]   "Whom God set forth to be a propitiation through faith."  Of
   this proportion there was a type in the inmost part of the temple, the
   Holy of Holies, namely, the golden mercy-seat placed upon the two
   cherubim.  But how could He ever be the Paraclete, and the atonement,
   and the propitiation without the power of God, which makes an end of
   our weakness, flows over the souls of believers, and is administered by
   Jesus, who indeed is prior to it and Himself the power of God, who
   enables a man to say: [4632]   "I can do all things through Jesus
   Christ who strengtheneth me."  Whence we know that Simon Magus, who
   gave himself the title of "The power of God, which is called great,"
   was consigned to perdition and destruction, he and his money with him.
   We, on the contrary, who confess Christ as the true power of God,
   believe that we share with Him, inasmuch as He is that power, all
   things in which any energy resides.

   39.  Christ as Wisdom and Sanctification and Redemption.

   We must not, however, pass over in silence that He is of right the
   wisdom of God, and hence is called by that name.  For the wisdom of the
   God and Father of all things does not apprehend His substance in mere
   visions, like the phantasms of human thoughts.  Whoever is able to
   conceive a bodiless existence of manifold speculations which extend to
   the rationale of existing things, living and, as it were, ensouled, he
   will see how well the Wisdom of God which is above every creature
   speaks of herself, when she says: [4633]   "God created me the
   beginning of His ways, for His works."  By this creating act the whole
   creation was enabled to exist, not being unreceptive of that divine
   wisdom according to which it was brought into being; for God, according
   to the prophet David, [4634] made all things in wisdom.  But many
   things came into being by the help of wisdom, which do not lay hold of
   that by which they were created:  and few things indeed there are which
   lay hold not only of that wisdom which concerns themselves, but of that
   which has to do with many things besides, namely, of Christ who is the
   whole of wisdom.  But each of the sages, in proportion as he embraces
   wisdom, partakes to that extent of Christ, in that He is wisdom; just
   as every one who is greatly gifted with power, in proportion as he has
   power, in that proportion also has a share in Christ, inasmuch as He is
   power.  The same is to be thought about sanctification and redemption;
   for Jesus Himself is made sanctification to us and redemption.  Each of
   us is sanctified with that sanctification, and redeemed with that
   redemption.  Consider, moreover, if the words "to us," added by the
   Apostle, have any special force.  Christ, he says, "was made to us of
   God, wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption."
   In other passages, he speaks about Christ as being wisdom, without any
   such qualification, and of His being power, saying that Christ is the
   power of God and the wisdom of God, though we might have conceived that
   He was not the wisdom of God or the power of God, absolutely, but only
   for us.  Now, in respect of wisdom and power, we have both forms of the
   statement, the relative and the absolute; but in respect of
   sanctification and redemption, this is not the case.  Consider,
   therefore, since [4635] "He that sanctifies and they that are
   sanctified are all of one," whether the Father is the sanctification of
   Him who is our sanctification, as, Christ being our head, God is His
   head.  But Christ is our redemption because we had become prisoners and
   needed ransoming.  I do not enquire as to His own redemption, for
   though He was tempted in all things as we are, He was without sin, and
   His enemies never reduced Him to captivity.

   40.  Christ as Righteousness; As the Demiurge, the Agent of the Good
   God, and as High-Priest.

   Having expiscated the "to us" and the "absolutely"--sanctification and
   redemption being "to us" and not absolute, wisdom and redemption both
   to us and absolute--we must not omit to enquire into the position of
   righteousness in the same passage.  That Christ is righteousness
   relatively to us appears clearly from the words:  "Who was made to us
   of God wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
   And if we do not find Him to be righteousness absolutely as He is the
   wisdom and the power of God absolutely, then we must enquire whether to
   Christ Himself, as the Father is sanctification, so the Father is also
   righteousness.  There is, we know, no unrighteousness with God; [4636]
   He is a righteous and holy Lord, [4637] and His judgments are in
   righteousness, and being righteous, He orders all things righteously.

   The heretics drew a distinction for purposes of their own between the
   just and the good.  They did not make the matter very clear, but they
   considered that the demiurge was just, while the Father of Christ was
   good.  That distinction may, I think, if carefully examined, be applied
   to the Father and the Son; the Son being righteousness, and having
   received power [4638] to execute judgment, because He is the Son of Man
   and will judge the world in righteousness, but the Father doing good to
   those who have been disciplined by the righteousness of the Son.  This
   is after the kingdom of the Son; then the Father will manifest in His
   works His name the Good, when God becomes all in all.  And perhaps by
   His righteousness the Saviour prepares everything at the fit times, and
   by His word, by His ordering, by His chastisements, and, if I may use
   such an expression, by His spiritual healing aids, disposes all things
   to receive at the end the goodness of the Father.  It was from His
   sense of that goodness that He answered him who addressed the
   Only-begotten with the words "Good Master," [4639] and said, "Why
   callest thou Me good?  None is good but one, God, the Father."  This we
   have treated of elsewhere, especially in dealing with the question of
   the greater than the demiurge; Christ we have taken to be the demiurge,
   and the Father the greater than He.  Such great things, then, He is,
   the Paraclete, the atonement, the propitiation, the sympathizer with
   our weaknesses, who was tempted in all human things, as we are, without
   sin; and in consequence He is a great High-Priest, having offered
   Himself as the sacrifice which is offered once for all, and not for men
   only but for every rational creature.  For without [4640] God He tasted
   death for every one.  In some copies of the Epistle to the Hebrews the
   words are "by the grace of God."  Now, whether He tasted death for
   every one without God, He died not for men only but for all other
   intellectual beings too, or whether He tasted death for every one by
   the grace of God, He died for all without God, for by the grace of God
   He tasted death for every one.  It would surely be absurd to say that
   He tasted death for human sins and not for any other being besides man
   which had fallen into sin, as for example for the stars.  For not even
   the stars are clean in the eyes of God, as we read in Job, [4641] "The
   stars are not clean in His sight," unless this is to be regarded as a
   hyperbole.  Hence he is a great High-Priest, since He restores all
   things to His Father's kingdom, and arranges that whatever defects
   exist in each part of creation shall be filled up so as to be full of
   the glory of the Father.  This High-Priest is called, from some other
   notion of him than those we have noticed, Judas, that those who are
   Jews secretly [4642] may take the name of Jew not from Judah, son of
   Jacob, but from Him, since they are His brethren, and praise Him for
   the freedom they have attained.  For it is He who sets them free,
   saving them from their enemies on whose backs He lays His hand to
   subdue them.  When He has put under His feet the opposing power, and is
   alone in presence of His Father, then He is Jacob and Israel; and thus
   as we are made light by Him, since He is the light of the world, so we
   are made Jacob since He is called Jacob, and Israel since He is called
   Israel.

   41.  Christ as the Rod, the Flower, the Stone.

   Now He receives the kingdom from the king whom the children of Israel
   appointed, beginning the monarchy not at the divine command and without
   even consulting God.  He therefore fights the battles of the Lord and
   so prepares peace for His Son, His people, and this perhaps is the
   reason why He is called David.  Then He is called a rod; [4643] such He
   is to those who need a harder and severer discipline, and have not
   submitted to the love and gentleness of God.  On this account, if He is
   a rod, He has to "go forth;" He does not remain in Himself, but appears
   to go beyond His earlier state.  Going forth, then, and becoming a rod,
   He does not remain a rod, but after the rod He becomes a flower that
   rises up, and after being a rod He is made known as a flower to those
   who, by His being a rod, have met with visitation.  For "God will visit
   their iniquities with a rod," [4644] that is, Christ.  But "His mercy
   He will not take from him," for He will have mercy on him, for on whom
   the Son has mercy the Father has mercy also.  An interpretation may be
   given which makes Him a rod and a flower in respect of different
   persons, a rod to those who have need of chastisement, a flower to
   those who are being saved; but I prefer the account of the matter given
   above.  We must add here, however, that, perhaps, looking to the end,
   if Christ is a rod to any man He is also a flower to him, while it is
   not the case that he who receives Him as a flower must also know Him as
   a rod.  And yet as one flower is more perfect than another and plants
   are said to flower, even though they bring forth no perfect fruit, so
   the perfect receive that of Christ which transcends the flower.  Those,
   on the other hand, who have known Him as a rod will partake along with
   it, not in His perfection, but in the flower which comes before the
   fruit.  Last of all, before we come to the word Logos, Christ was a
   stone, [4645] set at naught by the builders but placed on the head of
   the corner, for the living stones are built up as on a foundation on
   the other stones of the Apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself our
   Lord being the chief corner-stone, because He is a part of the building
   made of living stones in the land of the living; therefore He is called
   a stone.  All this we have said to show how capricious and baseless is
   the procedure of those who, when so many names are given to Christ,
   take the mere appellation "the Word," without enquiring, as in the case
   of His other titles, in what sense it is used; surely they ought to ask
   what is meant when it is said of the Son of God that He was the Word,
   and God, and that He was in the beginning with the Father, and that all
   things were made by Him.

   42.  Of the Various Ways in Which Christ is the Logos.

   As, then, from His activity in enlightening the world whose light He
   is, Christ is named the Light of the World, and as from His making
   those who sincerely attach themselves to Him put away their deadness
   and rise again and put on newness of life, He is called the
   Resurrection, so from an activity of another kind He is called Shepherd
   and Teacher, King and Chosen Shaft, and Servant, and in addition to
   these Paraclete and Atonement and Propitiation.  And after the same
   fashion He is also called the Logos, [4646] because He takes away from
   us all that is irrational, and makes us truly reasonable, so that we do
   all things, even to eating and drinking, to the glory of God, and
   discharge by the Logos to the glory of God both the commoner functions
   of life and those which belong to a more advanced stage.  For if, by
   having part in Him, we are raised up and enlightened, herded also it
   may be and ruled over, then it is clear that we become in a divine
   manner reasonable, when He drives away from us what in us is irrational
   and dead, since He is the Logos (reason) and the Resurrection.
   Consider, however, whether all men have in some way part in Him in His
   character as Logos.  On this point the Apostle teaches us that He is to
   be sought not outside the seeker, and that those find Him in themselves
   who set their heart on doing so; "Say not [4647] in thy heart, Who
   shall ascend into heaven?  That is to bring Christ down; or, Who shall
   descend into the abyss?  That is to bring Christ up from the dead.  But
   what saith the Scripture?  The Word is very nigh thee, in thy mouth and
   in thy heart," as if Christ Himself were the same thing as the Word
   said to be sought after.  But when the Lord Himself says [4648] "If I
   had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin; but now they
   have no cloak for their sin," the only sense we can find in His words
   is that the Logos Himself says that those are not chargeable with sin
   to whom He (reason) has not fully come, but that those, if they sin,
   are guilty who, having had part in Him, act contrary to the ideas by
   which He declares His full presence in us.  Only when thus read is the
   saying true:  "If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had
   sin."  Should the words be applied, as many are of opinion that they
   should, to the visible Christ, then how is it true that those had no
   sin to whom He did not come?  In that case all who lived before the
   advent of the Saviour will be free from sin, since Jesus, as seen in
   flesh, had not yet come.  And more--all those to whom He has never been
   preached will have no sin, and if they have no sin, then it is clear
   they are not liable to judgment.  But the Logos in man, in which we
   have said that our whole race had part, is spoken of in two senses;
   first, in that of the filling up of ideas which takes place, prodigies
   excepted, in every one who passes beyond the age of boyhood, but
   secondly, in that of the consummation, which takes place only in the
   perfect.  The words, therefore, "If I had not come and spoken to them,
   they would not have had sin, but now they have no cloak for their sin,"
   are to be understood in the former sense; but the words, [4649] "All
   that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not
   hear them," in the latter.  For before the consummation of reason
   comes, there is nothing in man but what is blameworthy; all is
   imperfect and defective, and can by no means command the obedience of
   those irrational elements in us which are tropically spoken of as
   sheep.  And perhaps the former meaning is to be recognized in the words
   "The Logos was made flesh," but the second in "The Logos was God."  We
   must accordingly look at what there is to be seen in human affairs
   between the saying, "The Word (reason) was made flesh" and "The Word
   was God."  When the Word was made flesh can we say that it was to some
   extent broken up and thinned out, and can we say that it recovered from
   that point onward till it became again what it was at first, God the
   Word, the Word with the Father; the Word whose glory John saw, the
   verily only-begotten, as from the Father.  But the Son may also be the
   Logos (Word), because He reports the secret things of His Father who is
   intellect in the same way as the Son who is called the Word.  For as
   with us the word is a messenger of those things which the mind
   perceives, so the Word of God, knowing the Father, since no created
   being can approach Him without a guide, reveals the Father whom He
   knows.  For no one knows the Father save the Son, [4650] and he to
   whomsoever the Son reveals Him, and inasmuch as He is the Word He is
   the Messenger of Great Counsel, [4651] who has the government upon His
   shoulders; for He entered on His kingdom by enduring the cross.  In the
   Apocalypse, [4652] moreover, the Faithful and True (the Word), is said
   to sit on a white horse, the epithets indicating, I consider, the
   clearness of the voice with which the Word of truth speaks to us when
   He sojourns among us.  This is scarcely the place to show how the word
   "horse" is often used in passages spoken for our encouragement in
   sacred learning.  I only cite two of these:  "A horse is deceitful for
   safety," [4653] and "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we
   will rejoice in the name of the Lord our God." [4654]   Nor must we
   leave unnoticed a passage in the forty-fourth Psalm, [4655] frequently
   quoted by many writers as if they understood it:  "My heart hath
   belched forth a good word, I speak my works to the King."  Suppose it
   is God the Father who speaks thus; what is His heart, that the good
   word should appear in accordance with His heart?  If, as these writers
   suppose, the Word (Logos) needs no interpretation, then the heart is to
   be taken in the natural sense too.  But it is quite absurd to suppose
   God's heart to be a part of Him as ours is of our body.  We must remind
   such writers that as when the hand of God is spoken of, and His arm and
   His finger, we do not read the words literally but enquire in what
   sound sense we may take them so as to be worthy of God, so His heart is
   to be understood of His rational power, by which He disposes all
   things, and His word of that which announces what is in this heart of
   His.  But who is it that announces the counsel of the Father to those
   of His creatures who are worthy and who have risen above themselves,
   who but the Saviour?  That "belched forth" is not, perhaps, without
   significance; a hundred other terms might have been employed; "My heart
   has produced a good word," it might have been said, or "My heart has
   spoken a good word."  But in belching, some wind that was hidden makes
   its way out to the world, and so it may be that the Father gives out
   views of truth not continuously, but as it were after the fashion of
   belching, and the word has the character of the things thus produced,
   and is called, therefore, the image of the invisible God.  We may enter
   our agreement, therefore, with the ordinary acceptation of these words,
   and take them to be spoken by the Father.  It is not, however, a matter
   of course, that it is God Himself who announces these things.  Why
   should it not be a prophet?  Filled with the Spirit and unable to
   contain himself, he brings forth a word about his prophecy concerning
   Christ:  "My heart hath belched forth a good word, I speak my works to
   the King, my pen is the tongue of a ready writer.  Excellent in beauty
   is He beyond the sons of men."  Then to the Christ Himself:  "Grace is
   poured out on Thy lips."  If the Father were the speaker, how could He
   go on after the words, "Grace is poured out on thy lips," to say,
   "Therefore God hath blessed thee for ever," and a little further on,
   "Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
   above thy fellows."  Some of those who wish to make the Father the
   speaker may appeal to the words, "Hear, O daughter, and behold and
   incline thine ear, and forget thy people and thy father."  The prophet,
   it may be said, could not address the Church in the words, "Hear, O
   daughter."  It is not difficult, however, to show that changes of
   person occur frequently in the Psalms, so that these words, "Hear, O
   daughter," might be from the Father, in this passage, though the Psalm
   as a whole is not.  To our discussion of the Word we may here add the
   passage, [4656] "By the word of the Lord were the heavens founded, and
   all the power of them by the breath of His mouth."  Some refer this to
   the Saviour and the Holy Spirit.  The passage, however, does not
   necessarily imply any more than that the heavens were founded by the
   reason (logos) of God, as when we say that a house is built by the plan
   (logos) of the architect, or a ship by the plan (logos) of the
   shipbuilder.  In the same way the heavens were founded (made solid) by
   the Word of God, for they are [4657] of a more divine substance, which
   on this account is called solid; [4658] it has little fluidity for the
   most part, nor is it easily melted like other parts of the world, and
   specially the lower parts.  On account of this difference the heavens
   are said in a special manner to be constituted by the Word of God.

   The saying then stands, first, "In the beginning was the Logos;" we are
   to place that full in our view; but the testimonies we cited from the
   Proverbs led us to place wisdom first, and to think of wisdom as
   preceding the Word which announces her.  We must observe, then, that
   the Logos is in the beginning, that is, in wisdom, always.  Its being
   in wisdom, which is called the beginning, does not prevent it from
   being with God and from being God, and it is not simply with God, but
   is in the beginning, in wisdom, with God.  For he goes on:  "He was in
   the beginning with God."  He might have said, "He was with God;" but as
   He was in the beginning, so He was with God in the beginning, and "All
   things were made by Him," being in the beginning, for God made all
   things, as David tells us, in wisdom.  And to let us understand that
   the Word has His own definite place and sphere as one who has life in
   Himself (and is a distinct person), we must also speak about powers,
   not about power.  "Thus saith the Lord of powers, (A.V. hosts)" we
   frequently read; there are certain creatures, rational and divine,
   which are called powers:  and of these Christ was the highest and best,
   and is called not only the wisdom of God but also His power.  As, then,
   there are several powers of God, each of them in its own form, and the
   Saviour is different from these, so also Christ, even if that which is
   Logos in us is not in respect of form outside of us, will be understood
   from our discussion up to this point to be the Logos, who has His being
   in the beginning, in wisdom.  This for the present may suffice, on the
   word:  "In the beginning was the Logos."

   Book II.

   1.  "And the Word was with God, and the Word was God."  In the
   preceding section, my revered brother Ambrosius, brother formed
   according to the Gospel, we have discussed, as far as is at present in
   our power, what the Gospel is, and what is the beginning in which the
   Word was, and what the Word is which was in the beginning.  We now come
   to consider the next point in the work before us, How the Word was with
   God.  To this end it will be of service to remember that what is called
   the Word came to certain persons; as "The Word of the Lord [4659] which
   came to Hosea, the son of Beeri," and "The Word [4660] which came to
   Isaiah, the son of Amos, concerning Judah and concerning Jerusalem,"
   and "The Word which came to Jeremiah [4661] concerning the drought."
   We must enquire how this Word came to Hosea, and how it came also to
   Isaiah the son of Amos, and again to Jeremiah concerning the drought;
   the comparison may enable us to find out how the Word was with God.
   The generality will simply look at what the prophets said, as if that
   were the Word of the Lord or the Word, that came to them.  May it not
   be, however, that as we say that this person comes to that, so the Son,
   the Word, of whom we are now theologizing, came to Hosea, sent to him
   by the Father; historically, that is to say, to the son of Beeri, the
   prophet Hosea, but mystically to him who is saved, for Hosea means,
   etymologically, Saved; and to the son of Beeri, which etymologically
   means wells, since every one who is saved becomes a son of that spring
   which gushes forth out of the depths, the wisdom of God.  And it is
   nowise marvellous that the saint should be a son of wells.  From his
   brave deeds he is often called a son, whether, from his works shining
   before men, of light, or from his possessing the peace of God which
   passes all understanding, of peace, or, once more, from the help which
   wisdom brings him, a child of wisdom; for wisdom, [4662] it says, is
   justified of her children.  Thus he who by the divine spirit searches
   all things, and even the deep things of God, so that he can exclaim,
   [4663] "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge
   of God!" he can be a son of wells, to whom the Word of the Lord comes.
   Similarly the Word comes also to Isaiah, teaching the things which are
   coming upon Judæa and Jerusalem in the last days; and so also it comes
   to Jeremiah lifted up by a divine elation.  For Iao means
   etymologically lifting up, elation.  Now the Word comes to men who
   formerly could not receive the advent of the Son of God who is the
   Word; but to God it does not come, as if it had not been with Him
   before.  The Word was always with the Father; and so it is said, "And
   the Word was with God."  He did not come to God, and this same word
   "was" is used of the Word because He was in the beginning at the same
   time when He was with God, neither being separated from the beginning
   nor being bereft of His Father.  And again, neither did He come to be
   in the beginning after He had not been in it, nor did He come to be
   with God after not having been with Him.  For before all time and the
   remotest age [4664] the Word was in the beginning, and the Word was
   with God.  Thus to find out what is meant by the phrase, "The Word was
   with God," we have adduced the words used about the prophets, how He
   came to Hosea, to Isaiah, to Jeremiah, and we have noticed the
   difference, by no means accidental, between "became" and "was."  We
   have to add that in His coming to the prophets He illuminates the
   prophets with the light of knowledge, causing them to see things which
   had been before them, but which they had not understood till then.
   With God, however, He is God, just because He is with Him.  And perhaps
   it was because he saw some such order in the Logos, that John did not
   place the clause "The Word was God" before the clause "The Word was
   with God."  The series in which he places his different sentences does
   not prevent the force of each axiom from being separately and fully
   seen.  One axiom is, "In the beginning was the Word," a second, "The
   Word was with God," and then comes, "And the Word was God."  The
   arrangement of the sentences might be thought to indicate an order; we
   have first "In the beginning was the Word," then, "And the Word was
   with God," and thirdly, "And the Word was God," so that it might be
   seen that the Word being with God makes Him God.

   2.  In What Way the Logos is God.  Errors to Be Avoided on This
   Question.

   We next notice John's use of the article in these sentences.  He does
   not write without care in this respect, nor is he unfamiliar with the
   niceties of the Greek tongue.  In some cases he uses the article, and
   in some he omits it.  He adds the article to the Logos, but to the name
   of God he adds it sometimes only.  He uses the article, when the name
   of God refers to the uncreated cause of all things, and omits it when
   the Logos is named God.  Does the same difference which we observe
   between God with the article and God without it prevail also between
   the Logos with it and without it?  We must enquire into this.  As the
   God who is over all is God with the article not without it, so "the
   Logos" is the source of that reason (Logos) which dwells in every
   reasonable creature; the reason which is in each creature is not, like
   the former called par excellence The Logos.  Now there are many who are
   sincerely concerned about religion, and who fall here into great
   perplexity.  They are afraid that they may be proclaiming two Gods, and
   their fear drives them into doctrines which are false and wicked.
   Either they deny that the Son has a distinct nature of His own besides
   that of the Father, and make Him whom they call the Son to be God all
   but the name, or they deny the divinity of the Son, giving Him a
   separate existence of His own, and making His sphere of essence fall
   outside that of the Father, so that they are separable from each
   other.  To such persons we have to say that God on the one hand is Very
   God (Autotheos, God of Himself); and so the Saviour says in His prayer
   to the Father, [4665] "That they may know Thee the only true God;" but
   that all beyond the Very God is made God by participation in His
   divinity, and is not to be called simply God (with the article), but
   rather God (without article).  And thus the first-born of all creation,
   who is the first to be with God, and to attract to Himself divinity, is
   a being of more exalted rank than the other gods beside Him, of whom
   God is the God, as it is written, [4666] "The God of gods, the Lord,
   hath spoken and called the earth."  It was by the offices of the
   first-born that they became gods, for He drew from God in generous
   measure that they should be made gods, and He communicated it to them
   according to His own bounty.  The true God, then, is "The God," and
   those who are formed after Him are gods, images, as it were, of Him the
   prototype.  But the archetypal image, again, of all these images is the
   Word of God, who was in the beginning, and who by being with God is at
   all times God, not possessing that of Himself, but by His being with
   the Father, and not continuing to be God, if we should think of this,
   except by remaining always in uninterrupted contemplation of the depths
   of the Father.

   3.  Various Relations of the Logos to Men.

   Now it is possible that some may dislike what we have said representing
   the Father as the one true God, but admitting other beings besides the
   true God, who have become gods by having a share of God.  They may fear
   that the glory of Him who surpasses all creation may be lowered to the
   level of those other beings called gods.  We drew this distinction
   between Him and them that we showed God the Word to be to all the other
   gods the minister of their divinity.  To this we must add, in order to
   obviate objections, that the reason which is in every reasonable
   creature occupied the same relation to the reason who was in the
   beginning with God, and is God the Word, as God the Word occupies to
   God.  As the Father who is Very God and the True God is to His image
   and to the images of His image--men are said to be according to the
   image, not to be images of God--so He, the Word, is to the reason
   (word) in every man.  Each fills the place of a fountain--the Father is
   the fountain of divinity, the Son of reason.  As, then, there are many
   gods, but to us there is but one God the Father, and many Lords, but to
   us there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, so there are many Logoi, but we,
   for our part, pray that that one Logos may be with us who was in the
   beginning and was with God, God the Logos.  For whoever does not
   receive this Logos who was in the beginning with God, or attach himself
   to Him as He appeared in flesh, or take part in some of those who had
   part in this Logos, or whoever having had part in Him falls away from
   Him again, he will have his portion in what is called most opposite to
   reason.  What we have drawn out from the truths with which we started
   will now be clear enough.  First, we spoke about God and the Word of
   God, and of Gods, either, that is, beings who partake in deity or
   beings who are called Gods and are not.  And again of the Logos of God
   and of the Logos of God made flesh, and of logoi, or beings which
   partake in some way of the Logos, of second logoi or of third, thought
   to be logoi, in addition to that Logos that was before them all, but
   not really so.  Irrational Reasons these may be styled; beings are
   spoken of who are said to be Gods but are not, and one might place
   beside these Gods who are no Gods, Reasons which are no Reasons.  Now
   the God of the universe is the God of the elect, and in a much greater
   degree of the Saviours of the elect; then He is the God of these beings
   who are truly Gods, and then He is the God, in a word, of the living
   and not of the dead.  But God the Logos is the God, perhaps, of those
   who attribute everything to Him and who consider Him to be their
   Father.  Now the sun and the moon and the stars were connected,
   according to the accounts of men of old times, with beings who were not
   worthy to have the God of gods counted their God.  To this opinion they
   were led by a passage in Deuteronomy which is somewhat on this wise:
   [4667]   "Lest when thou liftest up thine eyes to heaven, and seest the
   sun and the moon and the whole host of heaven, thou wander away and
   worship them and serve them which the Lord thy God hath appointed to
   all the peoples.  But to you the Lord thy God hath not so given them."
   But how did God appoint the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven
   to all the nations, if He did not give them in the same way to Israel
   also, to the end that those who could not rise to the realm of
   intellect, might be inclined by gods of sense to consider about the
   Godhead, and might of their own free will connect themselves with these
   and so be kept from falling away to idols and demons?  Is it not the
   case that some have for their God the God of the universe, while a
   second class, after these, attach themselves to the Son of God, His
   Christ, and a third class worship the sun and the moon and all the host
   of heaven, wandering, it is true, from God, but with a far different
   and a better wandering than that of those who invoke as gods the works
   of men's hands, silver and gold,--works of human skill.  Last of all
   are those who devote themselves to the beings which are called gods but
   are no gods.  In the same way, now, some have faith in that Reason
   which was in the beginning and was with God and was God; so did Hosea
   and Isaiah and Jeremiah and others who declared that the Word of the
   Lord, or the Logos, had come to them.  A second class are those who
   know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified, considering that the
   Word made flesh is the whole Word, and knowing only Christ after the
   flesh.  Such is the great multitude of those who are counted
   believers.  A third class give themselves to logoi (discourses) having
   some part in the Logos which they consider superior to all other
   reason: these are they who follow the honourable and distinguished
   philosophical schools among the Greeks.  A fourth class besides these
   are they who put their trust in corrupt and godless discourses, doing
   away with Providence, which is so manifest and almost visible, and who
   recognize another end for man to follow than the good.  It may appear
   to some that we have wandered from our theme, but to my thinking the
   view we have reached of four things connected with the name of God and
   four things connected with the Logos comes in very well at this point.
   There was God with the article and God without the article, then there
   were gods in two orders, at the summit of the higher order of whom is
   God the Word, transcended Himself by the God of the universe.  And,
   again, there was the Logos with the article and the Logos without the
   article, corresponding to God absolutely and a god; and the Logoi in
   two ranks.  And some men are connected with the Father, being part of
   Him, and next to these, those whom our argument now brings into clearer
   light, those who have come to the Saviour and take their stand entirely
   in Him.  And third are those of whom we spoke before, who reckon the
   sun and the moon and the stars to be gods, and take their stand by
   them.  And in the fourth and last place those who submit to soulless
   and dead idols.  To all this we find analogies in what concerns the
   Logos.  Some are adorned with the Word Himself; some with what is next
   to Him and appears to be the very original Logos Himself, those,
   namely, who know nothing but Jesus Christ and Him crucified, and who
   behold the Word as flesh.  And the third class, as we described them a
   little before.  Why should I speak of those who are thought to be in
   the Logos, but have fallen away, not only from the good itself, but
   from the very traces of it and from those who have a part in it?

   4.  That the Logos is One, Not Many.  Of the Word, Faithful and True,
   and of His White Horse.

   "He was in the beginning with God."  By his three foregoing
   propositions the Evangelist has made us acquainted with three orders,
   and he now sums up the three in one, saying, "This (Logos) was in the
   beginning with God."  In the first premiss we learned where the Logos
   was:  He was in the beginning; then we learned with whom He was, with
   God; and then who He was, that He was God.  He now points out by this
   word "He," the Word who is God, and gathers up into a fourth
   proposition the three which went before, "In the beginning was the
   Word," "The Word was with God," and "The Word was God."  Now he says,
   He, this (Word) was in the beginning with God.  The term beginning may
   be taken of the beginning of the world, so that we may learn from what
   is said that the Word was older than the things which were made from
   the beginning.  For if "in the beginning God created heaven and earth,"
   but "He" was in the beginning, then the Logos is manifestly older than
   those things which were made at the beginning, older not only than the
   firmament and the dry land, but than the heavens and earth.  Now some
   one might ask, and not unreasonably, why it is not said, "In the
   beginning was the Word of God, and the Word of God was with God, and
   the Word of God was God."  But he who asked such a question could be
   shown to be taking for granted that there are a plurality of logoi,
   differing perhaps from each other in kind, one being the word of God,
   another perhaps the word of angels, a third of men, and so on with the
   other logoi.  Now, if this were so with the Logos, the case would be
   the same with wisdom and with righteousness.  But it would be absurd
   that there should be a number of things equally to be called "The
   Word;" and the same would apply to wisdom and to righteousness.  We
   shall be driven to confess that we ought not to look for a plurality of
   logoi, or of wisdom, or of righteousness, if we look at the case of
   truth.  Any one will confess that there is only one truth; it could
   never be said in this case that there is one truth of God, and another
   of the angels, and another of man,--it lies in the nature of things
   that the truth about anything is one.  Now, if truth be one, it is
   clear that the preparation of it and its demonstration, which is
   wisdom, must in reason be conceived as one, since what is regarded as
   wisdom cannot justly claim that title where truth, which is one, is
   absent from its grasp.  But if truth is one and wisdom one, then Reason
   (Logos) also, which announces truth and makes truth simple and manifest
   to those who are fitted to receive it, will be one.  This we say, by no
   means denying that truth and wisdom and reason are of God, but we wish
   to indicate the purpose of the omission in this passage of the words
   "of God," and of the form of the statement, "In the beginning the Logos
   was with God."  The same John in the Apocalypse gives Him His name with
   the addition "of God," where he says: [4668]   "And I saw heaven
   opened, and behold a white horse, and He that sat thereon called
   Faithful and True; and in righteousness doth He judge and make war.
   And His eyes are as a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems,
   and He hath a name written which no one knoweth but He Himself.  And He
   is arrayed in a garment sprinkled with blood, and His name is called
   [4669] Word of God.  And His armies in heaven followed Him on white
   horses, clothed in pure fine linen.  And out of His mouth proceedeth a
   sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations, and He shall
   rule them with a rod of iron, and He treadeth the winepress of the
   fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God.  And He hath on His garment
   and on His thigh a name written:  King of kings, and Lord of lords."
   In this passage Logos is necessarily spoken of absolutely without the
   article, and also with the addition Logos of God; had the first not
   been the case (i.e., had the article been given) we might have been led
   to take up the meaning wrongly, [4670] and so to depart from the truth
   about the Logos.  For if it had been called simply Logos, and had not
   been said to be the Logos of God, then we would not be clearly informed
   that the Logos is the Logos of God.  And, again, had it been called
   Logos of God but not said to be Logos absolutely, then we might imagine
   many logoi, according to the constitution of each of the rational
   beings which exist; then we might assume a number of logoi properly so
   called.  Again, in his description in the Apocalypse of the Logos of
   God, the Apostle and Evangelist (and the Apocalypse entitles him to be
   styled a prophet, too) says he saw the Word of God in the opened
   heaven, and that He was riding on a white horse.  Now we must consider
   what he means to convey when he speaks of heaven being opened and of
   the white horse, and of the Word of God riding on the white horse, and
   also what is meant by saying that the Word of God is Faithful and True,
   and that in righteousness He judges and makes war.  All this will
   greatly advance our study on the subject of the Word of God.  Now I
   conceive heaven to have been shut against the ungodly, and those who
   bear the image of the earthly, and to have been opened to the righteous
   and those adorned with the image of the heavenly.  For to the former,
   being below and still dwelling in the flesh, the better things are
   closed, since they cannot understand them and have neither power nor
   will to see their beauty, looking down as they do and not striving to
   look up.  But to the excellent, or those who have their commonwealth in
   heaven, [4671] he opens, with the key of David, the things in heavenly
   places and discloses them to their view, and makes all clear to them by
   riding on his horse.  These words also have their meaning; the horse is
   white because it is the nature of higher knowledge (gnosis) to be clear
   and white and full of light.  And on the white horse sits He who is
   called Faithful, seated more firmly, and so to speak more royally, on
   words which cannot be set aside, words which run sharply and more
   swiftly than any horse, and overhear in their rushing course every
   so-called word that simulates the Word, and every so-called truth that
   simulates the Truth.  He who sits on the white horse is called
   Faithful, not because of the faith He cherishes, but of that which He
   inspires, because He is worthy of faith.  Now the Lord Jehovah,
   according to Moses, [4672] is Faithful and True.  He is true also in
   respect of His relation to shadow, type, and image; for such is the
   Word who is in the opened heaven, for He is not on earth as He is in
   heaven; on earth He is made flesh and speaks through shadow, type, and
   image.  The multitude, therefore, of those who are reputed to believe
   are disciples of the shadow of the Word, not of the true Word of God
   which is in the opened heaven.  Hence Jeremiah says, [4673] "The Spirit
   of our face is Christ the Lord, of whom we said, In His shadow shall we
   live among the nations."  Thus the Word of God who is called Faithful
   is also called True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war;
   since He has received from God the faculty of judging in very
   righteousness and very judgment, and of apportioning its due to every
   existing creature.  For none of those who have some portion of
   righteousness and of the faculty of judgment can receive on his soul
   such copies and impressions of righteousness and judgment as to come
   short in no point of absolute righteousness and absolute justice, just
   as no painter of a picture can communicate to the representation all
   the qualities of the original.  This, I conceive, is the reason why
   David says, [4674] "Before Thee shall no living being be justified."
   He does not say, no man, or no angel, but no living being, since even
   if any being partakes of life and has altogether put off mortality, not
   even then can it be justified in comparison of Thee, who art, as it
   were, Life itself.  Nor is it possible that one who partakes of life
   and is therefore called living, should become life itself, or that one
   who partakes of righteousness and, therefore, is called righteous
   should become equal to righteousness itself.  Now it is the function of
   the Word of God, not only to judge in righteousness, but also to make
   war in righteousness, that by making war on His enemies by reason and
   righteousness, so that what is irrational and wicked is destroyed,
   [4675] He may dwell in the soul of him who, for his salvation, so to
   speak, has become captive to Christ, and may justify that soul and cast
   out from her all adversaries.  We shall, however, obtain a better view
   of this war which the Word carries on if we remember that He is an
   ambassador for the truth, while there is another who pretends to be the
   Word and is not, and one who calls herself the truth and is not, but a
   lie.  Then the Word, arming Himself against the lie, slays it with the
   breath of His mouth and brings it to naught by the manifestation of His
   coming. [4676]   And consider whether these words of the Apostle to the
   Thessalonians may be understood in an intellectual sense.  For what is
   that which is destroyed by the breath of the mouth of Christ, Christ
   being the Word and Truth and Wisdom, but the lie?  And what is that
   which is brought to naught by the manifestation of Christ's coming,
   Christ being conceived as wisdom and reason, what but that which
   announces itself as wisdom, when in reality it is one of those things
   with which God deals as the Apostle describes, [4677] "He taketh the
   wise, those who are not wise with the true wisdom, in their own
   craftiness"?  To what he says of the rider on the white horse, John
   adds the wonderful statement:  "His eyes are like a flame of fire."
   For as the flame of fire is bright and illuminating, but at the same
   time fiery and destructive of material things, so, if I may so say, are
   the eyes of the Logos with which He sees, and every one who has part in
   Him; they have not only the inherent quality of laying hold of the
   things of the mind, but also that of consuming and putting away those
   conceptions which are more material and gross, since whatever is in any
   way false flees from the directness and lightness of truth.  It is in a
   very natural order that after speaking of Him who judges in
   righteousness and makes war in accordance with His righteous judgments,
   and then after His warring of His giving light, the writer goes on to
   say, "On His head are many diadems."  For had the lie been one, and of
   one form only, against which the True and Faithful Word contended, and
   for conquering which, He was crowned, then one crown alone would
   naturally have been given Him for the victory.  As it is, however, as
   the lies are many which profess the truth and for warring against which
   the Word is crowned, the diadems are many which surround the head of
   the conqueror of them all.  As He has overcome every revolting power
   many diadems mark His victory.  Then after the diadems He is said to
   have a name written which no one knows but He Himself.  For there are
   some things which are known to the Word alone; for the beings which
   come into existence after Him have a poorer nature than His, and none
   of them is able to behold all that He apprehends.  And perhaps it is
   the case that only those who have part in that Word know the things
   which are kept from the knowledge of those who do not partake of Him.
   Now, in John's vision, the Word of God as He rides on the white horse
   is not naked:  He is clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood, for
   the Word who was made flesh and therefore died is surrounded with marks
   of the fact that His blood was poured out upon the earth, when the
   soldier pierced His side.  For of that passion, even should it be our
   lot some day to come to that highest and supreme contemplation of the
   Logos, we shall not lose all memory, nor shall we forget the truth that
   our admission was brought about by His sojourning in our body.  This
   Word of God is followed by the heavenly armies one and all; they follow
   the Word as their leader, and imitate Him in all things, and chiefly in
   having mounted, they also, white horses.  To him that understands, this
   secret is open.  And as sorrow and grief and wailing fled away at the
   end of things, so also, I suppose, did obscurity and doubt, all the
   mysteries of God's wisdom being precisely and clearly opened.  Look
   also at the white horses of the followers of the Word and at the white
   and pure linen with which they were clothed.  As linen comes out of the
   earth, may not those linen garments stand for the dialects on the earth
   in which those voices are clothed which make clear announcements of
   things?  We have dealt at some length with the statements found in the
   Apocalypse about the Word of God; it is important for us to know
   clearly about Him.

   5.  He (This One) Was in the Beginning with God.

   To those who fail to distinguish with care the different propositions
   of the context the Evangelist may appear to be repeating himself.  "He
   was in the beginning with God" may seem to add nothing to "And the Word
   was with God."  We must observe more carefully.  In the statement "The
   Word was with God" we are not told anything of the when or the where;
   that is added in the fourth axiom.  There are four axioms, or, as some
   call them, propositions, the fourth being "He was in the beginning with
   God."  Now "The Word was with God" is not the same thing as "He was,"
   etc.; for here we are told, not only that He was with God, but when and
   where He was so:  "He was in the beginning with God."  The "He," too,
   used as it is for a demonstration, will be considered to refer to the
   Word, or by a less careful enquirer, to God.  What was noted before is
   now summed up in this designation "He," the notion of the Logos and
   that of God; and as the argument proceeds the different notions are
   collected in one; for the notion God is not included in the notion
   Logos, nor the notion Logos in that of God.  And perhaps the
   proposition before us is a summing up in one of the three which have
   preceded.  Taking the statement that the Word was in the beginning, we
   have not yet learned that He was with God, and taking the statement
   that the Word was with God it is not yet clear to us that He was with
   God in the beginning; and taking the statement that the Word was God,
   it has neither been shown that He was in the beginning, nor that He was
   with God.

   Now when the Evangelist says, "He was in the beginning with God," if we
   apply the pronoun "He" to the Word and to God (as He is God) and
   consider that "in the beginning" is conjoined with it, and "with God"
   added to it, then there is nothing left of the three propositions that
   is not summed up and brought together in this one.  And as "in the
   beginning" has been said twice, we may consider if there are not two
   lessons we may learn.  First, that the Word was in the beginning, as if
   He was by Himself and not with any one, and secondly, that He was in
   the beginning with God.  And I consider that there is nothing untrue in
   saying of Him both that He was in the beginning, and in the beginning
   with God, for neither was He with God alone, since He was also in the
   beginning, nor was He in the beginning alone and not with God, since
   "He was in the beginning with God."

   6.  How the Word is the Maker of All Things, and Even the Holy Spirit
   Was Made Through Him.

   "All things were made through Him."  The "through [4678] whom" is never
   found in the first place but always in the second, as in the Epistle to
   the Romans, [4679] "Paul a servant of Christ Jesus, a called Apostle,
   separated to the Gospel of God which He promised before by His prophets
   in Holy Scriptures, concerning His Son, who was born of the seed of
   David according to the flesh, determined the Son of God in power
   according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection of the dead,
   Jesus Christ our Lord, through whom we received grace and apostleship,
   for obedience of the faith among all the nations, for His name's
   sake."  For God promised aforehand by the prophets His own Gospel, the
   prophets being His ministers, and having their word to speak about Him
   "through whom."  And again God gave grace and apostleship to Paul and
   to the others for the obedience of the faith among all the nations, and
   this He gave them through Jesus Christ the Saviour, for the "through
   whom" belonged to Him.  And the Apostle Paul says in the Epistle to the
   Hebrews: [4680]   "At the end of the days He spoke to us in His Son,
   whom He made the heir of all things, through whom' also He made the
   ages," showing us that God made the ages through His Son, the "through
   whom" belonging, when the ages were being made, to the Only-begotten.
   Thus, if all things were made, as in this passage also, through the
   Logos, then they were not made by the Logos, but by a stronger and
   greater than He.  And who else could this be but the Father?  Now if,
   as we have seen, all things were made through Him, we have to enquire
   if the Holy Spirit also was made through Him.  It appears to me that
   those who hold the Holy Spirit to be created, and who also admit that
   "all things were made through Him," must necessarily assume that the
   Holy Spirit was made through the Logos, the Logos accordingly being
   older than He.  And he who shrinks from allowing the Holy Spirit to
   have been made through Christ must, if he admits the truth of the
   statements of this Gospel, assume the Spirit to be uncreated.  There is
   a third resource besides these two (that of allowing the Spirit to have
   been made by the Word, and that of regarding it as uncreated), namely,
   to assert that the Holy Spirit has no essence of His own beyond the
   Father and the Son.  But on further thought one may perhaps see reason
   to consider that the Son is second beside the Father, He being the same
   as the Father, while manifestly a distinction is drawn between the
   Spirit and the Son in the passage, [4681] "Whosoever shall speak a word
   against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever shall
   blaspheme against the Holy Spirit, he shall not have forgiveness,
   either in this world or in the world to come."  We consider, therefore,
   that there are three hypostases, the Father and the Son and the Holy
   Spirit; and at the same time we believe nothing to be uncreated but the
   Father.  We therefore, as the more pious and the truer course, admit
   that all things were made by the Logos, and that the Holy Spirit is the
   most excellent and the first in order [4682] of all that was made by
   the Father through Christ.  And this, perhaps, is the reason why the
   Spirit is not said to be God's own Son.  The Only-begotten only is by
   nature and from the beginning a Son, and the Holy Spirit seems to have
   need of the Son, to minister to Him His essence, so as to enable Him
   not only to exist, but to be wise and reasonable and just, and all that
   we must think of Him as being.  All this He has by participation of the
   character of Christ, of which we have spoken above.  And I consider
   that the Holy Spirit supplies to those who, through Him and through
   participation in Him, are called saints, the material of the gifts,
   which come from God; so that the said material of the gifts is made
   powerful by God, is ministered by Christ, and owes its actual existence
   in men to the Holy Spirit.  I am led to this view of the charisms by
   the words of Paul which he writes somewhere, [4683] "There are
   diversities of gifts but the same Spirit, and diversities of
   ministrations, and the same Lord.  And there are diversities of
   workings, but it is the same God that worketh all in all."  The
   statement that all things were made by Him, and its seeming corollary,
   that the Spirit must have been called into being by the Word, may
   certainly raise some difficulty.  There are some passages in which the
   Spirit is placed above Christ; in Isaiah, for example, Christ declares
   that He is sent, not by the Father only, but also by the Holy Spirit.
   "Now the Lord hath sent Me," He says, [4684] "and His Spirit," and in
   the Gospel He declares that there is forgiveness for the sin committed
   against Himself, but that for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit there
   is no forgiveness, either in this age or in the age to come.  What is
   the reason of this?  Is it because the Holy Spirit is of more value
   than Christ that the sin against Him cannot be forgiven?  May it not
   rather be that all rational beings have part in Christ, and that
   forgiveness is extended to them when they repent of their sins, while
   only those have part in the Holy Spirit who have been found worthy of
   it, and that there cannot well be any forgiveness for those who fall
   away to evil in spite of such great and powerful cooperation, and who
   defeat the counsels of the Spirit who is in them.  When we find the
   Lord saying, as He does in Isaiah, that He is sent by the Father and by
   His Spirit, we have to point out here also that the Spirit is not
   originally superior to the Saviour, but that the Saviour takes a lower
   place than He in order to carry out the plan which has been made that
   the Son of God should become man.  Should any one stumble at our saying
   that the Saviour in becoming man was made lower than the Holy Spirit,
   we ask him to consider the words used in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
   [4685] where Jesus is shown by Paul to have been made less than the
   angels on account of the suffering of death.  "We behold Him," he says,
   "who hath been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of
   the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour."  And this, too,
   has doubtless to be added, that the creation, in order to be delivered
   from the bondage of corruption, and not least of all the human race,
   required the introduction into human nature of a happy and divine
   power, which should set right what was wrong upon the earth, and that
   this action fell to the share, as it were, of the Holy Spirit; but the
   Spirit, unable to support such a task, puts forward the Saviour as the
   only one able to endure such a conflict.  The Father therefore, the
   principal, sends the Son, but the Holy Spirit also sends Him and
   directs Him to go before, promising to descend, when the time comes, to
   the Son of God, and to work with Him for the salvation of men.  This He
   did, when, in a bodily shape like a dove, He flew to Him after the
   baptism.  He remained on Him, and did not pass Him by, as He might have
   done with men not able continuously to bear His glory.  Thus John, when
   explaining how he knew who Christ was, spoke not only of the descent of
   the Spirit on Jesus, but also of its remaining upon him.  For it is
   written that John said: [4686]   "He who sent me to baptize said, On
   whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him,
   the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire."  It
   is not said only, "On whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending,"
   for the Spirit no doubt descended on others too, but "descending and
   abiding on Him."  Our examination of this point has been somewhat
   extended, since we were anxious to make it clear that if all things
   were made by Him, then the Spirit also was made through the Word, and
   is seen to be one of the "all things" which are inferior to their
   Maker.  This view is too firmly settled to be disturbed by a few words
   which may be adduced to the opposite effect.  If any one should lend
   credence to the Gospel according to the Hebrews, where the Saviour
   Himself says, "My mother, the Holy Spirit took me just now by one of my
   hairs and carried me off to the great mount Tabor," he will have to
   face the difficulty of explaining how the Holy Spirit can be the mother
   of Christ when it was itself brought into existence through the Word.
   But neither the passage nor this difficulty is hard to explain.  For if
   he who does the will of the Father in heaven [4687] is Christ's brother
   and sister and mother, and if the name of brother of Christ may be
   applied, not only to the race of men, but to beings of diviner rank
   than they, then there is nothing absurd in the Holy Spirit's being His
   mother, every one being His mother who does the will of the Father in
   heaven.

   On the words, "All things were made by Him," there is still one point
   to be examined.  The "word" is, as a notion, from "life," and yet we
   read, "What was made in the Word was life, and the life was the light
   of men."  Now as all things were made through Him, was the life made
   through Him, which is the light of men, and the other notions under
   which the Saviour is presented to us?  Or must we take the "all things
   were made by Him" subject to the exception of the things which are in
   Himself?  The latter course appears to be the preferable one.  For
   supposing we should concede that the life which is the light of men was
   made through Him, since it said that the life "was made" the light of
   men, what are we to say about wisdom, which is conceived as being prior
   to the Word?  That, therefore, which is about the Word (His relations
   or conditions) was not made by the Word, and the result is that, with
   the exception of the notions under which Christ is presented, all
   things were made through the Word of God, the Father making them in
   wisdom.  "In wisdom hast Thou made them all," it says, [4688] not
   through, but in wisdom.

   7.  Of Things Not Made Through the Logos.

   Let us see, however, why the words are added, "And without Him was not
   anything (Gr. even one thing) made."  Some might think it superfluous
   to add to the words "All things were made through Him," the phrase
   "Without Him was not anything made."  For if everything whatsoever was
   made through the Logos, then nothing was made without Him.  Yet it does
   not follow from the proposition that without the Logos nothing was
   made, that all things were made through the Logos.  It is possible that
   though nothing was made without the Logos, all things were made, not
   through the Logos only, but some things by Him.  We must, therefore,
   make ourselves sure in what sense the "all things" is to be understood,
   and in what sense the "nothing."  For, without a clear preliminary
   definition of these terms, it might be maintained that, if all things
   were made through the Logos, and evil is a part of all things, then the
   whole matter of sin, and everything that is wicked, that these also
   were made through the Logos.  But this we must regard as false.  There
   is nothing absurd in thinking that creatures were made through the
   Logos, and also that men's brave deeds have been done through Him, and
   all the useful acts of those who are now in bliss; but with the sins
   and misfortunes of men it is otherwise.  Now some have held that since
   evil is not based in the constitution of things--for it did not exist
   at the beginning and at the end it will have ceased--that, therefore,
   the evils of which we spoke are the Nothing; and as some of the Greeks
   say that genera and forms, such as the (general) animal and the man,
   belong to the category of Nothings, so it has been supposed that all
   that is not of God is Nothing, and has not even obtained through the
   Word the subsistence it appears to have.  We ask whether it is possible
   to show from Scripture in any convincing way that this is so.  As for
   the meanings of the word "Nothing" and "Not-being," they would appear
   to be synonymous, for Nothing can be spoken of as Not-being, and the
   Not-being can be described as Nothing.  The Apostle, however, appears
   to count the things which are not, not among those which have no
   existence whatever, but rather among things which are evil.  To him the
   Not-being is evil; "God," he says, [4689] "called the things that are
   not as things that are."  And Mardochæus, too, in the Esther of the
   Septuagint, calls the enemies of Israel "those that are not," saying,
   [4690] "Deliver not Thy sceptre, O Lord, to those that are not."  We
   may also notice how evil men, on account of their wickedness, are said
   not to be, from the name ascribed to God in Exodus: [4691]   "For the
   Lord said to Moses, I am, that is My name."  The good God says this
   with respect of us also who pray that we may be part of His
   congregation.  The Saviour praises him, saying, [4692] "None is good
   but one, God the Father."  The good, then, is the same as He who is.
   Over against good is evil or wickedness, and over against Him who is
   that which is not, whence it follows that evil and wickedness are that
   which is not.  This, perhaps, is what has led some to affirm that the
   devil is not created by God.  In respect that he is the devil he is not
   the work of God, but he who is the devil is a created being, and as
   there is no other creator but our God, he is a work of God.  It is as
   if we should say that a murderer is not a work of God, while we may say
   that in respect he is a man, God made him.  His being as a man he
   received from God; we do not assert that he received from God his being
   as a murderer.  All, then, who have part in Him who is, and the saints
   have part in Him, may properly be called Beings; but those who have
   given up their part in the Being, by depriving themselves of Being,
   have become Not-beings.  But we said when entering on this discussion,
   that Not-being and Nothing are synonymous, and hence those who are not
   beings are Nothing, and all evil is nothing, since it is Not-being, and
   thus since they are called Not-being came into existence without the
   Logos, not being numbered among the all things which were made through
   Him.  Thus we have shown, so far as our powers admit, what are the "all
   things" which were made through the Logos, and what came into existence
   without Him, since at no time is it Being, and it is, therefore, called
   "Nothing."

   8.  Heracleon's View that the Logos is Not the Agent of Creation.

   It was, I consider, a violent and unwarranted procedure which was
   adopted by Heracleon, [4693] the friend, as it is said, of Valentinus,
   in discussing this sentence:  "All things were made through Him."  He
   excepted the whole world and all that it contains, excluding, as far as
   his hypothesis goes, from the "all things" what is best in the world
   and its contents.  For he says that the æon (age), and the things in
   it, were not made by the Logos; he considers them to have come into
   existence before the Logos.  He deals with the statement, "Without Him
   was nothing made," with some degree of audacity, nor is he afraid of
   the warning: [4694]   "Add not to His words, lest He find thee out and
   thou prove a liar," for to the "Nothing" he adds:  "Of what is in the
   world and the creation."  And as his statements on the passage are
   obviously very much forced and in the face of the evidence, for what he
   considers divine is excluded from the all, and what he regards as
   purely evil is, that and nothing else, the all things, we need not
   waste our time in rebutting what is, on the face of it, absurd, when,
   without any warrant from Scripture, he adds to the words, "Without Him
   was nothing made," the further words, "Of what is in the earth and the
   creation."  In this proposal, which has no inner probability to
   recommend it, he is asking us, in fact, to trust him as we do the
   prophets, or the Apostles, who had authority and were not responsible
   to men for the writings belonging to man's salvation, which they handed
   to those about them and to those who should come after.  He had, also,
   a private interpretation of his own of the words:  "All things were
   made through Him," when he said that it was the Logos who caused the
   demiurge to make the world, not, however, the Logos from whom or by
   whom, but Him through whom, taking the written words in a different
   sense from that of common parlance. [4695]   For, if the truth of the
   matter was as he considers, then the writer ought to have said that all
   things were made through the demiurge by the Word, and not through the
   Word by the demiurge.  We accept the "through whom," as it is usually
   understood, and have brought evidence in support of our interpretation,
   while he not only puts forward a new rendering of his own, unsupported
   by the divine Scripture, but appears even to scorn the truth and
   shamelessly and openly oppose it.  For he says:  "It was not the Logos
   who made all things, as under another who was the operating agent,"
   taking the "through whom" in this sense, "but another made them, the
   Logos Himself being the operating agent."  This is not a suitable
   occasion for the proof that it was not the demiurge who became the
   servant of the Logos and made the world; but that the Logos became the
   servant of the demiurge and formed the world.  For, according to the
   prophet David, [4696] "God spake and they came into being, He commanded
   and they were created."  For the unbegotten God commanded the
   first-born of all creation, [4697] and they were created, not only the
   world and what is therein, but also all other things, whether thrones
   or dominions or principalities or powers, for all things were made
   through Him and unto Him, and He is before all things."

   9.  That the Logos Present in Us is Not Responsible for Our Sins.

   One point more on the words:  "Without Him was not anything made."  The
   question about evil must receive adequate discussion; what was said of
   it has not, it is true, a very likely appearance, and yet it appears to
   me that it ought not to be simply overlooked.  The question is whether
   evil, also, was made through the Logos, taking the Logos, now be it
   well noted, in the sense of that reason which is in every one, as thus
   brought into being by the reason which was from the beginning.  The
   Apostle says: [4698]   "Without the law sin was dead," and adds, "But
   when the commandment came sin revived," and so teaches generally about
   sin that it has no power before the law and the commandment (but the
   Logos is, in a sense, law and commandment), and there would be no sin
   were there no law, for, [4699] "sin is not imputed where there is no
   law."  And, again, there would be no sin but for the Logos, for "if I
   had not come and spoken unto them," Christ says, [4700] "they had not
   had sin."  For every excuse is taken away from one who wants to make
   excuse for his sin, if, though the Word is in him and shows him what he
   ought to do, he does not obey it.  It seems, then, that all things, the
   worse things not excepted, were made by the Logos, and without Him,
   taking the nothing here in its simpler sense, was nothing made.  Nor
   must we blame the Logos if all things were made by Him, and without Him
   nothing was made, any more than we blame the master who has showed the
   pupil his duty, when the instruction has been such as to leave the
   pupil, should he sin, no excuse or room to say that he erred through
   ignorance.  This appears the more plainly when we consider that master
   and pupil are inseparable.  For as master and pupil are correlatives,
   and belong together, so the Logos is present in the nature of
   reasonable beings as such, always suggesting what they ought to do,
   even should we pay no heed to his commands, but devote ourselves to
   pleasure and allow his best counsels to pass by us unregarded.  As the
   eye is a servant given us for the best purposes, and yet we use it to
   see things on which it is wrong for us to look, and as we make a wrong
   use of our hearing when we spend our time in listening to singing
   competitions and to other forbidden sounds, so we outrage the Logos who
   is in us, and use Him otherwise than as we ought, when we make Him
   assist in our transgressions.  For He is present with those who sin,
   for their condemnation, and He condemns the man who does not prefer Him
   to everything else.  Hence we find it written: [4701]   "The word which
   I have spoken unto you, the same shall judge you."  That is as if He
   should say:  "I, the Word, who am always lifting up my voice in you, I,
   myself, will judge you, and no refuge or excuse will then be left
   you."  This interpretation, however, may appear somewhat strained, as
   we have taken the Word in one sense to be the Word in the beginning,
   who was with God, God the Word, and have now taken it in another sense,
   speaking of it, not only in reference to the principal works of
   creation, as in the words, "All things were made through Him," but as
   related to all the acts of reasonable beings, this last being the Logos
   (reason), without whose presence none of our sins are committed.  The
   question arises whether the Logos in us is to be pronounced the same
   being as that which was in the beginning and was with God, God the
   Word.  The Apostle, certainly, does not appear to make the Logos in us
   a different being from the Logos who was in the beginning with God.
   "Say not in thine heart," he says, [4702] "who shall go up into heaven;
   that is to bring Christ down, or who shall go down into the abyss; that
   is to bring Christ up from the dead.  But what saith the Scripture?
   The Logos is very nigh thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart."

   10.  "That Which Was Made Was Life in Him, and the Life Was the Light
   of Men."  This Involves the Paradox that What Does Not Derive Life from
   the Logos Does Not Live at All.

   The Greeks have certain apothegms, called paradoxes, in which the
   wisdom of their sages is presented at its highest, and some proof, or
   what appears to be proof, is given.  Thus it is said that the wise man
   alone, and that every wise man, is a priest, because the wise man alone
   and every wise man possesses knowledge as to the service of God.
   Again, that the wise man alone and that every wise man is free and has
   received from the divine law authority to do what he himself is minded
   to do, and this authority they call lawful power of decision.  Why
   should we say more about these so-called paradoxes?  Much discussion is
   devoted to them, and they call for a comparison of the sense of
   Scripture with the doctrine thus conveyed. so that we may be in a
   position to determine where religious doctrine agrees with them and
   where it differs from them.  This has been suggested to us by our study
   of the words, "That which was made was life in Him;" for it appears
   possible to follow the words of Scripture here and to make out a number
   of things which partake of the character of the paradoxes and are even
   more paradoxical than these sentences of the Greeks.  If we consider
   the Logos in the beginning, who was with God, God the Word, we shall
   perhaps be able to declare that only he who partakes of this being,
   considered in this character, is to be pronounced reasonable
   ("logical"), and thus we should demonstrate that the saint alone is
   reasonable.  Again, if we apprehend that life has come in the Logos,
   he, namely, who said, "I am the life," then we shall say that no one is
   alive who is outside the faith of Christ, that all are dead who are not
   living to God, that their life is life to sin, and therefore, if I may
   so express myself, a life of death.  Consider however, whether the
   divine Scriptures do not in many places teach this; as where the
   Saviour says, [4703] "Or have ye not read that which was spoken at the
   bush, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of
   Jacob.  He is not God of the dead but of the living."  And [4704]
   "Before Thee shall no living being be justified."  But why need we
   speak about God Himself or the Saviour?  For it is disputed to which of
   them the voice belongs which says in the prophets, [4705] "As I live,
   saith the Lord."

   11.  How No One is Righteous or Can Truly Be Said to Live in Comparison
   with God.

   First let us look at the words, "He is not the God of the dead but of
   the living."  That is equivalent to saying that He is not the God of
   sinners but of saints.  For it was a great gift to the Patriarchs that
   God in place of His own name should add their name to His own
   designation as God, as Paul says, [4706] "Therefore God is not ashamed
   to be called their God."  He is the God, therefore, of the fathers and
   of all the saints; it might be hard to find a passage to the effect
   that God is the God of any of the wicked.  If, then, He is the God of
   the saints, and is said to be the God of the living, then the saints
   are the living and the living are saints; neither is there any saint
   outside the living, nor when any one is called living is the further
   implication absent that in addition to his having life he is a holy
   one.  Near akin to this is the lesson to be drawn from the saying,
   [4707] "I shall be well pleasing to the Lord in the land of the
   living."  The good pleasure of the Lord, he appears to say, is in the
   ranks of the saints, or in the place of the saints, and it is there
   that he hopes to be.  No one pleases God well who has not entered the
   rank of the saints, or the place of the saints; and to that place every
   one must come who has assumed beforehand, as it were in this life, the
   shadow and image of true God-pleasing.  The passage which declares that
   before God no living being shall be justified shows that in comparison
   with God and the righteousness that is in Him none, even of the most
   finished saints, will be justified.  We might take a parable from
   another quarter and say that no candle can give light before the sun,
   not that the candle will not give light, only it will not when the sun
   outshines it.  In the same way every "living" will be justified, only
   not before God, when it is compared with those who are below and who
   are in the power of darkness.  To them the light of the saints will
   shine.  Here, perhaps, we have the key to the meaning of that verse:
   [4708]   "Let your light shine before men."  He does not say, Let your
   light shine before God; had he said so he would have given a
   commandment impossible of fulfilment, as if he had bidden those lights
   which have souls to let their light shine before the sun.  It is not
   only, therefore, the ordinary mass of the living who will not be
   justified before God, but even those among the living who are
   distinguished above the rest, or, to put it more truly, the whole
   righteousness of the living will not be justified before God, as
   compared with the righteousness of God, as if I were to call together
   all the lights which shine on the earth by night, and to say that they
   could not give light in comparison with the rays of the sun.  We rise
   from these considerations to a higher level when we take the words
   before our minds, "I live, saith the Lord."  Life, in the full sense of
   the word, especially after what we have been saying on the subject,
   belongs perhaps to God and none but Him.  Is this the reason why the
   Apostle, after speaking of the supreme excellency of the life of God
   and being led to the highest expression about it, says about God
   (showing in this a true understanding of that saying, "I live, saith
   the Lord"); "who only hath immortality." [4709]   No living being
   besides God has life free from change and variation.  Why should we be
   in further doubt?  Even Christ did not share the Father's immortality;
   for He "tasted death for every man."

   12.  Is the Saviour All that He Is, to All?

   We have thus enquired as to the life of God, and the life which is
   Christ, and the living who are in a place by themselves, and have seen
   how the living are not justified before God, and we have noticed the
   cognate statement, "Who alone hath immortality."  We may now take up
   the assumption which may appear to be involved in this, namely, that
   whatever being is gifted with reason does not possess blessedness as a
   part of its essence, or as an inseparable part of its nature.  For if
   blessedness and the highest life were an inseparable characteristic of
   reasonable being, how could it be truly said of God that He only has
   immortality?  We should therefore remark, that the Saviour is some
   things, not to Himself but to others, and some things both to Himself
   and others, and we must enquire if there are some things which He is to
   Himself and to no other.  Clearly it is to others that He is a
   Shepherd, not a shepherd like those among men who make gain out of
   their occupation; unless the benefit conferred on the sheep might be
   regarded, on account of His love to men, as a benefit to Himself also.
   Similarly it is to others that He is the Way and the Door, and, as all
   will admit, the Rod.  To Himself and to others He is Wisdom and perhaps
   also Reason (Logos).  It may be asked whether, as He has in Himself a
   system of speculations, inasmuch as He is wisdom, there are some of
   those speculations which cannot be received by any nature that is
   begotten, but His own, and which He knows for Himself only.  Nor should
   the reverence we owe to the Holy Spirit keep us from seeking to answer
   this question.  For the Holy Spirit Himself receives instruction, as is
   clear from what is said about the Paraclete and the Holy Spirit, [4710]
   "He shall take of mine and shall declare it to you."  Does He, then,
   from these instructions, take in everything that the Son, gazing at the
   Father from the first, Himself knows?  That would require further
   consideration.  And if the Saviour is some things to others, and some
   things it may be to Himself, and to no other, or to one only, or to
   few, then we ask, in so far as He is the life which came in the Logos,
   whether he is life to Himself and to others, or to others, and if to
   others, to what others.  And are life and the light of men the same
   thing, for the text says, "That which was made was life in Him and the
   life was the light of men."  But the light of men is the light only of
   some, not of all, rational creatures; the word "men" which is added
   shows this.  But He is the light of men, and so He is the life of those
   whose light he is also.  And inasmuch as He is life He may be called
   the Saviour, not for Himself but to be life to others, whose light also
   He is.  And this life comes to the Logos and is inseparable from Him,
   once it has come to Him.  But the Logos, who cleanses the soul, must
   have been in the soul first; it is after Him and the cleansing that
   proceeds from Him, when all that is dead or weak in her has been taken
   away, that pure life comes to every one who has made himself a fit
   dwelling for the Logos, considered as God.

   13.  How the Life in the Logos Comes After the Beginning.

   Here, we must carefully observe, we have two things which are one, and
   we have to define the difference between them.  First, what is before
   us in The Word in the beginning, then what is implied in The Life in
   the Word.  The Word was not made in the beginning; there was no time
   when the beginning was devoid of the Word, and hence it is said, "In
   the beginning was the Word."  Of life, on the other hand, we read, not
   that it was as the Word, but that it was made; if at least it be the
   case that the life is the light of men.  For when man was not yet,
   there was no light of men; for the light of men is conceived only in
   relation to men.  And let no one annoy us with the objection that we
   have put this under the category of time, though it be the order of the
   things themselves, that make them first and second and so on, and even
   though there should have been no time when the things placed by the
   Logos third and fourth were not in existence.  As, then, all things
   were made by Him, not all things were by Him, and as without Him was
   nothing made, not, without Him nothing was, so what was made in Him,
   not what was in Him, was life.  And, again, not what was made in the
   beginning was the Word, but what was in the beginning was the Word.
   Some of the copies, it is true, have a reading which is not devoid of
   probability, "What was made is life in Him."  But if life is the same
   thing as the light of men, then no one who is in darkness is living,
   and none of the living is in darkness; but every one who is alive is
   also in light, and every one who is in light is living, so that not he
   only who is living, but every one who is living, is a son of light; and
   he who is a son of light is he whose work shines before men.
     __________________________________________________________________

   14.  How the Natures of Men are Not So Fixed from the First, But that
   They May Pass from Darkness to Light.

   We have been discussing certain things which are opposite, and what has
   been said of them may serve to suggest what has been omitted.  We are
   speaking of life and the light of men, and the opposite to life is
   death; the opposite to the light of men, the darkness of men.  It is
   therefore plain that he who is in the darkness of men is in death, and
   that he who works the works of death is nowhere but in darkness.  But
   he who is mindful of God, if we consider what it is to be mindful of
   Him, is not in death, according to the saying, [4711] "In death there
   is no one who remembers Thee."  Are the darkness of men, and death,
   such as they are by nature?  On this point we have another passage,
   [4712] "We were once darkness, but now light in the Lord," even if we
   be now in the fullest sense saints and spiritual persons.  Thus he who
   was once darkness has become, like Paul, capable of being light in the
   Lord.  Some consider that some natures are spiritual from the first,
   such as those of Paul and the holy Apostles; but I scarcely see how to
   reconcile with such a view, what the above text tells us, that the
   spiritual person was once darkness and afterwards became light.  For if
   the spiritual was once darkness what can the earthy have been?  But if
   it is true that darkness became light, as in the text, how is it
   unreasonable to suppose that all darkness is capable of becoming
   light?  Had not Paul said, "We were once in darkness, but now are we
   light in the Lord," and thus implied of those whom they consider to be
   naturally lost, that they were darkness, or are darkness still, the
   hypothesis about the different natures might have been admissible.  But
   Paul distinctly says that he had once been darkness but was now light
   in the Lord, which implies the possibility that darkness should turn
   into light.  But he who perceives the possibility of a change on each
   side for the better or for the worse, will not find it hard to gain an
   insight into every darkness of men, or into that death which consists
   in the darkness of men.

   15.  Heracleon's View that the Lord Brought Life Only to the
   Spiritual.  Refutation of This.

   Heracleon adopts a somewhat violent course when he arrives at this
   passage, "What was made in Him was life."  Instead of the "In Him" of
   the text he understands "to those men who are spiritual," as if he
   considered the Logos and the spiritual to be identical, though this he
   does not plainly say; and then he proceeds to give, as it were, an
   account of the origin of the matter and says, "He (the Logos) provided
   them with their first form at their birth, carrying further and making
   manifest what had been sown by another, [4713] into form and into
   illumination and into an outline of its own."  He did not observe how
   Paul speaks of the spiritual, [4714] and how he refrains from saying
   that they are men.  "A natural man receiveth not the things of the
   spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; but the spiritual
   judgeth all things."  We maintain that it was not without a meaning
   that he did not add the word men to the word spiritual.  Spiritual is
   something better than man, for man receives his form either in soul, or
   in body, or in both together, not in what is more divine than these,
   namely, in spirit; and it is after he has come to have a prevailing
   share of this that he is called "spiritual."  Moreover, in bringing
   forward such a hypothesis as this, he furnishes not even the pretence
   of a proof, and shows himself unable to reach even a moderate degree of
   plausibility for his argument on the subject.  So much, then, for him.

   16.  The Life May Be the Light of Others Besides.

   Let us suggest another question, namely, whether the life was the light
   of men only, and not of every being as well that is in blessedness.
   For if the life were the same thing as the light of men, and if the
   light of Christ were for men alone, then the life also would be only
   for men.  But such a view is both foolish and impious, since the other
   Scriptures testify against this interpretation and declare that, when
   we are somewhat more advanced, we shall be equal to the angels. [4715]
     The question is to be solved on the principle that when a predicate
   is applied to certain persons, it is not to be at once taken to apply
   to them alone.  Thus, when the light of men is spoken of, it is not the
   light of men only; had that been the meaning, a word would have been
   added to express it; the life, it would have read, was the light of men
   only.  For it is possible for the light of men to be the light of
   others besides men, just as it is possible that certain animals and
   certain plants may form the food of men, and that the same animals and
   plants should be the food of other creatures too.  That is an example
   from common life; it is fitting that another analogy should be adduced
   from the inspired books.  Now the question here before us, is why the
   light of men should not be the light of other creatures also, and we
   have seen that to speak of the light of men by no means excludes the
   possibility that the light may be that of other beings besides man,
   whether inferior to him or like him.  Now a name is given to God; He is
   said to be the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.  He, then, who
   infers from the saying, "The life was the light of men," that the light
   is for no other than for men, ought also to conclude that the God of
   Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob is the God of no one
   else but these three patriarchs.  But He is also the God of Elijah,
   [4716] and, as Judith says, [4717] of her father Simeon, and the God of
   the Hebrews.  By analogy of reasoning, then, if nothing prevents Him
   from being the God of others, nothing prevents the light of men from
   being the light of others besides men.

   17.  The Higher Powers are Men; And Christ is Their Light Also.

   Another, again, appeals to the text, "Let us make man according to our
   image and likeness, [4718] " and maintains that whatever is made
   according to God's image and likeness is man.  To support this,
   numberless instances are adduced to show that in Scripture "man" and
   "angel" are used indifferently, and that the same subject is entitled
   both angel and man.  This is true of the three who were entertained by
   Abraham, and of the two who came to Sodom; in the whole course of
   Scripture, persons are styled sometimes men, sometimes angels.  Those
   who hold this view will say that since persons are styled angels who
   are manifestly men, as when Zechariah says, [4719] "The messenger of
   the Lord, I am with you, saith the Lord Almighty," and as it is written
   of John the Baptist, [4720] "Behold I send My messenger before thy
   face," the angels (messengers) of God are so called on account of their
   office, and are not here called men on account of their nature.  It
   confirms this view that the names applied to the higher powers are not
   those of species of living beings, but those of the orders, assigned by
   God to this and to that reasonable being.  "Throne" is not a species of
   living being, nor "dominion," nor "principality," nor "power"; these
   are names of the businesses to which those clothed with the names have
   been appointed; the subjects themselves are nothing but men, but the
   subject has come to be a throne, or a dominion, or a principality, or a
   power.  In Joshua, the son of Nun, we read [4721] that in Jericho there
   appeared to Joshua a man who said, "I am captain of the Lord's host,
   now am I come."  The outcome of this is that the light of men must be
   held to be the same as the light of every being endowed with reason;
   for every reasonable being is man, since it is according to the image
   and likeness of God.  It is spoken of in three different ways, "the
   light of men," and simply "the light," and "the true light."  It is the
   light of men either, as we showed before, because there is nothing to
   prevent us from regarding it as the light of other beings besides men,
   or because all beings endowed with reason are called men because they
   are made in the image of God.

   18.  How God Also is Light, But in a Different Way; And How Life Came
   Before Light.

   The Saviour is here called simply light.  But in the Catholic Epistle
   of this same John [4722] we read that God is light.  This, it has been
   maintained, furnishes a proof that the Son is not in substance
   different from the Father.  Another student, however, looking into the
   matter more closely and with a sounder judgment, will say that the
   light which shines in darkness and is not overtaken by it, is not the
   same as the light in which there is no darkness at all.  The light
   which shines in darkness comes upon this darkness, as it were, and is
   pursued by it, and, in spite of attempts made upon it, is not
   overtaken.  But the light in which there is no darkness at all neither
   shines on darkness, nor is at first pursued by it, so as to prove
   victor and to have it recorded that it was not overtaken by its
   pursuer.  The third designation was "the true light."  But in
   proportion as God, since He is the Father of truth, is more and greater
   than truth, and since He is the Father of wisdom is greater and more
   excellent than wisdom, in the same proportion He is more than the true
   light.  We may learn, perhaps, in a more suggestive manner, how the
   Father and the Son are two lights, from David, who says in the
   thirty-fifth Psalm, [4723] "In Thy light we shall see light."  This
   same light of men which shines in darkness, the true light, is called,
   further on in the Gospel, the light of the world; Jesus says, [4724] "I
   am the light of the world."  Nor must we omit to notice that whereas
   the passage might very well have run, "That which was made was in Him
   the light of men, and the light of men was life," he chose the opposite
   order.  He puts life before the light of men, even if life and the
   light of men are the same thing; in thinking of those who have part in
   life, though that life is also the light of men, we are to come first
   to the fact that they are living the divine life spoken of before; then
   we come to their enlightenment.  For life must come first if the living
   person is to be enlightened; it would not be a good arrangement to
   speak of the illumination of one not yet conceived as living, and to
   make life come after the illumination.  For though "life" and "the
   light" of men are the same thing, the notions are taken separately.
   This light of men is also called, by Isaiah, "the light of the
   Gentiles," where he says, [4725] "Behold I have set Thee for a covenant
   of the generation, for a light of the Gentiles;" and David, placing his
   confidence in this light, says in the twenty-sixth Psalm, [4726] "The
   Lord is my illumination and my Saviour; whom shall I fear?"

   19.  The Life Here Spoken of is the Higher Life, that of Reason.

   As for those who make up a mythology about the æons and arrange them in
   syzygies (yokes or pairs), and who consider the Logos and Life to have
   been emitted by Intellect and Truth, it may not be beside the point to
   state the following difficulties.  How can life, in their system, the
   yokefellow of the Word, derive his origin from his yokefellow?  For
   "what was made in Him," he says, evidently referring to the Word,
   mentioned immediately before, "was life."  Will they tell us how life,
   the yokefellow, as they say, of the Word, came into being in the Word,
   and how life rather than the Word is the light of men.  It would be
   quite natural if men of reasonable minds, who are perplexed with such
   questions and find the point we have raised hard to dispose of, should
   turn round upon us and invite us to discuss the reason why it is not
   the Word that is said to be the light of men, but life which originated
   in the Word.  To such an enquiry we shall reply that the life here
   spoken of is not that which is common to rational beings and to beings
   without reason, but that life which is added to us upon the completion
   of reason in us, our share in that life, being derived from the first
   reason (Logos).  It is when we turn away from the life which is life in
   appearance only, not in truth, and when we yearn to be filled with the
   true life, that we are made partakers of it, and when it has arisen in
   us it becomes the foundation of the light of the higher knowledge
   (gnosis).  With some it may be that this life is only potentially and
   not actually light, with those who do not strive to search out the
   things of the higher knowledge, while with others it is actually
   light.  With these it clearly is so who act on Paul's injunction, "Seek
   earnestly the best gifts;" and among the greatest gifts is that which
   all are enjoined to seek, namely, the word of wisdom, and it is
   followed by the word of knowledge.  This wisdom and this knowledge lie
   side by side; into the difference between them this is not a fitting
   occasion to enquire.

   20.  Different Kinds of Light; And of Darkness.

   "And [4727] the light shineth in darkness and the darkness hath not
   overtaken it."  We are still enquiring about the light of men, since it
   is what was spoken of in the preceding verse, and also, I consider,
   about darkness, which is named as its adversary, the darkness also
   being, if the definition of it is correct, that of men.  The light of
   men is a generic notion covering two special things; and with the
   darkness of men it is the same.  He who has gained the light of men and
   shares its beams will do the work of light and know in the higher
   sense, being illuminated by the light of the higher knowledge.  And we
   must recognize the analogous case of those on the other side, and of
   their evil actions, and of that which is thought to be but is not
   really knowledge, since those who exercise it have the reason (Logos)
   not of light but of darkness.  And because the sacred word knows the
   things which produce light, Isaiah says: [4728]   "Because Thy
   commandments are a light upon the earth," and David says in the Psalm,
   [4729] "The precept of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes."  But
   since in addition to the commandments and the precepts there is a light
   of higher knowledge, we read in one of the twelve (prophets), [4730]
   "Sow to yourselves for righteousness, reap to yourselves for the fruit
   of life, make light for yourselves the light of knowledge."  There is a
   further light of knowledge in addition to the commandments, and so we
   read, "Make light for yourselves," not simply light, but what
   light?--the light of knowledge.  For if any light that a man kindles
   for himself were a light of knowledge, then the added words, "Make
   light for yourselves, the light of knowledge," would have no meaning.
   And again that darkness is brought upon men by their evil deeds, we
   learn from John himself, when he says in his epistle, [4731] "If we say
   that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and do
   not the truth," and again, "He that saith he is in the light, and
   hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now," and again, "He that
   hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth
   not whither he goeth, because darkness hath blinded his eyes."  Walking
   in darkness signifies evil conduct, and to hate one's brother, is not
   that to fall away from that which is properly called knowledge?  But he
   also who is ignorant of divine things walks in darkness, just because
   of that ignorance; as David says, [4732] "They knew not, they
   understood not, they walk in darkness."  Consider, however, this
   passage, [4733] "God is light and in Him is no [4734] darkness," and
   see if the reason for this saying is not that darkness is not one,
   being either two, because there are two kinds of it, or many, because
   it is taken distributively, individually with reference to the many
   evil actions and the many false doctrines; so that there are many
   darknesses, not one of which is in God.  The saying of the Saviour
   could not be spoken of the Holy One, "Ye are the light of the world;"
   for the Holy One is light of the world (absolute, not particular), and
   there is not in Him any darkness.

   21.  Christ is Not, Like God, Quite Free from Darkness:  Since He Bore
   Our Sins.

   Now some one will ask how this statement that there is no darkness in
   Him can be regarded as a thing peculiar to Him, when we consider that
   the Saviour also was quite without sin.  Could it not be said of Him
   also that "He is light, and that there is no darkness in Him"?  The
   difference between the two cases has been partly set forth above.  We
   will now, however, go a step further than we did before, and add, that
   if God made Christ who knew no sin to be sin for us, [4735] then it
   could not be said of Him that there was no darkness in Him.  For if
   Jesus was in the likeness [4736] of the flesh of sin and for sin, and
   condemned sin by taking upon Him the likeness of the flesh of sin, then
   it cannot be said of Him, absolutely and directly, that there was no
   darkness in Him.  We may add that "He [4737] took our infirmities and
   bare our sicknesses," both infirmities of the soul and sicknesses of
   the hidden man of our heart.  On account of these infirmities and
   sicknesses which He bore away from us, He declares His soul to be
   sorrowful and sore troubled, [4738] and He is said in Zechariah to have
   put on filthy garments, [4739] which, when He was about to take them
   off, are said to be sins.  "Behold, it is said, I have taken away thy
   sins."  Because He had taken on Himself the sins of the people of those
   who believed in Him, he uses many such expressions as these:  "Far from
   my salvation are the words of my transgressions," [4740] and "Thou
   knowest my foolishness, and my sins were not hid from Thee." [4741]
   And let no one suppose that we say this from any lack of piety towards
   the Christ of God; for as the Father alone has immortality and our Lord
   took upon Himself, for His love to men, the death He died for us, so to
   the Father alone the words apply, "In Him is no darkness," since Christ
   took upon Himself, for His goodwill towards men, our darknesses.  This
   He did, that by His power He might destroy our death and remove the
   darkness which is in our soul, so that the saying in Isaiah might be
   fulfilled, [4742] "The people that sat in darkness saw a great light."
   This light, which came into being in the Logos, and is also life,
   shines in the darkness of our souls, and it has come where the rulers
   of this darkness carry on their struggle with the race of men and
   strive to subdue to darkness those who do not stand firm with all their
   power; that they might be enlightened the light has come so far, and
   that they might be called sons of light.  And shining in darkness this
   light is pursued by the darkness, but not overtaken.

   22.  How the Darkness Failed to Overtake the Light.

   Should any one consider that we are adding something that is not
   written, namely, the pursuit of the light by the darkness, let him
   reflect that unless the darkness had pursued the light the words, "The
   darkness did not overtake it," would have no meaning.  John writes for
   those who have wit to see what is omitted and to supply it as the
   context requires, and so he wrote, "The darkness did not overtake it."
   If it did not overtake it, it must first have pursued it, and that the
   darkness did pursue the light is clear from what the Saviour suffered,
   and those also who received His teachings, His own children, when
   darkness was doing what it could against the sons of light and was
   minded to drive light away from men.  But since, if God be for us,
   [4743] no one, however that way minded, can be against us, the more
   they humbled themselves the more they grew, and they prevailed
   exceedingly.  In two ways the darkness did not overtake the light.
   Either it was left far behind and was itself so slow, while the light
   was in its course so sharp and swift, that it was not even able to keep
   following it, or if the light sought to lay a snare for the darkness,
   and waited for it in pursuance of the plan it had formed, then
   darkness, coming near the light, was brought to an end.  In either case
   the darkness did not overtake the light.

   23.  There is a Divine Darkness Which is Not Evil, and Which Ultimately
   Becomes Light.

   In connection with this subject it is necessary for us to point out
   that darkness is not to be understood, every time it is mentioned, in a
   bad sense; Scripture speaks of it sometimes in a good sense.  The
   heterodox have failed to observe this distinction, and have accordingly
   adopted most shameful doctrines about the Maker of the world, and have
   indeed revolted from Him, and addicted themselves to fictions and
   myths.  We must, therefore, show how and when the name of darkness is
   taken in a good sense.  Darkness and clouds and tempest are said in
   Exodus [4744] to be round about God, and in the seventeenth Psalm,
   [4745] "He made darkness His secret place, His tent round about Him,
   dark water in clouds of the air."  Indeed, if one considers the
   multitude of speculation and knowledge about God, beyond the power of
   human nature to take in, beyond the power, perhaps, of all originated
   beings except Christ and the Holy Spirit, then one may know how God is
   surrounded with darkness, because the discourse is hid in ignorance
   which would be required to tell in what darkness He has made His
   hiding-place when He arranged that the things concerning Him should be
   unknown and beyond the grasp of knowledge.  Should any one be staggered
   by these expositions, he may be reconciled to them both by the "dark
   sayings" and by the "treasures of darkness," hidden, invisible, which
   are given to Christ by God.  In nowise different, I consider, are the
   treasures of darkness which are hid in Christ, from what is spoken of
   in the text, "God made darkness His secret place," and (the saint)
   "shall understand parable and dark saying." [4746]   And consider if we
   have here the reason of the Saviour's saying to His disciples, "What ye
   have heard in darkness, speak ye in the light."  The mysteries
   committed to them in secret and where few could hear, hard to be known
   and obscure, He bids them, when enlightened and therefore said to be in
   the light, to make known to every one who is made light.  I might add a
   still stranger feature of this darkness which is praised, namely, that
   it hastens to the light and overtakes it, and so at last, after having
   been unknown as darkness, undergoes for him who does not see its power
   such a change that he comes to know it and to declare that what was
   formerly known to him as darkness has now become light.

   24.  John the Baptist Was Sent.  From Where?  His Soul Was Sent from a
   Higher Region.

   "There was a man sent from God, whose name was John." [4747]   He who
   is sent is sent from somewhere to somewhere; and the careful student
   will, therefore, enquire from what quarter John was sent, and whither.
   The "whither" is quite plain on the face of the story; he was sent to
   Israel, and to those who were willing to hear him when he was staying
   in the wilderness of Judæa and baptizing by the banks of the Jordan.
   According to the deeper sense, however, he was sent into the world, the
   world being understood as this earthly place where men are; and the
   careful student will have this in view in enquiring from where John was
   sent.  Examining the words more closely, he will perhaps declare that
   as it is written of Adam, [4748] "And the Lord sent him forth out of
   the Paradise of pleasure to till the earth, out of which he was taken,"
   so also John was sent, either from heaven or from Paradise, or from
   some other quarter to this place on the earth.  He was sent that he
   might bear witness of the light.  There is, however, an objection to
   this interpretation, which is not to be lightly dismissed.  It is
   written in Isaiah: [4749]   "Whom shall I send, and who will go to the
   people?"  The prophet answers:  "Here am I,--send me."  He, then, who
   objects to that rendering of our passage which appears to be the deeper
   may say that Isaiah was sent not to this world from another place, but
   after having seen "the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up,"
   was sent to the people, to say, "Hearing, ye shall hear and shall not
   understand," and so on; and that in the same manner John, the beginning
   of his mission not being narrated, is sent after the analogy of the
   mission of Isaiah, to baptize, [4750] and to make ready for the Lord a
   people prepared for Him, and to bear witness of the light.  So much we
   have said of the first sense; and now we adduce certain solutions which
   help to confirm the deeper meaning about John.  In the same passage it
   is added, "He came for witness, to bear witness of the light."  Now, if
   he came, where did he come from?  To those who find it difficult to
   follow us, we point to what John says afterwards of having seen the
   Holy Spirit as a dove descending on the Saviour.  "He that sent me," he
   says, [4751] "to baptize with water, He said unto me, Upon whomsoever
   thou shalt see the Holy Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, the
   same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit and with fire."  When
   did He send him and give him this injunction?  The answer to this
   question will probably be that when He sent him to begin to baptize,
   then He who was dealing with him uttered this word.  But a more
   convincing argument for the view that John was sent from another region
   when he entered into the body, the one object of his entry into this
   life being that he should bear witness of the truth, may be drawn from
   the narrative of his birth.  Gabriel, when announcing to Zacharias the
   birth of John, and to Mary the advent of our Saviour among men, says:
   [4752]   That John is to be "filled with the Holy Spirit even from his
   mother's womb."  And we have also the saying, "For behold, when the
   voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb
   for joy."  He who sedulously guards himself in his dealings with
   Scripture against forced, or casual, or capricious procedure, must
   necessarily assume that John's soul was older than his body, and
   subsisted by itself before it was sent on the ministry of the witness
   of the light.  Nor must we overlook the text, "This is Elijah which is
   to come." [4753]   For if that general doctrine of the soul is to be
   received, namely, that it is not sown at the same time with the body,
   but is before it, and is then, for various causes, clothed with flesh
   and blood; then the words "sent from God" will not appear to be
   applicable to John alone.  The most evil of all, the man of sin, the
   son of perdition, is said by Paul to be sent by God: [4754]   "God
   sendeth them a working of error that they should believe a lie; that
   they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure
   in unrighteousness."  But our present question may, perhaps, be solved
   in this way, that as every man is a man of God, simply because God
   created him, but not every man is called a man of God, but only he who
   has devoted himself to God, such as Elijah and those who are called men
   of God in the Scriptures, thus every man might be said in ordinary
   language to be sent from God, but in the absolute sense no one is to be
   spoken of in this way who has not entered this life for a divine
   ministry and in the service of the salvation of mankind.  We do not
   find it said of any one but the saints that he is sent by God.  It is
   said of Isaiah as we showed before; it is also said of Jeremiah, "To
   whomsoever I shall send thee thou shalt go"; [4755] and it is said of
   Ezekiel, [4756] "I send thee to nations that are rebellious and have
   not believed in Me."  The examples, however, do not expressly speak of
   a mission from the region outside life into life, and as it is a
   mission into life that we are enquiring about, they may seem to have
   little bearing on our subject.  But there is nothing absurd in our
   transferring the argument derived from them to our question.  They tell
   us that it is only the saints, and we were speaking of them, whom God
   is said to send, and in this sense they may be applied to the case of
   those who are sent into this life.

   25.  Argument from the Prayer of Joseph, to Show that the Baptist May
   Have Been an Angel Who Became a Man.

   As we are now engaged with what is said of John, and are asking about
   his mission, I may take the opportunity to state the view which I
   entertain about him.  We have read this prophecy about him, "Behold, I
   send My messenger (angel) before Thy face, who shall prepare Thy way
   before Thee;" and at this we ask if it can be one of the holy angels
   who is sent down on this ministry as forerunner of our Saviour.  No
   wonder if, when the first-born of all creation was assuming a human
   body, some of them should have been filled with love to man and become
   admirers and followers of Christ, and thought it good to minister to
   his kindness towards man by having a body like that of men.  And who
   would not be moved at the thought of his leaping for joy when yet in
   the belly, surpassing as he did the common nature of man?  Should the
   piece entitled "The prayer of Joseph," one of the apocryphal works
   current among the Hebrews, be thought worthy of credence, this dogma
   will be found in it clearly expressed.  Those at the beginning, it is
   represented, having some marked distinction beyond men, and being much
   greater than other souls, because they were angels, they have come down
   to human nature.  Thus Jacob says:  "I, Jacob, who speak to you, and
   Israel, I am an angel of God, a ruling spirit, and Abraham and Isaac
   were created before every work of God; and I am Jacob, called Jacob by
   men, but my name is Israel, called Israel by God, a man seeing God,
   because I am the first-born of every creature which God caused to
   live."  And he adds:  "When I was coming from Mesopotamia of Syria,
   Uriel, the angel of God, came forth, and said, I have come down to the
   earth and made my dwelling among men, and I am called Jacob by name.
   He was wroth with me and fought with me and wrestled against me, saying
   that his name and the name of Him who is before every angel should be
   before my name.  And I told him his name and how great he was among the
   sons of God; Art not thou Uriel my eighth, and I am Israel and
   archangel of the power of the Lord and a chief captain among the sons
   of God?  Am not I Israel, the first minister in the sight of God, and I
   invoked my God by the inextinguishable name?"  It is likely that this
   was really said by Jacob, and was therefore written down, and that
   there is also a deeper meaning in what we are told, "He supplanted his
   brother in the womb."  Consider whether the celebrated question about
   Jacob and Esau has a solution.  We read, [4757] "The children being not
   yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of
   God according to election might stand, not of works but of him that
   calleth, it was said, "The elder shall serve the younger."  Even as it
   is written:  "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."  What shall we say,
   then?  Is there unrighteousness with God?  God forbid."  If, then, when
   they were not yet born, and had not done anything either good or evil,
   in order that God's purpose according to election might stand, not of
   works, but of him that calleth, if at such a period this was said, how
   if we do not go back to the works done before this life, can it be said
   that there is no unrighteousness with God when the elder serves the
   younger and is hated (by God) before he has done anything worthy of
   slavery or of hatred?  We have made something of a digression in
   introducing this story about Jacob and appealing to a writing which we
   cannot well treat with contempt; but it certainly adds weight to our
   argument about John, to the effect that as Isaiah's voice declares
   [4758] he is an angel who assumed a body for the sake of bearing
   witness to the light.  So much about John considered as a man.

   26.  John is Voice, Jesus is Speech.  Relation of These Two to Each
   Other.

   Now we know voice and speech to be different things.  The voice can be
   produced without any meaning and with no speech in it, and similarly
   speech can be reported to the mind without voice, as when we make
   mental excursions, within ourselves.  And thus the Saviour is, in one
   view of Him, speech, and John differs from Him; for as the Saviour is
   speech, John is voice.  John himself invites me to take this view of
   him, for to those who asked who he was, he answered, "I am the voice of
   one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord! make His
   paths straight!"  This explains, perhaps, how it was that Zacharias
   lost his voice at the birth of the voice which points out the Word of
   God, and only recovered it when the voice, forerunner of the Word, was
   born.  A voice must be perceived with the ears if the mind is
   afterwards to receive the speech which the voice indicates.  Hence,
   John is, in point of his birth, a little older than Christ, for our
   voice comes to us before our speech.  But John also points to Christ;
   for speech is brought forward by the voice.  And Christ is baptized by
   John, though John declares himself to have need to be baptized by
   Christ; for with men speech is purified by voice, though the natural
   way is that speech should purify the voice which indicates it.  In a
   word, when John points out Christ, it is man pointing out God, the
   Saviour incorporeal, the voice pointing out the Word.

   27.  Significance of the Names of John and of His Parents.

   The force that is in names may be applied in many matters, and it may
   be worth our while to ask at this point what is the significance of the
   names John and Zacharias.  The relatives wish, as the giving of a name
   is a thing not to be lightly disposed of, to call the child Zacharias,
   and are surprised that Elisabeth should want him to be called John.
   Zacharias then writes, "His name is John," and is at once freed from
   his troublesome silence.  On examining the names, then, we find
   "Joannes" to be "Joa" without the "nes."  The New Testament gives
   Hebrew names a Greek form and treats them as Greek words; Jacob is
   changed into Jacobus, Symeon into Simon, and Joannes is the same as
   Joa.  Zacharias is said to be memory, and Elisabeth "oath of my God,"
   or "strength of my God."  John then came into the world from grace of
   God (=Joa=Joannes), and his parents were Memory (about God) and the
   Oath of our God, about the fathers.  Thus was he born to make ready for
   the Lord a people fit for Him, at the end of the Covenant now grown
   old, which is the end of the Sabbatic period.  Hence it is not possible
   that the rest after the Sabbath should have come into existence from
   the seventh of our God; on the contrary, it is our Saviour who, after
   the pattern of His own rest, caused us to be made in the likeness of
   His death, and hence also of His resurrection. [4759]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [4759] Origen appears to be pointing to the fact that the Christian
   rest which is connected in its origin with the resurrection of Christ
   is not held as the Jewish Sabbath rest on the seventh but on the first
   day of the week.  John marking the end of the old period is the son of
   Elisabeth the oath, or seventh, of God, and is thus connected with the
   seventh day; but not so Jesus.

   28.  The Prophets Bore Witness to Christ and Foretold Many Things
   Concerning Him.

   "He came for a witness that He might bear witness of the light, that
   all through Him might believe." [4760]   Some of the dissenters from
   the Church's doctrine, men who profess to believe in Christ, have
   desired another being, as indeed their system requires, besides the
   Creator, and hence cannot allow His coming to the world to have been
   foretold by the prophets. [4761]   They therefore endeavour to get rid
   of the testimonies of the prophets about Christ, and say that the Son
   of God has no need of witnesses, but that He brings with Him His own
   evidence, partly in the sound words full of power which He proclaimed
   and partly in the wonderful works He did, which were sufficient at once
   to convince any one whatever.  Then they say:  If Moses is believed on
   account of his word and his works, and has no need of any witnesses to
   announce him beforehand, and if the prophets were received, every one
   of them, by these people, as messengers from God, how should not one
   who is much greater than Moses and the prophets accomplish His mission
   and benefit the human race, without prophets to bear witness about
   Him?  They regard it as superfluous that He should have been foretold
   by the prophets, since the prophets were concerned, as these opponents
   would say, that those who believed in Christ should not receive Him as
   a new God, and therefore did what they could to bring them to that same
   God whom Moses and the prophets taught before Jesus.  To this we must
   say that as there are many causes which may lead men to believe, since
   men who are not moved by one argument may be by another, so God is able
   to provide for men a number of occasions, any of which may cause their
   minds to open to the truth that God, who is over all, has taken on
   Himself human nature.  It is manifest to all, how some are brought by
   the prophetic writings to the admiration of Christ.  They are astounded
   at the voices of so many prophets before Him, which establish the place
   of His birth, the country of His upbringing, the power of His teaching,
   His working of wonderful works, and His human passion brought to a
   close by His resurrection.  We must notice, too, that Christ's
   stupendous acts of power were able to bring to the faith those of
   Christ's own time, but that they lost their demonstrative force with
   the lapse of years and began to be regarded as mythical.  Greater
   evidential value than that of the miracles then performed attaches to
   the comparison which we now make between these miracles and the
   prophecy of them; this makes it impossible for the student to cast any
   doubt on the former.  The prophetic testimonies do not declare merely
   the advent of the Messiah; it is by no means the case that they teach
   this and nothing else.  They teach a great deal of theology.  The
   relation of the Father to the Son and of the Son to the Father may be
   learned not less from what the prophets announce about Christ, than
   from the Apostles narrating the splendours of the Son of God.  A
   parallel case, which we may venture to adduce, is that of the martyrs,
   who were honoured by the witness they bore Him, and by no means
   conferred any favour on Him by their witnessing for the Son of God.
   And how is it if, as many of Christ's true disciples were honoured by
   having thus to witness for Him, so the prophets received from God as
   their special gift that of understanding about Christ and announcing
   Him before, and that they taught not only those living after Christ's
   advent how they should regard the Son of God, but those also who lived
   in the generations before Him?  As he who in these times does not know
   the Son has not the Father either, [4762] so also we are to understand
   it was in these earlier times.  Hence "Abraham rejoiced to see the day
   of Christ, and he saw it and was glad." [4763]   He, therefore, who
   declares that they are not to testify about Christ is seeking to
   deprive the chorus of the prophets of the greatest gift they have; for
   what office of equal importance would be left to prophecy, inspired as
   it is by the Holy Spirit, if all connection with the economy of our
   Lord and Master were taken away from it?  For as these have their faith
   well ordered who approach the God of the universe through Mediator and
   High-Priest and Paraclete, and as his religion is a halting one who
   does not go in through the door to the Father, so also in the case of
   men of old time.  Their religion was sanctified and made acceptable to
   God by their knowledge and faith and expectation of Christ.  For we
   have observed that God declares Himself to be a witness and exhorts
   them all to declare the same about Christ, and to be imitators of Him,
   bearing witness of Him to all who require it.  For he says, [4764] "Be
   witnesses for Me, and I am witness, saith the Lord God, and My servant
   whom I have chosen."  Now every one who bears witness to the truth,
   whether he support it by words or deeds, or in whatever way, may
   properly be called a witness (martyr); but it has come to be the custom
   of the brotherhood, since they are struck with admiration of those who
   have contended to the death for truth and valour, to keep the name of
   martyr more properly for those who have borne witness to the mystery of
   godliness by shedding their blood for it.  The Saviour gives the name
   of martyr to every one who bears witness to the truth He declares; thus
   at the Ascension He says to His disciples: [4765]   "You shall be my
   witnesses in Jerusalem and in Judæa and in Samaria and unto the
   uttermost parts of the earth."  The leper who was cleansed [4766] had
   still to bring the gift which Moses commanded for a testimony to those
   who did not believe in the Christ.  In the same way the martyrs bear
   witness for a testimony to the unbelieving, and so do all the saints
   whose deeds shine before men.  They spend their life rejoicing in the
   cross of Christ and bearing witness to the true light.

   29.  The Six Testimonies of the Baptist Enumerated.  Jesus' "Come and
   See."  Significance of the Tenth Hour.

   Accordingly John came to bear witness of the light, and in his
   witness-bearing he cried, saying, [4767] "He that cometh after me
   exists before me; for He was before me; for of His fulness we have all
   received and grace for grace, for the law was given by Moses, but grace
   and truth came through Jesus Christ.  No one hath seen God at any time;
   the only-begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath
   declared Him."  This whole speech is from the mouth of the Baptist
   bearing witness to the Christ.  Some take it otherwise, and consider
   that the words from "for of His fulness" to "He hath declared Him" are
   from the writer, John the Apostle.  The true state of the case is that
   John's first testimony begins, as we said before, "He that cometh after
   me," and ends, "He hath declared Him," and his second testimony is that
   spoken to the priests and levites sent from Jerusalem, whom the Jews
   had sent.  To them he confesses and does not deny the truth, namely,
   that he is not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet, but "the voice
   of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as
   saith Isaiah the prophet." [4768]   After this there is another
   testimony of the same Baptist to Christ, still teaching His superior
   nature, which goes forth into the whole world and enters into
   reasonable souls.  He says, [4769] "There standeth One among you whom
   you know not, even He that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I
   am not worthy to unloose."  Consider if, since the heart is in the
   middle of the whole body, and the ruling principle in the heart, the
   saying, "There standeth One among you whom you know not," can be
   understood of [4770] the reason which is in every man.  John's fourth
   testimony of Christ after these points to His human sufferings.  He
   says, [4771] "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
   world.  This is He of whom I said, After me cometh a man who exists
   before me, for He was before me.  And I knew Him not, but that He
   should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with
   water."  And the fifth testimony is recorded in the words, [4772] "I
   beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and it abode upon
   Him, and I knew Him not, but He that sent me to baptize with water, He
   said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and
   abiding upon Him, the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit.
   And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God."  In the
   sixth place John witnesses of Christ to the two disciples: [4773]   "He
   looked on Jesus as He walked and saith, Behold the Lamb of God."  After
   this testimony the two disciples who heard it followed Jesus; and Jesus
   turned and beheld them following, and saith unto them, "What seek ye?"
   Perhaps it is not without significance that after six testimonies John
   ceases from his witness-bearing and Jesus brings forward in the seventh
   place His "What seek ye?"  Very becoming in those who have been helped
   by John's testimony is the speech in which they address Christ as their
   Master, and declare their wish to see the dwelling of the Son of God;
   for they say to Him, "Rabbi," which answers to "Master," in our
   language, "where dwellest Thou?"  And since every one that seeketh
   findeth, when John's disciples seek Jesus' dwelling, Jesus shows it to
   them, saying, "Come and see."  By the word "Come" He exhorts them
   perhaps to the practical part of life, while the "see" is to suggest to
   them that that speculation which comes in the train of right conduct
   will be vouchsafed to those who desire it; in Jesus' dwelling they will
   have it.  After they had asked where Jesus dwells, and had followed the
   Master and had seen, they desired to stay with Him and to spend that
   day with the Son of God.  Now the number ten is a sacred one, not a few
   mysteries being indicated by it; and so we are to understand that the
   mention of the tenth hour as that at which these disciples turned in
   with Jesus, is not without significance.  Of these disciples, Andrew,
   the brother of Simon Peter, is one; and he having profited by this day
   with Jesus and having found his own brother Simon (perhaps he had not
   found him before), told him that he had found the Messiah, which is,
   being interpreted, Christ.  It is written that "he that seeketh
   findeth."  Now he had sought where Jesus dwelt, and had followed Him
   and looked upon His dwelling; he stays with the Lord "at the tenth
   hour," and finds the Son of God, the Word, and Wisdom, and is ruled by
   Him as King.  That is why he says, "We have found the Messiah," and
   this a thing which every one can say who has found this Word of God and
   is ruled as by a king, by His Divinity.  As a fruit he at once brings
   his brother to Christ, and Christ deigned to look upon Simon, that is
   to say, by looking at him to visit and enlighten his ruling principle;
   and Simon by Jesus' looking at him was enabled to grow strong, so as to
   earn a new name from that work of firmness and strength, and to be
   called Peter.

   30.  How John Was a Witness of Christ, and Specially of "The Light."

   It may be asked why we should have gone through all this when the verse
   before us is, "He came for witness, that he might bear witness of the
   light."  But it was necessary to give John's testimonies to the light,
   and to show the order in which they took place, and also, in order to
   show how effective John's testimony proved, to set forth the help it
   afforded afterwards to those to whom he bore it.  But before all these
   testimonies there was an earlier one when the Baptist leaped in the
   womb of Elisabeth at the greeting of Mary.  That was a testimony to
   Christ and attested His divine conception and birth.  And what more
   need I say?  John is everywhere a witness and forerunner of Christ.  He
   anticipates His birth and dies a little before the death of the Son of
   God, and thus witnesses not only for those at the time of the birth,
   but to those who were expecting the freedom which was to come for man
   through the death of Christ.  Thus, in all his life, he is a little
   before Christ, and everywhere makes ready for the Lord a people
   prepared for Him.  And John's testimony precedes also the second and
   diviner coming of Christ, for we read, [4774] "If ye will receive it,
   this is Elijah which is to come.  He that hath ears to hear let him
   hear."  Now, there was a beginning, in which the Word was,--and we saw
   from Proverbs that that beginning was wisdom,--and the Word was in
   existence, and in the Word life was made, and the life was the light of
   men; and all this being so, I ask why the man who came, sent from God,
   whose name was John, why he came for witness to bear witness especially
   of the light?  Why did he not come to bear witness of the life, or of
   the Word, or about the beginning, or about any other of the many
   aspects in which Christ appears?  Consider here the texts, "The people
   which sat in darkness saw a great light," and "The light shineth in
   darkness, and the darkness overtook it not," and consider how those who
   are in darkness, that is, men, have need of light.  For if the light of
   men shines in darkness, and there is no active power in darkness to
   attain to it, then we must partake of other aspects of Christ; at
   present we have no real share of Him at all.  For what share have we of
   life, we who are still in the body of death, and whose life is hid with
   Christ in God? [4775]   "For when Christ who is our life shall appear,
   then shall we also appear with Him in glory."  It was not possible,
   therefore, that he who came should bear witness about a life which is
   still hid with Christ in God.  Nor did he come for witness to bear
   witness of the Word, for we know the Word who was in the beginning with
   God and who is God the Word; for the Word was made flesh on the earth.
   And though the witness had been, at least apparently, about the Word,
   it would in fact have been about the Word made flesh and not about the
   word of God.  He did not come, therefore, to bear witness of the Word.
   And how could there be any witness-bearing about wisdom, to those who,
   even if they appear to know something, cannot understand pure truth,
   but behold it through a glass and in an enigma?  It is likely, however,
   that before the second and diviner advent of Christ, John or Elias will
   come to bear witness about life a little before Christ our life is made
   manifest, and that then they will bear witness about the Word, and
   offer also their testimony about wisdom.  Some inquiry is necessary
   whether a testimony such as that of John is to precede each of the
   aspects of Christ.  So much for the words, "He came for witness, to
   bear witness of the light."  What we are to understand by the further
   words, "That all might believe through Him," may be considered later.

   Fragments of the Fourth Book. [4776]

   (Three Leaves from the Beginning.)

   1.  He who distinguishes in himself voice and meaning and things for
   which the meaning stands, will not be offended at rudeness of language
   if, on enquiry, he finds the things spoken of to be sound.  The more
   may this be so when we remember how the holy men acknowledge their
   speech and their preaching to be not in persuasion of the wisdom of
   words, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power....

   [Then, after speaking of the rudeness of style of the Gospel, he
   proceeds: ]

   2.  The Apostles are not unaware that in some things they give offence,
   and that in some respects their culture is defective, and they confess
   themselves [4777] accordingly to be rude in speech but not in
   knowledge; for we must consider that the other Apostles would have said
   this, too, as well as Paul.  As for the text, [4778] "But we have this
   treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of
   God and not of us," we interpret it in this way.  By "treasures" we
   understand here, as in other passages, the treasure of knowledge
   (gnosis) and of hidden wisdom.  By "earthen vessels" we understand the
   humble diction of the Scriptures, which the Greek might so readily be
   led to despise, and in which the excellency of God's power appears so
   clearly.  The mystery of the truth and the power of the things said
   were not hindered by the humble diction from travelling to the ends of
   the earth, nor from subduing to the word of Christ, not only the
   foolish things of the world, but sometimes its wise things, too.  For
   we see our calling, [4779] not that no wise man according to the flesh,
   but that not many wise according to the flesh.  But Paul, in his
   preaching of the Gospel, is a debtor [4780] to deliver the word not to
   Barbarians only, but also to Greeks, and not only to the unwise, who
   would easily agree with him, but also to the wise.  For he was made
   sufficient [4781] by God to be a minister of the New Covenant, wielding
   the demonstration of the spirit and of power, so that when the
   believers agreed with him their belief should not be in the wisdom of
   men, but in the power of God.  For, perhaps, if the Scripture
   possessed, like the works the Greeks admire, elegance and command of
   diction, then it would be open to suppose that not the truth of them
   had laid hold of men, but that the apparent sequence and splendour of
   language had carried off the hearers, and had carried them off by
   guile.

   From the Fifth Book.

   From the Preface. [4782]

   You are not content to fulfil the office, when I am present with you,
   of a taskmaster to drive me to labour at theology; even when I am
   absent you demand that I should spend most of my time on you and on the
   task I have to do for you. [4783]   I, for my part, am inclined to
   shrink from toil, and to avoid that danger which threatens from God
   those who give themselves to writing on divinity; thus I would take
   shelter in Scripture in refraining from making many books.  For Solomon
   says in Ecclesiastes, [4784] "My son, beware of making many books;
   there is no end of it, and much study is a weariness of the flesh."
   For we, except that text have some hidden meaning which we do not yet
   perceive, have directly transgressed the injunction, we have not
   guarded ourselves against making many books.

   Gospel have run to four volumes, he goes on:]

   2.  How Scripture Warns Us Against Making Many Books.

   For, to judge by the words of the phrase, "My son, beware of making
   many books," two things appear to be indicated by it:  first, that we
   ought not to possess many books, and then that we ought not to compose
   many books.  If the first is not the meaning the second must be, and if
   the second is the meaning the first does not necessarily follow.  In
   either case we appear to be told that we ought not to make many books.
   I might take my stand on this dictum which now confronts us, and send
   you the text as an excuse, and I might appeal in support of this
   position to the fact that not even the saints found leisure to compose
   many books; and thus I might cry off from the bargain we made with each
   other, and give up writing what I was to send to you.  You, on your
   side, would no doubt feel the force of the text I have cited, and
   might, for the future, excuse me.  But we must treat Scripture
   conscientiously, and must not congratulate ourselves because we see the
   primary meaning of a text, that we understand it altogether.  I do not,
   therefore, shrink from bringing forward what excuse I think I am able
   to offer for myself, and to point out the arguments, which you would
   certainly use against me, if I acted contrary to our agreement.  And in
   the first place, the Sacred History seems to agree with the text in
   question, inasmuch as none of the saints composed several works, or set
   forth his views in a number of books.  I will take up this point:  when
   I proceed to write a number of books, the critic will remind me that
   even such a one as Moses left behind him only five books.
     __________________________________________________________________

   3.  The Apostles Wrote Little. [4785]

   But he who was made fit to be a minister of the New Covenant, not of
   the letter, but of the spirit, Paul, who fulfilled the Gospel from
   Jerusalem round about to Illyricum, [4786] did not write epistles to
   all the churches he taught, and to those to whom he did write he sent
   no more than a few lines.  And Peter, on whom the Church of Christ is
   built, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail [4787] left
   only one epistle of acknowledged genuineness.  Suppose we allow that he
   left a second; for this is doubtful.  What are we to say of him who
   leaned on Jesus' breast, namely, John, who left one Gospel, though
   confessing [4788] that he could make so many that the world would not
   contain them?  But he wrote also the Apocalypse, being commanded to be
   silent and not to write the voices of the seven thunders. [4789]   But
   he also left an epistle of very few lines.  Suppose also a second and a
   third, since not all pronounce these to be genuine; but the two
   together do not amount to a hundred lines.

   [Then, after enumerating the prophets and Apostles, and showing how
   each wrote only a little, or not even a little, he goes on:] [4790]

   4.  I feel myself growing dizzy with all this, and wonder whether, in
   obeying you, I have not been obeying God, nor walking in the footsteps
   of the saints, unless it be that my too great love to you, and my
   unwillingness to cause you any pain, has led me astray and caused me to
   think of all these excuses.  We started from the words of the preacher,
   where he says:  "My son, beware of making many books."  With this I
   compare a saying from the Proverbs of the same Solomon, [4791] "In the
   multitude of words thou shalt not escape sin; but in sparing thy lips
   thou shalt be wise."  Here I ask whether speaking many words of
   whatever kind is a multitude of words (in the sense of the preacher),
   even if the many words a man speaks are sacred and connected with
   salvation.  If this be the case, and if he who makes use of many
   salutary words is guilty of "multitude of words," then Solomon himself
   did not escape this sin, for "he spoke [4792] three thousand proverbs,
   and five thousand songs, and he spoke of trees from the cedar that is
   in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall, he
   spoke also of beasts and of fowl, and of creeping things and of
   fishes."  How, I may ask, can any one give any course of instruction,
   without a multitude of words, using the phrase in its simplest sense?
   Does not Wisdom herself say to those who are perishing, [4793] "I
   stretched out my words, and ye heeded not"?  Do we not find Paul, too,
   extending his discourse from morning to midnight, [4794] when Eutychus
   was borne down with sleep and fell down, to the dismay of the hearers,
   who thought he was killed?  If, then, the words are true, "In much
   speaking thou wilt not escape sin," and if Solomon was yet not guilty
   of great sin when he discoursed on the subjects above mentioned, nor
   Paul when he prolonged his discourse till midnight, then the question
   arises, What is that much speaking which is referred to? and then we
   may pass on to consider what are the many books.  Now the entire Word
   of God, who was in the beginning with God, is not much speaking, is not
   words; for the Word is one, being composed of the many speculations
   (theoremata), each of which is a part of the Word in its entirety.
   Whatever words there be outside of this one, which promise to give any
   description and exposition, even though they be words about truth, none
   of these, to put it in a somewhat paradoxical way, is Word or Reason,
   they are all words or reasons.  They are not the monad, far from it;
   they are not that which agrees and is one in itself, by their inner
   divisions and conflicts unity has departed from them, they have become
   numbers, perhaps infinite numbers.  We are obliged, therefore, to say
   that whoever speaks that which is foreign to religion is using many
   words, while he who speaks the words of truth, even should he go over
   the whole field and omit nothing, is always speaking the one word.  Nor
   are the saints guilty of much speaking, since they always have the aim
   in view which is connected with the one word.  It appears, then, that
   the much speaking which is condemned is judged to be so rather from the
   nature of the views propounded, than from the number of the words
   pronounced.  Let us see if we cannot conclude in the same way that all
   the sacred books are one book, but that those outside are the "many
   books" of the preacher.  The proof of this must be drawn from Holy
   Scripture, and it will be most satisfactorily established if I am able
   to show that it is not only one book, taking the word now in its
   commoner meaning, that we find to be written about Christ.  Christ is
   written about even in the Pentateuch; He is spoken of in each of the
   Prophets, and in the Psalms, and, in a word, as the Saviour Himself
   says, in all the Scriptures.  He refers us to them all, when He says:
   [4795]   "Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal
   life, and these are they which testify of Me."  And if He refers us to
   the Scriptures as testifying of Him, it is not to one that He sends us,
   to the exclusion of another, but to all that speak of Him, those which,
   in the Psalms, He calls the chapter of the book, saying, [4796] "In the
   chapter of the book it is written of Me."  If any one proposes to take
   these words, "In the chapter of the book it is written of Me,"
   literally, and to apply them to this or that special passage where
   Christ is spoken of, let him tell us on what principle he warrants his
   preference for one book over another.  If any one supposes that we are
   doing something of this kind ourselves, and applying the words in
   question to the book of Psalms, we deny that we do so, and we would
   urge that in that case the words should have been, "In this book it is
   written of Me."  But He speaks of all the books as one chapter, thus
   summing up in one all that is spoken of Christ for our instruction.  In
   fact the book was seen by John, [4797] "written within and without, and
   sealed; and no one could open it to read it, and to loose the seals
   thereof, but the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, who has
   the key of David, [4798] he that openeth and none shall shut, and that
   shutteth and none shall open."  For the book here spoken of means the
   whole of Scripture; and it is written within (lit. in front), on
   account of the meaning which is obvious, and on the back, on account of
   its remoter and spiritual sense.  Observe, in addition to this, if a
   proof that the sacred writings are one book, and those of an opposite
   character many, may not be found in the fact that there is one book of
   the living from which those who have proved unworthy to be in it are
   blotted out, as it is written: [4799]   "Let them be blotted out of the
   book of the living," while of those who are to undergo the judgment,
   there are books in the plural, as Daniel says: [4800]   "The judgment
   was set, and the books were opened."  But Moses also bears witness to
   the unity of the sacred book, when he says: [4801]   "If Thou forgive
   the people their sins, forgive, but if not, then wipe me out of the
   book which Thou hast written."  The passage in Isaiah, [4802] too, I
   read in the same way.  It is not peculiar to his prophecy that the
   words of the book should be sealed, and should neither be read by him
   who does not know letters, because he is ignorant of letters, nor by
   him who is learned, because the book is sealed.  This is true of every
   writing, for every written work needs the reason (Logos) which closed
   it to open it.  "He shall shut, and none shall open," [4803] and when
   He opens no one can cast doubt on the interpretation He brings.  Hence
   it is said that He shall open and no man shall shut.  I infer a similar
   lesson from the book spoken of in Ezekiel, [4804] in which was written
   lamentation, and a song, and woe.  For the whole book is full of the
   woe of the lost, and the song of the saved, and the lamentation of
   those between these two.  And John, too, when he speaks of his eating
   the one roll, [4805] in which both front and back were written on,
   means the whole of Scripture, one book which is, at first, most sweet
   when one begins, as it were, to chew it, but bitter in the revelation
   of himself which it makes to the conscience of each one who knows it.
   I will add to the proof of this an apostolic saying which has been
   quite misunderstood by the disciples of Marcion, who, therefore, set
   the Gospels at naught.  The Apostle says: [4806]   "According to my
   Gospel in Christ Jesus;" he does not speak of Gospels in the plural,
   and, hence, they argue that as the Apostle only speaks of one Gospel in
   the singular, there was only one in existence.  But they fail to see
   that, as He is one of whom all the evangelists write, so the Gospel,
   though written by several hands, is, in effect, one.  And, in fact, the
   Gospel, though written by four, is one.  From these considerations,
   then, we learn what the one book is, and what the many books, and what
   I am now concerned about is, not the quantity I may write, but the
   effect of what I say, lest, if I fail in this point, and set forth
   anything against the truth itself, even in one of my writings, I should
   prove to have transgressed the commandment, and to be a writer of "many
   books."  Yet I see the heterodox assailing the holy Church of God in
   these days, under the pretence of higher wisdom, and bringing forward
   works in many volumes in which they offer expositions of the
   evangelical and apostolic writings, and I fear that if I should be
   silent and should not put before our members the saving and true
   doctrines, these teachers might get a hold of curious souls, which, in
   the absence of wholesome nourishment, might go after food that is
   forbidden, and, in fact, unclean and horrible.  It appears to me,
   therefore, to be necessary that one who is able to represent in a
   genuine manner the doctrine of the Church, and to refute those dealers
   in knowledge, falsely so-called, should take his stand against
   historical fictions, and oppose to them the true and lofty evangelical
   message in which the agreement of the doctrines, found both in the
   so-called Old Testament and in the so-called New, appears so plainly
   and fully.  You yourself felt at one time the lack of good
   representatives of the better cause, and were impatient of a faith
   which was at issue with reason and absurd, and you then, for the love
   you bore to the Lord, gave yourself to composition from which, however,
   in the exercise of the judgment with which you are endowed, you
   afterwards desisted.  This is the defence which I think admits of being
   made for those who have the faculty of speaking and writing.  But I am
   also pleading my own cause, as I now devote myself with what boldness I
   may to the work of exposition; for it may be that I am not endowed with
   that habit and disposition which he ought to have who is fitted by God
   to be a minister of the New Covenant, not of the letter but of the
   spirit.

   Sixth Book.

   1.  The Work is Taken Up After a Violent Interruption, Which Has Driven
   the Writer from Alexandria.  He Addresses Himself to It Again, with
   Thanks for His Deliverance, and Prayer for Guidance.

   When a house is being built which is to be made as strong as possible,
   the building takes place in fine weather and in calm, so that nothing
   may hinder the structure from acquiring the needed solidity.  And thus
   it turns out so strong and stable that it is able to withstand the rush
   of the flood, and the dashing of the river, and all the agencies
   accompanying a storm which are apt to find out what is rotten in a
   building and to show what parts of it have been properly put together.
   And more particularly should that house which is capable of sheltering
   the speculations of truth, the house of reason, as it were, in promise
   or in letters, be built at a time when God can add His free
   co-operation to the projector of so noble a work, when the soul is
   quiet and in the enjoyment of that peace which passes all
   understanding, when she is turned away from all disturbance and not
   buffeted by any billows.  This, it appears to me, was well understood
   by the servants of the prophetic spirit and the ministers of the Gospel
   message; they made themselves worthy to receive that peace which is in
   secret from Him who ever gives it to them that are worthy and who said,
   [4807] "Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you; not as the
   world giveth give I unto you."  And look if some similar lesson is not
   taught under the surface with regard to David and Solomon in the
   narrative about the temple.  David, who fought the wars of the Lord and
   stood firm against many enemies, his own and those of Israel, desired
   to build a temple for God.  But God, through Nathan, prevents him from
   doing so, and Nathan says to him, [4808] "Thou shalt not build me an
   house, because thou art a man of blood."  But Solomon, on the other
   hand, saw God in a dream, and in a dream received wisdom, for the
   reality of the vision was kept for him who said, "Behold a greater than
   Solomon is here."  The time was one of the profoundest peace, so that
   it was possible for every man to rest under his own vine and his own
   fig-tree, and Solomon's very name was significant of the peace which
   was in his days, for Solomon means peaceful; and so he was at liberty
   to build the famous temple of God.  About the time of Ezra, also, when
   "truth conquers wine and the hostile king and women," [4809] the temple
   of God is restored again.  All this is said by way of apology to you,
   reverend Ambrosius.  It is at your sacred encouragement that I have
   made up my mind to build up in writing the tower of the Gospel; and I
   have therefore sate down to count the cost, [4810] if I have sufficient
   to finish it, lest I should be mocked by the beholders, because I laid
   the foundation but was not able to finish the work.  The result of my
   counting, it is true, has been that I do not possess what is required
   to finish it; yet I have put my trust in God, who enriches us [4811]
   with all wisdom and all knowledge.  If we strive to keep His spiritual
   laws we believe that He does enrich us; He will supply what is
   necessary so that we shall get on with our building, and shall even
   come to the parapet of the structure.  That parapet it is which keeps
   from falling those who go up on the house of the Word; for people only
   fall off those houses which have no parapet, so that the buildings
   themselves are to blame for their fall and for their death.  We
   proceeded as far as the fifth volume in spite of the obstacles
   presented by the storm in Alexandria, and spoke what was given us to
   speak, for Jesus rebuked the winds and the waves of the sea.  We
   emerged from the storm, we were brought out of Egypt, that God
   delivering us who led His people forth from there.  Then, when the
   enemy assailed us with all bitterness by his new writings, so directly
   hostile to the Gospel, and stirred up against us all the winds of
   wickedness in Egypt, I felt that reason called me rather to stand fast
   for the conflict, and to save the higher part in me, lest evil counsels
   should succeed in directing the storm so as to overwhelm my soul,
   rather to do this than to finish my work at an unsuitable season,
   before my mind had recovered its calm.  Indeed, the ready writers who
   usually attended me brought my work to a stand by failing to appear to
   take down my words.  But now that the many fiery darts directed against
   me have lost their edge, for God extinguished them, and my soul has
   grown accustomed to the dispensation sent me for the sake of the
   heavenly word, and has learned from necessity to disregard the snares
   of my enemies, it is as if a great calm had settled on me, and I defer
   no longer the continuation of this work.  I pray that God will be with
   me, and will speak as a teacher in the porch of my soul, so that the
   building I have begun of the exposition of the Gospel of John may
   arrive at completion.  May God hear my prayer and grant that the body
   of the whole work may now be brought together, and that no interruption
   may intervene which might prevent me from following the sequence of
   Scripture.  And be assured that it is with great readiness that I now
   make this second beginning and enter on my sixth volume, because what I
   wrote before at Alexandria has not, I know not by what chance, been
   brought with me.  I feared I might neglect this work, if I were not
   engaged on it at once, and therefore thought it better to make use of
   this present time and begin without delay the part which remains.  I am
   not certain if the part formerly written will come to light, and would
   be very unwilling to waste time in waiting to see if it does.  Enough
   of preamble, let us now attend to our text.

   2.  How the Prophets and Holy Men of the Old Testament Knew the Things
   of Christ.

   "And this is the witness of John." [4812]   This is the second recorded
   testimony of John the Baptist to Christ.  The first begins with "This
   was He of whom I said, He that cometh after me," and goes down to "The
   only-begotten Son of God who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath
   declared him."  Heracleon supposes the words, "No one has seen God at
   any time," etc., to have been spoken, not by the Baptist, but by the
   disciple.  But in this he is not sound.  He himself allows the words,
   "Of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace; for the law was
   given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ," to have been
   spoken by the Baptist.  And does it not follow that the person who
   received of the fulness of Christ, and a second grace in addition to
   that he had before, and who declared the law to have been given by
   Moses, but grace and truth to have come through Jesus Christ, is it not
   clear that this is the person who understood, from what he received
   from the fulness of Christ, how "no one hath seen God at any time," and
   how "the only-begotten who is in the bosom of the Father" had delivered
   the declaration about God to him and to all those who had received of
   His fulness?  He was not declaring here for the first time Him that is
   in the bosom of the Father, as if there had never before been any one
   fit to receive what he told His Apostles.  Does he not teach us that he
   was before Abraham, and that Abraham rejoiced and was glad to see his
   day?  The words "Of his fulness all we received," and "Grace for
   grace," show, as we have already made clear, that the prophets also
   received their gift from the fulness of Christ and received a second
   grace in place of that they had before; for they also, led by the
   Spirit, advanced from the introduction they had in types to the vision
   of truth.  Hence not all the prophets, but many of them, [4813] desired
   to see the things, which the Apostles saw.  For if there was a
   difference among the prophets, those who were perfect and more
   distinguished of them did not desire to see what the Apostles saw, but
   actually beheld them, while those who rose less fully than these to the
   height of the Word were filled with longing for the things which the
   Apostles knew through Christ.  The word "saw" we have not taken in a
   physical sense, and the word "heard" we have taken to refer to a
   spiritual communication; only he who has ears is prepared to hear the
   words of Jesus--a thing which does not happen too frequently.  There is
   the further point, that the saints before the bodily advent of Jesus
   had an advantage over most believers in their insight into the
   mysteries of divinity, since the Word of God was their teacher before
   He became flesh, for He was always working , in imitation of His
   Father, of whom He says, "My father worketh hitherto."  On this point
   we may adduce the words He addresses to the Sadducees, who do not
   believe the doctrine of the resurrection.  "Have you not read," He
   says, [4814] "what is said by God at the Bush, I am the God of Abraham,
   and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; He is not the God of the
   dead but of the living."  If, then, God is not ashamed to be called the
   God of these men, and if they are counted by Christ among the living,
   and if all believers are sons of Abraham, [4815] since all the Gentiles
   are blessed with faithful Abraham, who is appointed by God to be a
   father of the Gentiles, can we hesitate to admit that those living
   persons made acquaintance with the learning of living men, and were
   taught by Christ who was born before the daystar, [4816] before He
   became flesh?  And for this cause they lived, because they had part in
   Him who said, "I am the life," and as the heirs of so great promises
   received the vision, not only of angels, but of God in Christ.  For
   they saw, it may be, the image of the invisible God, [4817] since he
   who hath seen the Son hath seen the Father, and so they are recorded to
   have known God, and to have heard God's words worthily, and, therefore,
   to have seen God and heard Him.  Now, I consider that those who are
   fully and really sons of Abraham are sons of his actions, spiritually
   understood, and of the knowledge which was made manifest to him.  What
   he knew and what he did appears again in those who are his sons, as the
   Scripture teaches those who have ears to hear, [4818] "If ye were the
   children of Abraham, ye would do the works of Abraham."  And if it is a
   true proverb [4819] which says, "A wise man will understand that which
   proceeds from his own mouth, and on his lips he will bear prudence,"
   then we must at once repudiate some things which have been said about
   the prophets, as if they were not wise men, and did not understand what
   proceeded from their own mouths.  We must believe what is good and true
   about the prophets, that they were sages, that they did understand what
   proceeded from their mouths, and that they bore prudence on their
   lips.  It is clear indeed that Moses understood in his mind the truth
   (real meaning) of the law, and the higher interpretations of the
   stories recorded in his books.  Joshua, too, understood the meaning of
   the allotment of the land after the destruction of the nine and twenty
   kings, and could see better than we can the realities of which his
   achievements were the shadows.  It is clear, too, that Isaiah saw the
   mystery of Him who sat upon the throne, and of the two seraphim, and of
   the veiling of their faces and their feet, and of their wings, and of
   the altar and of the tongs.  Ezekiel, too, understood the true
   significance of the cherubim and of their goings, and of the firmament
   that was above them, and of Him that sat on the throne, than all which
   what could be loftier or more splendid?  I need not enter into more
   particulars; the point I aim at establishing is clear enough already,
   namely, that those who were made perfect in earlier generations knew
   not less than the Apostles did of what Christ revealed to them, since
   the same teacher was with them as He who revealed to the Apostles the
   unspeakable mysteries of godliness.  I will add but a few points, and
   then leave it to the reader to judge and to form what views he pleases
   on this subject.  Paul says in his Epistle to the Romans, [4820] "Now,
   to him who is able to establish you according to my Gospel, according
   to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence
   through times eternal, but is now made manifest by the prophetic
   Scriptures and the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ."  For if the
   mystery concealed of old is made manifest to the Apostles through the
   prophetic writings, and if the prophets, being wise men, understood
   what proceeded from their own mouths, then the prophets knew what was
   made manifest to the Apostles.  But to many it was not revealed, as
   Paul says, [4821] "In other generations it was not made known to the
   sons of men as it hath now been revealed unto His holy Apostles and
   prophets by the Spirit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs and members
   of the same body."  Here an objection may be raised by those who do not
   share the view we have propounded; and it becomes of importance to
   define what is meant by the word "revealed."  It is capable of two
   meanings:  firstly, that the thing in question is understood, but
   secondly, if a prophecy is spoken of, that it is accomplished.  Now,
   the fact that the Gentiles were to be fellow-heirs and members of the
   same body, and partakers of the promise, was known to the prophets to
   this extent, that they knew the Gentiles were to fellow-heirs and
   members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ.  When
   this should be, and why, and what Gentiles were spoken of, and how,
   though strangers from the covenants, and aliens to the promises, they
   were yet to be members of one body and sharers of the blessings; all
   this was known to the prophets, being revealed to them.  But the things
   prophesied belong to the future, and are not revealed to those who know
   them, but do not witness their fulfilment, as they are to those who
   have the event before their eyes.  And this was the position of the
   Apostles.  Thus, I conceive, they knew the events no more than the
   fathers and the prophets did; and yet it is truly said of them that
   "what to other generations was not revealed was now revealed to the
   Apostles and prophets, that the Gentiles were fellow-heirs and members
   of the same body, and partakers in the promise of Christ."  For, in
   addition to knowing these mysteries, they saw the power at work in the
   accomplished fact.  The passage, "Many prophets and righteous men
   desired to see the things ye see and did not see them; and to hear the
   things ye hear and did not hear them," may be interpreted in the same
   way.  They also desired to see the mystery of the incarnation of the
   Son of God, and of His coming down to carry out the design of His
   suffering for the salvation of many, actually put in operation.  This
   may be illustrated from another quarter.  Suppose one of the Apostles
   to have understood the "unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a
   man to utter," [4822] but not to witness the glorious bodily appearing
   of Jesus to the faithful. which is promised, although He desired to see
   it and suppose another had not only not [4823] marked and seen what
   that Apostle marked and saw, but had a much feebler grasp of the divine
   hope, and yet is present at the second coming of our Saviour, which the
   Apostle, as in the parallel above, had desired, but had not seen.  We
   shall not err from the truth if we say that both of these have seen
   what the Apostle, or indeed the Apostles, desired to see, and yet that
   they are not on that account to be deemed wiser or more blessed than
   the Apostles.  In the same way, also, the Apostles are not to be deemed
   wiser than the fathers, or than Moses and the prophets, than those in
   fact who, for their virtue, were found worthy of epiphanies and of
   divine manifestations and of revelations of mysteries.

   3.  "Grace and Truth Came Through Jesus Christ."  These Words Belong to
   the Baptist, Not the Evangelist.  What the Baptist Testifies by Them.

   We have lingered rather long over these discussions, but there is a
   reason for it.  There are many who, under the pretence of glorifying
   the advent of Christ, declare the Apostles to be wiser than the fathers
   or the prophets; and of these teachers some have invented a greater God
   for the later period, while some, not venturing so far, but moved,
   according to their own account of the matter, by the difficulty
   connected with doctrine, cancel the whole of the gift conferred by God
   on the fathers and the prophets, through Christ, through whom all
   things were made.  If all things were made through Him, clearly so must
   the splendid revelations have been which were made to the fathers and
   prophets, and became to them the symbols of the sacred mysteries of
   religion.  Now the true soldiers of Christ must always be prepared to
   do battle for the truth, and must never, so far as lies with them,
   allow false convictions to creep in.  We must not, therefore, neglect
   this matter.  It may be said that John's earlier testimony to Christ is
   to be found in the words, "He who cometh after me exists before me, for
   He was before me," and that the words, "For of His fulness we all
   received, and grace for grace," are in the mouth of John the disciple.
   Now, we must show this exposition to be a forced one, and one which
   does violence to the context; it is rather a strong proceeding to
   suppose the speech of the Baptist to be so suddenly and, as it were,
   inopportunely interrupted by that of the disciple, and it is quite
   apparent to any one who can judge, in whatever small degree, of a
   context, that the speech goes on continuously after the words, "This is
   He of whom I spoke, He that cometh after me exists before me, for He
   was before me."  The Baptist brings a proof that Jesus existed before
   him because He was before him, since He is the first-born of all
   creation; he says, "For of His fulness all we received."  That is the
   reason why he says, "He exists before me, for He was before me."  That
   is how I know that He is first and in higher honour with the Father,
   since of His fulness both I and the prophets before me received the
   more divine prophetic grace instead of the grace we received at His
   hands before in respect of our election.  That is why I say, "He exists
   before me, for He was before me," because we know what we have received
   from His fulness; namely, that the law was given through Moses, not by
   Moses, while grace and truth not only were given but came into
   existence [4824] through Jesus Christ.  For His God and Father both
   gave the law through Moses, and made grace and truth through Jesus
   Christ, that grace and truth which came to man.  If we give a
   reasonable interpretation to the words, "Grace and truth came through
   Jesus Christ," we shall not be alarmed at the possible discrepancy with
   them of that other saying, "I am the way and the truth and the life."
   If it is Jesus who says, "I am the truth," then how does the truth come
   through Jesus Christ, since no one comes into existence through
   himself?  We must recognize that this very truth, the essential truth,
   which is prototypal, so to speak, of that truth which exists in souls
   endowed with reason, that truth from which, as it were, images are
   impressed on those who care for truth, was not made through Jesus
   Christ, nor indeed through any one, but by God;--just as the Word was
   not made through any one which was in the beginning with the
   Father;--and as wisdom which God created the beginning of His ways was
   not made through any one, so the truth also was not made through any
   one.  That truth, however, which is with men came through Jesus Christ,
   as the truth in Paul and the Apostles came through Jesus Christ.  And
   it is no wonder, since truth is one, that many truths should flow from
   that one.  The prophet David certainly knew many truths, as he says,
   [4825] "The Lord searcheth out truths," for the Father of truth
   searches out not the one truth but the many through which those are
   saved who possess them.  And as with the one truth and many truths, so
   also with righteousness and righteousnesses.  For the very essential
   righteousness is Christ, "Who was made to us of God wisdom and
   righteousness and sanctification and redemption."  But from that
   righteousness is formed the righteousness which is in each individual,
   so that there are in the saved many righteousnesses, whence also it is
   written, [4826] "For the Lord is righteous, and He loved
   righteousnesses."  This is the reading in the exact copies, and in the
   other versions besides the Septuagint, and in the Hebrew.  Consider if
   the other things which Christ is said to be in a unity admit of being
   multiplied in the same way and spoken of in the plural.  For example,
   Christ is our life as the Saviour Himself says, [4827] "I am the way
   and the truth and the life."  The Apostle, too, says, [4828] "When
   Christ our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in
   glory."  And in the Psalms again we find, [4829] "Thy mercy is better
   than life;" for it is on account of Christ who is life in every one
   that there are many lives.  This, perhaps, is also the key to the
   passage, [4830] "If ye seek a proof of the Christ that speaketh in
   me."  For Christ is found in every saint, and so from the one Christ
   there come to be many Christs, imitators of Him and formed after Him
   who is the image of God; whence God says through the prophet, [4831]
   "Touch not my Christs."  Thus we have explained in passing the passage
   which we appeared to have omitted from our exposition, viz.:  "Grace
   and truth came through Jesus Christ;" and we have also shown that the
   words belong to John the Baptist and form part of his testimony to the
   Son of God.

   4.  John Denies that He is Elijah or "The" Prophet.  Yet He Was "A"
   Prophet.

   Now let us consider John's second testimony.  Jews from Jerusalem,
   [4832] kindred to John the Baptist, since he also belonged to a
   priestly race, send priests and levites to ask John who he is.  In
   saying, "I am not the Christ," he made a confession of the truth.  The
   words are not, as one might suppose, a negation; for it is no negation
   to say, in the honour of Christ, that one is not Christ.  The priests
   and levites sent from Jerusalem, having there heard in the first place
   that he is not the expected Messiah, put a question about the second
   great personage whom they expected, namely, Elijah, whether John were
   he, and he says he is not Elijah, and by his "I am not" makes a second
   confession of the truth.  And, as many prophets had appeared in Israel,
   and one in particular was looked for according to the prophecy of
   Moses, who said, [4833] "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to
   you of your brethren, like unto me, him shall ye hear; and it shall
   come to pass that every soul that shall not hear that prophet shall be
   destroyed from among the people," they, therefore, ask a third
   question, not whether he is a prophet, but whether he is the prophet.
   Now, they did not apply this name to the Christ, but supposed the
   prophet to be a second figure beside the Christ.  But John, on the
   contrary, who knew that He whose forerunner he was was both the Christ
   and the prophet thus foretold, answered "No;" whereas, if they had
   asked if he was a prophet, he would have answered "Yes;" [4834] for he
   was not unconscious that he was a prophet.  In all these answers John's
   second testimony to Christ was not yet completed; he had still to give
   his questioners the answer they were to take back to those who sent
   them, and to declare himself in the terms of the prophecy of Isaiah,
   which says, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
   way of the Lord."

   5.  There Were Two Embassies to John the Baptist; The Different
   Characters of These.

   Here the enquiry suggests itself whether the second testimony is
   concluded, and whether there is a third, addressed to those who were
   sent from the Pharisees.  They wished to know why he baptized, if he
   was neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet; and he said:
   [4835]   "I baptize with water; but there standeth one among you whom
   you know not, He that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am
   not worthy to unloose."  Is this a third testimony, or is this which
   they were to report to the Pharisees a part of the second?  As far as
   the words allow me to conjecture I should say that the word to the
   emissaries of the Pharisees was a third testimony.  It is to be
   observed, however, that the first testimony asserts the divinity of the
   Saviour, while the second disposes of the suspicion of those who were
   in doubt whether John could be the Christ, and the third declares one
   who was already present with men although they saw Him not, and whose
   coming was no longer in the future.  Before going on to the subsequent
   testimonies in which he points out Christ and witnesses to Him, let us
   look at the second and third, word for word, and let us, in the first
   place, observe that there are two embassies to the Baptist, one "from
   Jerusalem" from the Jews, who send priests and levites, to ask him,
   "Who art thou?" the second sent by the Pharisees, [4836] who were in
   doubt about the answer which had been made to the priests and levites.
   Observe how what is said by the first envoys is in keeping with the
   character of priests and levites, and shows gentleness and a
   willingness to learn.  "Who art thou?" they say, and "What then? art
   thou Elijah?" and "Art thou that prophet?" and then, "Who art thou,
   that we may give an answer to them that sent us?  What sayest thou of
   thyself?"  There is nothing harsh or arrogant in the enquiries of these
   men; everything agrees well with the character of true and careful
   servants of God; and they raise no difficulties about the replies made
   to them.  Those, on the contrary, who are sent from the Pharisees
   assail the Baptist, as it were, with arrogant and unsympathetic words:
   "Why then baptizest thou if thou be not the Christ nor Elijah nor the
   prophet?"  This mission is sent scarcely for the sake of information,
   as in the former case of the priests and levites, but rather to debar
   the Baptist from baptizing, as if it were thought that no one was
   entitled to baptize but Christ and Elijah and the prophet.  The student
   who desires to understand the Scripture must always proceed in this
   careful way; he must ask with regard to each speech, who is the speaker
   and on what occasion it was spoken.  Thus only can we discern how
   speech harmonizes with the character of the speaker, as it does all
   through the sacred books.

   6.  Messianic Discussion with John the Baptist.

   Then the Jews sent priests and levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who
   art thou?  And he confessed and denied not; and he confessed, I am not
   the Christ. [4837]   What legates should have been sent from the Jews
   to John, and where should they have been sent from?  Should they not
   have been men held to stand by the election of God above their fellows,
   and should they not have come from that place which was chosen out of
   the whole of the earth, though it is all called good, from Jerusalem
   where was the temple of God?  With such honour, then, do they enquire
   of John.  In the case of Christ nothing of this sort is reported to
   have been done by the Jews; but what the Jews do to John, John does to
   Christ, sending his own disciples to ask him, [4838] "Art thou He that
   should come, or do we look for another?"  John confesses to those sent
   to him, and denies not, and he afterwards declares, "I am the voice of
   one crying in the wilderness;" but Christ, as having a greater
   testimony than John the Baptist, makes His answer by words and deeds,
   saying, "Go and tell John those things which ye do hear and see; the
   blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed
   and the deaf hear, and the poor have the Gospel preached to them."  On
   this passage I shall, if God permit, enlarge in its proper place.
   Here, however, it might be asked reasonably enough why John gives such
   an answer to the question put to him.  The priests and levites do not
   ask him, "Art thou the Christ?" but "Who art thou?" and the Baptist's
   reply to this question should have been, "I am the voice of one crying
   in the wilderness."  The proper reply to the question, "Art thou the
   Christ?" is, "I am not the Christ;" and to the question, "Who art
   thou?"--"The voice of one crying in the wilderness."  To this we may
   say that he probably discerned in the question of the priests and
   levites a cautious reverence, which led them to hint the idea in their
   minds that he who was baptizing might be the Christ, but withheld them
   from openly saying so, which might have been presumptuous.  He quite
   naturally, therefore, proceeds in the first place to remove any false
   impressions they might have taken up about him, and declares publicly
   the true state of the matter, "I am not the Christ."  Their second
   question, and also their third, show that they had conceived some such
   surmise about him.  They supposed that he might be that second in
   honour to whom their hopes pointed, namely, Elijah, who held with them
   the next position after Christ; and so when John had answered, "I am
   not the Christ," they asked, "What then?  Art thou Elijah?"  And he
   said, "I am not."  They wish to know, in the third place, if he is the
   prophet, and on his answer, "No," they have no longer any name to give
   the personage whose advent they expected, and they say, "Who art thou,
   then, that we may give an answer to them that sent us.  What sayest
   thou of thyself?"  Their meaning is:  "You are not, you say, any of
   those personages whose advent Israel hopes and expects, and who you
   are, to baptize as you do, we do not know; tell us, therefore, so that
   we may report to those who sent us to get light upon this point."  We
   add, as it has some bearing on the context, that the people were moved
   by the thought that the period of Christ's advent was near.  It was in
   a manner imminent in the years from the birth of Jesus and a little
   before, down to the publication of the preaching.  Hence it was, in all
   likelihood, that as the scribes and lawyers had deduced the time from
   Holy Scripture and were expecting the Coming One, the idea was taken up
   by Theudas, who came forward as the Messiah and brought together a
   considerable multitude, and after him by the famous Judas of Galilee in
   the days of the taxing. [4839]   Thus the coming of the Messiah was
   more warmly expected and discussed, and it was natural enough for the
   Jews to send priests and levites from Jerusalem to John, to ask him,
   "Who art thou?" and learn if he professed to be the Christ.

   7.  Of the Birth of John, and of His Alleged Identity with Elijah.  Of
   the Doctrine of Transcorporation.

   "And [4840] they asked him, What then?  Art thou Elijah? and he said, I
   am not."  No one can fail to remember in this connection what Jesus
   says of John, [4841] "If ye will receive it, this is Elijah which is to
   come."  How, then, does John come to say to those who ask him, "Art
   thou Elijah?"--"I am not."  And how can it be true at the same time
   that John is Elijah who is to come, according to the words of Malachi,
   [4842] "And behold I send unto you Elijah the Tishbite, before the
   great and notable day of the Lord come, who shall restore the heart of
   the father to the son, and the heart of a man to his neighbour, lest I
   come, and utterly smite the earth."  The words of the angel of the
   Lord, too, who appeared to Zacharias, as he stood at the right hand of
   the altar of incense, are somewhat to the same effect as the prophecy
   of Malachi:  "And [4843] thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and
   thou shalt call his name John."  And a little further on: [4844]   "And
   he shall go before His face in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn
   the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the
   wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for
   Him."  As for the first point, one might say that John did not know
   that he was Elijah.  This will be the explanation of those who find in
   our passage a support for their doctrine of transcorporation, as if the
   soul clothed itself in a fresh body and did not quite remember its
   former lives.  These thinkers will also point out that some of the Jews
   assented to this doctrine when they spoke about the Saviour as if He
   was one of the old prophets, and had risen not from the tomb but from
   His birth.  His mother Mary was well known, and Joseph the carpenter
   was supposed to be His father, and it could readily be supposed that He
   was one of the old prophets risen from the dead.  The same person will
   adduce the text in Genesis, [4845] "I will destroy the whole
   resurrection," and will thereby reduce those who give themselves to
   finding in Scripture solutions of false probabilities to a great
   difficulty in respect of this doctrine.  Another, however, a churchman,
   who repudiates the doctrine of transcorporation as a false one, and
   does not admit that the soul of John ever was Elijah, may appeal to the
   above-quoted words of the angel, and point out that it is not the soul
   of Elijah that is spoken of at John's birth, but the spirit and power
   of Elijah.  "He shall go before him," it is said, "in the spirit and
   power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children."
   Now it can be shown from thousands of texts that the spirit is a
   different thing from the soul, and that what is called the power is a
   different thing from both the soul and the spirit.  On these points I
   cannot now enlarge; this work must not be unduly expanded.  To
   establish the fact that power is different from spirit, it will be
   enough to cite the text, [4846] "The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee,
   and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee."  As for the
   spirits of the prophets, these are given to them by God, and are spoken
   of as being in a manner their property (slaves), as "The spirits of the
   prophets are subject to the prophets," [4847] and "The spirit of Elijah
   rested upon Elisha." [4848]   Thus, it is said, there is nothing absurd
   in supposing that John, "in the spirit and power of Elijah," turned the
   hearts of the fathers to the children, and that it was on account of
   this spirit that he was called "Elijah who was to come."  And to
   reinforce this view it may be argued that if the God of the universe
   identified Himself with His saints to such an extent as to be called
   the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, much more
   might the Holy Spirit so identify Himself with the prophets as to be
   called their spirit, so that when the spirit is spoken of it might be
   the spirit of Elijah or the spirit of Isaiah.  Our churchman, to go on
   with his views, may further say that those who supposed Jesus to be one
   of the prophets risen from the dead were probably misled, partly by the
   doctrine above mentioned, and partly by supposing Him to be one of the
   prophets, and that as for this misconception that He was one of the
   prophets, these persons probably fell into their error from not knowing
   about Jesus' supposed father and actual mother, and considering that He
   had risen from the tombs.  As for the text in Genesis about the
   resurrection, the churchman will rejoin with a text to an opposite
   effect, "God hath raised up for me another seed in place of Abel whom
   Cain slew;" [4849] showing that the resurrection occurs in Genesis.  As
   for the first difficulty which was raised, our churchman will meet the
   view of the believers in transcorporation by saying that John is no
   doubt, in a certain sense, as he has already shown, Elijah who is to
   come; and that the reason why he met the enquiry of the priests and
   levites with "I am not," was that he divined the object they had in
   view in making it.  For the enquiry laid before John by the priests and
   levites was not intended to bring out whether the same spirit was in
   both, but whether John was that very Elijah who was taken up, and who
   now appeared according to the expectation of the Jews without being
   born (for the emissaries, perhaps, did not know about John's birth);
   and to such all enquiry he naturally answered, "I am not;" for he who
   was called John was not Elijah who was taken up, and had not changed
   his body for his present appearance.  Our first scholar, whose view of
   transcorporation we have seen based upon our passage, may go on with a
   close examination of the text, and urge against his antagonist, that if
   John was the son of such a man as the priest Zacharias, and if he was
   born when his parents were both aged, contrary to all human
   expectation, then it is not likely that so many Jews at Jerusalem would
   be so ignorant about him, or that the priests and levites whom they
   sent would not be acquainted with the facts of his birth.  Does not
   Luke declare [4850] that "fear came upon all those who lived round
   about,"--clearly round about Zacharias and Elisabeth--and that "all
   these things were noised abroad throughout the whole hill country of
   Judæa"?  And if John's birth from Zacharias was a matter of common
   knowledge, and the Jews of Jerusalem yet sent priests and levites to
   ask, "Art thou Elijah?" then it is clear that in saying this they
   assumed the doctrine of transcorporation to be true, and that it was a
   current doctrine of their country, and not foreign to their secret
   teaching.  John therefore says, I am not Elijah, because he does not
   know about his own former life.  These thinkers, accordingly, entertain
   an opinion which is by no means to be despised.  Our churchman,
   however, may return to the charge, and ask if it is worthy of a
   prophet, who is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, who is predicted by
   Isaiah, and whose birth was foretold before it took place by so great
   an angel, one who has received of the fulness of Christ, who shares in
   such a grace, who knows truth to have come through Jesus Christ, and
   has taught such deep things about God and about the only-begotten, who
   is in the bosom of the Father, is it worthy of such a one to lie, or
   even to hesitate, out of ignorance of what he was.  For with respect to
   what was obscure, he ought to have refrained from confessing, and to
   have neither affirmed nor denied the proposition put before him.  If
   the doctrine in question really was widely current, ought not John to
   have hesitated to pronounce upon it, lest his soul had actually been in
   Elijah?  And here our churchman will appeal to history, and will bid
   his antagonists ask experts of the secret doctrines of the Hebrews, if
   they do really entertain such a belief.  For if it should appear that
   they do not, then the argument based on that supposition is shown to be
   quite baseless.  Our churchman, however, is still free to have recourse
   to the solution given before, and to insist that attention be paid to
   the meaning with which the question was put.  For if, as I showed, the
   senders knew John to be the child of Zacharias and Elisabeth, and if
   the messengers still more, being men of priestly race, could not
   possibly be ignorant of the remarkable manner in which their kinsman
   Zacharias had received his son, then what could be the meaning of their
   question, "Art thou Elijah?"  Had they not read that Elijah had been
   taken up into heaven, and did they not expect him to appear?  Then, as
   they expect Elijah to come at the consummation before Christ, and
   Christ to follow him, perhaps their question was meant less in a
   literal than in a tropical sense:  Are you he who announces beforehand
   the word which is to come before Christ, at the consummation?  To this
   he very properly answers, "I am not."  The adversary, however, tries to
   show that the priests could not be ignorant that the birth of John had
   taken place in so remarkable a manner, because "all these things had
   been much spoken of in the hill country of Judæa;" and the churchman
   has to meet this.  He does so by showing that a similar mistake was
   widely current about the Saviour Himself; for "some said that He was
   John the Baptist, others Elijah, others Jeremiah or one of the
   prophets." [4851]   So the disciples told the Lord when He was in the
   parts of Cæsarea Philippi, and questioned them on that subject.  And
   Herod, too, said, [4852] "John whom I beheaded, he is risen from the
   dead;" so that he appears not to have known what was said about Christ,
   as reported in the Gospel, [4853] "Is not this the son of the
   carpenter, is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James, and
   Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?  And His sisters, are they not all with
   us?"  Thus in the case of the Saviour, while many knew of His birth
   from Mary, others were under a mistake about Him; and so in the case of
   John, there is no wonder if, while some knew of his birth from
   Zacharias, others were in doubt whether the expected Elijah had
   appeared in him or not.  There was not more room for doubt about John,
   whether he was Elijah, than about the Saviour, whether He was John.  Of
   the two, the question of the outward form of Elijah could be disposed
   of from the words of Scripture, though not from actual observation, for
   we read, [4854] "He was a hairy man, and girt with a leather girdle
   about his loins."  John's outward appearance, on the contrary, was well
   known, and was not like that of Jesus; and yet there were those who
   surmised that John had risen from the dead, and taken the name of
   Jesus.  As for the change of name, a thing which reminds us of
   mysteries, I do not know how the Hebrews came to tell about Phinehas,
   son of Eleazar, who admittedly prolonged his life to the time of many
   of the judges, as we read in the Book of Judges, [4855] to tell about
   him what I now mention.  They say that he was Elijah, because he had
   been promised immortality (in Numbers [4856] ), on account of the
   covenant of peace granted to him because he was jealous with a divine
   jealousy, and in a passion of anger pierced the Midianitish woman and
   the Israelite, and stayed the wrath of God as it is called, as it is
   written, "Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, hath turned
   my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with
   my jealousy among them."  No wonder, then, if those who conceived
   Phinehas and Elijah to be the same person, whether they judged soundly
   in this or not, for that is not now the question, considered John and
   Jesus also to be the same.  This, then, they doubted, and desired to
   know if John and Elijah were the same.  At another time than this, the
   point would certainly call for a careful enquiry, and the argument
   would have to be well weighed as to the essence of the soul, as to the
   principle of her composition, and as to her entering into this body of
   earth.  We should also have to enquire into the distributions of the
   life of each soul, and as to her departure from this life, and whether
   it is possible for her to enter into a second life in a body or not,
   and whether that takes place at the same period, and after the same
   arrangement in each case, or not; and whether she enters the same body,
   or a different one, and if the same, whether the subject remains the
   same while the qualities are changed, or if both subject and qualities
   remain the same, and if the soul will always make use of the same body
   or will change it.  Along with these questions, it would also be
   necessary to ask what transcorporation is, and how it differs from
   incorporation, and if he who holds transcorporation must necessarily
   hold the world to be eternal.  The views of these scholars must also be
   taken into account, who consider that, according to the Scriptures, the
   soul is sown along with the body, and the consequences of such a view
   must also be looked at.  In fact the subject of the soul is a wide one,
   and hard to be unravelled, and it has to be picked out of scattered
   expressions of Scripture.  It requires, therefore, separate treatment.
   The brief consideration we have been led to give to the problem in
   connection with Elijah and John may now suffice; we go on to what
   follows in the Gospel.

   8.  John is a Prophet, But Not the Prophet.

   "Art thou that prophet?  And he answered No." [4857]   If the law and
   the prophets were until John, [4858] what can we say that John was but
   a prophet?  His father Zacharias, indeed, says, filled with the Holy
   Ghost and prophesying, [4859] "And thou, child, shalt be called the
   prophet of the Highest, for thou shalt go before the Lord to prepare
   His ways."  (One might indeed get past this passage by laying stress on
   the word called:  he is to be called, he is not said to be, a
   prophet.)  And still more weighty is it that the Saviour said to those
   who considered John to be a prophet, [4860] "But what went ye out to
   see?  A prophet?  Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet."  The
   words, Yea, I say unto you, manifestly affirm that John is a prophet,
   and that is nowhere denied afterwards.  If, then, he is said by the
   Saviour to be not only a prophet but "more than a prophet," how is it
   that when the priests and levites come and ask him, "Art thou the
   Prophet?" he answers No!  On this we must remark that it is not the
   same thing to say, "Art thou the Prophet?" and "Art thou a prophet?"
   The distinction between the two expressions has already been observed,
   when we asked what was the difference between the God and God, and
   between the Logos and Logos. [4861]   Now it is written in Deuteronomy,
   [4862] "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like me;
   Him shall ye hear, and it shall be that every soul that will not hear
   that prophet shall be cut off from among His people."  There was,
   therefore, an expectation of one particular prophet having a
   resemblance to Moses in mediating between God and the people and
   receiving a new covenant from God to give to those who accepted his
   teaching; and in the case of each of the prophets, the people of Israel
   recognized that he was not the person of whom Moses spoke.  As, then,
   they doubted about John, whether he were not the Christ, [4863] so they
   doubted whether he could not be the prophet.  And there is no wonder
   that those who doubted about John whether he were the Christ, did not
   understand that the Christ and the prophet are the same person; their
   doubt as to John necessarily implied that they were not clear on this
   point.  Now the difference between "the prophet" and "a prophet" has
   escaped the observation of most students; this is the case with
   Heracleon, who says, in these very words:  "As, then, John confessed
   that he was not the Christ, and not even a prophet, nor Elijah."  If he
   interpreted the words before us in such a way, he ought to have
   examined the various passages to see whether in saying that he is not a
   prophet nor Elijah he is or is not saying what is true.  He devotes no
   attention, however, to these passages, and in his remaining
   commentaries he passes over such points without any enquiry.  In the
   sequel, too, his remarks, of which we shall have to speak directly, are
   very scanty, and do not testify to careful study.

   10.  Of the Voice John the Baptist is.

   "He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness:  Make
   straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet."  As He who
   is peculiarly the Son of God, being no other than the Logos, yet makes
   use of Logos (reason)--for He was the Logos in the beginning, and was
   with God, the Logos of God--so John, the servant of that Logos, being,
   if we take the Scripture to mean what it says, no other than a voice,
   yet uses his voice to point to the Logos.  He, then, understanding in
   this way the prophecy about himself spoken by Isaiah the prophet, says
   he is a voice, not crying in the wilderness, but "of one crying in the
   wilderness," of Him, namely, who stood and cried, [4864] "If any man
   thirst, let him come unto Me and drink."  He it was, too, who said,
   [4865] "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.  Every
   valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought
   low; and all the crooked shall be made straight."  For as we read in
   Exodus that God said to Moses, [4866] "Behold I have given thee for a
   God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet;" so we are
   to understand--the cases are at least analogous if not altogether
   similar--it is with the Word in the beginning, who is God, and with
   John.  For John's voice points to that word and demonstrates it.  It is
   therefore a very appropriate punishment that falls on Zacharias on his
   saying to the angel, [4867] "Whereby shall I know this?  For I am an
   old man and my wife well stricken in years."  For his want of faith
   with regard to the birth of the voice, he is himself deprived of his
   voice, as the angel Gabriel says to him, "Behold, thou shalt be silent
   and not able to speak until the day that these things shall come to
   pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled
   in their season."  And afterwards when he had "asked for a writing
   tablet and written, His name is John; and they all marvelled," he
   recovered his voice; for "his mouth was opened immediately and his
   tongue, and he spake, blessing God."  We discussed above how it is to
   be understood that the Logos is the Son of God, and went over the ideas
   connected with that; and a similar sequence of ideas is to be observed
   at this point.  John came for a witness; he was a man sent from God to
   bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe; he
   was that voice, then, we are to understand, which alone was fitted
   worthily to announce the Logos.  We shall understand this aright if we
   call to mind what was adduced in our exposition of the texts:  "That
   all might believe through Him," and "This is he of whom it is written,
   Behold I send My messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way
   before thee." [4868]   There is fitness, too, in his being said to be
   the voice, not of one saying in the wilderness, but of one crying in
   the wilderness.  He who cries, "Prepare ye the way of the Lord," also
   says it; but he might say it without crying it.  But he cries and
   shouts it, that even those may hear who are at a distance from the
   speaker, and that even the deaf may understand the greatness of the
   tidings, since it is announced in a great voice; and he thus brings
   help, both to those who have departed from God and to those who have
   lost the acuteness of their hearing.  This, too, was the reason why
   "Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me
   and drink."  Hence, too, [4869] "John beareth witness of Him, and
   cried, saying," "Hence also God commands Isaiah to cry, with the voice
   of one saying, Cry.  And I said, What shall I cry?"  The physical voice
   we use in prayer need not be great nor startling; even should we not
   lift up any great cry or shout, God will yet hear us.  He says to
   Moses, [4870] "Why criest thou unto Me?" when Moses had not cried
   audibly at all.  It is not recorded in Exodus that he did so; but Moses
   had cried mightily to God in prayer with that voice which is heard by
   God alone.  Hence David also says, [4871] "With my voice I cried unto
   the Lord, and He heard me."  And one who cries in the desert has need
   of a voice, that the soul which is deprived of God and deserted of
   truth--and what more dreadful desert is there than a soul deserted of
   God and of all virtue, since it still goes crookedly and needs
   instruction--may be exhorted to make straight the way of the Lord.  And
   that way is made straight by the man who, far from copying the
   serpent's crooked journey; while he who is of the contrary disposition
   perverts his way.  Hence the rebuke directed to a man of this kind and
   to all who resemble him, "Why pervert ye the right ways of the Lord?"

   11.  Of the Way of the Lord, How It is Narrow, and How Jesus is the
   Way.

   Now the way of the Lord is made straight in two fashions.  First, in
   the way of contemplation, when thought is made clear in truth without
   any mixture of falsehood; and then in the way of conduct, after the
   sound contemplation of what ought to be done, when action is produced
   which harmonizes with sound theory of conduct.  And that we may the
   more clearly understand the text, "Make straight the way of the Lord,"
   it will be well to compare with it what is said in the Proverbs, [4873]
   "Depart not, either to the right hand or to the left."  For he who
   deviates in either direction has given up keeping his path straight,
   and is no longer worthy of regard, since he has gone apart from the
   straightness of the journey, for "the Lord [4874] is righteous, and
   loves righteousness, and His face beholds straightness."  Hence he who
   is the object of regard, and receives the benefit that comes from this
   oversight, says, [4875] "The light of Thy countenance was shown upon
   us, O Lord."  Let us stand, then, as Jeremiah [4876] exhorts, upon the
   ways, and let us see and ask after the ancient ways of the Lord, and
   let us see which is the good way, and walk in it.  Thus did the
   Apostles stand and ask for the ancient ways of the Lord; they asked the
   Patriarchs and the Prophets, enquiring into their writings, and when
   they came to understand these writings they saw the good way, namely,
   Jesus Christ, who said, "I am the way," and they walked in it.  For it
   is a good way that leads the good man to the good father, the man who,
   from the good treasure of his heart, brings forth good things, and who
   is a good and faithful servant.  This way is narrow, indeed, for the
   many cannot bear to walk in it and are lovers of their flesh; but it is
   also hard-pressed [4877] by those who use violence [4878] to walk in
   it, for it is not called afflicting, but afflicted. [4879]   For that
   way which is a living way, and feels the qualities of those who tread
   it, is pressed and afflicted, when he travels on it who has not taken
   off his shoes from off his feet, [4880] nor truly realized that the
   place on which he stands. or indeed treads, is holy ground.  And it
   will lead to Him who is the life, and who says, "I am the life."  For
   the Saviour, in whom all virtues are combined, has many aspects.  To
   him who, though by no means near the end, is yet advancing, He is the
   way; to him who has put off all that is dead He is the life.  He who
   travels on this way is told to take nothing with him on it, since it
   provides bread and all that is necessary for life, enemies are
   powerless on it, and he needs no staff, and since it is holy, he needs
   no shoes.

   12.  Heracleon's View of the Voice, and of John the Baptist.

   The words, however, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,"
   etc., may be taken as equivalent to "I am He of whom the voice in the
   wilderness' is written."  Then John would be the person crying, and his
   voice would be that crying in the wilderness, "Make straight the way of
   the Lord."  Heracleon, discussing John and the prophets, says, somewhat
   slanderously, that "the Word is the Saviour; the voice, that in the
   wilderness which John interpreted; the sound is the whole prophetic
   order."  To this we may reply by reminding him of the text, [4881] "If
   the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the
   battle," and that which says that though a man have knowledge of
   mysteries, or have prophecy but wants love, he is a sounding or a
   tinkling cymbal. [4882]   If the prophetic voice be nothing but sound,
   how does our Lord come to refer us to it as where He says, [4883]
   "Search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life,
   and these are they which bear witness," and [4884] "If ye believed
   Moses, ye would believe Me," and [4885] "Well did Isaiah prophesy
   concerning you, saying, This people honours me with their lips"?  I do
   not know if any one can reasonably admit that the Saviour thus spoke in
   praise of an uncertain sound, or that there is any preparation to be
   had from the Scriptures to which we are referred as from the voice of a
   trumpet, for our war against opposing powers, should their sound give
   an uncertain voice.  If the prophets had not love, and if that is why
   they were sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal, then how does the Lord
   send us to their sound, as these writers will have it, as if we could
   get help from that?  He asserts, indeed, that a voice, when well fitted
   to speech, becomes speech, as if one should say that a woman is turned
   into a man; and the assertion is not supported by argument.  And, as if
   he were in a position to put forth a dogma on the subject and to get on
   in this way, he declares that sound can be changed in a similar way
   into voice, and the voice, which is changed into speech, he says, is in
   the position of a disciple, while sound passing into voice is in that
   of a slave.  If he had taken any kind of trouble to establish these
   points we should have had to devote some attention to refuting them;
   but as it is, the bare denial is sufficient refutation.  There was a
   point some way back which we deferred taking up, that, namely, of the
   motive of John's speeches.  We may now take it up.  The Saviour,
   according to Heracleon, calls him both a prophet and Elijah, but he
   himself denies that he is either of these.  When the Saviour, Heracleon
   says, calls him a prophet and Elijah, He is speaking not of John
   himself, but of his surroundings; but when He calls him greater than
   the prophets and than those who are born of women, then He is
   describing the character of John himself.  When John, on the other
   hand, is asked about himself, his answers relate to himself, not to his
   surroundings.  This we have examined as carefully as possible,
   comparing each of the terms in question with the statements of
   Heracleon, lest he should not have expressed himself quite accurately.
   For how it comes that the statements that he is Elijah and that he is a
   prophet apply to those about him, but the statement that he is the
   voice of one crying in the wilderness, to himself, no attempt whatever
   is made to show.  Heracleon only gives an illustration, namely, this:
   His surroundings were, so to speak, his clothes, and other than
   himself, and when he was asked about his clothes, if he were his
   clothes, he could not answer "Yes."  Now that his being Elijah, who was
   to come, was his clothes, is scarcely consistent, so far as I can see,
   with Heracleon's views; it might consist, perhaps, with the exposition
   we ourselves gave of the words, "In the spirit and power of Elijah;" it
   might, in a sense, be said that this spirit of Elijah is equivalent to
   the soul of John.  He then goes on to try to determine why those who
   were sent by the Jews to question John were priests and levites, and he
   answers by no means badly, that it was incumbent on such persons, being
   devoted to the service of God, to busy themselves and to make enquiries
   about such matters.  When he goes on, however, to say that it was
   "because John was of the levitical tribe," this is less well
   considered.  We raised the question ourselves above, and saw that if
   the Jews who were sent knew John's birth, it was not open to them to
   ask if he was Elijah.  Then, again, in dealing with the question, "Art
   thou the prophet?" Heracleon does not regard the addition of the
   article as having any special force, and says, "They asked him if he
   were a prophet, wishing to know this more general fact."  Again, not
   Heracleon alone, but, so far as I am informed, all those who diverge
   from our views, as if they had not been able to deal with a trifling
   ambiguity and to draw the proper distinction, suppose John to be
   greater than Elijah and than all the prophets.  The words are, "Of
   those born of women there is none greater than John;" but this admits
   of two meanings, that John is greater than they all, or again, that
   some of them are equal to him.  For though many of the prophets were
   equal to him, still it might be true in respect of the grace bestowed
   on him, that none of them was greater than he.  He regards it as
   confirming the view that John was greater, that "he is predicted by
   Isaiah;" for no other of all those who uttered prophecies was held
   worthy by God of this distinction.  This, however, is a venturesome
   statement and implies some disrespect of what is called the Old
   Testament, and total disregard of the fact that Elijah himself was the
   subject of prophecy.  For Elijah is prophesied by Malachi, who says,
   [4886] "Behold, I send unto you Elijah, the Tishbite, who shall restore
   the heart of the father to the son."  Josiah, too, as we read in third
   Kings, [4887] was predicted by name by the prophet who came out of
   Judah; for he said, Jeroboam also being present at the altar, "Thus
   saith the Lord, Behold a son is born to David, his name is Josiah."
   There are some also who say that Samson was predicted by Jacob, when he
   said, [4888] "Dan shall judge his own people, he is as one tribe in
   Israel," for Samson who judged Israel was of the tribe of Dan.  So much
   by way of evidence of the rashness of the statement that John alone was
   the subject of prophecy, made by Heracleon in his attempted explanation
   of the words, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness."

   13.  John I. 24, 25.  Of the Baptism of John, that of Elijah, and that
   of Christ.

   And they that were sent were of the Pharisees.  And they asked him, and
   said unto him, [4889] "Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the
   Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"  Those who sent from Jerusalem
   the priests and levites who asked John these questions, having learned
   who John was not, and who he was, preserve a decent silence, as if
   tacitly assenting and indicating that they accepted what was said, and
   saw that baptism was suited to a voice crying in the wilderness for the
   preparing of the way of the Lord.  But the Pharisees being, as their
   name indicates, a divided and seditious set of people, show that they
   do not agree with the Jews of the metropolis and with the ministers of
   the service of God, the priests and levites.  They send envoys who deal
   in rebukes, and so far as their power extends debar him from baptizing;
   their envoys ask, Why baptizest thou, then, if thou art not the Christ,
   nor Elijah, nor the prophet?  And if we were to stitch together into
   one statement what is written in the various Gospels, we should say
   that at this time they spoke as is here reported, but that at a later
   time, when they wished to received baptism, they heard the address of
   John: [4890]   "Generations of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from
   the wrath to come?  Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
   repentance."  This is what the Baptist says in Matthew, when he sees
   many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, without, it
   is clear, having the fruits of repentance, and pharisaically boasting
   in themselves that they had Abraham for their father.  For this they
   are rebuked by John, who has the zeal of Elijah according to the
   communication of the Holy Spirit.  For that is a rebuking word, "Think
   not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father," and that
   is the word of a teacher, when he speaks of those who for their stony
   hearts are called unbelieving stones, and says that by the power of God
   these stones may be changed into children of Abraham; for they were
   present to the eyes of the prophet and did not shrink from his divine
   glance.  Hence his words:  "I say unto you that God is able of these
   stones to raise up children to Abraham."  And since they came to his
   baptism without having done fruits meet for repentance, he says to them
   most appropriately, "Already is the axe laid to the root of the tree;
   every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast
   into the fire."  This is as much as to say to them:  Since you have
   come to baptism without having done fruits meet for repentance, you are
   a tree that does not bring forth good fruit and which has to be cut
   down by the most sharp and piercing axe of the Word which is living and
   powerful and sharper than every two-edged sword.  The estimation in
   which the Pharisees held themselves is also set forth by Luke in the
   passage: [4891]   "Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a
   Pharisee and the other a publican.  And the Pharisee stood and prayed
   thus with himself:  God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men are,
   extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican."  The
   result of this speech is that the publican goes down to his house
   justified rather than the Pharisee, and the lesson is drawn, that every
   one who exalts himself is abased.  They came, then, in the character in
   which the Saviour's reproving words described them, as hypocrites to
   John's baptism, nor does it escape the Baptist's observation that they
   have the poison of vipers under their tongue and the poison of asps,
   for "the poison of asps is under their tongue." [4892]   The figure of
   serpents rightly indicates their temper, and it is plainly revealed in
   their better question:  "Why baptizest thou then, if thou art not the
   Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"  To these I would fain reply, if
   it be the case that the Christ and Elijah and the prophet baptize, but
   that the voice crying in the wilderness has no authority to do so,
   "Most harshly, my friends, do you question the messenger sent before
   the face of Christ to prepare His way before Him.  The mysteries which
   belong to this point are all hidden to you; for Jesus being, whether
   you will or not, the Christ, did not Himself baptize but His disciples,
   He who was Himself the prophet.  And how have you come to believe that
   Elijah who is to come will baptize?"  He did not baptize the logs upon
   the altar in the times of Ahab, [4893] though they needed such a bath
   to be burned up, what time the Lord appeared in fire.  No, he commands
   the priests to do this for him, and that not only once; for he says,
   "Do it a second time," upon which they did it a second time, and "Do it
   a third time," and they did it a third time.  If, then, he did not at
   that time himself baptize but left the work to others, how was he to
   baptize at the time spoken of by Malachi?  Christ, then, does not
   baptize with water, but His disciples.  He reserves for Himself to
   baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire.  Now Heracleon accepts the
   speech of the Pharisees as distinctly implying that the office of
   baptizing belonged to the Christ and Elijah and to every prophet, for
   he uses these words, "Whose office alone it is to baptize."  He is
   refuted by what we have just said, and especially by the consideration
   that he takes the word "prophet" in a general sense; [4894] for he
   cannot show that any of the prophets baptized.  He adds, not
   incorrectly, that the Pharisees put the question from malice, and not
   from a desire to learn.

   14.  Comparison of the Statements of the Four Evangelists Respecting
   John the Baptist, the Prophecies Regarding Him, His Addresses to the
   Multitude and to the Pharisees, Etc.

   We deem it necessary to compare with the expression of the passage we
   are considering the similar expressions found elsewhere in the
   Gospels.  This we shall continue to do point by point to the end of
   this work, so that terms which appear to disagree may be shown to be in
   harmony, and that the peculiar meanings present in each may be
   explained.  This we shall do in the present passage.  The words, "The
   voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the
   Lord," are placed by John, who was a disciple, in the mouth of the
   Baptist.  In Mark, on the other hand, the same words are recorded at
   the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in accordance with the
   Scripture of Isaiah, as thus:  "The beginning of the Gospel of Jesus
   Christ, as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send My
   messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.  The
   voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
   make His paths straight."  Now the words, "Make straight the way of the
   Lord," added by John, are not found in the prophet.  Perhaps John was
   seeking to compress the "Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight
   the paths of our God," and so wrote, "Make straight the way of the
   Lord;" while Mark combined two prophecies spoken by two different
   prophets in different places, and made one prophecy out of them, "As it
   is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold I send My messenger before thy
   face, who shall prepare thy way.  The voice of one crying in the
   wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight."
   The words, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness," are written
   immediately after the narrative of Hezekiah's recovery from his
   sickness, [4895] while the words, "Behold I send My messenger before
   thy face," are written by Malachi. [4896]   What John does here,
   abbreviating the text he quotes, we find done by Mark also at another
   point.  For while the words of the prophet are, "Prepare ye the way of
   the Lord, make straight the paths of our God," Mark writes, "Prepare ye
   the way of the Lord, make His paths straight."  And John practises a
   similar abbreviation in the text, "Behold I send My messenger before
   thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee," when he does not add
   the words "before thee," as in the original.  Coming now to the
   statement, "They were sent from the Pharisees and they asked Him,"
   [4897] we have been led by our examination of the passage to prefix the
   enquiry of the Pharisees--which Matthew does not mention--to the
   occurrence recorded in Matthew, when John saw many of the Pharisees and
   Sadducees coming to his baptism, and said to them, "Ye generations of
   vipers," etc.  For the natural sequence is that they should first
   enquire and then come.  And we have to observe how, when Matthew
   reports that there went out to John Jerusalem and all Judæa, and all
   the region round about Jordan, to be baptized by him in Jordan,
   confessing their sins, it was not these people who heard from the
   Baptist any word of rebuke or refutation, but only those many Pharisees
   and Sadducees whom he saw coming.  They it was who were greeted with
   the address, "Ye offspring of vipers," etc. [4898]   Mark, again, does
   not record any words of reproof as having been used by John to those
   who came to him, being all the country of Judæa and all of them of
   Jerusalem, who were baptized by him in the Jordan and confessed their
   sins.  This is because Mark does not mention the Pharisees and
   Sadducees as having come to John.  A further circumstance which we must
   mention is that both Matthew and Mark state that, in the one case, all
   Jerusalem and all Judæa, and the whole region round about Jordan, in
   the other, the whole land of Judæa and all they of Jerusalem, were
   baptized, confessing their sins; but when Matthew introduces the
   Pharisees and Sadducees as coming to the baptism, he does not say that
   they confessed their sins, and this might very likely and very
   naturally be the reason why they were addressed as "offspring of
   vipers."  Do not suppose, reader, that there is anything improper in
   our adducing in our discussion of the question of those who were sent
   from the Pharisees and put questions to John, the parallel passages
   from the other Gospels too.  For if we have indicated the proper
   connection between the enquiry of the Pharisees, recorded by the
   disciple John, and their baptism which is found in Matthew, we could
   scarcely avoid inquiring into the passages in question, nor recording
   the observations made on them.  Luke, like Mark, remembers the passage,
   "The voice of one crying in the wilderness," but he for his part treats
   it as follows: [4899]   "The word of God came unto John, the son of
   Zacharias, in the wilderness.  And he came into all the region round
   about Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance unto remission of
   sins; as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
   The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
   Lord, make His paths straight."  Luke, however, added the continuation
   of the prophecy:  "Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and
   hill shall be brought low, and the crooked shall become straight, and
   the rough ways smooth, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God."
   He writes, like Mark, "Make His ways straight;" curtailing, as we saw
   before, the text, "Make straight the ways of our God."  In the phrase,
   "And all the crooked shall become straight," he leaves out the "all,"
   and the word "straight" he converts from a plural into a singular.
   Instead of the phrase, moreover, "The rough land into a plain," he
   gives, "The rough ways into smooth ways," and he leaves out "And the
   glory of the Lord shall be revealed," and gives what follows, "And all
   flesh shall see the salvation of God."  These observations are of use
   as showing how the evangelists are accustomed to abbreviate the sayings
   of the prophets.  It has also to be observed that the speech,
   "Offspring of vipers," etc., is said by Matthew to have been spoken to
   the Pharisees and Sadducees when coming to baptism, they being a
   different set of people from those who confessed their sins, and to
   whom no words of this kind were spoken.  With Luke, on the contrary,
   these words were addressed to the multitudes who came out to be
   baptized by John, and there were not two divisions of those who were
   baptized, as we found in Matthew.  But Matthew, as the careful observer
   will see, does not speak of the multitudes in the way of praise, and he
   probably means the Baptist's address, Offspring of vipers, etc., to be
   understood as addressed to them also.  Another point is, that to the
   Pharisees and Sadducees he says, "Bring forth a fruit," in the
   singular, "worthy of repentance," but to the multitudes he uses the
   plural, "Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance."  Perhaps the
   Pharisees are required to yield the special fruit of repentance, which
   is no other than the Son and faith in Him, while the multitudes, who
   have not even a beginning of good things, are asked for all the fruits
   of repentance, and so the plural is used to them.  Further, it is said
   to the Pharisees, "Think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham
   for our father."  For the multitudes now have a beginning, appearing as
   they do to be introduced into the divine Word, and to approach the
   truth; and thus they begin to say within themselves, "We have Abraham
   for our father."  The Pharisees, on the contrary, are not beginning to
   this, but have long held it to be so.  But both classes see John point
   to the stones aforesaid and declare that even from these children can
   be raised up to Abraham, rising up out of unconsciousness and
   deadness.  And observe how it is said to the Pharisees, [4900]
   according to the word of the prophet, [4901] "Ye have eaten false
   fruit," and they have false fruit,--"Every tree which bringeth not
   forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire," while to the
   multitudes which do not bear fruit at all, [4902] "Every tree which
   bringeth not forth fruit is hewn down."  For that which has no fruit at
   all has not good fruit, and, therefore, it is worthy to be hewn down.
   But that which bears fruit has by no means good fruit, whence it also
   calls for the axe to lay it low.  But, if we look more closely into
   this about the fruit, we shall find that it is impossible that that
   which has just begun to be cultivated, even should it not prove
   fruitless, should bear the first good fruits.  The husbandman is
   content that the tree just coming into cultivation should bear him at
   first such fruits as it may; afterwards, when he has pruned and trained
   it according to his art, he will receive, not the fruits it chanced to
   bear at first, but good fruits.  The law itself favours this
   interpretation, for it says [4903] that the planter is to wait for
   three years, having the trees pruned and not eating the fruit of them.
   "Three years," it says, "the fruit shall be unpurified to you, and
   shall not be eaten, but in the fourth year all the fruit shall be holy,
   for giving praise unto the Lord."  This explains how the word "good" is
   omitted from the address to the multitudes, "Every tree, therefore,
   which bears not fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire."  The tree
   which goes on bearing such fruit as it did at first, is a tree which
   does not bear good fruit, and is, therefore, cut down, and cast into
   the fire, since, when the three years have passed and the fourth comes
   round, it does not bear good fruit, for praise unto the Lord.  In thus
   adducing the passages from the other Gospels I may appear to be
   digressing, but I cannot think it useless, or without bearing on our
   present subject.  For the Pharisees send to John, after the priests and
   levites who came from Jerusalem, men who came to ask him who he was,
   and enquire, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not the Christ, nor
   Elijah, nor the prophet?  After making this enquiry they straightway
   come for baptism, as Matthew records, and then they hear words suited
   to their quackery and hypocrisy.  But the words addressed to them were
   very similar to those spoken to the multitudes, and hence the necessity
   to look carefully at both speeches, and to compare them together.  It
   was while we were so engaged that various points arose in the sequence
   of the matter, which we had to consider.  To what has been said we must
   add the following.  We find mention made in John of two orders of
   persons sending:  the one, that of the Jews from Jerusalem sending
   priests and levites; the other, that of the Pharisees who want to know
   why he baptizes.  And we found that, after the enquiry, the Pharisees
   present themselves for baptism.  May it not be that the Jews, who had
   sent the earlier mission from Jerusalem, received John's words before
   those who sent the second mission, namely, the Pharisees, and hence
   arrived before them?  For Jerusalem and all Judæa, and, in consequence,
   the whole region round about Jordan, were being baptized by him in the
   river Jordan, confessing their sins; or, as Mark says, "There went out
   to him the whole land of Judæa, and all they of Jerusalem, and were
   baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins."  Now,
   neither does Matthew introduce the Pharisees and Sadducees, to whom the
   words, "Offspring of vipers," etc., are addressed; nor does Luke
   introduce the multitudes who meet with the same rebuke, as confessing
   their sins.  And the question may be raised how, if the whole city of
   Jerusalem, and the whole of Judæa, and the whole region round about
   Jordan, were baptized of John in Jordan, the Saviour could say, [4904]
   "John the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking, and ye say he hath
   a devil;" and how could He say to those who asked Him, [4905] "By what
   authority doest thou these things?  I also will ask you one word, which
   if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these
   things.  The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or of men?
   And they reason, and say, If we shall say, From heaven, He will say,
   Why did ye not believe him?"  The solution of the difficulty is this.
   The Pharisees, addressed by John, as we saw before, with his "Offspring
   of vipers," etc., came to the baptism, without believing in him,
   probably because they feared the multitudes, and, with their accustomed
   hypocrisy towards them, deemed it right to undergo the washing, so as
   not to appear hostile to those who did so.  Their belief was, then,
   that he derived his baptism from men, and not from heaven, but, on
   account of the multitude, lest they should be stoned, they are afraid
   to say what they think.  Thus there is no contradiction between the
   Saviour's speech to the Pharisees and the narratives in the Gospels
   about the multitudes who frequented John's baptism.  It was part of the
   effrontery of the Pharisees that they declared John to have a devil,
   as, also, that they declared Jesus to have performed His wonderful
   works by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.

   15.  How the Baptist Answers the Question of the Pharisees and Exalts
   the Nature of Christ.  Of the Shoe-Latchet Which He is Unable to Untie.

   John [4906] answered them, saying, "I baptize with water, but in the
   midst of you standeth one whom ye know not, even He who cometh after
   me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose."  Heracleon
   considers that John's answers to those sent by the Pharisees refer not
   to what they asked, but to what he wished, not observing that he
   accuses the prophet of a want of manners, by making him, when asked
   about one thing, answer about another; for this is a fault to be
   guarded against in conversation.  We assert, on the contrary, that the
   reply accurately takes up the question.  It is asked, "Why baptizest
   thou then, if thou art not the Christ?"  And what other answer could be
   given to this than to show that his baptism was in its nature a bodily
   thing?  I, he says, "baptize with water;" this is his answer to, "Why
   baptizest thou."  And to the second part of their question, "If thou
   art not the Christ," he answers by exalting the superior nature of
   Christ, that He has such virtue as to be invisible in His deity, though
   present to every man and extending over the whole universe.  This is
   what is indicated in the words, "There standeth one among you."  The
   Pharisees, moreover, though expecting the advent of Christ, saw nothing
   in Him of such a nature as John speaks of; they believed Him to be
   simply a perfect and holy man.  John, therefore, rebukes their
   ignorance of His superiority, and adds to the words, "There standeth
   one among you," the clause, "whom ye know not."  And, lest any one
   should suppose the invisible One who extends to every man, or, indeed,
   to the whole world, to be a different person from Him who became man,
   and appeared upon the earth and conversed with men, he adds to the
   words, "There standeth one among you whom you know not," the further
   words, "Who cometh after me," that is, He who is to be manifested after
   me.  By whose surpassing excellence he well understood that his own
   nature was far surpassed, though some doubted whether he might be the
   Christ; and, therefore, desiring to show how far he is from attaining
   to the greatness of the Christ, that no one should think of him beyond
   what he sees or hears of him, he goes on:  "The latchet of whose shoe I
   am not worthy to unloose."  By which he conveys, as in a riddle, that
   he is not fit to solve and to explain the argument about Christ's
   assuming a human body, an argument tied up and hidden (like a shoe-tie)
   to those who do not understand it,--so as to say anything worthy of
   such an advent, compressed, as it was, into so short a space.

   16.  Comparison of John's Testimony to Jesus in the Different Gospels.

   It may not be out of place, as we are examining the text, "I baptize
   with water," to compare the parallel utterances of the evangelists with
   this of John.  Matthew reports that the Baptist, when he saw many of
   the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, after the words of
   rebuke which we have already studied, went on: [4907]   "I indeed
   baptize you with water unto repentance; but He that cometh after me is
   mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; He shall baptize
   you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire."  This agrees with the words in
   John, in which the Baptist declares himself to those sent by the
   Pharisees, on the subject of his baptizing with water.  Mark, again,
   says, [4908] "John preached, saying, There cometh after me He that is
   mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop
   down and unloose.  I baptized you with water, but He shall baptize you
   with the Holy Ghost."  And Luke says [4909] that, as the people were in
   expectation, and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John,
   whether haply he were the Christ, John answered them all, saying, "I
   indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh one mightier than I,
   whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose; He shall baptize you
   with the Holy Ghost, and with fire."

   17.  Of the Testimony of John to Jesus in Matthew's Gospel,

   These, then, are the parallel passages of the four; let us try to see
   as clearly as we can what is the purport of each and wherein they
   differ from each other.  And we will begin with Matthew, who is
   reported by tradition to have published his Gospel before the others,
   to the Hebrews, those, namely, of the circumcision who believed.  I, he
   says, baptize you with water unto repentance, purifying you, as it
   were, and turning you away from evil courses and calling you to
   repentance; for I am come to make ready for the Lord a people prepared
   for Him, and by my baptism of repentance to prepare the ground for Him
   who is to come after me, and who will thus benefit you much more
   effectively and powerfully than my strength could.  For His baptism is
   not that of the body only; He fills the penitent with the Holy Ghost,
   and His diviner fire does away with everything material and consumes
   everything that is earthy, not only from him who admits it to his life,
   but even from him who hears of it from those who have it.  So much
   stronger than I is He who is coming after me, that I am not able to
   bear even the outskirts of the powers round Him which are furthest from
   Him (they are not open and exposed, so that any one could see them),
   nor even to bear those who support them.  I know not of which I should
   speak.  Should I speak of my own great weakness, which is not able to
   bear even these things about Christ which in comparison with the
   greater things in Him are least, or should I speak of His transcendent
   Deity, greater than all the world?  If I who have received such grace,
   as to be thought worthy of prophecy predicting my arrival in this human
   life, in the words, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness," and
   "Behold I send my messenger before thy face;" if I whose birth Gabriel
   who stands before God announced to my father so advanced in years, so
   much against his expectation, I at whose name Zacharias recovered his
   voice and was enabled to use it to prophesy, I to whom my Lord bears
   witness that among them that are born of women there is none greater
   than I, I am not able so much as to bear His shoes!  And if not His
   shoes, what can be said about His garments?  Who is so great as to be
   able to guard His coat?  Who can suppose that He can understand the
   meaning contained in His tunic which is without seam from the top
   because it is woven throughout?  It is to be observed that while the
   four represent John as declaring himself to have come to baptize with
   water, Matthew alone adds the words "to repentance," teaching that the
   benefit of baptism is connected with the intention of the baptized
   person; to him who repents it is salutary, but to him who comes to it
   without repentance it will turn to greater condemnation.  And here we
   must note that as the wonderful works done by the Saviour in the cures
   He wrought, which are symbolical of those who at any time are set free
   by the word of God from any sickness or disease, though they were done
   to the body and brought a bodily relief, yet also called those who were
   benefited by them to an exercise of faith, so the washing with water
   which is symbolic of the soul cleansing herself from every stain of
   wickedness, is no less in itself to him who yields himself to the
   divine power of the invocation of the Adorable Trinity, the beginning
   and source of divine gifts; for "there are diversities of gifts."  This
   view receives confirmation from the narrative recorded in the Acts of
   the Apostles, which shows the Spirit to have descended so manifestly on
   those who receive baptism, after the water had prepared the way for him
   in those who properly approached the rite.  Simon Magus, astonished at
   what he saw, desired to receive from Peter this gift, but though it was
   a good thing he desired, he thought to attain it by the mammon of
   unrighteousness.  We next remark in passing that the baptism of John
   was inferior to the baptism of Jesus which was given through His
   disciples.  Those persons in the Acts [4910] who were baptized to
   John's baptism and who had not heard if there was any Holy Ghost are
   baptized over again by the Apostle.  Regeneration did not take place
   with John, but with Jesus through His disciples it does so, and what is
   called the laver of regeneration takes place with renewal of the
   Spirit; for the Spirit now comes in addition since it comes from God
   and is over and above the water and does not come to all after the
   water.  So far, then, our examination of the statements in the Gospel
   according to Matthew.

   18.  Of the Testimony in Mark.  What is Meant by the Saviour's Shoes
   and by Untying His Shoe-Latchets.

   Now let us consider what is stated by Mark.  Mark's account of John's
   preaching agrees with the other.  The words are, "There cometh after me
   He that is mightier than I," which amounts to the same thing as "He
   that cometh after me is mightier than I."  There is a difference,
   however, in what follows, "The latchets of His shoes I am not worthy to
   stoop down and untie."  For it is one thing to bear a person's
   shoes,--they must, it is evident, have been untied already from the
   feet of the wearer,--and it is another thing to stoop down and untie
   the latchet of his shoes.  And it follows, since believers cannot think
   that either of the Evangelists made any mistake or misrepresentation,
   that the Baptist must have made these two utterances at different times
   and have meant them to express different things.  It is not the case,
   as some suppose. that the reports refer to the same incident and turned
   out differently because of a looseness of memory as to some of the
   facts or words.  Now it is a great thing to bear the shoes of Jesus, a
   great thing to stoop down to the bodily features of His mission, to
   that which took place in some lower region, so as to contemplate His
   image in the lower sphere, and to untie each difficulty connected with
   the mystery of His incarnation, such being as it were His
   shoe-latchets.  For the fetter of obscurity is one as the key of
   knowledge also is one; not even He who is greatest among those born of
   women is sufficient of Himself to loose such things or to open them,
   for He who tied and locked at first, He also grants to whom He will to
   loose His shoe-latchet and to unlock what He has shut.  If the passage
   about the shoes has a mystic meaning we ought not to scorn to consider
   it.  Now I consider that the inhumanisation when the Son of God assumes
   flesh and bones is one of His shoes, and that the other is the descent
   to Hades, whatever that Hades be, and the journey with the Spirit to
   the prison.  As to the descent into Hades, we read in the sixteenth
   Psalm, "Thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades," and as for the journey
   in prison with the Spirit we read in Peter in his Catholic Epistle,
   [4911] "Put to death," he says, "in the flesh, but quickened in the
   Spirit; in which also He went and preached unto the spirits in prison,
   which at one time were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God once
   waited in the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing."  He, then,
   who is able worthily to set forth the meaning of these two journeys is
   able to untie the latchet of the shoes of Jesus; he, bending down in
   his mind and going with Jesus as He goes down into Hades, and
   descending from heaven and the mysteries of Christ's deity to the
   advent He of necessity made with us when He took on man (as His
   shoes).  Now He who put on man also put on the dead, for [4912] "for
   this end Jesus both died and revived, that He might be Lord both of
   dead and living."  This is why He put on both living and dead, that is,
   the inhabitants of the earth and those of Hades, that He might be the
   Lord of both dead and living.  Who, then, is able to stoop down and
   untie the latchet of such shoes, and having untied them not to let them
   drop, but by the second faculty he has received to take them up and
   bear them, by bearing the meaning of them in his memory?

   19.  Luke and John Suggest that One May Loose the Shoe-Latchets of the
   Logos Without Stooping Down.

   We must not, however, omit to ask how it comes that Luke and John give
   the speech without the phrase "to stoop down."  He, perhaps, who stoops
   down may be held to unloose in the sense which we have stated.  On the
   other hand, it may be that one who fixes his eyes on the height of the
   exaltation of the Logos, may find the loosing of those shoes which when
   one is seeking them seem to be bound, so that He also looses those
   shoes which are separable from the Logos, and beholds the Logos
   divested of inferior things, as He is, the Son of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   20.  The Difference Between Not Being "Sufficient" And Not Being
   "Worthy."

   John records that the Baptist said he was not worthy, Mark that he was
   not sufficient, and these two are not the same.  One who was not worthy
   might yet be sufficient, and one who was worthy might not be
   sufficient.  For even if it be the case that gifts are bestowed to
   profit withal and not merely according to the proportion of faith, yet
   it would seem to be the part of a God who loves men and who sees before
   what harm must come from the rise of self-opinion or conceit, not to
   bestow sufficiency even on the worthy.  But it belongs to the goodness
   of God by conferring bounties to conquer the object of His bounty,
   taking in advance him who is destined to be worthy, and adorning him
   even before he becomes worthy with sufficiency, so that after his
   sufficiency he may come to be worthy; he is not first to be worthy and
   then to anticipate the giver and take His gifts before the time and so
   arrive at being sufficient.  Now with the three the Baptist says he is
   not sufficient, while in John he says he is not worthy.  But it may be
   that he who formerly declared that he was not sufficient became
   sufficient afterwards, even though perhaps he was not worthy, or again
   that while he was saying he was not worthy, and was in fact not worthy,
   he arrived at being worthy, unless one should say that human nature can
   never come to perform worthily this loosing or this bearing, and that
   John, therefore, says truly that he never became sufficient to loose
   the latchets of the Saviour's shoes, nor worthy of it either.  However
   much we take into our minds there are still left things not yet
   understood; for, as we read in the wisdom of Jesus, son of Sirach,
   [4913] "When a man hath done, then he beginneth, and when he leaveth
   off, then he shall be doubtful."

   21.  The Fourth Gospel Speaks of Only One Shoe, the Others of Both.
   The Significance of This.

   As to the shoes, too, which are spoken of in the three Gospels, we have
   a question to consider; we must compare them with the single shoe named
   by the disciple John.  "I am not worthy," we read there, "to untie the
   latchet of His shoe."  Perhaps he was conquered by the grace of God,
   and received the gift of doing that which of himself he would not have
   been worthy to do, of untying, namely, the latchet of one of the shoes,
   namely, after he had seen the Saviour's sojourn among men, of which he
   bears witness.  But he did not know the things which were to follow,
   namely, whether Jesus was to come to that place also, to which he was
   to go after being beheaded in prison, or whether he was to look for
   another; and hence he alludes enigmatically to that doubt which was
   afterwards cleared up to us, and says, "I am not worthy to untie His
   shoe-latchet."  If any one considers this to be a superfluous
   speculation, he can combine in one the speech about the shoes and that
   about the shoe, as if John said, I am by no means worthy to loose His
   shoestring, not even at the beginning, the string of one of His shoes.
   Or the following may be a way to combine what is said in the Four.  If
   John understands about Jesus' sojourn here, but is in doubt about the
   future, then he says with perfect truth that he is not worthy to loose
   the latchet of His shoes; for though he loosed that of one shoe, he did
   not loose both.  And on the other hand, what he says about the latchet
   of the shoe is quite true also; since as we saw he is still in doubt
   whether Jesus is He that was to come, or whether another is to be
   looked for, in that other region.

   22.  How the Word Stands in the Midst of Men Without Being Known of
   Them.

   As for the saying, "There standeth one among you whom you know not," we
   are led by it to consider the Son of God, the Word, by whom all things
   were made, since He exists in substance throughout the underlying
   nature of things, being the same as wisdom.  For He permeated, from the
   beginning, all creation, so that what is made at any time should be
   made through Him, and that it might be always true of anything soever,
   that "All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything
   made that was made;" and this saying also, "By wisdom didst thou make
   them all."  Now, if He permeates all creation, then He is also in those
   questioners who ask, "Why baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ,
   nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"  In the midst of them stands the Word,
   who is the same and steadfast, being everywhere established by the
   Father.  Or the words, "There standeth among you," may be understood to
   say, In the midst of you men, because you are reasonable beings, stands
   He who is proved by Scripture to be the sovereign principle in the
   midst of every body, and so to be present in your heart.  Those,
   therefore, who have the Word in the midst of them, but who do not
   consider His nature, nor from what spring and principle He came, nor
   how He gave them the nature they have, [4914] these, while having Him
   in the midst of them, know Him not.  But John knew Him:  for the words,
   "Whom you know not," used in reproach to the Pharisees, show that he
   well knew the Word whom they did not know.  And the Baptist, therefore,
   knowing Him, saw Him coming after himself, who was now in the midst of
   them, that is to say, dwelling after him and the teaching he gave in
   his baptism, in those who, according to reason (or the Word), submitted
   to that purifying rite.  The word "after," however, has not the same
   meaning here as it has when Jesus commands us to come "after" Him; for
   in this case we are bidden to go after Him, so that, treading in His
   steps, we may come to the Father; but in the other case, the meaning is
   that after the teachings of John (since "He came in order that all men
   through Him might believe"), the Word dwells with those who have
   prepared themselves, purified as they are by the lesser words for the
   perfect Word.  Firstly, then, stands the Father, being without any
   turning or change; and then stands also His Word, always carrying on
   His work of salvation, and even when He is in the midst of men, not
   comprehended, and not even seen.  He stands, also, teaching, and
   inviting all to drink from His abundant spring, for [4915] "Jesus stood
   and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink."

   23.  Heracleon's View of This Utterance of John the Baptist, and
   Interpretation of the Shoe of Jesus.

   But Heracleon declares the words, "There standeth one among you," to be
   equivalent to "He is already here, and He is in the world and in men,
   and He is already manifest to you all."  By this He does away with the
   meaning which is also present in the words, that the Word had permeated
   the whole world.  For we must say to him, When is He not present, and
   when is He not in the world?  Does not this Gospel say, "He was in the
   world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not."  And
   this is why those to whom the Logos is He "whom you know not," do not
   know Him:  they have never gone out of the world, but the world does
   not know Him.  But at what time did He cease to be among men?  Was He
   not in Isaiah, when He said, [4916] "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
   because He hath anointed me," and [4917] "I became manifest to those
   who sought me not."  Let them say, too, if He was not in David when he
   said, not from himself, [4918] "But I was established by Him a king in
   Zion His holy hill," and the other words spoken in the Psalms in the
   person of Christ.  And why should I go over the details of this proof,
   truly they are hard to be numbered, when I can show quite clearly that
   He was always in men?  And that is enough to show Heracleon's
   interpretation of "There standeth in the midst of you," to be unsound,
   when he says it is equivalent to "He is already here, and He is in the
   world and in men."  We are disposed to agree with him when he says that
   the words, "Who cometh after me," show John to be the forerunner of
   Christ, for he is in fact a kind of servant running before his master.
   The words, however, "Whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose,"
   receive much too simple an interpretation when it is said that "in
   these words the Baptist confesses that he is not worthy even of the
   least honourable ministration to Christ."  After this interpretation he
   adds, not without sense, "I am not worthy that for my sake He should
   come down from His greatness and should take flesh as His footgear,
   concerning which I am not able to give any explanation or description,
   nor to unloose the arrangement of it."  In understanding the world by
   his shoe, Heracleon shows some largeness of mind, but immediately after
   he verges on impiety in declaring that all this is to be understood of
   that person whom John here has in his mind.  For he considers that it
   is the demiurge of the world who confesses by these words that he is a
   lesser person than the Christ; and this is the height of impiety.  For
   the Father who sent Him, He who is the God of the living as Jesus
   Himself testifies, of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, and He who is
   greater than heaven and earth for the reason that He is the Maker of
   them, He also alone is good and is greater than He who was sent by
   Him.  And even if, as we said, Heracleon's idea was a lofty one, that
   the whole world was the shoe of Jesus, yet I think we ought not to
   agree with him.  For how can it be harmonized with such a view, that
   "Heaven is My throne and the earth My footstool," a testimony which
   Jesus accepts as said of the Father? [4919]   "Swear not by heaven," He
   says, "for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is the
   footstool of His feet."  How, if he takes the whole world to be the
   shoe of Jesus, can he also accept the text, [4920] "Do not I fill
   heaven and earth?" saith the Lord.  It is also worth while to enquire,
   whether as the Word and wisdom permeated the whole world, and as the
   Father was in the Son, the words are to be understood as above or in
   this way, that He who first of all was girded about with the whole
   creation, in addition to the Son's being in Him, granted to the
   Saviour, as being second after Him and being God the Word, to pervade
   the whole creation.  To those who have it in them to take note of the
   uninterrupted movement of the great heaven, how it carries with it from
   East to West so great a multitude of stars, to them most of all it will
   seem needful to enquire what that force is, how great and of what
   nature, which is present in the whole world.  For to pronounce that
   force to be other than the Father and the Son, that perhaps might be
   inconsistent with piety.

   24.  The Name of the Place Where John Baptized is Not Bethany, as in
   Most Copies, But Bethabara.  Proof of This.  Similarly "Gergesa" Should
   Be Read for "Gerasa," In the Story of the Swine.  Attention is to Be
   Paid to the Proper Names in Scripture, Which are Often Written
   Inaccurately, and are of Importance for Interpretation.

   "These things were done in Bethabara, beyond Jordan, where John was
   baptizing." [4921]   We are aware of the reading which is found in
   almost all the copies, "These things were done in Bethany."  This
   appears, moreover, to have been the reading at an earlier time; and in
   Heracleon we read "Bethany."  We are convinced, however, that we should
   not read "Bethany," but "Bethabara."  We have visited the places to
   enquire as to the footsteps of Jesus and His disciples, and of the
   prophets.  Now, Bethany, as the same evangelist tells us, [4922] was
   the town of Lazarus, and of Martha and Mary; it is fifteen stadia from
   Jerusalem, and the river Jordan is about a hundred and eighty stadia
   distant from it.  Nor is there any other place of the same name in the
   neighbourhood of the Jordan, but they say that Bethabara is pointed out
   on the banks of the Jordan, and that John is said to have baptized
   there.  The etymology of the name, too, corresponds with the baptism of
   him who made ready for the Lord a people prepared for Him; for it
   yields the meaning "House of preparation," while Bethany means "House
   of obedience."  Where else was it fitting that he should baptize, who
   was sent as a messenger before the face of the Christ, to prepare His
   way before Him, but at the House of preparation?  And what more fitting
   home for Mary, who chose the good part, [4923] which was not taken away
   from her, and for Martha, who was cumbered for the reception of Jesus,
   and for their brother, who is called the friend of the Saviour, than
   Bethany, the House of obedience?  Thus we see that he who aims at a
   complete understanding of the Holy Scriptures must not neglect the
   careful examination of the proper names in it.  In the matter of proper
   names the Greek copies are often incorrect, and in the Gospels one
   might be misled by their authority.  The transaction about the swine,
   which were driven down a steep place by the demons and drowned in the
   sea, is said to have taken place in the country of the Gerasenes.
   [4924]   Now, Gerasa is a town of Arabia, and has near it neither sea
   nor lake.  And the Evangelists would not have made a statement so
   obviously and demonstrably false; for they were men who informed
   themselves carefully of all matters connected with Judæa.  But in a few
   copies we have found, "into the country of the Gadarenes;" and, on this
   reading, it is to be stated that Gadara is a town of Judæa, in the
   neighbourhood of which are the well-known hot springs, and that there
   is no lake there with overhanging banks, nor any sea.  But Gergesa,
   from which the name Gergesenes is taken, is an old town in the
   neighbourhood of the lake now called Tiberias, and on the edge of it
   there is a steep place abutting on the lake, from which it is pointed
   out that the swine were cast down by the demons.  Now, the meaning of
   Gergesa is "dwelling of the casters-out," and it contains a prophetic
   reference to the conduct towards the Saviour of the citizens of those
   places, who "besought Him to depart out of their coasts."  The same
   inaccuracy with regard to proper names is also to be observed in many
   passages of the law and the prophets, as we have been at pains to learn
   from the Hebrews, comparing our own copies with theirs which have the
   confirmation of the versions, never subjected to corruption, of Aquila
   and Theodotion and Symmachus.  We add a few instances to encourage
   students to pay more attention to such points.  One of the sons of
   Levi, [4925] the first, is called Geson in most copies, instead of
   Gerson.  His name is the same as that of the first-born of Moses;
   [4926] it was given appropriately in each case, both children being
   born, because of the sojourn in Egypt, in a strange land.  The second
   son of Juda, [4927] again, has with us the name Annan, but with the
   Hebrews Onan, "their labour."  Once more, in the departures of the
   children of Israel in Numbers, [4928] we find, "They departed from
   Sochoth and pitched in Buthan;" but the Hebrew, instead of Buthan,
   reads Aiman.  And why should I add more points like these, when any one
   who desires it can examine into the proper names and find out for
   himself how they stand?  The place-names of Scripture are specially to
   be suspected where many of them occur in a catalogue, as in the account
   of the partition of the country in Joshua, and in the first Book of
   Chronicles from the beginning down to, say, the passage about Dan,
   [4929] and similarly in Ezra.  Names are not to be neglected, since
   indications may be gathered from them which help in the interpretation
   of the passages where they occur.  We cannot, however, leave our proper
   subject to examine in this place into the philosophy of names.

   25.  Jordan Means "Their Going Down."  Spiritual Meanings and
   Application of This.

   Let us look at the words of the Gospel now before us.  "Jordan" means
   "their going down."  The name "Jared" is etymologically akin to it, if
   I may say so; it also yields the meaning "going down;" for Jared was
   born to Maleleel, as it is written in the Book of Enoch--if any one
   cares to accept that book as sacred--in the days when the sons of God
   came down to the daughters of men.  Under this descent some have
   supposed that there is an enigmatical reference to the descent of souls
   into bodies, taking the phrase "daughters of men" as a tropical
   expression for this earthly tabernacle.  Should this be so, what river
   will "their going down" be, to which one must come to be purified, a
   river going down, not with its own descent, but "theirs," that, namely,
   of men, what but our Saviour who separates those who received their
   lots from Moses from those who obtained their own portions through
   Jesus (Joshua)?  His current, flowing in the descending stream, makes
   glad, as we find in the Psalms, [4930] the city of God, not the visible
   Jerusalem--for it has no river beside it--but the blameless Church of
   God, built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Christ Jesus
   our Lord being the chief corner-stone.  Under the Jordan, accordingly,
   we have to understand the Word of God who became flesh and tabernacled
   among us, Jesus who gives us as our inheritance the humanity which He
   assumed, for that is the head corner-stone, which being taken up into
   the deity of the Son of God, is washed by being so assumed, and then
   receives into itself the pure and guileless dove of the Spirit, bound
   to it and no longer able to fly away from it.  For "Upon whomsoever,"
   we read, "thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him,
   the same is He that baptizeth with the Holy Spirit."  Hence, he who
   receives the Spirit abiding on Jesus Himself is able to baptize those
   who come to him in that abiding Spirit.  But John baptizes beyond
   Jordan, in the regions verging on the outside of Judæa, in Bethabara,
   being the forerunner of Him who came to call not the righteous but
   sinners, and who taught that the whole have no need of a physician, but
   they that are sick.  For it is for forgiveness of sins that this
   washing is given.

   26.  The Story of Israel Crossing Jordan Under Joshua is Typical of
   Christian Things, and is Written for Our Instruction.

   Now, it may very well be that some one not versed in the various
   aspects of the Saviour may stumble at the interpretation given above of
   the Jordan; because John says, "I baptize with water, but He that
   cometh after me is stronger than I; He shall baptize you with the Holy
   Spirit."  To this we reply that, as the Word of God in His character as
   something to be drunk is to one set of men water, and to another wine,
   making glad the heart of man, and to others blood, since it is said,
   [4931] "Except ye drink My blood, ye have no life in you," and as in
   His character as food He is variously conceived as living bread or as
   flesh, so also He, the same person, is baptism of water, and baptism of
   Holy Spirit and of fire, and to some, also, of blood.  It is of His
   last baptism, as some hold, that He speaks in the words, [4932] "I have
   a baptism to be baptized with, and how am I straitened till it be
   accomplished?"  And it agrees with this that the disciple John speaks
   in his Epistle [4933] of the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, as
   being one.  And again He declares Himself to be the way and the door,
   but clearly He is not the door to those to whom He is the way, and He
   is no longer the way to those to whom He is the door.  All those, then,
   who are being initiated in the beginning of the oracles of God, and
   come to the voice of him who cries in the wilderness, "Make straight
   the way of the Lord," the voice which sounds beyond Jordan at the house
   of preparation, let them prepare themselves so that they may be in a
   state to receive the spiritual word, brought home to them by the
   enlightenment of the Spirit.  As we are now, as our subject requires,
   bringing together all that relates to the Jordan, let us look at the
   "river."  God, by Moses, carried the people through the Red Sea, making
   the water a wall for them on the right hand and on the left, and by
   Joshua He carried them through Jordan.  Now, Paul deals with this
   Scripture, and his warfare is not according to the flesh of it, for he
   knew that the law is spiritual in a spiritual sense.  And he shows us
   that he understood what is said about the passage of the Red Sea; for
   he says in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, [4934] "I would not,
   brethren, have you ignorant, how that our fathers were all under the
   cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were all baptized into Moses
   in the cloud and in the sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat,
   and drink the same spiritual drink; for they drank of the spiritual
   rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ."  In the spirit of
   this passage let us also pray that we may receive from God to
   understand the spiritual meaning of Joshua's passage through Jordan.
   Of it, also, Paul would have said, "I would not, brethren, have you
   ignorant, that all our fathers went through Jordan, and were all
   baptized into Jesus in the spirit and in the river."  And Joshua, who
   succeeded Moses, was a type of Jesus Christ, who succeeds the
   dispensation through the law, and replaces it by the preaching of the
   Gospel.  And even if those Paul speaks of were baptized in the cloud
   and in the sea, there is something harsh and salt in their baptism.
   They are still in fear of their enemies, and crying to the Lord and to
   Moses, saying, [4935] "Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou
   brought us forth to slay us in the wilderness?  Why hast thou dealt
   thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?"  But the baptism to
   Joshua, which takes place in quite sweet and drinkable water, is in
   many ways superior to that earlier one, religion having by this time
   grown clearer and assuming a becoming order.  For the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord our God is carried in procession by the priests
   and levites, the people following the ministers of God, it, also,
   accepting the law of holiness.  For Joshua says to the people, [4936]
   "Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; the Lord will do wonders among
   you."  And he commands the priests to go before the people with the ark
   of the covenant, wherein is plainly showed forth the mystery of the
   Father's economy about the Son, which is highly exalted by Him who gave
   the Son this office; "That at the name of Jesus [4937] every knee
   should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under
   the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
   Lord, to the glory of God the Father."  This is pointed out by what we
   find in the book called Joshua, [4938] "In that day I will begin to
   exalt thee before the children of Israel."  And we hear our Lord Jesus
   saying to the children of Israel, [4939] "Come hither and hear the
   words of the Lord your God.  Hereby ye shall know that the living God
   is in (among) you;" for when we are baptized to Jesus, we know that the
   living God is in us.  And, in the former case, they kept the passover
   in Egypt, and then began their journey, but with Joshua, after crossing
   Jordan on the tenth day of the first month they pitched their camp in
   Galgala; for a sheep had to be procured before invitations could be
   issued to the banquet after Joshua's baptism.  Then the children of
   Israel, since the children of those who came out of Egypt had not
   received circumcision, were circumcised by Joshua with a very sharp
   stone; the Lord declares that He takes away the reproach of Egypt on
   the day of Joshua's baptism, when Joshua purified the children of
   Israel.  For it is written: [4940]   "And the Lord said to Joshua, the
   son of Nun, This day have I taken away the reproach of Egypt from off
   you."  Then the children of Israel kept the passover on the fourteenth
   day of the month, with much greater gladness than in Egypt, for they
   ate unleavened bread of the corn of the holy land, and fresh food
   better than manna.  For when they received the land of promise God did
   not entertain them with scantier food, nor when such a one as Joshua
   was their leader do they get inferior bread.  This will be plain to him
   who thinks of the true holy land and of the Jerusalem above.  Hence it
   is written in this same Gospel: [4941]   Your fathers did eat bread in
   the wilderness, and are dead; he that eateth of this bread shall live
   for ever.  For the manna, though it was given by God, yet was bread of
   travel, bread supplied to those still under discipline, well fitted for
   those who were under tutors and governors.  And the new bread Joshua
   managed to get from corn they cut in the country, in the land of
   promise, others having laboured and his disciples reaping,--that was
   bread more full of life, distributed as it was to those who, for their
   perfection, were able to receive the inheritance of their fathers.
   Hence, he who is still under discipline to that bread may receive death
   as far as it is concerned, but he who has attained to the bread that
   follows that, eating it, shall live for ever.  All this has been added,
   not, I conceive, without appropriateness, to our study of the baptism
   at the Jordan, administered by John at Bethabara.

   27.  Of Elijah and Elisha Crossing the Jordan.

   Another point which we must not fail to notice is that when Elijah was
   about to be taken up in a whirlwind, as if to heaven, [4942] he took
   his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the water, which was
   divided hither and thither, and they went over both of them, that is,
   he and Elisha.  His baptism in the Jordan made him fitter to be taken
   up, for, as we showed before, Paul gives the name of baptism to such a
   remarkable passage through the water.  And through this same Jordan
   Elisha receives, through Elijah, the gift he desired, saying, "Let a
   double portion of thy spirit be upon me."  What enabled him to receive
   this gift of the spirit of Elijah was, perhaps, that he had passed
   through Jordan twice, once with Elijah, and the second time, when,
   after receiving the mantle of Elijah, he smote the water and said,
   "Where is the God of Elijah, even He?  And he smote the waters, and
   they were divided hither and thither."

   28.  Naaman the Syrian and the Jordan.  No Other Stream Has the Same
   Healing Power.

   Should any one object to the expression "He smote the water," on
   account of the conclusion we arrived at above with respect to the
   Jordan, that it is a type of the Word who descended for us our
   descending, we rejoin that with the Apostle the rock is plainly said to
   be Christ, and that it is smitten twice with the rod, so that the
   people may drink of the spiritual rock which follows them.  The
   "smiting" in this new difficulty is that of those who are fond of
   suggesting something that contradicts the conclusion even before they
   have learned what the question is which is in hand.  From such God sets
   us free, since, on the one hand, He gives us to drink when we are
   thirsty, and on the other He prepares for us, in the immense and
   trackless deep, a road to pass over, namely, by the dividing of His
   Word, since it is by the reason which distinguishes (divides) that most
   things are made plain to us.  But that we may receive the right
   interpretation about this Jordan, so good to drink, so full of grace,
   it may be of use to compare the cleansing of Naaman the Syrian from his
   leprosy, and what is said of the rivers of religion of the enemies of
   Israel.  It is recorded of Naaman [4943] that he came with horse and
   chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.  And Elisha sent
   a messenger to him, saying, "Go, wash seven times in the Jordan, and
   thy flesh shall come again unto thee, and thou shalt be cleansed."
   Then Naaman is angry; he does not see that our Jordan is the cleanser
   of those who are impure from leprosy, from that impurity, and their
   restorer to health; it is the Jordan that does this, and not the
   prophet; the office of the prophet is to direct to the healing agency.
   Naaman then says, not understanding the great mystery of the Jordan,
   "Behold, I said that he will certainly come out to me, and will call
   upon the name of the Lord his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and
   restore the leper."  For to put his hand on the leprosy [4944] and
   cleanse it is a work belonging to our Lord Jesus only; for when the
   leper appealed to Him with faith, saying, "If Thou wilt Thou canst make
   me clean," He not only said, "I will, be thou clean," but in addition
   to the word He touched him, and he was cleansed from his leprosy.
   Naaman, then, is still in error, and does not see how far inferior
   other rivers are to the Jordan for the cure of the suffering; he extols
   the rivers of Damascus, Arbana, and Pharpha, saying, "Are not Arbana
   and Pharpha, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?
   Shall I not wash in them and be clean?"  For as none is good [4945] but
   one, God the Father, so among rivers none is good but the Jordan, nor
   able to cleanse from his leprosy him who with faith washes his soul in
   Jesus.  And this, I suppose, is the reason why the Israelites are
   recorded to have wept when they sat by the rivers of Babylon and
   remembered Zion; those who are carried captive, on account of their
   wickedness, when they taste other waters after sacred Jordan, are led
   to remember with longing their own river of salvation.  Therefore it is
   said of the rivers of Babylon, "There we sat down," clearly because
   they were unable to stand, "and wept."  And Jeremiah rebukes those who
   wish to drink the waters of Egypt, and desert the water which comes
   down from heaven, and is named from its so coming down--namely, the
   Jordan.  He says, [4946] "What hast thou to do with the way of Egypt,
   to drink the water of Geon, and to drink the water of the river," or,
   as it is in the Hebrew, "to drink the water of Sion."  Of which water
   we have now to speak.

   29.  The River of Egypt and Its Dragon, Contrasted with the Jordan.

   But that the Spirit in the inspired Scriptures is not speaking mainly
   of rivers to be seen with the eyes, may be gathered from Ezekiel's
   prophecies against Pharaoh, king of Egypt: [4947]   "Behold I am
   against thee, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great dragon, seated in the
   midst of rivers, who sayest, Mine are the rivers, and I made them.  And
   I will put traps in thy jaws, and I will make the fishes of the river
   to stick to thy fins, and I will bring thee up from the midst of thy
   river, and all the fish of the river, and I will cast thee down quickly
   and all the fish of the river; thou shalt fall upon the face of thy
   land, and thou shalt not be gathered together, and thou shalt not be
   adorned."  For what real bodily dragon has ever been reported as having
   been seen in the material river of Egypt?  But consider if the river of
   Egypt be not the dwelling of the dragon who is our enemy, who was not
   even able to kill the child Moses.  But as the dragon is in the river
   of Egypt, so is God in the river which makes glad the city of God; for
   the Father is in the Son.  Hence those who come to wash themselves in
   Him put away the reproach of Egypt, and become more fit to be
   restored.  They are cleansed from that foulest leprosy, receive a
   double portion of spiritual gifts, and are made ready to receive the
   Holy Spirit, since the spiritual dove does not light on any other
   stream.  Thus we have considered in a way more worthy of the sacred
   subject the Jordan and the purification that is in it, and Jesus being
   washed in it, and the house of preparation.  Let us, then, draw from
   the river as much help as we require.

   30.  Of What John Learned from Jesus When Mary Visited Elisabeth in the
   Hill Country.

   "The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him." [4948]   The mother of
   Jesus had formerly, as soon as she conceived, stayed with the mother of
   John, also at that time with child, and the Former then communicated to
   the Formed with some exactness His own image, and caused him to be
   conformed to His glory.  And from this outward similarity it came that
   with those who did not distinguish between the image itself and that
   which was according to the image, John was thought to be Christ [4949]
   and Jesus was supposed [4950] to be John risen from the dead.  So now
   Jesus, after the testimonies of John to Him which we have examined, is
   Himself seen by the Baptist coming to him.  It is to be noticed that on
   the former occasion, when the voice of Mary's salutation came to the
   ears of Elisabeth, the babe John leaped in the womb of his mother, who
   then received the Holy Spirit, as it were, from the ground.  For it
   came to pass, we read, [4951] "when Elisabeth heard the salutation of
   Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the
   Holy Spirit, and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry and said,"
   etc.  On this occasion, similarly, John sees Jesus coming to him and
   says, "Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world."
   For with regard to matters of great moment one is first instructed by
   hearing and afterwards one sees them with one's own eyes.  That John
   was helped to the shape he was to wear by the Lord who, still in the
   process of formation and in His mother's womb, approached Elisabeth,
   will be clear to any one who has grasped our proof that John is a voice
   but that Jesus is the Word, for when Elisabeth was filled with the Holy
   Spirit at the salutation of Mary there was a great voice in her, as the
   words themselves bear; for they say, "And she spake out with a loud
   voice."  Elisabeth, it is plain, did this, "and she spake."  For the
   voice of Mary's salutation coming to the ears of Elisabeth filled John
   with itself; hence John leaps, and his mother becomes, as it were, the
   mouth of her son and a prophetess, crying out with a loud voice and
   saying, "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy
   womb."  Now we see clearly how it was with Mary's hasty journey to the
   hill country, and her entrance into the house of Zacharias, and the
   greeting with which she salutes Elisabeth; it was that she might
   communicate some of the power she derived from Him she had conceived,
   to John, yet in his mother's womb, and that John too might communicate
   to his mother some of the prophetic grace which had come to him, that
   all these things were done.  And most rightly was it in the hill
   country that these transactions took place, since no great thing can be
   entertained by those who are low and may be thence called valleys.
   Here, then, after the testimonies of John,--the first, when he cried
   and spoke about His deity; the second, addressed to the priests and
   levites who were sent by the Jews from Jerusalem; and the third, in
   answer to the sharper questions of those from the Pharisees,--Jesus is
   seen by the witness-bearer coming to him while he is still advancing
   and growing better.  This advance and improvement is symbolically
   indicated in the phrase, "On the morrow."  For Jesus came in the
   consequent illumination, as it were, and on the day after what had
   preceded, not only known as standing in the midst even of those who
   knew Him not, but now plainly seen advancing to him who had formerly
   made such declarations about Him.  On the first day the testimonies
   take place, and on the second Jesus comes to John.  On the third John,
   standing with two of his disciples and looking upon Jesus as He walked,
   said, "Behold the Lamb of God," thus urging those who were there to
   follow the Son of God.  On the fourth day, too, He was minded to go
   forth into Galilee, and He who came forth to seek that which was lost
   finds Philip and says to him, "Follow Me."  And on that day, after the
   fourth, which is the sixth from the beginning of those we have
   enumerated, the marriage takes place in Cana of Galilee, which we shall
   have to consider when we get to the passage.  Note this, too, that Mary
   being the greater comes to Elisabeth, who is the less, and the Son of
   God comes to the Baptist; which should encourage us to render help
   without delay to those who are in a lower position, and to cultivate
   for ourselves a moderate station.

   31.  Of the Conversation Between John and Jesus at the Baptism,
   Recorded by Matthew Only.

   John the disciple does not tell us where the Saviour comes from to John
   the Baptist, but we learn this from Matthew, who writes: [4952]   "Then
   cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized of him."
   And Mark adds the place in Galilee; he says, [4953] "And it came to
   pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was
   baptized by John in Jordan."  Luke does not mention the place Jesus
   came from, but on the other hand he tells us what we do not learn from
   the others, that immediately after the baptism, as He was coming up,
   heaven was opened to Him, and the Holy Spirit descended on Him in
   bodily form like a dove.  Again, it is Matthew alone who tells us of
   John's preventing the Lord, saying to the Saviour, "I have need to be
   baptized of Thee, and comest Thou to me?"  None of the others added
   this after Matthew, so that they might not be saying just the same as
   he.  And what the Lord rejoined, "Suffer it now, for thus it becometh
   us to fulfil all righteousness," this also Matthew alone recorded.

   32.  John Calls Jesus a "Lamb."  Why Does He Name This Animal
   Specially?  Of the Typology of the Sacrifices, Generally.

   "And he sayeth, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of
   the world." [4954]   There were five animals which were brought to the
   altar, three that walk and two that fly; and it seems to be worth
   asking why John calls the Saviour a lamb and not any of these other
   creatures, and why, when each of the animals that walk is offered of
   three kinds he used for the sheep-kind the term "lamb."  The five
   animals are as follows:  the bullock, the sheep, the goat, the
   turtle-dove, the pigeon.  And of the walking animals these are the
   three kinds--bullock, ox, calf; ram, sheep, lamb; he-goat, goat, kid.
   Of the flying animals, of pigeons we only hear of two young ones; of
   turtle doves only of a pair.  He, then, who would accurately understand
   the spiritual rationale of the sacrifices must enquire of what heavenly
   things these were the pattern and the shadow, and also for what end the
   sacrifice of each victim is prescribed, and he must specially collect
   the points connected with the lamb.  Now that the principle of the
   sacrifice must be apprehended with reference to certain heavenly
   mysteries, appears from the words of the Apostle, who somewhere [4955]
   says, "Who serve a pattern and shadow of heavenly things," and again,
   "It was necessary that the patterns of the things in the heavens should
   be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better
   sacrifices than these."  Now to find out all the particulars of these
   and to state in its relation to them that sacrifice of the spiritual
   law which took place in Jesus Christ (a truth greater than human nature
   can comprehend)--to do this belongs to no other than the perfect man,
   [4956] who, by reason of use, has his senses exercised to discern good
   and evil, and who is able to say, from a truth-loving disposition,
   [4957] "We speak wisdom among them that are perfect."  Of these things
   truly and things like these, we can say, [4958] "Which none of the
   rulers of this world knew."

   33.  A Lamb Was Offered at the Morning and Evening Sacrifice.
   Significance of This.

   Now we find the lamb offered in the continual (daily) sacrifice.  Thus
   it is written, [4959] "This is that which thou shalt offer upon the
   altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually, for a
   continual sacrifice.  The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning, and
   the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and a tenth part of fine flour
   mingled with beaten oil, the fourth part of a hin; and for a
   drink-offering the fourth part of a bin of wine to the first lamb.  And
   the other lamb thou shalt offer in the evening, according to the first
   sacrifice and according to its drink-offering.  Thou shalt offer a
   sweet savour, an offering to the Lord, a continual burnt offering
   throughout your generations at the door of tent of witness before the
   Lord, where I will make myself known to thee, to speak unto thee.  And
   I will appoint thee for the children of Israel, and I will be
   sanctified in my glory, and with sanctification I will sanctify the
   tent of witness."  But what other continual sacrifice can there be to
   the man of reason in the world of mind, but the Word growing to
   maturity, the Word who is symbolically called a lamb and who is offered
   as soon as the soul receives illumination.  This would be the continual
   sacrifice of the morning, and it is offered again when the sojourn of
   the mind with divine things comes to an end.  For it cannot maintain
   for ever its intercourse with higher things, seeing that the soul is
   appointed to be yoked together with the body which is of earth and
   heavy.

   34.  The Morning and Evening Sacrifices of the Saint in His Life of
   Thought.

   But if any one asks what the saint is to do in the time between morning
   and evening, let him follow what takes place in the cultus and infer
   from it the principle he asks for.  In that case the priests begin
   their offerings with the continual sacrifice, and before they come to
   the continuous one of the evening they offer the other sacrifices which
   the law prescribes, as, for example, that for transgression, or that
   for involuntary offences, or that connected with a prayer for
   salvation, or that of jealousy, or that of the Sabbath, or of the new
   moon, and so on, which it would take too long to mention.  So we,
   beginning our oblation with the discourse of that type which is Christ,
   can go on to discourse about many other most useful things.  And
   drawing to a close still in the things of Christ, we come, as it were,
   to evening and night, when we arrive at the bodily features of His
   manifestation.

   35.  Jesus is a Lamb in Respect of His Human Nature.

   If we enquire further into the significance of Jesus being pointed out
   by John, when he says, "This is the Lamb of God which taketh away the
   sin of the world," we may take our stand at the dispensation of the
   bodily advent of the Son of God in human life, and in that case we
   shall conceive the lamb to be no other than the man.  For the man "was
   led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb, dumb before his
   shearers," [4960] saying, "I was as like a gentle lamb led to the
   slaughter." [4961]   Hence, too, in the Apocalypse [4962] a lamb is
   seen, standing as if slain.  This slain lamb has been made, according
   to certain hidden reasons, a purification of the whole world, for
   which, according to the Father's love to man, He submitted to death,
   purchasing us back by His own blood from him who had got us into his
   power, sold under sin.  And He who led this lamb to the slaughter was
   God in man, the great High-Priest, as he shows by the words: [4963]
   "No one taketh My life away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.  I
   have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again."

   36.  Of the Death of the Martyrs Considered as a Sacrifice, and in What
   Way It Operates to the Benefit of Others.

   Akin to this sacrifice are the others of which the sacrifices of the
   law are symbols, and another kind of sacrifice also appears to me to be
   of the same nature; namely, the shedding of the blood of the noble
   martyrs, whom the disciple John saw, for this is not without
   significance, standing beside the heavenly altar.  "Who is wise, [4964]
   and he shall understand these things, prudent, and he shall know
   them?"  It is a matter of higher speculation to consider even slightly
   the rationale of those sacrifices which cleanse those for whom they are
   offered.  Jephthah's sacrifice of his daughter should receive
   attention; it was by vowing it that he conquered the children of Ammon,
   and the victim approved his vow, for when her father said, [4965] "I
   have opened my mouth unto the Lord against thee," she answered, "If
   thou hast opened thy mouth unto the Lord against me, do that which thou
   hast vowed."  The story suggests that the being must be a very cruel
   one to whom such sacrifices are offered for the salvation of men; and
   we require some breadth of mind and some ability to solve the
   difficulties raised against Providence, to be able to account for such
   things and to see that they are mysteries and exceed our human nature.
   Then we shall say, [4966] "Great are the judgments of God, and hard to
   be described; for this cause untutored souls have gone astray."  Among
   the Gentiles, too, it is recorded that many a one, when pestilential
   disease broke out in his country, offered himself a victim for the
   public good.  That this was the case the faithful Clement assumes,
   [4967] on the faith of the narratives, to whom Paul bears witness when
   he says, [4968] "With Clement also, and the others, my
   fellow-labourers, whose names are in the book of life."  If there is
   anything in these narratives that appears incongruous to one who is
   minded to carp at mysteries revealed to few, the same difficulty
   attaches to the office that was laid on the martyrs, for it was God's
   will that we should rather endure all the dreadful reproaches connected
   with confessing Him as God, than escape for a short time from such
   sufferings (which men count evil) by allowing ourselves by our words to
   conform to the will of the enemies of the truth.  We are, therefore,
   led to believe that the powers of evil do suffer defeat by the death of
   the holy martyrs; as if their patience, their confession, even unto
   death, and their zeal for piety blunted the edge of the onset of evil
   powers against the sufferer, and their might being thus dulled and
   exhausted, many others of those whom they had conquered raised their
   heads and were set free from the weight with which the evil powers
   formerly oppressed and injured them.  And even the martyrs themselves
   are no longer involved in suffering, even though those agents which
   formerly wrought ill to others are not exhausted; for he who has
   offered such a sacrifice overcomes the power which opposed him, as I
   may show by an illustration which is suited to this subject.  He who
   destroys a poisonous animal, or lulls it to sleep with charms, or by
   any means deprives it of its venom, he does good to many who would
   otherwise have suffered from that animal had it not been destroyed, or
   charmed, or emptied of its venom.  Moreover, if one of those who were
   formerly bitten should come to know of this, and should be cured of his
   malady and look upon the death of that which injured him, or tread on
   it, or touch it when dead, or taste a part of it, then he, who was
   formerly a sufferer, would owe cure and benefit to the destroyer of the
   poisonous animal.  In some such way must we suppose the death of the
   most holy martyrs to operate, many receiving benefit from it by an
   influence we cannot describe.

   37.  Of the Effects of the Death of Christ, of His Triumph After It,
   and of the Removal by His Death of the Sins of Men.

   We have lingered over this subject of the martyrs and over the record
   of those who died on account of pestilence, because this lets us see
   the excellence of Him who was led as a sheep to the slaughter and was
   dumb as a lamb before the shearer.  For if there is any point in these
   stories of the Greeks, and if what we have said of the martyrs is well
   founded,--the Apostles, too, were for the same reason the filth of the
   world and the offscouring of all things, [4969] --what and how great
   things must be said of the Lamb of God, who was sacrificed for this
   very reason, that He might take away the sin not of a few but of the
   whole world, for the sake of which also He suffered?  If any one sin,
   we read, [4970] "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
   righteous; and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours
   only, but for those of the whole world," since He is the Saviour of all
   men, [4971] especially of them that believe, who [4972] blotted out the
   written bond that was against us by His own blood, and took it out of
   the way, so that not even a trace, not even of our blotted-out sins,
   might still be found, and nailed it to His cross; who having put off
   from Himself the principalities and powers, made a show of them openly,
   triumphing over them by His cross.  And we are taught to rejoice when
   we suffer afflictions in the world, knowing the ground of our rejoicing
   to be this, that the world has been conquered and has manifestly been
   subjected to its conqueror.  Hence all the nations, released from their
   former rulers, serve Him, because He [4973] saved the poor from his
   tyrant by His own passion, and the needy who had no helper.  This
   Saviour, then, having humbled the calumniator by humbling Himself,
   abides with the visible sun before His illustrious church, tropically
   called the moon, from generation to generation.  And having by His
   passion destroyed His enemies, He who is strong in battle and a mighty
   Lord [4974] required after His mighty deeds a purification which could
   only be given Him by His Father alone; and this is why He forbids Mary
   to touch Him, saying, [4975] "Touch Me not, for I am not yet ascended
   to My Father; but go and tell My disciples, I go to My Father and your
   Father, to My God and your God."  And when He comes, loaded with
   victory and with trophies, with His body which has risen from the
   dead,--for what other meaning can we see in the words, "I am not yet
   ascended to My Father," and "I go unto My Father,"--then there are
   certain powers which say, Who is this that cometh from Edom, red
   garments from Bosor; this that is beautiful? [4976]   Then those who
   escort Him say to those that are upon the heavenly gates, [4977] "Lift
   up your gates, ye rulers, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors,
   and the king of glory shall come in."  But they ask again, seeing as it
   were His right hand red with blood and His whole person covered with
   the marks of His valour, "Why are Thy garments red, and Thy clothes
   like the treading of the full winefat when it is trodden?"  And to this
   He answers, "I have crushed them."  For this cause He had need to wash
   "His robe in wine, and His garment in the blood of the grape." [4978]
   For when He had taken up our infirmities and carried our diseases, and
   had borne the sin of the whole world, and had conferred blessings on so
   many, then, perhaps, He received that baptism which is greater than any
   that could ever be conceived among men, and of which I think He speaks
   when He says, [4979] "I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how am
   I straitened till it be accomplished?"  I enquire here with boldness
   and I challenge the ideas put forward by most writers.  They say that
   the greatest baptism, beyond which no greater can be conceived, is His
   passion.  But if this be so, why should He say to Mary after it, "Touch
   Me not"?  He should rather have offered Himself to her touch, when by
   His passion He had received His perfect baptism.  But if it was the
   case, as we said before, that after all His deeds of valour done
   against His enemies, He had need to wash "His robe in wine, His garment
   in the blood of the grape," then He was on His way up to the husbandman
   of the true vine, the Father, so that having washed there and after
   having gone up on high, He might lead captivity captive and come down
   bearing manifold gifts--the tongues, as of fire, which were divided to
   the Apostles, and the holy angels which are to be present with them in
   each action and to deliver them.  For before these economies they were
   not yet cleansed and angels could not dwell with them, for they too
   perhaps do not desire to be with those who have not prepared themselves
   nor been cleansed by Jesus.  For it was of Jesus' benignity alone that
   He ate and drank with publicans and sinners, and suffered the penitent
   woman who was a sinner to wash His feet with her tears, and went down
   even to death for the ungodly, counting it not robbery to be equal with
   God, and emptied Himself, assuming the form of a servant.  And in
   accomplishing all this He fulfils rather the will of the Father who
   gave Him up for sinners than His own.  For the Father is good, but the
   Saviour is the image of His goodness; and doing good to the world in
   all things, since God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself,
   which formerly for its wickedness was all enemy to Him, He accomplishes
   His good deeds in order and succession, and does not all at once take
   all His enemies for His footstool.  For the Father says to Him, to the
   Lord of us all, [4980] "Sit Thou on My right hand, until I make Thy
   enemies the footstool of Thy feet."  And this goes on till the last
   enemy, Death, is overcome by Him.  And if we consider what is meant by
   this subjection to Christ and find an explanation of this mainly from
   the saying, [4981] "When all things shall have been put under Him, then
   shall the Son Himself be subjected to Him who put all things under
   Him," then we shall see how the conception agrees with the goodness of
   the God of all, since it is that of the Lamb of God, taking away the
   sin of the world.  Not all men's sin, however, is taken away by the
   Lamb of God, not the sin of those who do not grieve and suffer
   affliction till it be taken away.  For thorns are not only fixed but
   deeply rooted in the hand of every one who is intoxicated by wickedness
   and has parted with sobriety, as it is said in the Proverbs, [4982]
   "Thorns grow in the hand of the drunkard," and what pain they must
   cause him who has admitted such growth in the substance of his soul, it
   is hard even to tell.  Who has allowed wickedness to establish itself
   so deeply in his soul as to be a ground full of thorns, he must be cut
   down by the quick and powerful word of God, which is sharper than a
   two-edged sword, and which is more caustic than any fire.  To such a
   soul that fire must be sent which finds out thorns, and by its divine
   virtue stands where they are and does not also burn up the
   threshing-floors or standing corn.  But of the Lamb which takes away
   the sin of the world and begins to do so by His own death there are
   several ways, some of which are capable of being clearly understood by
   most, but others are concealed from most, and are known to those only
   who are worthy of divine wisdom.  Why should we count up all the ways
   by which we come to believe among men?  That is a thing which every one
   living in the body is able to see for himself.  And in the ways in
   which we believe in these also, sin is taken away; by afflictions and
   evil spirits and dangerous diseases and grievous sicknesses.  And who
   knows what follows after this?  So much as we have said was not
   unnecessary--we could not neglect the thought which is so clearly
   connected with that of the words, "Behold the Lamb of God that taketh
   away the sin of the world," and had therefore to attend somewhat
   closely to this part of our subject.  This has brought us to see that
   God convicts some by His wrath and chastens them by His anger, since
   His love to men is so great that He will not leave any without
   conviction and chastening; so that we should do what in us lies to be
   spared such conviction and such chastening by the sorest trials.

   38.  The World, of Which the Sin is Taken Away, is Said to Be the
   Church.  Reasons for Not Agreeing with This Opinion.

   The reader will do well to consider what was said above and illustrated
   from various quarters on the question what is meant in Scripture by the
   word "world"; and I think it proper to repeat this.  I am aware that a
   certain scholar understands by the world the Church alone, since the
   Church is the adornment of the world, [4983] and is said to be the
   light of the world.  "You," he says, [4984] "are the light of the
   world."  Now, the adornment of the world is the Church, Christ being
   her adornment, who is the first light of the world.  We must consider
   if Christ is said to be the light of the same world as His disciples.
   When Christ is the light of the world, perhaps it is meant that He is
   the light of the Church, but when His disciples are the light of the
   world, perhaps they are the light of others who call on the Lord,
   others in addition to the Church, as Paul says on this point in the
   beginning of his first Epistle to the Corinthians, where he writes, "To
   the Church of God, with all who call on the name of the Lord Jesus
   Christ."  Should any one consider that the Church is called the light
   of the world, meaning thereby of the rest of the race of men, including
   unbelievers, this may be true if the assertion is taken prophetically
   and theologically; but if it is to be taken of the present, we remind
   him that the light of a thing illuminates that thing, and would ask him
   to show how the remainder of the race is illuminated by the Church's
   presence in the world.  If those who hold the view in question cannot
   show this, then let them consider if our interpretation is not a sound
   one, that the light is the Church, and the world those others who call
   on the Name.  The words which follow the above in Matthew will point
   out to the careful enquirer the proper interpretation.  "You," it is
   said, "are the salt of the earth," the rest of mankind being conceived
   as the earth, and believers are their salt; it is because they believe
   that the earth is preserved.  For the end will come if the salt loses
   its savour, and ceases to salt and preserve the earth, since it is
   clear that if iniquity is multiplied and love waxes cold upon the
   earth, [4985] as the Saviour Himself uttered an expression of doubt as
   to those who would witness His coming, saying, [4986] "When the Son of
   man cometh, shall He find faith upon the earth?" then the end of the
   age will come.  Supposing, then, the Church to be called the world,
   since the Saviour's light shines on it--we have to ask in connection
   with the text, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of
   the world," whether the world here is to be taken intellectually of the
   Church, and the taking away of sin is limited to the Church.  In that
   case what are we to make of the saying of the same disciple with regard
   to the Saviour, as the propitiation for sin?  "If any man sin," we
   read, "we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous;
   and He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for our sins only, but
   for the sins of the whole world?"  Paul's dictum appears to me to be to
   the same effect, when he says, [4987] "Who is the Saviour of all men,
   especially of the faithful."  Again, Heracleon, dealing with our
   passage, declares, without any proof or any citation of witnesses to
   that effect, that the words, "Lamb of God," are spoken by John as a
   prophet, but the words, "who taketh away the sin of the world," by John
   as more than a prophet.  The former expression he considers to be used
   of His body, but the latter of Him who was in that body, because the
   lamb is an imperfect member of the genus sheep; the same being true of
   the body as compared with the dweller in it.  Had he meant to attribute
   perfection to the body he would have spoken of a ram as about to be
   sacrificed.  After the careful discussions given above, I do not think
   it necessary to enter into repetitions on this passage, or to
   controvert Heracleon's careless utterances.  One point only may be
   noted, that as the world was scarcely able to contain Him who had
   emptied Himself, it required a lamb and not a ram, that its sin might
   be taken away.

   Tenth Book.

   1.  Jesus Comes to Capernaum.  Statements of the Four Evangelists
   Regarding This.

   "After this [4988] He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His
   brothers and His disciples; and there they abode not many days.  And
   the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
   and He found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves,
   and the changers of money sitting, and He made a sort of scourge of
   cords, and cast them all out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen,
   and He poured out the small money of the changers and overthrew their
   tables, and to those that sold the doves He said, Take these things
   hence; make not My Father's house a house of merchandize.  Then His
   disciples remembered that it was written, that the zeal of thy house
   shall eat me up.  The Jews therefore answered and said unto Him, What
   sign showest Thou unto us, that Thou doest such things?  Jesus answered
   and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
   it up.  The Jews therefore answered, Forty-six years was this temple in
   building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?  But He spoke of the
   temple of His body.  When therefore He rose from the dead, His
   disciples remembered that He said this, and they believed the Scripture
   and the word which Jesus said.  Now when He was at Jerusalem at the
   passover at the feast, many believed in His name, beholding His signs
   which He did.  But Jesus Himself did not trust Himself to them, for
   that He knew all men, and because He had no need that any should bear
   witness concerning man.  For He Himself knew what was in man."

   The numbers which are recorded in the book of that name [4989] obtained
   a place in Scripture in accordance with some principle which determines
   their proportion to each thing.  We ought therefore to enquire whether
   the book of Moses which is called Numbers teaches us, should we be able
   to trace it out, in some special way, the principle with regard to this
   matter.  This remark I make to you at the outset of my tenth book, for
   in many passages of Scripture I have observed the number ten to have a
   peculiar privilege, and you may consider carefully whether the hope is
   justified that this volume will bring you from God some special
   benefit.  That this may prove to be the case, we will seek to yield
   ourselves as fully as we can to God, who loves to bestow His choicest
   gifts.  The book begins at the words:  "After this He went down to
   Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples, and
   there they abode not many days."  The other three Evangelists say that
   the Lord, after His conflict with the devil, departed into Galilee.
   Matthew and Luke represent that he was first at Nazara, [4990] and then
   left them and came and dwelt in Capernaum.  Matthew and Mark also state
   a certain reason why He departed thither, namely, that He had heard
   that John was cast into prison.  The words are as follows:  Matthew
   says, [4991] "Then the devil leaveth Him, and behold, angels came and
   ministered unto Him.  But when He heard that John was delivered up, He
   departed into Galilee, and leaving Nazareth He came and dwelt at
   Capernaum on the seashore in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali, that
   it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
   The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali;" and after the quotation
   from Isaiah:  "From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent
   ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."  Mark has the following:
   [4992]   "And He was in the desert forty days and forty nights tempted
   by Satan, and He was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered
   unto Him.  But after John was delivered up Jesus came into Galilee,
   preaching the Gospel of God, that the time is fulfilled and the kingdom
   of God is at hand; repent ye, and believe in the Gospel."  Then after
   the narrative about Andrew and Peter and James and John, Mark writes:
   "And He entered into Capernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath He was
   teaching in the synagogue."  Luke has, [4993] "And having finished the
   temptation the devil departed from Him for a season.  And Jesus
   returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and a fame went out
   concerning Him into all the region round about, and He taught in their
   synagogues being glorified of all.  And He came to Nazara, where He had
   been brought up, and He entered as His custom was into the synagogue on
   the Sabbath day."  Then Luke [4994] gives what He said at Nazara, and
   how those in the synagogue were enraged at Him and cast Him out of the
   city and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their cities were
   built, to cast Him down headlong, and how going through the midst of
   them the Lord went His way; and with this he connects the statement,
   "And He came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching
   them on the Sabbath day."

   2.  The Discrepancy Between John and the First Three Gospels at This
   Part of the Narrative, Literally Read, the Narratives Cannot Be
   Harmonized: They Must Be Interpreted Spiritually.

   The truth of these matters must lie in that which is seen by the mind.
   If the discrepancy between the Gospels is not solved, we must give up
   our trust in the Gospels, as being true and written by a divine spirit,
   or as records worthy of credence, for both these characters are held to
   belong to these works.  Those who accept the four Gospels, and who do
   not consider that their apparent discrepancy is to be solved
   anagogically (by mystical interpretation), will have to clear up the
   difficulty, raised above, about the forty days of the temptation, a
   period for which no room can be found in any way in John's narrative;
   and they will also have to tell us when it was that the Lord came to
   Capernaum.  If it was after the six days of the period of His baptism,
   the sixth being that of the marriage at Cana of Galilee, then it is
   clear that the temptation never took place, and that He never was at
   Nazara, and that John was not yet delivered up.  Now, after Capernaum,
   where He abode not many days, the passover of the Jews was at hand, and
   He went up to Jerusalem, where He cast the sheep and oxen out of the
   temple, and poured out the small change of the bankers.  In Jerusalem,
   too, it appears that Nicodemus, the ruler and Pharisee, first came to
   Him by night, and heard what we may read in the Gospel.  "After these
   things, [4995] Jesus came, and His disciples, into the land of Judæa,
   and there He tarried with them and baptized, at the same time at which
   John also was baptizing in Ænon near Salim, because there were many
   waters there, and they came and were baptized; for John was not yet
   cast into prison."  On this occasion, too, there was a questioning on
   the part of John's disciples with the Jews about purification, and they
   came to John, saying of the Saviour, "Behold, He baptizeth, and all
   come to Him."  They had heard words from the Baptist, the exact tenor
   of which it is better to take from Scripture itself.  Now, if we ask
   when Christ was first in Capernaum, our respondents, if they follow the
   words of Matthew, and of the other two, will say, After the temptation,
   when, "leaving Nazareth, He came and dwelt in Capernaum by the sea."
   But how can they show both the statements to be true, that of Matthew
   and Mark, that it was because He heard that John was delivered up that
   He departed into Galilee, and that of John, [4996] found there, after a
   number of other transactions, subsequent to His stay at Capernaum,
   after His going to Jerusalem, and His journey from there to Judæa, that
   John was not yet cast into prison, but was baptizing in Ænon near
   Salim?  There are many other points on which the careful student of the
   Gospels will find that their narratives do not agree; and these we
   shall place before the reader, according to our power, as they occur.
   The student, staggered at the consideration of these things, will
   either renounce the attempt to find all the Gospels true, and not
   venturing to conclude that all our information about our Lord is
   untrustworthy, will choose at random one of them to be his guide; or he
   will accept the four, and will consider that their truth is not to be
   sought for in the outward and material letter.

   3.  What We are to Think of the Discrepancies Between the Different
   Gospels.

   We must, however, try to obtain some notion of the intention of the
   Evangelists in such matters, and we direct ourselves to this.  Suppose
   there are several men who, by the spirit, see God, and know His words
   addressed to His saints, and His presence which He vouchsafes to them,
   appearing to them at chosen times for their advancement.  There are
   several such men, and they are in different places, and the benefits
   they receive from above vary in shape and character.  And let these men
   report, each of them separately, what he sees in spirit about God and
   His words, and His appearances to His saints, so that one of them
   speaks of God's appearances and words and acts to one righteous man in
   such a place, and another about other oracles and great works of the
   Lord, and a third of something else than what the former two have dealt
   with.  And let there be a fourth, doing with regard to some particular
   matter something of the same kind as these three.  And let the four
   agree with each other about something the Spirit has suggested to them
   all, and let them also make brief reports of other matters besides that
   one; then their narratives will fall out something on this wise:  God
   appeared to such a one at such a time and in such a place, and did to
   him thus and thus; as if He had appeared to him in such a form, and had
   led him by the hand to such a place, and then done to him thus and
   thus.  The second will report that God appeared at the very time of the
   foresaid occurrences, in a certain town, to a person who is named, a
   second person, and in a place far removed from that of the former
   account, and he will report a different set of words spoken at the same
   time to this second person.  And let the same be supposed to be the
   case with the third and with the fourth.  And let them, as we said,
   agree, these witnesses who report true things about God, and about His
   benefits conferred on certain men, let them agree with each other in
   some of the narratives they report.  He, then, who takes the writings
   of these men for history, or for a representation of real things by a
   historical image, and who supposes God to be within certain limits in
   space, and to be unable to present to several persons in different
   places several visions of Himself at the same time, or to be making
   several speeches at the same moment, he will deem it impossible that
   our four writers are all speaking truth.  To him it is impossible that
   God, who is in certain limits in space, could at the same set time be
   saying one thing to one man and another to another, and that He should
   be doing a thing and the opposite thing as well, and, to put it
   bluntly, that He should be both sitting and standing, should one of the
   writers represent Him as standing at the time, and making a certain
   speech in such a place to such a man, while a second writer speaks of
   Him as sitting.
     __________________________________________________________________

   4.  Scripture Contains Many Contradictions, and Many Statements Which
   are Not Literally True, But Must Be Read Spiritually and Mystically.

   In the case I have supposed where the historians desire to teach us by
   an image what they have seen in their mind, their meaning would be
   found, if the four were wise, to exhibit no disagreement; and we must
   understand that with the four Evangelists it is not otherwise.  They
   made full use for their purpose of things done by Jesus in the exercise
   of His wonderful and extraordinary power; they use in the same way His
   sayings, and in some places they tack on to their writing, with
   language apparently implying things of sense, things made manifest to
   them in a purely intellectual way.  I do not condemn them if they even
   sometimes dealt freely with things which to the eye of history happened
   differently, and changed them so as to subserve the mystical aims they
   had in view; so as to speak of a thing which happened in a certain
   place, as if it had happened in another, or of what took place at a
   certain time, as if it had taken place at another time, and to
   introduce into what was spoken in a certain way some changes of their
   own.  They proposed to speak the truth where it was possible both
   materially and spiritually, and where this was not possible it was
   their intention to prefer the spiritual to the material.  The spiritual
   truth was often preserved, as one might say, in the material
   falsehood.  As, for example, we might judge of the story of Jacob and
   Esau. [4997]   Jacob says to Isaac, "I am Esau thy firstborn son," and
   spiritually he spoke the truth, for he already partook of the rights of
   the first-born, which were perishing in his brother, and clothing
   himself with the goatskins he assumed the outward semblance of Esau,
   and was Esau all but the voice praising God, so that Esau might
   afterward find a place to receive a blessing.  For if Jacob had not
   been blessed as Esau, neither would Esau perhaps have been able to
   receive a blessing of his own.  And Jesus too is many things, according
   to the conceptions of Him, of which it is quite likely that the
   Evangelists took up different notions; while yet they were in agreement
   with each other in the different things they wrote.  Statements which
   are verbally contrary to each other, are made about our Lord, namely,
   that He was descended from David and that He was not descended from
   David.  The statement is true, "He was descended from David," as the
   Apostle says, [4998] "born of the seed of David according to the
   flesh," if we apply this to the bodily part of Him; but the self-same
   statement is untrue if we understand His being born of the seed of
   David of His diviner power; for He was declared to be the Son of God
   with power.  And for this reason too, perhaps, the sacred prophecies
   speak of Him now as a servant, and now as a Son.  They call Him a
   servant on account of the form of a servant which he wore, and because
   He was of the seed of David, but they call Him the Son of God according
   to His character as first-born.  Thus it is true to call Him man and to
   call Him not man; man, because He was capable of death; not man, on
   account of His being diviner than man.  Marcion, I suppose, took sound
   words in a wrong sense, when he rejected His birth from Mary, and
   declared that as to His divine nature He was not born of Mary, and
   hence made bold to delete from the Gospel the passages which have this
   effect.  And a like fate seems to have overtaken those who make away
   with His humanity and receive His deity alone; and also those opposites
   of these who cancel His deity and confess Him as a man to be a holy
   man, and the most righteous of all men.  And those who hold the
   doctrine of Dokesis, not remembering that He humbled Himself even unto
   death [4999] and became obedient even to the cross, but only imagining
   in Him the absence of suffering, the superiority to all such accidents,
   they do what they can to deprive us of the man who is more just than
   all men, and are left with a figure which cannot save them, for as by
   one man came death, so also by one man is the justification of life.
   We could not have received such benefit as we have from the Logos had
   He not assumed the man, had He remained such as He was from the
   beginning with God the Father, and had He not taken up man, the first
   man of all, the man more precious than all others, purer than all
   others and capable of receiving Him.  But after that man we also shall
   be able to receive Him, to receive Him so great and of such nature as
   He was, if we prepare a place in proportion to Him in our soul.  So
   much I have said of the apparent discrepancies in the Gospels, and of
   my desire to have them treated in the way of spiritual interpretation.

   5.  Paul Also Makes Contradictory Statements About Himself, and Acts in
   Opposite Ways at Different Times.

   On the same passage one may also make use of such an example as that of
   Paul, who at one place [5000] says that he is carnal, sold under sin,
   and thus was not able to judge anything, while in another place he is
   the spiritual man who is able to judge all things and himself to be
   judged by no man.  Of the carnal one are the words, "Not what I would
   that do I practise, but what I hate that do I."  And he too who was
   caught up to the third heaven and heard unspeakable words [5001] is a
   different Paul from him who says, Of such an one I will glory, but of
   myself I will not glory.  If he becomes [5002] to the Jews as a Jew
   that he may gain the Jews, and to those under the law as under the law
   that he may gain those under the law, and to them that are without law
   as without law, not being without law to God, but under law to Christ,
   that he may gain those without law, and if to the weak he becomes weak
   that he may gain the weak, it is clear that these statements must be
   examined each by itself, that he becomes a Jew, and that sometimes he
   is under the law and at another time without law, and that sometimes he
   is weak.  Where, for example, he says something by way of permission
   [5003] and not by commandment, there we may recognize that he is weak;
   for who, he says, [5004] is weak, and I am not weak?  When he shaves
   his head and makes an offering, [5005] or when he circumcises Timothy,
   [5006] he is a Jew; but when he says to the Athenians, [5007] "I found
   an altar with the inscription, To the unknown God.  That, then, which
   ye worship not knowing it, that declare I unto you," and, "As also some
   of your own poets have said, For we also are His offspring," then he
   becomes to those without the law as without the law, adjuring the least
   religious of men to espouse religion, and turning to his own purpose
   the saying of the poet, "From Love do we begin; his race are we."
   [5008]   And instances might perhaps be found where, to men not Jews
   and yet under the law, he is under the law.

   6.  Different Accounts of the Call of Peter, and of the Imprisonment of
   the Baptist.  The Meaning of "Capernaum."

   These examples may be serviceable to illustrate statements not only
   about the Saviour, but about the disciples too, for here also there is
   some discrepancy of statement.  For there is a difference in thought
   perhaps between Simon who is found by his own brother Andrew, and who
   is addressed "Thou shalt be called Cephas," [5009] and him who is seen
   by Jesus when walking by the sea of Galilee, [5010] along with his
   brother, and addressed conjointly with that brother, "Come after Me,
   and I will make you fishers of men."  There was some fitness in the
   fact that the writer who goes more to the root of the matter and tells
   of the Word becoming flesh, and hence does not record the human
   generation of the Word who was in the beginning with God, should not
   tell us of Simon's being found at the seashore and called away from
   there, but of his being found by his brother who had been staying with
   Jesus at the tenth hour, and of his receiving the name Cephas in
   connection with his being thus found out.  If he was seen by Jesus when
   walking by the sea of Galilee, it would scarcely be on a later occasion
   that he was addressed, "Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build
   My church."  With John again the Pharisees know Jesus to be baptizing
   with His disciples, [5011] adding this to His other great activities;
   but the Jesus of the three does not baptize at all.  John the Baptist,
   too, with the Evangelist of the same name, goes on a long time without
   being cast into prison.  With Matthew, on the contrary, he is put in
   prison almost at the time of the temptation of Jesus, and this is the
   occasion of Jesus retiring to Galilee, to avoid being put in prison.
   But in John there is nothing at all about John's being put in prison.
   Who is so wise and so able as to learn all the things that are recorded
   about Jesus in the four Evangelists, and both to understand each
   incident by itself, and have a connected view of all His sojournings
   and words and acts at each place?  As for the passage presently before
   us, it gives in the order of events that on the sixth day the Saviour,
   after the business of the marriage at Cana of Galilee, went down with
   His mother and His brothers and His disciples to Capernaum, which means
   "field of consolation."  For after the feasting and the wine it was
   fitting that the Saviour should come to the field of consolation with
   His mother and His disciples, to console those whom He was training for
   disciples and the soul which had conceived Him by the Holy Ghost, with
   the fruits which were to stand in that full field.

   7.  Why His Brothers are Not Called to the Wedding; And Why He Abides
   at Capernaum Not Many Days.

   But we must ask why His brothers are not called to the wedding:  they
   were not there, for it is not said they were; but they go down to
   Capernaum with Him and His mother and His disciples.  We must also
   examine why on this occasion they do not "go in to" Capernaum, nor "go
   up to," but "go down to" it.  Consider if we must not understand by His
   brothers here the powers which went down along with Him, not called to
   the wedding according to the explanations given above, since it is in
   lower and humbler places than those who are called disciples of Christ,
   and in another way, that these brothers receive assistance.  For if His
   mother is called, then there are some bearing fruit, and even to these
   the Lord goes down with the servants and disciples of the Word, to help
   such persons, His mother also being with Him.  Those indeed who are
   called Capernaum appear not to be able to allow Jesus and those who
   went down with Him to make a longer stay with them:  hence they remain
   with them not many days.  For the lower field of consolation does not
   admit the illumination of many doctrines, but is only capable of a
   few.  To get a clear view of the difference between those who receive
   Jesus for longer and for shorter time, we may compare with this, "They
   abode there not many days," the words recorded in Matthew as spoken by
   Christ when risen from the dead to His disciples who were being sent
   out to teach all nations, [5012] "Behold, I am with you always, even to
   the end of the world."  To those who are to know all that human nature
   can know while it still is here, is said with emphasis, "I am with
   you;" and as the rise of each new day upon the field of contemplation
   brings more days before the eyes of the blessed, therefore He says,
   "All the days till the end of the world."  As for those in Capernaum,
   on the contrary, to whom they go down as to the more needy, not only
   Jesus, but also His mother and His brothers and His disciples "abode
   there not many days."

   8.  How Christ Abides with Believers to the End of the Age, and Whether
   He Abides with Them After that Consummation.

   Some may very likely and not unreasonably ask, whether, when all the
   days of this age are over, there will no longer be any one to say, "Lo,
   I am with you," with those, namely, who received Him till the
   fulfilment of the age, for the "until" seems to indicate a certain
   limit of time.  To this we must say that the phrase, "I am with you,"
   is not the same as "I am in you."  We might say more properly that the
   Saviour was not in His disciples but with them, so long as they had not
   arrived in their minds at the consummation of the age.  But when they
   see to be at hand, as far as their effort is concerned, the
   consummation of the world which is crucified to them, then Jesus will
   be no longer with them, but in them, and they will say, "It is no
   longer I that live but Christ that lives in me," [5013] and "If ye seek
   a proof of Christ that speaketh in me." [5014]   In saying this we are
   keeping for our part also to the ordinary interpretation which makes
   the "always" the time down to the consummation of the age, and are not
   asking more than is attainable to human nature as it is here.  That
   interpretation may be adhered to and justice yet be done to the "I."
   He who is with His disciples who are sent out to teach all the nations,
   until the consummation, may be He who emptied Himself and took the form
   of a servant, and yet afterwards may be another in point of state;
   afterwards He may be such as He was before He emptied Himself, until
   all His enemies are made by His Father the footstool of His feet; and
   after this, when the Son has delivered up the kingdom to God and the
   Father, it may be the Father who says to them, "Behold, I am with
   you."  But whether it is "all the days" up to that time, or simply "all
   the days," or not "all days" but "every day," any one may consider that
   likes.  Our plan does not allow us at present to digress so far.

   9.  Heracleon Says that Jesus is Not Stated to Have Done Anything at
   Capernaum.  But in the Other Gospels He Does Many Things There.

   But Heracleon, dealing with the words, "After this He went down to
   Capernaum," declares that they indicate the introduction of another
   transaction, and that the word "went down" is not without
   significance.  "Capernaum," he says, "means these farthest-out parts of
   the world, these districts of matter, into which He descended, and
   because the place was not suitable, he says, He is not reported either
   to have done anything or said anything in it."  Now if the Lord had not
   been reported in the other Gospels either as having done or said
   anything at Capernaum, we might perhaps have hesitated whether this
   view ought or ought not to be received.  But that is far from being the
   case.  Matthew says our Lord left Nazareth and came and dwelt at
   Capernaum on the seaside, and that from that time He began to preach,
   saying, "Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."  And Mark,
   starting in his narrative [5015] from the temptation by the devil,
   relates that after John was cast into prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
   proclaiming the Gospel of God, and after the call of the four fishermen
   to the Apostleship, "they enter into Capernaum; and straightway on the
   Sabbath day He taught in the synagogue, and they were astonished at His
   doctrine."  And Mark records an action of Jesus also which took place
   at Capernaum, for he goes on to say, "In their synagogue there was a
   man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, saying, Ah! what have we
   to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?  Art Thou come to destroy us?
   We know Thee who Thou art, the Son of God.  And Jesus rebuked him,
   saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him; and the unclean spirit,
   tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.  And they
   were all amazed."  And at Capernaum Simon's mother-in-law is cured of
   her fever.  And Mark adds that when evening was come all those were
   cured who were sick and who were possessed with demons.  Luke's report
   is very like Mark's about Capernaum. [5016]   He says, "And He came to
   Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath
   day, and they were astonished at His teachings, for His word was with
   power.  And in the synagogue there was a man having a spirit of an
   unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, Ah! what have we to
   do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?  Hast Thou come to destroy us?  I
   know Thee who Thou art, the holy one of God.  And Jesus rebuked him,
   saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.  Then the demon having
   thrown him down in the midst, went out of him, doing him no harm."  And
   then Luke reports how the Lord rose up from the synagogue and went into
   the house of Simon, and rebuked the fever in his mother-in-law, and
   cured her of her disease; and after this cure, "when the sun was
   setting," he says, "all, as many as had persons sick with divers
   diseases, brought them to Him, and He laid his hands on each one of
   them and cured them.  And demons also went out from many, crying and
   saying, Thou art the Son of God, and He rebuked them and suffered them
   not to speak because they knew that He was the Christ."  We have
   presented all these statements as to the Saviour's sayings and doings
   at Capernaum in order to refute Heracleon's interpretation of our
   passage, "Hence He is not said to have done or to have spoken anything
   there."  He must either give two meanings to Capernaum, and show us his
   reasons for them, or if he cannot do this he must give up saying that
   the Saviour visited any place to no purpose.  We, for our part, should
   we come to passages where even a comparison of the other Gospels fails
   to show that Jesus' visit to this place or that was not accompanied by
   any results, will seek with the divine assistance to make it clear that
   His coming was not in vain.

   10.  Significance of Capernaum.

   Matthew for his part adds, [5017] that when the Lord had entered into
   Capernaum the centurion came to him, saying, "My boy is lying in my
   house sick of the palsy, grievously tormented," and after telling the
   Lord some more about him, received the reply, "Go, and as thou hast
   believed, so be it unto thee."  And Matthew then gives us the story of
   Peter's mother-in-law, in close agreement with the other two.  I
   conceive it to be a creditable piece of work and becoming to one who is
   anxious to hear about Christ, to collect from the four Gospels all that
   is related about Capernaum, and the discourses spoken, and the works
   done there, and how many visits the Lord paid to the place, and how, at
   one time, He is said to have gone down to it, and at another to have
   entered into it, and where He came from when He did so.  If we compare
   all these points together, we shall not go astray in the meaning we
   ascribe to Capernaum.  On the one hand, the sick are healed, and other
   works of power are done there, and on the other, the preaching, Repent
   ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand, begins there, and this
   appears to be a sign, as we showed when entering on this subject, of
   some more needy place of consolation, made so perhaps by Jesus, who
   comforted men by what He taught and by what He did there, in that place
   of consolation.  For we know that the names of places agree in their
   meaning with the things connected with Jesus; as Gergesa, where the
   citizens of these parts besought Him to depart out of their coasts,
   means, "The dwelling of the casters-out."  And this, also, we have
   noticed about Capernaum, that not only did the preaching, "Repent ye,
   for the kingdom of heaven is at hand," begin there, but that according
   to the three Evangelists Jesus performed there His first miracles.
   None of the three, however, added to the first wonders which he records
   as done in Capernaum, that note attached by John the disciple to the
   first work of Jesus, "This beginning of His signs did Jesus in Cana of
   Galilee."  For that which was done in Capernaum was not the beginning
   of the signs, since the leading sign of the Son of God was good cheer,
   and in the light of human experience it is also the most representative
   of Him.  For the Word of God does not show forth His own beauty so much
   in healing the sick, as in His tendering the temperate draught to make
   glad those who are in good health and are able to join in the banquet.

   11.  Why the Passover is Said to Be that of the "Jews."  Its
   Institution:  and the Distinction Between "Feasts of the Lord" And
   Feasts Not So Spoken of.

   "And the passover of the Jews was at hand." [5018]   Inquiring into the
   accuracy of the most wise John (on this passage), I put myself the
   question, What is indicated by the addition "of the Jews"?  Of what
   other nation was the passover a festival?  Would it not have been
   enough to say, "And the passover was at hand"?  It may, however, be the
   case that the human passover is one thing when kept by men not as
   Scripture intended, and that the divine passover is another thing, the
   true passover, observed in spirit and truth by those who worship God in
   spirit and in truth; and then the distinction indicated in the text may
   be that between the divine passover and that said to be of the Jews.
   We should attend to the passover law and observe what the Lord says of
   it when it is first mentioned in Scripture. [5019]   "And the Lord
   spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, This month is
   to you the beginning of months, it is the first for you among the
   months of the year.  Speak thou to all the congregation of the children
   of Israel, saying, On the tenth of this month shall every man take a
   sheep, according to the houses of your families;" then after some
   directions in which the word passover does not occur again, he adds,
   [5020] "Thus shall ye eat it, your loins girt and your shoes on your
   feet, and your staves in your hands, and ye shall eat it with haste.
   It is the passover of the Lord."  He does not say, "It is your
   passover."  And a little further on He names the festival again in the
   same way, [5021] "And it shall come to pass, when your sons say to you,
   What is this service?  And ye shall say to them, It is the sacrifice,
   the passover of the Lord, how He guarded the houses of the children of
   Israel."  And again, a little further on, [5022] "And the Lord spake to
   Moses and Aaron, saying, This is the law of the passover.  No alien
   shall eat of it."  And again in a little, [5023] "But if a proselyte
   come to you, and keep the passover of the Lord, every male of him shall
   be circumcised."  Observe that in the law we never find it said, "Your
   passover;" but in all the passages quoted the phrase occurs once
   without any adjunct, while we have three times "The passover of the
   Lord."  To make sure that there is such a distinction between the
   passover of the Lord and the passover of the Jews, we may consider the
   way in which Isaiah speaks of the matter: [5024]   "Your new moons and
   your Sabbaths and your great day I cannot bear; your fast and your
   holiday and your new moons and your feasts my soul hateth."  The Lord
   does not call them His own, these observances of sinners (they are
   hated of His soul, if such there be); neither the new moons, nor the
   Sabbaths, nor the great day, nor the fast, nor the festivals.  And in
   the legislation about the Sabbath in Exodus, we read, [5025] "And Moses
   said unto them, This is the word which the Lord spake, The Sabbath is a
   holy rest unto the Lord."  And a little further on, "And Moses said,
   Eat ye; for to-day is a Sabbath unto the Lord."  And in Numbers, [5026]
   before the sacrifices which are offered at each festival, as if all the
   festivals came under the law of the continuous and daily sacrifice, we
   find it written, "And the Lord spake unto Moses, Announce to the
   children of Israel, and thus shalt thou say unto them, My gifts, My
   offerings, My fruits for a smell of sweet savour, ye shall observe to
   offer unto Me at My festivals.  And thou shalt say unto them, These are
   the offerings which ye shall offer unto the Lord."  The festival set
   forth in Scripture He calls His own, not those of the people receiving
   the law, He speaks of His gifts, His offerings.  A similar way of
   speaking is that in Exodus with regard to the people; it is said by God
   to be His own people, when it does not sin; but in the section about
   the calf He abjures it and calls it the people of Moses. [5027]   On
   the one hand, "Thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Let My
   people go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness.  But if thou wilt
   not let My people go, behold, I will send against thee and against thy
   servants, and against thy people and against thy houses, the dog-fly;
   and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of the dog-fly, and on
   the land on which they are, against it will I send them.  And I will
   glorify on that day the land of Gesem, on which My people are; on it
   there shall be no dog-fly, that thou mayest know that I am the Lord,
   the Lord of all the earth.  And I will make a distinction between My
   people and thy people."  To Moses, on the other hand, He says, [5028]
   "Go, descend quickly, for thy people hath transgressed, which thou
   leddest out of the land of Egypt."  As, then, the people when it does
   not sin is the people of God, but when it sins is no longer spoken of
   as His, thus, also, the feasts when they are hated by the Lord's soul
   are said to be feasts of sinners, but when the law is given regarding
   them, they are called feasts of the Lord.  Now of these feasts passover
   is one, which in the passage before us is said to be that not of the
   Lord, but of the Jews.  In another passage, too, [5029] we find it
   said, "These are the feasts of the Lord, which ye shall call chosen,
   holy."  From the mouth of the Lord Himself, then, we see that there is
   no gainsaying our statement on this point.  Some one, no doubt, will
   ask about the words of the Apostle, where he writes to the Corinthians:
   [5030]   "For our Passover also was sacrificed for us, namely, Christ;"
   he does not say, "The Passover of the Lord was sacrificed, even
   Christ."  To this we must say, either that the Apostle simply calls the
   passover our passover because it was sacrificed for us, or that every
   sacrifice which is really the Lord's, and the passover is one of these,
   awaits its consummation not in this age nor upon earth, but in the
   coming age and in heaven when the kingdom of heaven appears.  As for
   those feasts, one of the twelve prophets says, [5031] "What will ye do
   in the days of assembly, and in the days of the feast of the Lord?"
   But Paul says in the Epistle to the Hebrews: [5032]   "But ye are come
   unto Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly
   Jerusalem, and to ten thousands of angels, the assembly and church of
   the firstborn, who are written in heaven."  And in the Epistle to the
   Colossians: [5033]   "Let no one judge you in meat and in drink, or in
   respect of a feast-day or a new moon, or a sabbath-day; which are a
   shadow of the things to come."

   12.  Of the Heavenly Festivals, of Which Those on Earth are Typical.

   Now in what manner, in those heavenly things of which the shadow was
   present to the Jews on earth, those will celebrate festivals who have
   first been trained by tutors and governors under the true law, until
   the fulness of the time should come, namely, above, when we shall be
   able to receive into ourselves the perfect measure of the Son of God,
   this it is the work of that wisdom to make plain which has been hidden
   in a mystery; and it also may show to our thought how the laws about
   meats are symbols of those things which will there nourish and
   strengthen our soul.  But it is vain to think that one desiring to work
   out in his fancy the great sea of such ideas, even if he wished to show
   how local worship is still a pattern and shadow of heavenly things, and
   that the sacrifices and the sheep are full of meaning, that he should
   advance further than the Apostle, who seeks indeed to lift our minds
   above earthly views of the law, but who does not show us to any extent
   how these things are to be.  Even if we look at the festivals, of which
   passover is one, from the point of view of the age to come, we have
   still to ask how it is that our passover is now sacrificed, namely,
   Christ, and not only so, but is to be sacrificed hereafter.
     __________________________________________________________________

   13.  Spiritual Meaning of the Passover.

   A few points may be added in connection with the doctrines now under
   consideration, though it would require a special discussion in many
   volumes to treat of all the mystical statements about the law, and
   specially of those connected with the festivals, and more particularly
   still with the passover.  The passover of the Jews consists of a sheep
   which is sacrificed, each taking a sheep according to his father's
   house; and the passover is accompanied by the slaughter of thousands of
   rams and goats, in proportion to the number of the houses of the
   people.  But our Passover is sacrificed for us, namely, Christ.
   Another feature of the Jewish festival is unleavened bread; all leaven
   is made to disappear out of their houses; but "we keep the feast [5034]
   not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness,
   but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."  Whether there
   be any passover and any feast of leaven beyond the two we have
   mentioned, is a point we must examine more carefully, since these serve
   for a pattern and a shadow of the heavenly ones we spoke of, and not
   only such things as food and drink and new moons and sabbaths, but the
   festivals also, are a shadow of the things to come.  In the first
   place, when the Apostle says, "Our passover is sacrificed, Christ," one
   may feel with regard to this such doubts as these.  If the sheep with
   the Jews is a type of the sacrifice of Christ, then one should have
   been offered and not a multitude, as Christ is one; or if many sheep
   were offered it is to follow out the type, as if many Christs were
   sacrificed.  But not to dwell on this, we may ask how the sheep, which
   was the victim, contains an image of Christ, when the sheep was
   sacrificed by men who were observing the law, but Christ was put to
   death by transgressors of the law, and what application can be found in
   Christ of the direction, [5035] "They shall eat the flesh this night,
   roast with fire, and unleavened bread on bitter herbs shall they eat,"
   and "Eat not of it raw, nor sodden with water, but roast with fire; the
   head with the feet and the entrails; ye shall not set any of it apart
   till the morning, and a bone thereof ye shall not break.  But that
   which is left thereof till the morning ye shall burn."  The sentence,
   "A bone of it ye shall not break," John appears to have made use of in
   his Gospel, as applying to the transactions connected with Christ, and
   connecting with them the occasion spoken of in the law when those
   eating the sheep are bidden not to break a bone of it.  He writes as
   follows: [5036]   "The soldiers therefore came and brake the legs of
   the first, and of the other who was crucified with him; but when they
   came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they brake not His
   legs, but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced His side, and
   straightway there came out blood and water.  And he that hath seen hath
   borne witness and his witness is true, and he knoweth that he sayeth
   truth that ye also may believe.  And these things took place that the
   Scripture might be fulfilled, "A bone of Him ye shall not break."
   There are a myriad other points besides this in the Apostle's language
   which would call for inquiry, both about the passover and the
   unleavened bread, but they would have to be dealt with, as we said
   above, in a special work of great length.  At present we can only give
   an epitome of them as they bear on the text presently before us, and
   aim at a short solution of the principal problem.  We call to mind the
   words, "This is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world,"
   for it is said of the passover, [5037] "Ye shall take it of the lambs
   or of the goats."  The Evangelist here agrees with Paul, and both are
   involved in the difficulties we spoke of above.  But on the other hand
   we have to say that if the Word became flesh, and the Lord says, [5038]
   "Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, ye
   have no life in you.  He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood,
   hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.  For My
   flesh is meat indeed and My blood is drink indeed.  He that eateth My
   flesh and drinketh My blood abideth in Me, and I in him,"--then the
   flesh thus spoken of is that of the Lamb that takes away the sin of the
   world; and this is the blood, some of which was to be put on the two
   side posts of the door, and on the lintels in the houses, in which we
   eat the passover.  Of the flesh of this Lamb it is necessary that we
   should eat in the time of the world, which is night, and the flesh is
   to be roast with fire, and eaten with unleavened bread; for the Word of
   God is not flesh and flesh only.  He says, in fact, Himself, [5039] "I
   am the bread of life," and "This is the bread of life which came down
   from heaven, that a man should eat of it, and not die.  I am the bread
   of life that came down from heaven; if a man eat of this bread, he
   shall live for ever."  We must not overlook, however, that by a loose
   use of words, any food is called bread, as we read in Moses in
   Deuteronomy, [5040] "Forty days He ate no bread and drank no water,"
   instead of, He took no food, either wet or dry.  I am led to this
   observation by John's saying, "And the bread which I will give is My
   flesh, for the life of the world."  Again, we eat the flesh of the
   Lamb, with bitter herbs, and unleavened bread, when we repent of our
   sins and grieve with the sorrow which is according to God, a repentance
   which operates for our salvation, and is not to be repented of; or
   when, on account of our trials, we turn to the speculations which are
   found to be those of truth, and are nourished by them.  We are not,
   however, to eat the flesh of the Lamb raw, as those do who are slaves
   of the letter, like irrational animals, and those who are enraged at
   men truly reasonable, because they desire to understand spiritual
   things; truly, they share the nature of savage beasts.  But we must
   strive to convert the rawness of Scripture into well-cooked food, not
   letting what is written grow flabby and wet and thin, as those do who
   have itching ears, [5041] and turn away their ears from the truth;
   their methods tend to a loose and flabby conduct of life.  But let us
   be of a fervent spirit and keep hold of the fiery words given to us of
   God, such as Jeremiah received from Him who spoke to him, [5042]
   "Behold, I have made My words in thy mouth like fire," and let us see
   that the flesh of the Lamb be well cooked, so that those who partake of
   it may say, as Christ speaks in us, "Our heart burned by the way, as He
   opened to us the Scriptures." [5043]   Further, if it is our duty to
   enquire into such a point as the roasting of the flesh of the Lamb with
   fire, we must not forget the parallel of what Jeremiah suffered on
   account of the words of God, as he says: [5044]   "And it was as a
   glowing fire, burning in my bones, and I am without any strength, and I
   cannot bear it."  But, in this eating, we must begin at the head, that
   is to say, at the principal and the most essential doctrines about
   heavenly things, and we must end at the feet, the last branches of
   learning which enquire as to the final nature in things, or about more
   material things, or about things under the earth, or about wicked
   spirits and unclean demons.  For it may be that the account of these
   things is not obvious, like themselves, but is laid away among the
   mysteries of Scripture, so that it may be called, tropically, the feet
   of the Lamb.  Nor must we fail to deal with the entrails, which are
   within and hidden from us; we must approach the whole of Scripture as
   one body, we must not lacerate nor break through the strong and
   well-knit connections which exist in the harmony of its whole
   composition, as those do who lacerate, so far as they can, the unity of
   the Spirit that is in all the Scriptures.  But this aforesaid prophecy
   of the Lamb is to be our nourishment only during the night of this dark
   life of ours; what comes after this life is, as it were, the dawn of
   day, and why should we leave over till then the food which can only be
   useful to us now?  But when the night is passed, and the day which
   succeeds it is at hand, then we shall have bread to eat which has
   nothing to do with the leavened bread of the older and lower state of
   things, but is unleavened, and that will serve our turn until that
   which comes after the unleavened bread is given us, the manna, which is
   food for angels rather than men.  Every one of us, then, may sacrifice
   his lamb in every house of our fathers; and while one breaks the law,
   not sacrificing the lamb at all, another may keep the commandment
   entirely, offering his sacrifice, and cooking it aright, and not
   breaking a bone of it.  This, then, in brief, is the interpretation of
   the Passover sacrificed for us, which is Christ, in accordance with the
   view taken of it by the Apostles, and with the Lamb in the Gospel.  For
   we ought not to suppose that historical things are types of historical
   things, and material things of material, but that material things are
   typical of spiritual things, and historical things of intellectual.  It
   is not necessary that our discourse should now ascend to that third
   passover which is to be celebrated with myriads of angels in the most
   perfect and most blessed exodus; we have already spoken of these things
   to a greater extent than the passage demands.

   14.  In the First Three Gospels the Passover is Spoken of Only at the
   Close of the Ministry; In John at the Beginning.  Remarks on This.
   Heracleon on the Passover.

   We must not, however, fail to enquire into the statement that the
   passover of the Jews was at hand, when the Lord was at Capernaum with
   His mother and His brothers and His disciples.  In the Gospel according
   to Matthew, [5045] after being left by the devil, and after the angels
   came and ministered to Him, when He heard that John was delivered up He
   withdrew into Galilee, and leaving Nazara He came and dwelt in
   Capernaum.  Then He began to preach, and chose the four fishermen for
   His Apostles, and taught in the synagogues of the whole of Galilee and
   healed those who were brought to Him.  Then He goes up into the
   mountain and speaks the beatitudes and what follows them; and after
   finishing that instruction He comes down from the mountain and enters
   Capernaum a second time. [5046]   Then He embarked in a ship and
   crossed over to the other side to the country of the Gergesenes.  On
   their beseeching Him to depart out of their coasts He embarked [5047]
   in a ship and crossed over and came to His own city.  Then He wrought
   certain cures and went about all the cities and the villages, teaching
   in their synagogues; after this most of the events of the Gospels take
   place, before Matthew indicates the approach of the time of passover.
   [5048]   With the other Evangelists also, after the stay at Capernaum
   it is long till we come to any mention of the passover; which may
   confirm in their opinion those who take the view about Capernaum which
   was set forth above.  That stay, in the neighbourhood of the passover
   of the Jews, is set in a brighter light by that nearness, both because
   it was better in itself, and still more because at the passover of the
   Jews there are found in the temple those who sell oxen and sheep and
   doves.  This adds emphasis to the statement that the passover was not
   that of the Lord but that of the Jews; the Father's house was made, in
   the eyes of those who did not hallow it, a house of merchandise, and
   the passover of the Lord became for those who took a low and material
   view of it a Jewish passover.  A fitter occasion than the present will
   occur for enquiring as to the time of the passover, which took place
   about the spring equinox, and for any other enquiry which may arise in
   connection with it.  As for Heracleon, he says, "This is the great
   festival; for it was a type of the passion of the Saviour; not only was
   the lamb put to death, the eating of it afforded relaxation, the
   killing it pointed to what of the passion of the Saviour was in this
   world, and the eating it to the rest at the marriage."  We have given
   his words, that it may be seen with what a want of caution and how
   loosely he proceeds, and with what an absence of constructive skill
   even on such a theme as this; and how little regard in consequence is
   to be paid to him.

   15.  Discrepancy of the Gospel Narratives Connected with the Cleansing
   of the Temple.

   "And Jesus went up to Jerusalem. [5049]   And He found in the temple
   those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money
   sitting; and He made a scourge of cords, and cast out of the temple the
   sheep and the oxen, and poured out the small coin of the changers, and
   overturned their tables, and to those who sold the doves He said, Take
   these things hence; make not My Father's house a house of merchandise.
   Then His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy
   house shall eat me up."  It is to be noted that John makes this
   transaction of Jesus with those He found selling oxen and sheep and
   doves in the temple His second work; while the other Evangelists
   narrate a similar incident almost at the end and in connection with the
   story of the passion.  Matthew has it thus: [5050]   "At Jesus' entry
   into Jerusalem the whole city was stirred, saying, Who is this?  And
   the multitudes said, This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth of
   Galilee.  And Jesus went into the temple and cast out all them that
   sold and bought in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the
   money-changers and the seats of them that sold doves.  And He says to
   them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer, but
   you make it a den of robbers."  Mark has the following:  "And they came
   to Jerusalem.  And having entered into the temple He began to cast out
   those that sold and bought in the temple, and the tables of the
   money-changers He overthrew and the seats of them that sold doves.  And
   He suffered not that any should carry a vessel through the temple; and
   He taught and said unto them, Is it not written that My house shall be
   called a house of prayer for all the nations?  But you have made it a
   den of robbers."  And Luke: [5051]   "And when he came near, He beheld
   the city and wept over it, saying that, if thou hadst known in this
   day, even thou, the things that belong to peace; but now they are hid
   from thine eyes.  For the days shall come upon thee, when they shall
   surround thee and shut thee in on every side, and shall dash thee to
   the ground and thy children, and they shall not leave in thee one stone
   upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.  And
   He entered into the temple and began to cast out those that sold,
   saying to them, It is written, My house shall be a house of prayer, but
   ye have made it a den of robbers."  It is further to be observed that
   what is recorded by the three as having taken place in connection with
   the Lord's going up to Jerusalem, when He did these things in the
   temple, is narrated in a very similar manner by John as taking place
   long after this, after another visit to Jerusalem different from this
   one.  We must consider the statements, and in the first place that of
   Matthew, where we read: [5052]   "When He drew nigh to Jerusalem and
   came to Bethphage over against the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two
   disciples, saying unto them, Go ye into the village over against you,
   and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her; loose
   them and bring them to Me.  And if any man say unto you, What are you
   doing? you shall say, The Lord hath need of them, and straightway he
   will send them.  But this was done that it might be fulfilled which was
   spoken by the prophet, saying, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold,
   thy king cometh, meek and seated upon an ass and upon the colt of an
   ass.  And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them; they
   brought the ass and the foal, and they placed on them their garments,
   and He sat thereon.  And the most part of the multitude spread their
   garments on the road, but the multitudes that went before Him, and they
   that followed, cried, Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is He that
   cometh in the name of the Lord.  Hosanna in the highest."  After this
   comes, "And when He had entered into Jerusalem the whole city was
   stirred," which we cited above.  Then we have Mark's account: [5053]
   "And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to
   the Mount of Olives, He sends two of His disciples and says to them, Go
   ye into the village over against you.  And straightway as ye enter into
   it ye shall find a colt tied, on which no man hath ever sat, loose it
   and bring it.  And if any one say to you, Why do ye this? say, Because
   the Lord hath need of him, and straightway he will send him back
   hither.  And they went and found the colt tied at the door outside on
   the road, and they loose him.  And some of them that stood there said
   to them, What do ye, loosing the colt?  And they said to them as Jesus
   told them, and they let them go.  And they brought the colt to Jesus,
   and cast on it their garments.  But others cut down branches from the
   field and spread them in the way.  And they that went before and they
   that followed cried, Hosanna, blessed is He that cometh in the name of
   the Lord; blessed be the kingdom that cometh, of our father David!
   Hosanna in the highest!  And He went into Jerusalem to the temple, and
   looked round about on all things, and as it was already evening, He
   went out to Bethany with the twelve.  And on the morrow when they were
   come forth from Bethany He was hungry."  Then, after the affair of the
   withered fig tree, "They came to Jerusalem.  And He went into the
   temple and began to cast out them that sold."  Luke narrates as
   follows: [5054]    "And it came to pass, when He drew near to Bethphage
   and Bethany at the mount that is called the Mount of Olives, He sent
   two of his disciples, saying, Go ye into the village over against you,
   in which when ye enter, ye shall find a colt tied, on which no man ever
   hath sate; loose him and bring him.  And if any man asks you, Why do ye
   loose him? Ye shall say thus, The Lord hath need of him.  And the
   disciples went and found as He said to them.  And when they were
   loosing the colt its owners said to them, Why loose ye the colt? and
   they said, Because the Lord hath need of him.  And they brought him to
   Jesus, and they threw their garments on the colt, and set Jesus
   thereon.  And as He went, they strewed their garments in the way.  And
   when He was drawing near, being now at the descent of the Mount of
   Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and
   praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had
   seen, saying, Blessed is the King in the name of the Lord; peace in
   heaven and glory in the highest.  And some of the Pharisees from the
   multitude said unto Him, Master, rebuke Thy disciples.  And He answered
   and said, I say unto you, If these shall hold their peace, the stones
   will cry out.  And when He drew near He beheld the city and wept over
   it," and so on, as we cited above.  John, on the contrary, after giving
   an account nearly identical with this, as far as, "And Jesus went up to
   Jerusalem, and He found in the temple those who were selling oxen and
   sheep," gives a second account of an ascent of the Lord to Jerusalem,
   and then goes on to tell of the supper in Bethany six days before the
   passover, at which Martha served and Lazarus was at table.  "On the
   morrow, [5055] a great multitude that had come to the feast, having
   heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees
   and went forth to meet Him; and they cried, Hosanna, blessed be the
   King of Israel in the name of the Lord.  And Jesus, having found a
   young ass, sat thereon, as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Zion;
   behold thy King cometh, sitting on the foal of an ass."  I have written
   out long sections from the Gospels, but I have thought it necessary to
   do so, in order to exhibit the discrepancy at this part of our Gospel.
   Three of the Gospels place these incidents, which we supposed to be the
   same as those narrated by John, in connection with one visit of the
   Lord to Jerusalem.  While John, on the other hand, places them in
   connection with two visits which are widely separated from each other
   and between which were various journeys of the Lord to other places.  I
   conceive it to be impossible for those who admit nothing more than the
   history in their interpretation to show that these discrepant
   statements are in harmony with each other.  If any one considers that
   we have not given a sound exposition, let him write a reasoned
   rejoinder to this declaration of ours.

   16.  The Story of the Purging of the Temple Spiritualized.  Taken
   Literally, It Presents Some Very Difficult and Unlikely Features.

   We shall, however, expound according to the strength that is given to
   us the reasons which move us to recognize here a harmony; and in doing
   so we entreat Him who gives to every one that asks and strives acutely
   to enquire, and we knock that by the keys of higher knowledge the
   hidden things of Scripture may be opened to us.  And first, let us fix
   our attention on the words of John, beginning, "And Jesus went up to
   Jerusalem." [5056]   Now Jerusalem, as the Lord Himself teaches in the
   Gospel according to Matthew, [5057] "is the city of the great King."
   It does not lie in a depression, or in a low situation, but is built on
   a high mountain, and there are mountains round about it, [5058] and the
   participation of it is to the same place, [5059] and thither the tribes
   of the Lord went up, a testimony for Israel.  But that city also is
   called Jerusalem, to which none of those upon the earth ascends, nor
   goes in; but every soul that possesses by nature some elevation and
   some acuteness to perceive the things of the mind is a citizen of that
   city.  And it is possible even for a dweller in Jerusalem to be in sin
   (for it is possible for even the acutest minds to sin), should they not
   turn round quickly after their sin, when they have lost their power of
   mind and are on the point not only of dwelling in one of those strange
   cities of Judæa, but even of being inscribed as its citizens.  Jesus
   goes up to Jerusalem, after bringing help to those in Cana of Galilee,
   and then going down to Capernaum, that He may do in Jerusalem the
   things which are written.  He found in the temple, certainly, which is
   said to be the house of the Father of the Saviour, that is, in the
   church or in the preaching of the ecclesiastical and sound word, some
   who were making His Father's house a house of merchandise.  And at all
   times Jesus finds some of this sort in the temple.  For in that which
   is called the church, which is the house of the living God, the pillar
   and ground of the truth, [5060] when are there not some money-changers
   sitting who need the strokes of the scourge Jesus made of small cords,
   and dealers in small coin who require to have their money poured out
   and their tables overturned?  When are there not those who are inclined
   to merchandise, but need to be held to the plough and the oxen, that
   having put their hand to it and not turning round to the things behind
   them, they may be fit for the kingdom of God?  When are there not those
   who prefer the mammon of unrighteousness to the sheep which give them
   the material for their true adornment?  And there are always many who
   look down on what is sincere and pure and unmixed with any bitterness
   or gall, and who, for the sake of miserable gain, betray the care of
   those tropically called doves.  When, therefore, the Saviour finds in
   the temple, the house of His Father, those who are selling oxen and
   sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting, He drives them out,
   using the scourge of small cords which He has made, along with the
   sheep and oxen of their trade, and pours out their stock of coin, as
   not deserving to be kept together, so little is it worth.  He also
   overturns the tables in the souls of such as love money, saying even to
   those who sell doves, "Take these things hence," that they may no
   longer traffic in the house of God.  But I believe that in these words
   He indicated also a deeper truth, and that we may regard these
   occurrences as a symbol of the fact that the service of that temple was
   not any longer to be carried on by the priests in the way of material
   sacrifices, and that the time was coming when the law could no longer
   be observed, however much the Jews according to the flesh desired it.
   For when Jesus casts out the oxen and sheep, and orders the doves to be
   taken away, it was because oxen and sheep and doves were not much
   longer to be sacrificed there in accordance with Jewish practices.  And
   possibly the coins which bore the stamp of material things and not of
   God were poured out by way of type; because the law which appears so
   venerable, with its letter that kills, was, now that Jesus had come and
   had used His scourge to the people, to be dissolved and poured out, the
   sacred office (episcopate) being transferred to those from the Gentiles
   who believed, and the kingdom of God being taken away from the Jews
   [5061] and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of it.  But it
   may also be the case that the natural temple is the soul skilled in
   reason, which, because of its inborn reason, is higher than the body;
   to which Jesus ascends from Capernaum, the lower-lying place of less
   dignity, and in which, before Jesus' discipline is applied to it, are
   found tendencies which are earthly and senseless and dangerous, and
   things which have the name but not the reality of beauty, and which are
   driven away by Jesus with His word plaited out of doctrines of
   demonstration and of rebuke, to the end that His Father's house may no
   longer be a house of merchandize but may receive, for its own salvation
   and that of others, that service of God which is performed in
   accordance with heavenly and spiritual laws.  The ox is symbolic of
   earthly things, for he is a husbandman.  The sheep, of senseless and
   brutal things, because it is more servile than most of the creatures
   without reason.  Of empty and unstable thoughts, the dove.  Of things
   that are thought good but are not, the small change.  If any one
   objects to this interpretation of the passage and says that it is only
   pure animals that are mentioned in it, we must say that the passage
   would otherwise have an unlikely air.  The occurence is necessarily
   related according to the possibilities of the story.  It could not have
   been narrated that a herd of any other animals than pure ones had found
   access to the temple, nor could any have been sold there but those used
   for sacrifice.  The Evangelist makes use of the known practice of the
   merchants at the times of the Jewish feasts; they did bring in such
   animals to the outer court; this practice, with a real occurrence He
   knew of, were His materials.  Any one, however, who cares to do so may
   enquire whether it is in agreement with the position held by Jesus in
   this world, since He was reputed to be the Son of a carpenter, to
   venture upon such an act as to drive out a crowd of merchants from the
   temple?  They had come up to the feast to sell to a great number of the
   people, the sheep, several myriads in number, which they were to
   sacrifice according to their fathers' houses.  To the richer Jews they
   had oxen to sell, and there were doves for those who had vowed such
   animals, and many no doubt bought these with a view to their good cheer
   at the festival.  And did not Jesus do an unwarrantable thing when He
   poured out the money of the money-changers, which was their own, and
   overthrew their tables?  And who that received a blow from the scourge
   of small cords at the hands of One held in but slight esteem, was
   driven out of the temple, would not have attacked Him and raised a cry
   and avenged himself with his own hand, especially when there was such a
   multitude present who might all feel themselves insulted by Jesus in
   the same way?  To think, moreover, of the Son of God taking the small
   cords in His hands and plaiting a scourge out of them for this driving
   out from the temple, does it not bespeak audacity and temerity and even
   some measure of lawlessness?  One refuge remains for the writer who
   wishes to defend these things and is minded to treat the occurrence as
   real history, namely, to appeal to the divine nature of Jesus, who was
   able to quench, when He desired to do so, the rising anger of His foes,
   by divine grace to get the better of myriads, and to scatter the
   devices of tumultuous men; for "the Lord scatters the counsels of the
   nations [5062] and brings to naught devices of the peoples, but the
   counsel of the Lord abideth for ever."  Thus the occurrence in our
   passage, if it really took place, was not second in point of the power
   it exhibits to any even of the most marvellous works Christ wrought,
   and claimed no less by its divine character the faith of the
   beholders.  One may show it to be a greater work than that done at Cana
   of Galilee in the turning of water into wine; for in that case it was
   only soulless matter that was changed, but here it was the soul and
   will of thousands of men.  It is, however, to be observed that at the
   marriage the mother of Jesus is said to be there, and Jesus to have
   been invited and His disciples, but that no one but Jesus is said to
   have descended to Capernaum.  His disciples, however, appear afterwards
   as present with Him; they remembered that "the zeal of thine house
   shall devour me."  And perhaps Jesus was in each of the disciples as He
   ascended to Jerusalem, whence it is not said, Jesus went up to
   "Jerusalem and His disciples," but He went down to Capernaum, "He and
   His mother and His brothers and His disciples."

   17.  Matthew's Story of the Entry into Jerusalem.  Difficulties
   Involved in It for Those Who Take It Literally.

   We have now to take into consideration the statements of the other
   Gospels on the expulsion from the temple of those who made it a house
   of merchandise.  Take in the first place what we find in Matthew.  On
   the Lord's entering Jerusalem, he says, [5063] "All the city was
   stirred, saying, Who is this?"  But before this he has the story of the
   ass and the foal which were taken by command of the Lord and found by
   the two disciples whom he sent from Bethphage into the village over
   against them.  These two disciples loose the ass which was tied, and
   they have orders, if any one says anything to them, to answer that "the
   Lord has need of them; and immediately he will send them."  By these
   incidents Matthew declares that the prophecy was fulfilled which says,
   "Behold, the King cometh, meek and sitting on an ass and a colt the
   foal of an ass," which we find in Zechariah. [5064]   When, then, the
   disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them, they brought the ass
   and the colt, and placed on them, he says, their own garments, and the
   Lord sat upon them, clearly on the ass and the colt.  Then "the most
   part of the multitude spread their garments in the way, and others cut
   down branches from the trees and strewed them in the way, and the
   multitudes that went before and that followed cried, Hosanna to the Son
   of David, blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.  Hosanna
   in the highest."  Hence it was that when He entered Jerusalem, the
   whole city was moved, saying, Who is this? "and the multitudes said,"
   those obviously who went before Him and who followed Him, to those who
   were asking who He was, "This is the prophet Jesus of Nazareth of
   Galilee.  And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those that
   sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the
   money-changers and the seats of them that sold doves:  and He saith
   unto them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer;
   but ye make it a den of robbers."  Let us ask those who consider that
   Matthew had nothing but the history in his mind when he wrote his
   Gospel, what necessity there was for two of the disciples to be sent to
   the village over against Bethphage, to find an ass tied and its colt
   with it and to loose them and bring them?  And how did it deserve to be
   recorded that He sat upon the ass and the foal and entered into the
   city?  And how does Zechariah prophesy about Christ when he says,
   [5065] "Rejoice greatly, thou daughter of Zion, proclaim it, thou
   daughter of Jerusalem.  Behold thy king cometh unto thee, just is He
   and bringing salvation, meek and sitting on an ass and a young foal"?
   If it be the case that this prophecy predicts simply the material
   incident described by the Evangelists, how can those who stand on the
   letter maintain that this is so with regard to the following part also
   of the prophecy, which runs:  "And He shall destroy chariots from
   Ephraim and horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of the warrior shall be
   destroyed, and a multitude and peace from the Gentiles, and He shall
   rule over the waters as far as the sea, and the rivers to the ends of
   the earth," etc.  It is to be noted, too, that Matthew does not give
   the words as they are found in the prophet, for instead of "Rejoice
   greatly, thou daughter of Zion, proclaim it, thou daughter of
   Jerusalem," he makes it, "Tell ye the daughter of Zion."  He curtails
   the prophetic utterance by omitting the words, "Just is He and bringing
   salvation," then he gives, "meek and sitting," as in the original, but
   instead of "on an ass and a young colt," he gives, "on an ass and a
   colt the foal of an ass."  The Jews, examining into the application of
   the prophecy to what is recorded about Jesus, press us in a way we
   cannot overlook with the enquiry how Jesus destroyed chariots out of
   Ephraim and horse from Jerusalem, and how He destroyed the bow of the
   enemy and did the other deeds mentioned in the passage.  So much with
   regard to the prophecy.  Our literal interpreters, however, if there is
   nothing worthy of the appearance of the Son of God in the ass and the
   foal, may perhaps point to the length of the road for an explanation.
   But, in the first place, fifteen stades are not a great distance and
   afford no reasonable explanation of the matter, and, in the second
   place, they would have to tell us how two beasts of burden were needed
   for so short a journey; "He sat," it is said, "on them."  And then the
   words:  "If any man say aught unto you, say ye that the Lord hath need
   of them, and straightway he will send them."  It does not appear to me
   to be worthy of the greatness of the Son's divinity to say that such a
   nature as His confessed that it had need of an ass to be loosed from
   its bonds and of a foal to come with it; for everything the Son of God
   has need of should be great and worthy of His goodness.  And then the
   very great multitude strewing their garments in the way, while Jesus
   allows them to do so and does not rebuke them, as is clear from the
   words used in another passage, [5066] "If these should hold their
   peace, the stones will cry out."  I do not know if it does not indicate
   a certain degree of stupidity on the part of the writer to take delight
   in such things, if nothing more is meant by them than what lies on the
   surface.  And the branches being cut down from the trees and strewn on
   the road where the asses go by, surely they are rather a hindrance to
   Him who is the centre of the throng than a well-devised reception of
   Him.  The difficulties which met us on the part of those who were cast
   out of the temple by Jesus meet us here in a still greater degree.  In
   the Gospel of John He casts out those who bought, but Matthew says that
   He cast out those who sold and those who bought in the temple.  And the
   buyers would naturally be more numerous than the sellers.  We have to
   consider if the casting out of buyers and sellers in the temple was not
   out of keeping with the reputation of one who was thought to be the Son
   of a carpenter, unless, as we said before, it was by a divine power
   that He subjected them.  The words addressed to them, too, are harsher
   in the other Evangelists than in John.  For John says that Jesus said
   to them, "Make not My Father's house a house of merchandise," while in
   the others they are rebuked for making the house of prayer a den of
   robbers.  Now the house of His Father did not admit of being turned
   into a den of robbers, though by the acts of sinful men it was brought
   to be a house of merchandise.  It was not only the house of prayer, but
   in fact the house of God, and by force of human neglect it harboured
   robbers, and was turned not only into their house but their den--a
   thing which no skill, either of architecture or of reason, could make
   it.

   18.  The Ass and the Colt are the Old and the New Testament.  Spiritual
   Meaning of the Various Features of the Story.  Differences Between
   John's Narrative and that of the Other Evangelists.

   Now to see into the real truth of these matters is the part of that
   true intelligence which is given to those who can say, [5067] "But we
   have the mind of Christ that we may see those things which are freely
   given to us of God;" and doubtless it is beyond our powers.  For
   neither is the ruling principle in our soul free from agitation, nor
   are our eyes such as those of the fair bride of Christ should be, of
   which the bridegroom says, [5068] "Thy eyes are doves," signifying,
   perhaps, in a riddle, the observant power which dwells in the
   spiritual, because the Holy Spirit came like a dove to our Lord and to
   the lord in every one.  Such as we are, however, we will not delay, but
   will feel about the words of life which have been spoken to us and
   strive to lay hold of that power in them which flows to him who touches
   them in faith.  Now Jesus is the word of God which goes into the soul
   that is called Jerusalem, riding on the ass freed by the disciples from
   its bonds.  That is to say, on the simple language of the Old
   Testament, interpreted by the two disciples who loose it:  in the first
   place him who applies what is written to the service of the soul and
   shows the allegorical sense of it with reference to her, and in the
   second place him who brings to light by the things which lie in shadow
   the good and true things of the future.  But He also rides on the young
   colt, the New Testament; for in both alike we find the word of truth
   which purifies us and drives away all those thoughts in us which
   incline to selling and buying.  But He does not come alone to
   Jerusalem, the soul, nor only with a few companions; for many things
   have to enter into us before the word of God which makes us perfect,
   and as many things have to come after Him, all, however, hymning and
   glorifying Him and placing under Him their ornaments and vestures, so
   that the beasts He rides on may not touch the ground, when He who
   descended out of heaven is seated on them.  But that His bearers, the
   old and the new words of Scripture, may be raised yet higher above the
   ground, branches have to be cut down from the trees that they may tread
   on reasonable expositions.  But the multitudes which go before and
   follow Him may also signify the angelic ministrations, some of which
   prepare the way for Him in our souls, and help in their adorning, while
   some come after His presence in us, of which we have often spoken, so
   that we need not now adduce testimonies about it.  And perhaps it is
   not without reason that I have likened to an ass the surrounding voices
   which conduct the Word Himself to the soul; for it is a beast of
   burden, and many are the burdens, heavy the loads, which are brought
   into view from the text, especially of the Old Testament, as he can
   clearly see who observes what is done in this connection on the part of
   the Jews.  But the foal is not a beast of burden in the same way as the
   ass.  For though every lead of the latter be heavy to those who have
   not in themselves the upbearing and most lightening power of the
   Spirit, yet the new word is less heavy than the old.  I know some who
   interpret the tied-up ass as being believers from the circumcision, who
   are freed from many bonds by those who are truly and spiritually
   instructed in the word; and the foal they take to be those from the
   Gentiles, who before they receive the word of Jesus are free from any
   control and subject to no yoke in their unbridled and pleasure-loving
   existence.  The writers I am speaking of do not say who those are that
   go before and who those follow after; but there would be no absurdity
   in saying that those who went before were like Moses and the prophets,
   and those who followed after the holy Apostles.  To what Jerusalem all
   these go in it is now our business to enquire, and what is the house
   which has many sellers and buyers to be driven out by the Son of God.
   And perhaps the Jerusalem above to which the Lord is to ascend driving
   like a charioteer those of the circumcision and the believers of the
   Gentiles, while prophets and Apostles go before Him and follow after
   Him (or is it the angels who minister to Him, for they too may be meant
   by those who go before and those who follow), perhaps it is that city
   which before He ascended to it contained the so-called [5069]
   "spiritual hosts of wickedness in heavenly places," or the Canaanites
   and Hittites and Amorites and the other enemies of the people of God,
   and in a word, the foreigners.  For in that region, too, it was
   possible for the prophecy to be fulfilled which says, [5070] "Your
   country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire, your land,
   strangers devour it in your presence."  For these are they who defile
   and turn into a den of robbers, that is, of themselves the heavenly
   house of the Father, the holy Jerusalem, the house of prayer; having
   spurious money, and giving pence and small change, cheap worthless
   coinage, to all who come to them.  These are they who, contending with
   the souls, take from them what is most precious, robbing them of their
   better part to return to them what is worth nothing.  But the disciples
   go and find the ass tied and loose it, for it cannot have Jesus on
   account of the covering that is laid upon it by the law. [5071]   And
   the colt is found with it, both having been lost till Jesus came; I
   mean, namely, those of the circumcision and those of the Gentiles who
   afterwards believed.  But how these are sent back again after Jesus has
   ascended to Jerusalem seated upon them, it is somewhat dangerous to
   say; for there is something mystical about it, in connection with the
   change of saints into angels.  After that change they will be sent
   back, in the age succeeding this one, like the ministering spirits,
   [5072] who are sent to do service for the sake of them who will thereby
   inherit salvation.  But if the ass and the foal are the old and the new
   Scriptures, on which the Word of God rides, it is easy to see how,
   after the Word has appeared in them, they are sent back and do not wait
   after the Word has entered Jerusalem among those who have cast out all
   the thoughts of selling and buying.  I consider, too, that it is not
   without significance that the place where the ass was found tied, and
   the foal, was a village, and a village without a name.  For in
   comparison with the great world in heaven, the whole earth is a village
   where the ass is found tied and the colt, and it is simply called "the
   village" without any other designation being added to it.  From
   Bethphage Matthew says the disciples are sent out who are to fetch the
   ass and the colt; and Bethphage is a priestly place, the name of which
   means "House of Jaw-bones."  So much we have said, as our power
   allowed, on the text of Matthew, reserving for a further opportunity,
   when we may be permitted to take up the Gospel of Matthew by itself, a
   more complete and accurate discussion of his statements.  Mark and Luke
   say that the two disciples, acting on their Master's instructions,
   found a foal tied, on which no one had ever sat, and that they loosed
   it and brought it to the Lord.  Mark adds that they found the foal tied
   at the door, outside on the road.  But who is outside?  Those of the
   Gentiles who were strangers [5073] from the covenants, and aliens to
   the promise of God; they are on the road, not resting under a roof or a
   house, bound by their own sins, and to be loosed by the twofold
   knowledge spoken of above, of the friends of Jesus.  And the bonds with
   which the foal was tied, and the sins committed against the wholesome
   law and reproved by it,--for it is the gate of life,--in respect of it,
   I say, they were not inside but outside the door, for perhaps inside
   the door there cannot be any such bond of wickedness.  But there were
   some persons standing beside the tied-up foal, as Mark says; those, I
   suppose, who had tied it; as Luke records, it was the masters of the
   foal who said to the disciples, Why loose ye the foal?  For those lords
   who subjected and bound the sinner are illegal masters and cannot look
   the true master in the face when he frees the foal from its bonds.
   Thus when the disciples say, "The Lord hath need of him," these wicked
   masters have nothing to say in reply.  The disciples then bring the
   foal to Jesus naked, and put their own dress on it, so that the Lord
   may sit on the disciples' garments which are on it, at His ease.  What
   is said further will not, in the light of Matthew's statements, present
   any difficulty; how [5074] "They come to Jerusalem, and entering into
   the temple He began to cast out them that sold and bought in the
   temple," or how [5075] "When He drew nigh and beheld the city He wept
   over it; and entering into the temple He began to cast out them that
   sold."  For in some of those who have the temple in themselves He casts
   out all that sell and buy in the temple; but in others who do not quite
   obey the word of God, He only makes a beginning of casting out the
   sellers and buyers.  There is a third class also besides these, in
   which He began to cast out the sellers only, and not also the buyers.
   With John, on the contrary, they are all cast out by the scourge woven
   of small cords, along with the sheep and the oxen.  It should be
   carefully considered whether it is possible that the changes of the
   things described and the discrepancies found in them can be
   satisfactorily solved by the anagogic method.  Each of the Evangelists
   ascribes to the Word different modes of action, which produce in souls
   of different tempers not the same effects but yet similar ones.  The
   discrepancy we noticed in respect of Jesus' journeys to Jerusalem,
   which the Gospel now in hand reports quite differently from the other
   three, as we have expounded their words, cannot be made good in any
   other way.  John gives statements which are similar to those of the
   other three but not the same; instead of branches cut from the trees or
   stubble brought from the fields and strewed on the road he says they
   took branches of palm trees.  He says that much people had come to the
   feast, and that these went out to meet Him, crying, "Blessed is He that
   cometh in the name of the Lord," and "Blessed is the King of Israel."
   He also says that it was Jesus Himself who found the young ass on which
   Christ sat, and the phrase, young ass, doubtless conveys some
   additional meaning, as the small animal afforded a benefit not of men,
   nor through men, but through Jesus Christ.  John moreover does not, any
   more than the others, reproduce the prophetic words exactly; instead of
   them he gives us "Fear not, O daughter of Zion; behold thy King cometh
   sitting" (instead of "mounted") "on the foal of an ass" (for "on an ass
   and a young foal").  The words "Fear not, daughter of Zion," are not in
   the prophet at all.  But as the prophetic utterance has been applied by
   all in this way, let us see if there was not a necessity that the
   daughter of Zion should rejoice greatly and that the greater than she,
   the daughter of Jerusalem, should not only rejoice greatly but should
   also proclaim it when her king was coming to her, just and bringing
   salvation, and meek, having mounted an ass and a young colt.  Whoever,
   then, receives Him will no longer be afraid of those who are armed with
   the specious discourses of the heterodox, those chariots of Ephraim
   said to be destroyed by the Lord, [5076] nor the horse, the vain thing
   for safety, [5077] that is the mad desire which has accustomed itself
   to the things of sense and which is injurious to many of those who
   desire to dwell in Jerusalem and to attend to the sound word.  It is
   also fitting to rejoice at the destruction by Him who rides on the ass
   and the young foal of every hostile dart, since the fiery darts of the
   enemy are no longer to prevail over him who has received Jesus to his
   own temple.  And there will also be a multitude from the Gentiles with
   peace [5078] at the Saviour's coming to Jerusalem, when He rules over
   the waters that He may bruise the head of the dragon on the water,
   [5079] and we shall tread upon the waves of the sea and to the mouths
   of all the rivers on the earth.  Mark, however, writing about the foal,
   [5080] reports the Lord to have said, "On which never man sat;" and he
   seems to me to hint at the circumstance that those who afterwards
   believed had never submitted to the Word before Jesus' coming to them.
   For of men, perhaps, no one had ever sate on the foal, but of hearts or
   of powers alien to the Word some had sate on it, since in the prophet
   Isaiah the wealth of opposing powers is said to be borne on asses and
   camels. [5081]   "In the distress and the affliction," he writes, "the
   lion and the lion's whelp, whence also the offspring of flying asps,
   who carried their riches on asses and camels."  The question occurs
   again, for those who have no mind but for the bare words, if according
   to their view the words, "on which never man sat," are not quite
   meaningless.  For who but a man ever sits on a foal?  So much of our
   views.

   19.  Various Views of Heracleon on Purging of the Temple.

   Let us see what Heracleon makes of this.  He says that the ascent to
   Jerusalem signifies the Lord's going up from material things to the
   spiritual place, which is a likeness of Jerusalem.  And he considers
   that the words are, "He found in the temple," and not "in the
   sanctuary," [5082] because the Lord is not to be understood as
   instrumental in that call only, which takes place where the spirit is
   not.  He considers the temple to be the Holy of Holies, into which none
   but the High-Priest enters, and there I believe he says that the
   spiritual go; while the court of the temple, where the levites also
   enter, is a symbol of these psychical ones who are saved, but outside
   the Pleroma.  Then those who are found in the temple selling oxen and
   sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting, he took to represent
   those who attribute nothing to grace, but regard the entrance of
   strangers to the temple as a matter of merchandise and gain, and who
   minister the sacrifices for the worship of God, with a view to their
   own gain and love of money.  And the scourge which Jesus made of small
   cords and did not receive from another, he expounds in a way of his
   own, saying that the scourge is an image of the power and energy of the
   Holy Spirit, driving out by His breath those who are bad.  And he
   declares that the scourge and the linen and the napkin and other things
   of such a kind are symbolic of the power and energy of the Holy
   Spirit.  Then he assumes what is not written, as that the scourge was
   tied to a piece of wood, and this wood he takes to be a type of the
   cross; on this wood the gamblers, merchants, and all evil was nailed up
   and done away.  In searching into the act of Jesus, and discussing the
   composition of the scourge out of two substances, he romances in an
   extraordinary way; He did not make it, he says, of dead leather.  He
   wished to make the Church no longer a den of robbers, but the house of
   His Father.  We must here say what is most necessary on the divinity,
   as referred to in Heracleon's text.  If Jesus calls the temple at
   Jerusalem the house of His Father, and that temple was made in honour
   of Him who made heaven and earth, why are we not at once told that He
   is the Son of no one else than the Maker of heaven and earth, that He
   is the Son of God?  To this house of the Father of Jesus, as being the
   house of prayer, the Apostles of Christ also, as we find in their
   "Acts," are told [5083] by the angel to go and to stand there and
   preach all the words of this life.  But they came to the house of
   prayer, through the Beautiful Gate, to pray there, a thing they would
   not have done had they not known Him to be the same with the God
   worshipped by those who had dedicated that temple.  Hence, too, they
   say, those who obeyed God rather than men, Peter and the Apostles, "The
   God [5084] of our Fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging Him on
   a tree;" for they know that by no other God was Jesus raised from the
   dead but the God of the fathers, whom Jesus also extols as the God of
   Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, who are not dead but living.  How, too,
   could the disciples, if the house was not that of the same God with the
   God of Christ, have remembered the saying in the sixty-ninth Psalm,
   "The zeal of thy house shall devour Me;" for thus it is found in the
   prophet, and not "hath devoured Me."  Now Christ is zealous principally
   for that house of God which is in each of us; He does not wish that it
   should be a house of merchandise, nor that the house of prayer should
   be a den of robbers; for He is the Son of a jealous God.  We ought to
   give a liberal interpretation to such utterances of Scripture; they
   speak of human things, but in the way of metaphor, to show that God
   desires that nothing foreign should be mixed up with His will in the
   soul of all men, indeed, but principally of those who are minded to
   accept the message of our most divine faith.  But we must remember that
   the sixty-ninth Psalm, which contains the words, "The zeal of thy house
   shall devour me," and a little further on, "They gave Me gall for My
   drink and for My thirst they gave Me vinegar," both texts being
   recorded in the Gospels, that that Psalm is spoken in the person of the
   Christ, and nowhere shows any change of person.  It shows a great want
   of observation on Heracleon's part that he considers the words, "The
   zeal of thy house shall devour Me," to be spoken in the person of those
   powers which were cast out and destroyed by the Saviour; he fails to
   see the connection of the prophecy in the Psalm.  For if these words
   are understood as spoken by the expelled and destroyed powers, it
   follows that he must take the words, "They gave Me vinegar to drink,"
   which are a part of the same psalm, to be also spoken by those powers.
   What misled him was probably that he could not understand how the
   "shall devour Me" could be spoken by Christ, since He did not
   appreciate the way in which anthropopathic statements are applied to
   God and to Christ.

   Holy of Holies, represents the spiritual realm; and that Jesus entered
   it as being, as well as the naos, in need of His saving work.

   20.  The Temple Which Christ Says He Will Raise Up is the Church.  How
   the Dry Bones Will Be Made to Live Again.

   "The Jews then answered and said unto Him, What sign showest Thou unto
   us, seeing that Thou doest these things? [5085]   Jesus answered and
   said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
   up."  Those of the body, and those who incline to material things, seem
   to me to be meant by the Jews, who, after Jesus has driven out those
   who make God's house a house of merchandise, are angry at Him for
   treating these matters in such a way, and demand a sign, a sign which
   will show that the Word, whom they do not receive, has a right to do
   such things.  The Saviour joins on to His statement about the temple a
   statement which is really one with the former, about His own body, and
   to the question, What sign doest Thou, seeing that Thou doest such
   things? answers, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise
   it up."  He could have exhibited a thousand other signs, but to the
   question, "Seeing that Thou doest such things," He could not answer
   anything else; He fittingly gave the answer about the sign connected
   with the temple, and not about signs unconnected with the temple.  Now,
   both of these two things, the temple and the body of Jesus, appear to
   me, in one interpretation at least, to be types of the Church, and to
   signify that it is built of living stones, [5086] a spiritual house for
   a holy priesthood, built [5087] on the foundation of the Apostles and
   prophets, Christ Jesus being the head corner-stone; and it is,
   therefore, called a temple.  Now, from the text, [5088] "Ye are the
   body of Christ, and members each in his part," we see that even though
   the harmonious fitting of the stones of the temple appear to be
   dissolved and scattered, as it is written in the twenty-second Psalm
   [5089] that all the bones of Christ are, by the plots made against it
   in persecutions and afflictions, on the part of those who war against
   the unity of the temple in persecutions, yet the temple will be raised
   again, and the body will rise again on the third day after the day of
   evil which threatens it, [5090] and the day of consummation which
   follows.  For the third day will rise on the new heaven and the new
   earth, when these bones, the whole house of Israel, [5091] will rise in
   the great Lord's day, death having been overcome.  And thus the
   resurrection of the Saviour from the passion of the cross contains the
   mystery of the resurrection of the whole body of Christ.  But as that
   material body of Jesus was sacrificed for Christ, and was buried, and
   was afterwards raised, so the whole body of Christ's saints is
   crucified along with Him, and now lives no longer; for each of them,
   like Paul, glories [5092] in nothing but the cross of our Lord Jesus
   Christ, through which He is crucified to the world, and the world to
   Him.  Not only, therefore, is it crucified with Christ, and crucified
   to the world; it is also buried with Christ, for we were buried with
   Christ, Paul says. [5093]   And then he says, as if enjoying some
   earnest of the resurrection, "We rose with Him," [5094] because He
   walks in a certain newness of life, though not yet risen in that
   blessed and perfect resurrection which is hoped for.  Either, then, he
   is now crucified, and afterwards is buried, or he is now buried and
   taken down from the cross, and, being now buried, is to rise at some
   future time.  But to most of us the mystery of the resurrection is a
   great one, and difficult of contemplation; it is spoken of in many
   other passages of Scripture, and is specially announced in the
   following passage of Ezekiel: [5095]   "And the hand of the Lord was
   upon me, and He led me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me in the
   midst of the plain, and it was full of human bones.  And He led me
   round about them in a circle, and behold there were very many on the
   face of the plain, and behold they were very dry.  And He said to me,
   Son of man, shall these bones live?  And I said, Lord, Lord, Thou
   knowest.  And He said to me, Prophesy to these bones, and thou shalt
   say to them, Hear the word of the Lord, ye dry bones;" and a little
   further on, "And the Lord spake to me, saying, Son of man, these bones
   are the house of Israel.  And they say, Our bones are become dry, our
   hope is lost, we have breathed our last."  For what bones are these
   which are addressed, "Hear ye the word of the Lord," as if they heard
   the word of the Lord?  They belong to the house of Israel, or to the
   body of Christ, of which the Lord says, [5096] "All My bones are
   scattered," although the bones of His body were not scattered, and not
   even one of them was broken.  But when the resurrection itself takes
   place of the true and more perfect body of Christ, then those who are
   now the members of Christ, for they will then be dry bones, will be
   brought together, bone to bone, and fitting to fitting (for none of
   those who are destitute of fitting (harmonia) will come to the perfect
   man), to the measure [5097] of the stature of the fulness of the body
   of Christ.  And then the many members [5098] will be the one body, all
   of them, though many, becoming members of one body.  But it belongs to
   God alone to make the distinction of foot and hand and eye and hearing
   and smelling, which in one sense fill up the head, but in another the
   feet and the rest of the members, and the weaker and humbler ones, the
   more and the less honourable.  God will temper the body together, and
   then, rather than now, He will give to that which lacks the more
   abundant honour, that there may be, by no means, any schism in the
   body, but that the members may have the same care for one another, and,
   if any member be well off, all the members may share in its good
   things, or if any member be glorified, all the members may rejoice with
   it.

   21.  That the Son Was Raised Up by the Father.  The Charge Brought
   Against Jesus at His Trial Was Based on the Incident Now Before Us.

   What I have said is not alien to the passage now engaging us, dealing
   as it does with the temple and those cast out from it, of which the
   Saviour says, "The zeal of thy house shall devour Me;" and with the
   Jews who asked that a sign should be showed them, and the Saviour's
   answer to them, in which He combines the discourse on the temple with
   that on His own body, and says, "Destroy this temple and in three days
   I will raise it up."  For from this temple, which is the body of
   Christ, everything that is irrational and savours of merchandise must
   be driven away, that it may no longer be a house of merchandise.  And
   this temple must be destroyed by those who plot against the Word of
   God, and after its destruction be raised again on that third day which
   we discussed above; when the disciples also will remember what He, the
   Word, said before the temple of God was destroyed, and will believe,
   not only their knowledge but their faith also being then made perfect,
   and that by the word which Jesus spoke.  And every one who is of this
   nature, Jesus purifying him, [5099] puts away things that are
   irrational and things that savour of selling, to be destroyed on
   account of the zeal of the Logos that is in Him.  But they are
   destroyed to be raised again by Jesus, not on the third day, if we
   attend to the exact words before us, but "in three days."  For the
   rising again of the temple takes place on the first day after it has
   been destroyed and on the second day, and its resurrection is
   accomplished in all the three days.  Hence a resurrection both has been
   and is to be, if indeed we were buried with Christ, and rose with Him.
   And since the word, "We rose with Him," does not cover the whole of the
   resurrection, "in Christ shall all be made alive, [5100] but every one
   in his own order, Christ the first fruits, then they that are Christ's
   at His coming, and then the end."  It belongs to the resurrection that
   one should be on the first day in the paradise of God, [5101] and it
   belongs to the resurrection when Jesus appears and says, "Touch Me not;
   for I am not yet ascended to My Father," [5102] but the perfection of
   the resurrection was when He came to the Father.  Now there are some
   who fall into confusion on this head of the Father and the Son, and we
   must devote a few words to them.  They quote the text, [5103] "Yea, and
   we are found false witnesses for God, because we testified against God
   that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up," and other similar
   texts which show the raiser-up to be another person than He who was
   raised up; and the text, "Destroy this temple and in three days I will
   raise it up," as if it resulted from these that the Son did not differ
   in number from the Father, but that both were one, not only in point of
   substance but in point of subject, and that the Father and the Son were
   said to be different in some of their aspects but not in their
   hypostases.  Against such views we must in the first place adduce the
   leading texts which prove the Son to be another than the Father, and
   that the Son must of necessity be the son of a Father, and the Father,
   the father of a Son.  Then we may very properly refer to Christ's
   declaration that He cannot do anything but what He sees the Father
   doing and saying, [5104] because whatever the Father does that the Son
   also does in like manner, and that He had raised the dead, i.e., the
   body, the Father granting Him this, who must be said to have been the
   principal agent in raising up Christ from the dead.  But Heracleon
   says, "In three days," instead of "On the third day," not having
   examined the point (and yet having noted the words "in three"), that
   the resurrection is brought about in three days.  But he also calls the
   third the spiritual day, in which they consider the resurrection of the
   Church to be indicated.  It follows from this that the first day is to
   be called the "earthly" day, and the second the psychical, the
   resurrection of the Church not having taken place on them.  Now the
   statements of the false witnesses, recorded in the Gospel according to
   Matthew and Mark [5105] towards the end of the Gospel, and the
   accusation they brought against our Lord Jesus Christ, appear to have
   reference to this utterance of His, "Destroy this temple, and I will
   build it up in three days."  For He was speaking of the temple of His
   body, but they supposed His words to refer to the temple of stone, and
   so they said when accusing Him, "This man said, I am able to destroy
   the temple of God and to build it up in three days," or, as Mark has
   it, "We heard Him say, that I will destroy this temple made with hands,
   and in three days I will build up another temple not made with hands."
   Here the high-priest stood up and said to Him, "Answerest Thou
   nothing?  What do these witness against Thee?  But Jesus held His
   peace."  Or, as Mark says, "And the high-priest stood up in the midst,
   and asked Jesus saying, Answerest Thou nothing?  What do these witness
   against Thee?  But He held His peace and answered nothing."  These
   words must, I think, necessarily have reference to the text now before
   us.

   22.  The Temple of Solomon Did Not Take Forty-Six Years to Build.  With
   Regard to that of Ezra We Cannot Tell How Long It Took.  Significance
   of the Number Forty-Six.

   The Jews therefore said, "Forty and six years was this temple in
   building, [5106] and wilt thou raise it up in three days?"  How the
   Jews said that the temple had been forty-six years building, we cannot
   tell, if we adhere to the history.  For it is written in the third Book
   of Kings, [5107] that they prepared the stones and the wood three
   years, and in the fourth year, in the second month, [5108] when Solomon
   was king over Israel, the king commanded, and they brought great
   precious stones for the foundation of the house, and unhewn stones.
   And the sons of Solomon and the sons of Hiram hewed the stones and laid
   them in the fourth year, and they founded the house of the Lord in the
   month Nisan and the second month:  in the tenth year in the month Baal,
   which was the eighth month, the house was finished according to the
   whole count and the whole plan of it.  Thus comparing the time of its
   completion with the period of building, the building of it occupies
   less than eleven years.  How, then, do the Jews come to say that the
   temple was forty-six years in building?  One might, indeed, do violence
   to the words and make out the period of forty-six years at all costs,
   by counting from the time when David, after planning about the building
   of the temple, said to Nathan the prophet, [5109] "Behold I dwell in a
   house of cedar, and the ark of God dwelleth in the midst of the tent,"
   for though it is true that he was prevented, as being a man of blood,
   [5110] from carrying out the building, he seems to have busied himself
   in collecting materials for it.  In the first Book of Chronicles,
   [5111] certainly, David the king says to all the congregation, "Solomon
   my son, whom the Lord hath chosen, is young and tender, and the work is
   great, because he is not to build for man but for the Lord God.
   According to my whole power I have prepared for the house of my God,
   gold, silver, brass, and iron, wood, stones of Soom, and stones for
   filling up, and precious stones of many kinds, and all sorts of
   precious wood, and a large quantity of Parian marble.  And besides
   this, for the pleasure I have taken in the house of my God, the gold
   and the silver I possess, lo, I have given it for the house of my Lord,
   to the full; from such supplies [5112] I prepared for the house of the
   saints, three thousand talents of gold from Suphir, and seven thousand
   talents of stamped silver. that the houses of God may be overlaid with
   them by the hands of artificers."  For David reigned seven years in
   Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem; [5113] so that if it could
   be shown that the beginning of the preparations for the temple and of
   David's collecting the necessary material, was in the fifth year of his
   reign, then, with some forcing, the statement about forty-six years
   might stand.  But some one else will say that the temple spoken of was
   not that built by Solomon, for that it was destroyed at the period of
   the captivity, but the temple built at the time of Ezra, [5114] with
   regard to which the forty-six years can be shown to be quite accurate.
   But in this Maccabean period things were very unsettled with regard to
   the people and the temple, and I do not know if the temple was really
   built in that number of years.  Heracleon pays no attention to the
   history, but says that in that he was forty-six years preparing the
   temple, Solomon was an image of the Saviour.  The number six he
   connects with matter, that is, the image, and the number forty, which
   he says is the tetrad, not admitting of combination, he connects with
   the inspiration and the seed in the inspiration.  Consider if the forty
   cannot be taken as due to the four elements of the world arranged in
   the building of the temple at the points at issue, [5115] and the six
   to the fact that man was created on the sixth day.

   23.  The Temple Spoken of by Christ is the Church.  Application to the
   Church of the Statements Regarding the Building of Solomon's Temple,
   and the Numbers Stated in that Narrative.

   "But He spake of the temple of His body. [5116]   When, therefore, He
   was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this,
   and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said."
   This refers to the statement that the body of the Son is His temple.
   It may be asked whether this is to be taken in its plain sense, or
   whether we should try to connect each statement that is recorded about
   the temple, with the view we take about the body of Jesus, whether the
   body which He received from the Virgin, or that body of Christ which
   the Church is said to be, as we are said by the Apostle [5117] to be
   all members of His body.  One may, on the one hand, suppose it to be
   hopeless to get everything that is said about the temple properly
   connected with the body, in whatever sense the body be taken, and one
   may have recourse to a simpler explanation, and say that the body (in
   either of these senses) is called the temple, because as the temple had
   the glory of God dwelling in it, so He who was the image and glory of
   God, the first-born of every creature, could rightly be called, in
   respect of His body or the Church, the temple containing the image.
   We, for our part, see it to be a hard task to expound every particular
   of what is said about the temple in the third Book of Kings, and far
   beyond our powers of language, and we defer it in the meantime, as a
   thing beyond the scale of the present work.  We also have a strong
   conviction that in such matters, which transcend human nature, it must
   be the work of divine wisdom to make plain the meaning of inspired
   Scripture, of that wisdom which is hidden in a mystery, which none of
   the rulers of this world knew.  We are well aware, too, that we need
   the assistance of that excellent Spirit of wisdom, in order to
   understand such matters, as they should be understood by ministers of
   sacred things; and in this connection we will attempt to describe, as
   shortly as we may, our view of what belongs to this subject.  The body
   is the Church, and we learn from Peter [5118] that it is a house of
   God, built of living stones, a spiritual house for a holy priesthood.
   Thus the son of David, who builds this house, is a type of Christ.  He
   builds it when his wars are at an end, [5119] and a period of profound
   peace has arrived; he builds the temple for the glory of God in the
   Jerusalem on earth, so that worship may no longer be celebrated in a
   moveable erection like the tabernacle.  Let us seek to find in the
   Church the truth of each statement made about the temple.  If all
   Christ's enemies are made the footstool of His feet, [5120] and Death,
   the last enemy, is destroyed, then there will be the most perfect
   peace.  Christ will be Solomon, which means "Peaceful," [5121] and the
   prophecy will find its fulfilment in Him, which says, [5122] "With
   those who hated peace I was peaceful."  And then each of the living
   stones will be, according to the work of his life here, a stone of that
   temple, one, at the foundation, an apostle or a prophet, bearing those
   placed upon him, and another, after those in the foundation, and
   supported by the Apostles, will himself, with the Apostles, help to
   bear those in more need.  One will be a stone of the inmost parts,
   where the ark is, and the cherubim, and the mercy-seat; another will be
   on the outer wall, and another even outside the outer wall of the
   levites and priests, a stone of the altar of whole burnt offerings.
   And the management and service of these things will be entrusted to
   holy powers, angels of God, being, respectively, lordships, thrones,
   dominions, or powers; and there will be others subject to these,
   typified by three thousand six hundred [5123] chief officers, who were
   appointed over the works of Solomon, and the seventy thousand of those
   who bore burdens, and the eighty thousand stone-cutters in the
   mountain, who wrought in the work, and prepared the stones and the
   wood.  It is to be remarked that those reported as bearing burdens are
   related to the Hebdomad.  The quarrymen and stone-cutters, who make the
   stones fitted for the temple, have some kinship to the ogdoad.  And the
   officers, who are six hundred in number, are connected with the perfect
   number six multiplied into itself.  The preparation of the stones, as
   they are taken out and fitted for the building, extends over three
   years; this appears to me to point solely to the time of the eternal
   interval which is akin to the triad.  This will come to pass when peace
   is consummated after the number of years of the transaction of the
   matters connected with the exodus from Egypt, namely, three hundred and
   forty, and of what took place in Egypt four hundred and thirty years
   after the covenant made by God with Abraham.  Thus, from Abraham to the
   beginning of the building of the temple, there are two sabbatic
   numbers, the 700 and the 70; and at that time, too, our King Christ
   will command the seventy thousand burden-bearers not to take any chance
   stones for the foundation of the temple, but great stones, precious,
   unhewn, that they may be hewn, not by any chance workmen, but by the
   sons of Solomon; for so we find it written in the third Book of Kings.
   Then, too, on account of the profound peace, Hiram, king of Tyre,
   cooperates in the building of the temple, and gives his own sons to the
   sons of Solomon, to hew, in company with them, the great and precious
   stones for the holy place, which, in the fourth year, are placed in the
   foundation of the house of the Lord.  But in an ogdoad of years the
   house is finished in the eighth month of the eighth year after its
   foundation.

   24.  The Account of the Building of Solomon's Temple Contains Serious
   Difficulties and is to Be Interpreted Spiritually.

   For the sake of those, however, who consider that nothing further than
   the narrative itself is meant to be indicated in these words, it may
   not be unfitting to introduce at this point some considerations which
   they can scarcely withstand, to show that the words ought to be
   regarded as those of the Spirit, and that the mind of the Spirit should
   be sought for in them.  Did the sons of the kings really spend their
   time in hewing the great and precious stones, and practise a craft so
   little in keeping with royal birth?  And the number of the
   burden-bearers and of the stone-cutters and of the officers, the
   duration, too, of the period of preparing the stones and marking them,
   is all this recorded as it really was?  The holy house, too, was got
   ready in peace and was to be built for God without hammer or axe or any
   iron tool, that there might be no disturbance in the house of God.  And
   again I would ask those who are in bondage to the letter how it is
   possible that there should be eighty thousand stone-cutters and that
   the house of God should be built out of hard white stones without the
   noise of hammer or axe or any iron tool being heard in His house while
   the building was going on?  Is it not living stones that are hewn
   without any noise or tumult somewhere outside the temple, so that they
   are brought ready prepared to the place which awaits them in the
   building?  And there is some sort of an ascent about the temple of God,
   not with angles, but with bends of straight lines.  For it is written,
   [5124] "And there was a winding staircase to the middle, and from the
   middle to the third floor;" for the staircase in the house of God had
   to be spiral, thus imitating in its ascent the circle, which is the
   most perfect figure.  But that this house might be secure five ties are
   built in it, [5125] as fair as possible, a cubit high, that on looking
   up one might see it to be suggested how we rise from sensible things to
   the so-called divine perceptions, and so be brought to perceive those
   things which are seen only by the mind.  But the place of the happier
   stones appears to be that called Dabir, [5126] where the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord was, and, as I may say, the handwriting of God,
   the tables written with His own finger.  And the whole house is
   overlaid with gold; "the whole house," we read, [5127] "he overlaid
   with gold until all the house was finished."  But there were two
   cherubim in Dabir, a word which the translators of the Hebrew Bible
   into Greek failed to render satisfactorily.  Some, failing to do
   justice to the language, render it the temple; but it is more sacred
   than the temple.  Now everything about the house was made golden, for a
   sign that the mind which is quite made perfect estimates accurately the
   things perceived by the intellect.  But it is not given to all to
   approach and know them; and hence the veil of the court is erected,
   since to most of the priests and levites the things in the inmost part
   of the temple are not revealed.

   25.  Further Spiritualizing of Solomon's Temple-Building.

   It is worth while to enquire how, on the one hand, Solomon the king is
   said to have built the temple, and on the other the master-builder whom
   Solomon sent and fetched, [5128] "Hiram of Tyre, the son of a woman who
   was a widow; and he was of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a
   man of Tyre, a worker in brass, and filled with wisdom and
   understanding, to work all works in brass; and he was brought in to
   King Solomon and wrought all his works."  Here I ask whether Solomon
   can be taken for the first-born of all creation, [5129] and Hiram for
   the man whom he assumed, from the constraint of men--for the word
   Tyrians means "constrainers"--the man who derived his birth from
   nature, and being filled with all manner of art and wisdom and
   understanding, was brought in to cooperate with the first-born of all
   creation, and to build the temple.  In this temple there are also
   windows, [5130] placed obliquely and out of sight, so that the
   illumination of the divine light may enter for salvation, and--why
   should I go into particulars?--that the body of Christ, the Church, may
   be found having the plan of the spiritual house and temple of God.  As
   I said before, we require that wisdom which is hidden in a mystery, and
   which he alone can apprehend who is able to say, "But we have the mind
   of Christ,"--we require that wisdom to interpret spiritually each
   detail of what is said in accordance with the will of Him who caused it
   to be written.  To enter into these details is not in accordance with
   our present subject.  What has been said may suffice to let us
   understand how "He spake about the temple of His body."

   26.  The Promises Addressed to Jerusalem in the Prophets Refer to the
   Church, and are Still to Be Fulfilled.

   After all this it is proper to ask whether what is narrated as having
   taken place about the temple has ever taken place or ever will take
   place about the spiritual house.  The argument may seem to pinch in
   whichever way we take it.  If we say that it is possible that something
   like what is told about the temple may take place with regard to the
   spiritual house, or has already taken place in it, then those who hear
   us will, with difficulty, be brought to admit that a change can take
   place in such good things as these, firstly, because they do not wish
   it, and secondly, because of the incongruity of thinking that such
   things admit of change.  If, on the other hand, We seek to maintain the
   unchangeableness of the good things once given to the saints, then we
   cannot apply to them what we find in the history, and we shall seem to
   be doing what those of the heresies do, who fail to maintain the unity
   of the narrative of Scripture from beginning to end.  If we are not to
   take the view proper to old wives or Jews, of the promises recorded in
   the prophets, and especially in Isaiah, if, that is to say, we are to
   look for their fulfilment in connection with the Jerusalem on earth,
   then, as certain remarkable things connected with the building of the
   temple and the restoration of the people from the captivity are spoken
   of as happening after the captivity and the destruction of the temple,
   we must say that we are now the temple and the people which was carried
   captive, but is to come up again to Judæa and Jerusalem, and to be
   built with the precious stones of Jerusalem.  But I cannot tell if it
   be possible that, at the revolution of long periods of time, things of
   the same nature should take place again, but in a worse way.  The
   prophecies of Isaiah which we mentioned are the following: [5131]
   "Behold I prepare for thy stone carbuncle and for thy foundation
   sapphire; and I will make thy battlements jasper, and thy gates stones
   of crystal, and thy outer wall choice stones; and all thy sons shall be
   taught of the Lord, and in great peace shall thy children be, and in
   righteousness shalt thou be built."  And a little further on, to the
   same Jerusalem: [5132]   "And the glory of Lebanon shall come to thee
   with cypress, and pine, and cedar, along with those who will glorify My
   holy place.  And the sons of them that humbled thee and insulted thee
   shall come to thee in fear; and thou shalt be called the city of the
   Lord, Sion of holy Israel, because thou wert desolate and hated, and
   there was none to help thee.  And I will make thee an eternal delight,
   a joy of generations of generations.  And thou shalt suck the milk of
   the Gentiles and shall eat the riches of kings, and thou shalt know
   that I am the Lord that saveth thee and the God of Israel that chooseth
   thee.  And instead of brass I will bring thee gold, and instead of iron
   I will bring thee silver, and for wood I will bring thee brass, and for
   stones iron.  And I will establish thy rulers in peace and thy
   overseers in righteousness.  And wickedness shall no more be heard in
   thy land, nor affliction and distress in thy borders, but thy walls
   shall be called salvation and thy gates sculpture.  And the sun shall
   no longer be to thee for light by day, nor shall the rising of the moon
   give light to thee by night, but Christ shall be to thee an everlasting
   light and thy God thy glory.  For thy sun shall no more go down, and
   thy moon shall not fail, for thy Lord shall be to thee an everlasting
   light, and the days of thy mourning shall be fulfilled."  These
   prophecies clearly refer to the age still to come, and they are
   addressed to the children of Israel in their captivity, to whom He was
   sent and came, who said, "I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the
   house of Israel." [5133]   Such things, though they are captives, they
   are to receive in their own land; and proselytes also are to come to
   them at that time through Christ, and are to fly to them, according to
   the saying, [5134] "Behold, proselytes shall come to thee through Me,
   and shall flee to thee for refuge."  And if all this is to take place
   with the captives, then it is plain that they must be about their
   temple, and that they must go up there again to be built up, having
   become the most precious of stones.  For we find with John in his
   Apocalyse, [5135] the promise made to him that overcomes, that he will
   be a pillar in the temple of God, and will go no more out.  All this I
   have said with a view to our obtaining a cursory view at least of the
   matters pertaining to the temple, and the house of God, and the Church
   and Jerusalem, which we cannot now take up systematically.  Those,
   however, who, in their reading of the prophets, do not shrink from the
   labour of seeking after their spiritual meaning, must enquire into
   these matters with the greatest particularity, and must take account of
   every possibility.  So far of "the temple of His body."

   27.  Of the Belief the Disciples Afterwards Attained in the Words of
   Jesus.

   "When He was raised from the dead, [5136] His disciples remembered that
   He spake this, and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus
   had said."  This tells us that after Jesus' resurrection from the dead
   His disciples saw that what He had said about the temple had a higher
   application to His passion and His resurrection; they remembered that
   the words, "In three days I will raise it up," pointed to the
   resurrection; "And they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus
   had said."  We are not told that they believed the Scripture or the
   word which Jesus said, before.  For faith in its full sense is the act
   of him who accepts with his whole soul what is professed at baptism.
   As for the higher sense, as we have already spoken of the resurrection
   from the dead of the whole body of the Lord, we have now to note that
   the disciples were put in mind by the fulfilment of the Scripture which
   when they were in life they had not fully understood; its meaning was
   now brought under their eyes and made quite clear to them, and they
   knew of what heavenly things it was the pattern and shadow.  Then they
   believed the Scripture who formerly did not believe it, and believed
   the word of Jesus which, as the speaker means to convey, they had not
   believed before the resurrection.  For how can any one be said in the
   full sense to believe the Scripture when he does not see in it the mind
   of the Holy Spirit, which God would have us to believe rather than the
   literal meaning?  From this point of view we must say that none of
   those who walk according to the flesh believe the spiritual things of
   the law, of the very beginnings of which they have no conception.  But,
   they say, those are more blessed who have not seen and yet believe,
   than those who have seen and have believed, and for this they quote the
   saying to Thomas at the end of the Gospel of John, [5137] "Blessed are
   they that have not seen and yet have believed."  But it is not said
   here that those who have not seen and yet have believed are more
   blessed than those who have seen and believed.  According to their view
   those after the Apostles are more blessed than the Apostles; than which
   nothing can be more foolish.  He who is to be blessed must see in his
   mind the things which he believes, and must be able with the Apostles
   to hear the words spoken to him, "Blessed are your eyes, for they see,
   and your ears, for they hear," [5138] and "Many prophets and righteous
   men have desired to see the things which ye see, and have not seen
   them, and to hear the things which ye hear, and have not heard them."
   Yet he may be content who only receives the inferior beatitude, which
   says: [5139]   "Blessed are they who have not seen and yet have
   believed."  But how much more blessed are those eyes which Jesus calls
   blessed for the things which they have seen, than those which have not
   attained to such a vision; Simeon is content to take into his arms the
   salvation of God, and after seeing it, he says, [5140] "Now, O Lord,
   lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word; for
   mine eyes have seen Thy salvation."  We must strive, therefore, as
   Solomon says, to open our eyes that we may be satisfied with bread;
   "Open thine eyes," he says, "and be satisfied with bread."  What I have
   said on the text, "They believe the Scripture and the word which Jesus
   had said unto them," may lead us to understand, after discussing the
   subject of faith, that the perfection of our faith will be given us at
   the great resurrection from the dead of the whole body of Jesus which
   is His Holy Church.  For what is said about knowledge, "Now I know in
   part," [5141] that, I think, may be said in the same way of every other
   good; and one of these others is faith.  "Now I believe in part," we
   may say, "but when that which is perfect is come, then the faith which
   is in part will be done away."  As with knowledge, so with faith, that
   which is through sight is far better, if I may say so, than that which
   is through a glass and in an enigma.

   28.  The Difference Between Believing in the Name of Jesus and
   Believing in Jesus Himself.

   "Now, when He was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many
   believed in His name, beholding His signs which He did.  But He, Jesus,
   did not trust Himself to them, because He knew all (men) and because He
   needed not that any should testify of man, for he Himself knew what was
   in man." [5142]   One might ask how Jesus did not Himself believe in
   those of whom we are told that they believed.  To this we must say it
   was not those who believed in Him that Jesus did not trust, but those
   who believed in His name; for believing in His name is a different
   thing from believing in Him.  He who will not be judged because of his
   faith is exempted from the judgment, not for believing in His name, but
   for believing in Him; for the Lord says, [5143] "He that believeth in
   Me is not judged," not, "He who believes in My name is not judged;" the
   latter believes, and hence he is not worthy to be condemned already,
   but he is inferior to the other who believes in Him.  Hence it is that
   Jesus does not trust Himself to him who believes in His name.  We must,
   therefore, cleave to Him rather than to His name, lest after we have
   done wonders in His name, we should hear these words addressed to us
   which He will speak to those who boast of His name alone. [5144]   With
   the Apostle Paul [5145] let us seek joyfully to say, "I can do all
   things in Christ Jesus strengthening me."  We have also to notice that
   in a former passage [5146] the Evangelist calls the passover that of
   the Jews, while here he does not say that Jesus was at the passover of
   the Jews, but at the passover at Jerusalem; and in the former case when
   the passover is called that of the Jews, it is not said to be a feast;
   but here Jesus is recorded to have been at the feast; when at Jerusalem
   He was at the passover during the feast, and many believed, even though
   only in His name.  We ought to notice certainly that "many" are said to
   believe, not in Him, but in His name.  Now, those who believe in Him
   are those who walk in the straight and narrow way, [5147] which leads
   to life, and which is found by few.  It may well be, however, that many
   of those who believe in His name will sit down with Abraham and Isaac
   and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, the Father's house, in which are
   many mansions.  And it is to be noted that the many who believe in His
   name do not believe in the same way as Andrew does, and Peter, and
   Nathanael, and Philip.  These believe the testimony of John when he
   says, "Behold the Lamb of God," or they believe in Christ as found by
   Andrew, or Jesus saying to Philip, "Follow Me," or Philip saying, "We
   have found Him of whom Moses and the prophets did write, Jesus the Son
   of Joseph from Nazareth."  Those, on the other hand, of whom we now
   speak, "believed in His name, beholding His signs which He did."  And
   as they believe the signs and not in Him but in His name, Jesus "did
   not trust Himself to them, because He knew all men, and needed not that
   any should testify of man, because He knew what is in every man."

   29.  About What Beings Jesus Needed Testimony.

   The words, "He needed not that any should testify of man," may fitly be
   used to show that the Son of God is able of Himself to see the truth
   about each man and is in no need of such testimony as any other could
   supply.  The words, however, "He had no need that any should testify of
   man," are not equivalent to "He had no need of testimony about any
   being."  If we take the word "man" to include every being who is
   according to the image of God, or every reasonable creature, then He
   will have no need that any should testify to Him of any reasonable
   being whatever, since He Himself, by the power given Him by the Father,
   knows them all.  But if the term "man" be restricted to mortal animated
   reasonable beings, then it might be said, on the one hand, that He had
   need of testimony respecting the beings above man, and while His
   knowledge was adequate with regard to man it did not extend to those
   other beings.  On the other hand, however, it might be said that He who
   humbled Himself had no need that any should testify to Him concerning
   man, but that He had such need in respect of beings higher than men.

   30.  How Jesus Knew the Powers, Better or Worse, Which Reside in Man.

   It may also be asked what signs those many saw Him do who believed on
   Him, for it is not recorded that He did any signs at Jerusalem, though
   some may have been done which are not recorded.  One may, however,
   consider if what He did may be called signs, when He made a scourge of
   small cords, and cast them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and
   the oxen, and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the
   tables.  As for those who suppose that it was only about men that He
   had no need of witnesses, it has to be said that the Evangelist
   attributes to Him two things, that He knew all beings, and that He had
   no need that any one should testify of man.  If He knew all beings,
   then He knew not only men but the beings above men, all beings who are
   without such bodies as ours; and He knew what was in man, since He was
   greater than those who reproved and judged by prophesying, and who
   brought to the light the secret things of the hearts of those whom the
   Spirit suggested to them to be thus dealt with.  The words, "He knew
   what was in man," could also be taken as referring to the powers,
   better or worse, which work in men.  For if any one gives place to the
   devil, Satan enters into him; thus did Judas give place, and thus did
   the devil put it in his heart to betray Jesus, and "after the sop,"
   therefore, "the devil entered into him." [5148]   But if any one gives
   place to God, he becomes blessed; for blessed is the man whose help is
   from God, and the ascent is in his heart from God. [5149]   Thou
   knowest what is in man, Thou who knowest all things, O Son of God.  And
   now that our tenth book has come to be large enough we will here pause
   in our theme.

   Origen's Commentary

   on the

   Gospel of Matthew.

   by

   John Patrick, D.D.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Commentary on Matthew.

   ------------------------

   Introduction.

   ------------------------

   According to Eusebius (H. E. vi. 36) the Commentaries on the Gospel of
   Matthew were written about the same time as the Contra Celsum, when
   Origen was over sixty years of age, and may therefore be probably
   assigned to the period 246-248.  This statement is confirmed by
   internal evidence.  In the portion here translated, books x.-xiv., he
   passes by the verses Matt. xviii. 12, 13, and refers for the exposition
   of them to his Homilies on Luke (book xiii. 29).  Elsewhere, he refers
   his readers for a fuller discussion on certain points to his
   Commentaries on John (book xvi. 20), and on Romans (book xvii. 32).  Of
   the twenty-five books into which the work was divided, the first nine,
   with the exception of two fragments, are lost; books x.-xvii., covering
   the portion from Matt. xiii. 36 to xxii. 33, are extant in the Greek,
   and the greater part of the remaining books survives in a Latin
   version, which is co-extensive with the Greek from book xii. 9 to book
   xvii. 36, and contains further the exposition from Matt. xxii. 34 to
   xxvii. 66.  The passages in Cramer's Catena do not seem to be taken
   from the Commentaries.  Of the numerous quotations from Matthew only
   one (Matt. xxi. 35) can be definitely traced to this section of the
   writings of Origen; and as this differs greatly from our present text,
   and is moreover purely narrative, it is probably taken like the others
   either from the Scholia (commaticum interpretationis genus), or from
   the Homilies to which reference is made by Jerome (Prol. in Matt. I.
   iv).  The majority of them may be ascribed to the Scholia.

   In addition to the mss. already referred to (p. 292) the old Latin
   version is often useful for determining the text, though it contains
   some interpolations and has many omissions.  The omissions (cf. book
   xiii. 28, book xiv. 1, 3, book xiv. 19-22) are not due to any dogmatic
   bias, but have been made by the translator or some subsequent
   transcriber on the ground that the passages were uninteresting or
   unimportant.  The version is otherwise for the most part literal, and
   has in some cases preserved the correct reading, though it often fails
   just when it would have been of most service.  For an estimate of the
   work and method of Origen as an exegete, see pp. 290-292; and for a
   fuller statement on some of the points here touched upon, see
   Westcott's article on Origen in Smith's Dictionary of Christian
   Biography (vol. iv.).

   From the First Book of the Commentary on Matthew. [5150]

   Concerning the four Gospels which alone are uncontroverted in the
   Church of God under heaven, I have learned by tradition that the Gospel
   according to Matthew, who was at one time a publican and afterwards an
   Apostle of Jesus Christ, was written first; and that he composed it in
   the Hebrew tongue and published it for the converts from Judaism.  The
   second written was that according to Mark, who wrote it according to
   the instruction of Peter, who, in his General Epistle, acknowledged him
   as a son, saying, "The church that is in Babylon, elect together with
   you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son." [5151]   And third, was
   that according to Luke, the Gospel commended by [5152] Paul, which he
   composed for the converts from the Gentiles.  Last of all, that
   according to John.

   Book II. [5153]

   The Unity and Harmony of Scripture.

   "Blessed are the peacemakers...." [5154]   To the man who is a
   peacemaker in either sense there is in the Divine oracles nothing
   crooked or perverse, for they are all plain to those who understand.
   [5155]   And because to such an one there is nothing crooked or
   perverse, he sees therefore abundance of peace [5156] in all the
   Scriptures, even in those which seem to be at conflict, and in
   contradiction with one another.  And likewise he becomes a third
   peacemaker as he demonstrates that that which appears to others to be a
   conflict in the Scriptures is no conflict, and exhibits their concord
   and peace, whether of the Old Scriptures with the New, or of the Law
   with the Prophets, or of the Gospels with the Apostolic Scriptures, or
   of the Apostolic Scriptures with each other.  For, also, according to
   the Preacher, all the Scriptures are "words of the wise like goads, and
   as nails firmly fixed which were given by agreement from one shepherd;"
   [5157] and there is nothing superfluous in them.  But the Word is the
   one Shepherd of things rational which may have an appearance of discord
   to those who have not ears to hear, but are truly at perfect concord.
   For as the different chords of the psalter or the lyre, each of which
   gives forth a certain sound of its own which seems unlike the sound of
   another chord, are thought by a man who is not musical and ignorant of
   the principle of musical harmony, to be inharmonious, because of the
   dissimilarity of the sounds, so those who are not skilled in hearing
   the harmony of God in the sacred Scriptures think that the Old is not
   in harmony with the New, or the Prophets with the Law, or the Gospels
   with one another, or the Apostle with the Gospel, or with himself, or
   with the other Apostles.  But he who comes instructed in the music of
   God, being a man wise in word and deed, and, on this account, like
   another David--which is, by interpretation, skilful with the hand--will
   bring out the sound of the music of God, having learned from this at
   the right time to strike the chords, now the chords of the Law, now the
   Gospel chords in harmony with them, and again the Prophetic chords,
   and, when reason demands it, the Apostolic chords which are in harmony
   with the Prophetic, and likewise the Apostolic with those of the
   Gospels.  For he knows that all the Scripture is the one perfect and
   harmonised [5158] instrument of God, which from different sounds gives
   forth one saving voice to those willing to learn, which stops and
   restrains every working of an evil spirit, just as the music of David
   laid to rest the evil spirit in Saul, which also was choking him.
   [5159]   You see, then, that he is in the third place a peacemaker, who
   sees in accordance with the Scripture the peace of it all, and implants
   this peace in those who rightly seek and make nice distinctions in a
   genuine spirit.

   Book X.

   1.  The Parable of the Tares:  the House of Jesus.

   "Then He left the multitudes and went into His house, and His disciples
   came unto Him saying, Declare to us the parable of the tares of the
   field." [5160]   When Jesus then is with the multitudes, He is not in
   His house, for the multitudes are outside of the house, and it is an
   act which springs from His love of men to leave the house and to go
   away to those who are not able to come to Him.  Now, having discoursed
   sufficiently to the multitudes in parables, He sends them away and goes
   to His own house, where His disciples, who did not abide with those
   whom He had sent away, come to Him.  And as many as are more genuine
   hearers of Jesus first follow Him, then having inquired about His
   abode, are permitted to see it, and, having come, see and abide with
   Him, all for that day, and perhaps some of them even longer.  And, in
   my opinion, such things are indicated in the Gospel according to John
   in these words, "On the morrow again John was standing and two of his
   disciples." [5161]   And in order to explain the fact that of those who
   were permitted to go with Jesus and see His abode, the one who was more
   eminent becomes also an Apostle, these words are added:  "One of the
   two that heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's
   brother." [5162]   And if then, unlike the multitudes whom He sends
   away, we wish to hear Jesus and go to the house and receive something
   better than the multitudes, let us become friends of Jesus, so that as
   His disciples we may come to Him when He goes into the house, and
   having come may inquire about the explanation of the parable, whether
   of the tares of the field, or of any other.  And in order that it may
   be more accurately understood what is represented by the house of
   Jesus, let some one collect from the Gospels whatsoever things are
   spoken about the house of Jesus, and what things were spoken or done by
   Him in it; for all the passages collected together will convince any
   one who applies himself to this reading that the letters of the Gospel
   are not absolutely simple as some suppose, but have become simple to
   the simple by a divine concession; [5163] but for those who have the
   will and the power to hear them more acutely there are concealed things
   wise and worthy of the Word of God.

   2.  Exposition of the Parable.

   "After these things He answered and said to them, He that soweth the
   good seed is the Son of man." [5164]   Though we have already, in
   previous sections, according to our ability discussed these matters,
   none the less shall we now say what is in harmony with them, even if
   there is reasonable ground for another explanation.  And consider now,
   if in addition to what we have already recounted, you can otherwise
   take the good seed to be the children of the kingdom, because
   whatsoever good things are sown in the human soul, these are the
   offspring of the kingdom of God and have been sown by God the Word who
   was in the beginning with God, [5165] so that wholesome words about
   anything are children of the kingdom.  But while men are asleep who do
   not act according to the command of Jesus, "Watch and pray that ye
   enter not into temptation," [5166] the devil on the watch sows what are
   called tares--that is, evil opinions--over and among what are called by
   some natural conceptions, even the good seeds which are from the Word.
   And according to this the whole world might be called a field, and not
   the Church of God only, for in the whole world the Son of man sowed the
   good seed, but the wicked one tares,--that is, evil words,--which,
   springing from wickedness, are children of the evil one.  And at the
   end of things, which is called "the consummation of the age," [5167]
   there will of necessity be a harvest, in order that the angels of God
   who have been appointed for this work may gather up the bad opinions
   that have grown upon the soul, and overturning them may give them over
   to fire which is said to burn, that they may be consumed.  And so the
   angels and servants of the Word will gather from all the kingdom of
   Christ all things that cause a stumbling-block to souls and reasonings
   that create iniquity, which they will scatter and cast into the burning
   furnace of fire.  Then those who become conscious that they have
   received the seeds of the evil one in themselves, because of their
   having been asleep, shall wail and, as it were, be angry against
   themselves; for this is the "gnashing of teeth." [5168]   Wherefore,
   also, in the Psalms it is said, "They gnashed upon me with their
   teeth." [5169]   Then above all "shall the righteous shine," no longer
   differently as at the first, but all "as one sun in the kingdom of
   their Father." [5170]   Then, as if to indicate that there was indeed a
   hidden meaning, perhaps, in all that is concerned with the explanation
   of the parable, perhaps most of all in the saying, "Then shall the
   righteous shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father," the Saviour
   adds, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear," [5171] thereby
   teaching those who think that in the exposition, the parable has been
   set forth with such perfect clearness that it can be understood by the
   vulgar, [5172] that even the things connected with the interpretation
   of the parable stand in need of explanation.

   3.  The Shining of the Righteous.  Its Interpretation.

   But as we said above in reference to the words, "Then shall the
   righteous shine as the sun," that the righteous will shine not
   differently as formerly, but as one sun, we will, of necessity, set
   forth what appears to us on the point.  Daniel, knowing that the
   intelligent are the light of the world, and that the multitudes of the
   righteous differ in glory, seems to have said this, "And the
   intelligent shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and from
   among the multitudes of the righteous as the stars for ever and ever."
   [5173]   And in the passage, "There is one glory of the sun, and
   another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars:  for one
   star differeth from another star in glory:  so also is the resurrection
   of the dead," [5174] the Apostle says the same thing as Daniel, taking
   this thought from his prophecy.  Some one may inquire how some speak
   about the difference of light among the righteous, while the Saviour on
   the contrary says, "They shall shine as one sun."  I think, then, that
   at the beginning of the blessedness enjoyed by those who are being
   saved (because those who are not such are not yet purified), the
   difference connected with the light of the saved takes place:  but
   when, as we have indicated, he gathers from the whole kingdom of Christ
   all things that make men stumble, and the reasonings that work iniquity
   are cast into the furnace of fire, and the worse elements utterly
   consumed, and, when this takes place, those who received the words
   which are the children of the evil one come to self-consciousness, then
   shall the righteous having become one light of the sun shine in the
   kingdom of their Father.  For whom will they shine?  For those below
   them who will enjoy their light, after the analogy of the sun which now
   shines for those upon the earth?  For, of course, they will not shine
   for themselves.  But perhaps the saying, "Let your light shine before
   men," [5175] can be written "upon the table of the heart," [5176]
   according to what is said by Solomon, in a threefold way; so that even
   now the light of the disciples of Jesus shines before the rest of men,
   and after death before the resurrection, and after the resurrection
   "until all shall attain unto a full-grown man," [5177] and all become
   one sun.  Then shall they shine as the sun in the kingdom of their
   Father.

   4.  Concerning the Parable of the Treasure Hidden in the Field.  The
   Parable Distinguished from the Similitude.

   "Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the
   field, which a man found and hid." [5178]   The former parables He
   spoke to the multitudes; but this and the two which follow it, which
   are not parables but similitudes in relation to the kingdom of heaven,
   He seems to have spoken to the disciples when in the house.  In regard
   to this and the next two, let him who "gives heed to reading" [5179]
   inquire whether they are parables at all.  In the case of the latter
   the Scripture does not hesitate to attach in each case the name of
   parable; but in the present case it has not done so; and that
   naturally.  For if He spoke to the multitudes in parables, and "spake
   all these things in parables, and without a parable spake nothing to
   them," [5180] but on going to the house He discourses not to the
   multitudes but to the disciples who came to Him there, manifestly the
   things spoken in the house were not parables:  for, to them that are
   without, even to those to whom "it is not given to know the mysteries
   of the kingdom of heaven," [5181] He speaks in parables.  Some one will
   then say, If they are not really parables, what are they?  Shall we
   then say in keeping with the diction of the Scripture that they are
   similitudes (comparisons)?  Now a similitude differs from a parable;
   for it is written in Mark, "To what shall we compare the kingdom of
   God, or in what parable shall we set it forth?" [5182]   From this it
   is plain that there is a difference between a similitude and a
   parable.  The similitude seems to be generic, and the parable
   specific.  And perhaps also as the similitude, which is the highest
   genus of the parable, contains the parable as one of its species, so it
   contains that particular form of similitude which has the same name as
   the genus.  This is the case with other words as those skilled in the
   giving of many names have observed; who say that "impulse" [5183] is
   the highest genus of many species, as, for example, of "disinclination"
   [5184] and "inclination," and say that, in the case of the species
   which has the same name as the genus, "inclination" is taken in
   opposition to and in distinction from "disinclination."

   5.  The Field and the Treasure Interpreted.

   And here we must inquire separately as to the field, and separately as
   to the treasure hidden in it, and in what way the man who has found
   this hidden treasure goes away with joy and sells all that he has in
   order to buy that field; and we must also inquire--what are the things
   which he sells.  The field, indeed, seems to me according to these
   things to be the Scripture, which was planted with what is manifest in
   the words of the history, and the law, and the prophets, and the rest
   of the thoughts; for great and varied is the planting of the words in
   the whole Scripture; but the treasure hidden in the field is the
   thoughts concealed and lying under that which is manifest, "of wisdom
   hidden in a mystery," "even Christ, in whom are all the treasures of
   wisdom and knowledge hidden." [5185]   But another might say that the
   field is that which is verily full, which the Lord blessed, the Christ
   of God; but the treasure hidden in it is the things said to have been
   "hidden in Christ" by Paul, who says about Christ, "in whom are the
   treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden."  The heavenly things,
   therefore, even the kingdom of heaven, as in a figure it is written in
   the Scriptures--which are the kingdom of heaven, or Christ--Himself the
   king of the ages, are the kingdom of heaven which is likened to a
   treasure hidden in the field.
     __________________________________________________________________

   6.  The Exposition Continued.

   And at this point you will inquire, whether the kingdom of heaven is
   likened only to the treasure hidden in the field, so that we are to
   think of the field as different from the kingdom, or is likened to the
   whole of this treasure hidden in the field, so that the kingdom of
   heaven contains according to the similitude both the field and the
   treasure hidden in the field.  Now a man who comes to the field,
   whether to the Scriptures or to the Christ who is constituted both from
   things manifest and from things hidden, finds the hidden treasure of
   wisdom whether in Christ or in the Scriptures.  For, going round to
   visit the field and searching the Scriptures and seeking to understand
   the Christ, he finds the treasure in it; and, having found it, he hides
   it, thinking that it is not without danger to reveal to everybody the
   secret meanings of the Scriptures, or the treasures of wisdom and
   knowledge in Christ.  And, having hidden it, he goes away, working and
   devising how he shall buy the field, or the Scriptures, that he may
   make them his own possession, receiving from the people of God the
   oracles of God with which the Jews were first entrusted. [5186]   And
   when the man taught by Christ has bought the field, the kingdom of God
   which, according to another parable, is a vineyard, "is taken from them
   and is given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof," [5187]
   --to him who in faith has bought the field, as the fruit of his having
   sold all that he had, and no longer keeping by him anything that was
   formerly his; for they were a source of evil to him.  And you will give
   the same application, if the field containing the hidden treasure be
   Christ, for those who give up all things and follow Him, have, as it
   were in another way, sold their possessions, in order that, by having
   sold and surrendered them, and having received in their place from
   God--their helper--a noble resolution, they may purchase, at great cost
   worthy of the field, the field containing the treasure hidden in
   itself.

   7.  The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price.  The Formation and
   Difference of Pearls.

   "Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant
   seeking goodly pearls." [5188]   There are many merchants engaged in
   many forms of merchandise, but not to any one of these is the kingdom
   of heaven like, but only to him who is seeking goodly pearls, and has
   found one equal in value to many, a very costly pearl which he has
   bought in place of many.  I consider it reasonable, then, to make some
   inquiry into the nature of the pearl. [5189]   Be careful however to
   note, that Christ did not say, "He sold all the pearls that he had,"
   for he sold not only those which one seeking goodly pearls had bought,
   but also everything which he had, in order to buy that goodly pearl.
   We find then in those who write on the subject of stones, with regard
   to the nature of the pearl, that some pearls are found by land, and
   some in the sea.  The land pearls are produced among the Indians only,
   being fitted for signet-rings and collets and necklaces; and the sea
   pearls, which are superior, are found among the same Indians, the best
   being produced in the Red Sea.  The next best pearls are those taken
   from the sea at Britain; and those of the third quality, which are
   inferior not only to the first but to the second, are those found at
   Bosporus off Scythia.  Concerning the Indian pearl these things further
   are said.  They are found in mussels, like in nature to very large
   spiral snail-shells; and these are described as in troops making the
   sea their pasture-ground, as if under the guidance of some leader,
   conspicuous in colour and size, and different from those under him, so
   that he has an analogous position to what is called the queen of the
   bees.  And likewise, in regard to the fishing for the best--that is,
   those in India--the following is told.  The natives surround with nets
   a large circle of the shore, and dive down, exerting themselves to
   seize that one of them all which is the leader; for they say that, when
   this one is captured, the catching of the troop subject to it costs no
   trouble, as not one of those in the troop remains stationary, but as if
   bound by a thong follows the leader of the troop.  It is said also that
   the formation of the pearls in India requires periods of time, the
   creature undergoing many changes and alterations until it is
   perfected.  And it is further reported that the shell--I mean, the
   shell of the animal which bears the pearl--opens and gapes, as it were,
   and being opened receives into itself the dew of heaven; when it is
   filled with dew pure and untroubled, it becomes illumined and brings
   forth a large and well-formed pearl; but if at any time it receives dew
   darkened, or uneven, or in winter, it conceives a pearl cloudy and
   disfigured with spots.  And this we also find that if it be intercepted
   by lightning when it is on the way towards the completion of the stone
   with which it is pregnant, it closes, and, as it were in terror,
   scatters and pours forth its offspring, so as to form what are called
   "physemata."  And sometimes, as if premature, they are born small, and
   are somewhat cloudy though well-formed.  As compared with the others
   the Indian pearl has these features.  It is white in colour, like to
   silver in transparency, and shines through as with a radiance somewhat
   greenish yellow, and as a rule is round in form; it is also of tender
   skin, and more delicate than it is the nature of a stone to be; so it
   is delightful to behold, worthy to be celebrated among the more
   notable, as he who wrote on the subject of stones used to say.  And
   this is also a mark of the best pearl, to be rounded off on the outer
   surface, very white in colour, very translucent, and very large in
   size.  So much about the Indian pearl.  But that found in Britain, they
   say, is of a golden tinge, but somewhat cloudy, and duller in sparkle.
   And that which is found in the strait of Bosporus is darker than that
   of Britain, and livid, and perfectly dim, soft and small.  And that
   which is produced in the strait of Bosporus is not found in the "pinna"
   which is the pearl-bearing species of shells. but in what are called
   mussels; and their habitat--I mean those at Bosporus--is in the
   marshes.  There is also said to be a fourth class of pearls in
   Acarnania in the "pinnæ" of oysters.  These are not greatly sought
   after, but are irregular in form, and perfectly dark and foul in
   colour; and there are others also different from these in the same
   Acarnania which are cast away on every ground.

   8.  The Parable Interpreted is the Light of These Views.

   Now, having collected these things out of dissertations about stones, I
   say that the Saviour with a knowledge of the difference of pearls, of
   which some are in kind goodly and others worthless, said, "The kingdom
   of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls;"
   [5190] for, if some of the pearls had not been worthless, it would not
   have been said, "to a man seeking goodly pearls."  Now among the words
   of all kinds which profess to announce truth, and among those who
   report them, he seeks pearls.  And let the prophets be, so to speak,
   the mussels which conceive the dew of heaven, and become pregnant with
   the word of truth from heaven, the goodly pearls which, according to
   the phrase here set forth, the merchantman seeks.  And the leader of
   the pearls, on the finding of which the rest are found with it, is the
   very costly pearl, the Christ of God, the Word which is superior to the
   precious letters and thoughts in the law and the prophets, on the
   finding of which also all the rest are easily taken.  And the Saviour
   holds converse with all the disciples, as merchant-men who are not only
   seeking the goodly pearls but who have found them and possess them,
   when He says, "Cast not your pearls before swine." [5191]   Now it is
   manifest that these things were said to the disciples from that which
   is prefixed to His words, "And seeing the multitudes He went up into
   the mountain, and when He had sat down His disciples came unto Him;"
   [5192] for, in the course of those words, He said, "Give not that which
   is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine."
   [5193]   Perhaps, then, he is not a disciple of Christ, who does not
   possess pearls or the very costly pearl, the pearls, I mean, which are
   goodly; not the cloudy, nor the darkened, such as the words of the
   heterodox, which are brought forth not at the sunrise, but at the
   sunset or in the north, if it is necessary to take also into the
   comparison those things on account of which we found a difference in
   the pearls which are produced in different places.  And perhaps the
   muddy words and the heresies which are bound up with works of the
   flesh, are the darkened pearls, and those which are produced in the
   marshes, not goodly pearls.

   9.  Christ the Pearl of Great Price.

   Now you will connect with the man seeking goodly pearls the saying,
   "Seek and ye shall find," [5194] and this--"Every one that seeketh
   findeth." [5195]   For what seek ye?  Or what does every one that
   seeketh find?  I venture to answer, pearls and the pearl which he
   possesses, who has given up all things, and counted them as loss; "for
   which," says Paul, "I have counted all things but loss that I may win
   Christ;" [5196] by "all things" meaning the goodly pearls, "that I may
   win Christ," the one very precious pearl.  Precious, then, is a lamp to
   men in darkness, and there is need of a lamp until the sun rise; and
   precious also is the glory in the face of Moses, and of the prophets
   also, I think, and a beautiful sight, by which we are introduced so as
   to be able to see the glory of Christ, to which the Father bears
   witness, saying, "This is My beloved Son in whom I am well-pleased."
   [5197]   But "that which hath been made glorious hath not been made
   glorious in this respect by reason of the glory that surpasseth;"
   [5198] and there is need to us first of the glory which admits of being
   done away, for the sake of the glory which surpasseth; as there is need
   of the knowledge which is in part, which will be done away when that
   which is perfect comes. [5199]   Every soul, therefore, which comes to
   childhood, and is on the way to full growth, until the fulness of time
   is at hand, needs a tutor and stewards and guardians, in order that,
   after all these things, he who formerly differed nothing from a
   bond-servant, though he is lord of all, [5200] may receive, when freed
   from a tutor and stewards and guardians, the patrimony corresponding to
   the very costly pearl, and to that which is perfect, which on its
   coming does away with that which is in part, when one is able to
   receive "the excellency of the knowledge of Christ," [5201] having been
   previously exercised, so to speak, in those forms of knowledge which
   are surpassed by the knowledge of Christ.  But the multitude, not
   perceiving the beauty of the many pearls of the law, and all the
   knowledge, "in part," though it be, of the prophets, suppose that they
   can, without a clear exposition and apprehension of these, find in
   whole [5202] the one precious pearl, and behold "the excellency of the
   knowledge of Christ," in comparison with which all things that came
   before such and so great knowledge, although they were not refuse in
   their own nature, appear to be refuse.  This refuse is perhaps the
   "dung" thrown down beside the fig tree by the keeper of the vineyard,
   which is the cause of its bearing fruit. [5203]

   10.  The Pearl of the Gospel in Relation to the Old Testament.

   "To everything then is its season, and a time for everything under
   heaven," [5204] a time to gather the goodly pearls, and a time after
   their gathering to find the one precious pearl, when it is fitting for
   a man to go away and sell all that he has in order that he may buy that
   pearl.  For as every man who is going to be wise in the words of truth
   must first be taught the rudiments, and further pass through the
   elementary instruction, and appreciate it highly but not abide in it,
   as one who, having honoured it at the beginning but passed over towards
   perfection, is grateful for the introduction because it was useful at
   the first; so the perfect apprehension of the law and the prophets is
   an elementary discipline for the perfect apprehension of the Gospel,
   and all the meaning in the words and deeds of Christ.

   11.  The Parable of the Drag-Net.

   "Again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the
   sea." [5205]   As in the case of images and statues, the likenesses are
   not likenesses in every respect of those things in relation to which
   they are made; but, for example, the image painted with wax on the
   plane surface of wood has the likeness of the surface along with the
   colour, but does not further preserve the hollows and prominences, but
   only their outward appearance; and in the moulding of statues an
   endeavour is made to preserve the likeness in respect of the hollows
   and the prominences, but not in respect of the colour; and, if the cast
   be formed of wax, it endeavours to preserve both, I mean both the
   colour and also the hollows and the prominences, but is not indeed an
   image of the things in the respect of depth; so conceive with me also
   that, in the case of the similitudes in the Gospel, when the kingdom of
   heaven is likened unto anything, the comparison does not extend to all
   the features of that to which the kingdom is compared, but only to
   those features which are required by the argument in hand.  And here,
   accordingly, the kingdom of heaven is "like unto a net that was cast
   into the sea," not (as supposed by some, [5206] who represent that by
   this word the different natures of those who have come into the net,
   to-wit, the evil and the righteous, are treated of), as if it is to be
   thought that, because of the phrase "which gathered of every kind,"
   there are many different natures of the righteous and likewise also of
   the evil; for to such an interpretation all the Scriptures are opposed,
   which emphasise the freedom of the will, and censure those who sin and
   approve those who do right; or otherwise blame could not rightly attach
   to those of the kinds that were such by nature, nor praise to those of
   a better kind.  For the reason why fishes are good or bad lies not in
   the souls of the fishes, but is based on that which the Word said with
   knowledge, "Let the waters bring forth creeping things with living
   souls," [5207] when, also, "God made great sea-monsters and every soul
   of creeping creatures which the waters brought forth according to their
   kinds." [5208]   There, accordingly, "The waters brought forth every
   soul of creeping animals according to their kinds," the cause not being
   in it; but here we are responsible for our being good kinds and worthy
   of what are called "vessels," or bad and worthy of being cast outside.
   For it is not the nature in us which is the cause of the evil, but it
   is the voluntary choice which worketh evil; and so our nature is not
   the cause of righteousness, as if it were incapable of admitting
   unrighteousness, but it is the principle which we have admitted that
   makes men righteous; for also you never see the kinds of things in the
   water changing from the bad kinds of fishes into the good, or from the
   better kind to the worse; but you can always behold the righteous or
   evil among men either coming from wickedness to virtue, or returning
   from progress towards virtue to the flood of wickedness.  Wherefore
   also in Ezekiel, concerning the man who turns away from unrighteousness
   to the keeping of the divine commandments, it is thus written:  "But if
   the wicked man turn away from all his wickednesses which he hath done,"
   etc., down to the words, "that he turn from his wicked way and live;"
   [5209] but concerning the man who returns from the advance towards
   virtue unto the flood of wickedness it is said, "But in the case of the
   righteous man turning away from his righteousness and committing
   iniquity," etc., down to the words, "in his sins which he hath sinned
   in them shall he die." [5210]   Let those who, from the parable of the
   drag-net, introduce the doctrine of different natures, tell us in
   regard to the wicked man who afterwards turned aside from all the
   wickednesses which he committed and keeps all the commandments of God,
   and does that which is righteous and merciful, of what nature was he
   when he was wicked?  Clearly not of a nature to be praised.  If verily
   of a nature to be censured, of what kind of nature can he reasonably be
   described, when he turns away from all his sins which he did?  For if
   he were of the bad class of natures, because of his former deeds, how
   did he change to that which was better?  Or if because of his
   subsequent deeds you would say that he was of the good class, how being
   good by nature did he become wicked?  And you will also meet with a
   like dilemma in regard to the righteous man turning away from his
   righteousness and committing unrighteousness in all manner of sins.
   For before he turned away from righteousness, being occupied with
   righteous deeds he was not of a bad nature, for a bad nature could not
   be in righteousness, since a bad tree--that is wickedness--cannot
   produce good fruits,--the fruits that spring from virtue.  Again, on
   the other hand, if he had been of a good and unchangeable nature he
   would not have turned away from the good after being called righteous,
   so as to commit unrighteousness in all his sins which he committed.

   12.  The Divine Scriptures Compared to a Net.

   Now, these things being said, we must hold that "the kingdom of heaven
   is likened to a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every
   kind, [5211] " in order to set forth the varied character of the
   principles of action among men, which are as different as possible from
   each other, so that the expression "gathered from every kind" embraces
   both those worthy of praise and those worthy of blame in respect of
   their proclivities towards the forms of virtues or of vices.  And the
   kingdom of heaven is likened unto the variegated texture of a net, with
   reference to the Old and the New Scripture which is woven of thoughts
   of all kinds and greatly varied.  As in the case of the fishes that
   fall into the net, some are found in one part of the net and some in
   another part, and each at the part at which it was caught, so in the
   case of those who have come into the net of the Scriptures you would
   find some caught in the prophetic net; for example, of Isaiah,
   according to this expression, or of Jeremiah or of Daniel; and others
   in the net of the law, and others in the Gospel net, and some in the
   apostolic net; for when one is first captured by the Word or seems to
   be captured, he is taken from some part of the whole net.  And it is
   nothing strange if some of the fishes caught are encompassed by the
   whole texture of the net in the Scriptures, and are pressed in on every
   side and caught, so that they are unable to escape but are, as it were,
   absolutely enslaved, and not permitted to escape from the net.  And
   this net has been cast into the sea--the wave--tossed life of men in
   every part of the world, and which swims in the bitter affairs of
   life.  And before our Saviour Jesus Christ this net was not wholly
   filled; for the net of the law and the prophets had to be completed by
   Him who says, "Think not that I came to destroy the law and the
   prophets, I came not to destroy but to fulfil." [5212]   And the
   texture of the net has been completed in the Gospels, and in the words
   of Christ through the Apostles.  On this account, therefore, "the
   kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and
   gathered of every kind."  And, apart from what has been said, the
   expression, "gathered from every kind," may show forth the calling of
   the Gentiles from every race.  And those who attended to the net which
   was cast into the sea are Jesus Christ, the master of the net, and "the
   angels who came and ministered unto Him," [5213] who do not draw up the
   net from the sea, nor carry it to the shore beyond the sea,--namely, to
   things beyond this life, unless the net be filled full, that is, unless
   the "fulness of the Gentiles" has come into it.  But when it has come,
   then they draw it up from things here below, and carry it to what is
   figuratively called the shore, where it will be the work of those who
   have drawn it up, both to sit by the shore, and there to settle
   themselves, in order that they may place each of the good in the net
   into its own order, according to what are here called "vessels," but
   cast without and away those that are of an opposite character and are
   called bad.  By "without" is meant the furnace of fire as the Saviour
   interpreted, saying, "So shall it be at the consummation of the age.
   The angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the
   righteous and shall cast them into the furnace of fire." [5214]   Only
   it must be observed, that we are already taught by the parable of the
   tares and the similitude set forth, that the angels are to be entrusted
   with the power to distinguish and separate the evil from the righteous;
   for it is said above, "The Son of man shall send forth His angels, and
   they shall gather out of His kingdom all things that cause stumbling,
   and them that do iniquity, and shall cast them into the furnace of
   fire:  there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth." [5215]   But
   here it is said, "The angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from
   among the righteous and shall cast them into the furnace of fire."

   13.  Relation of Men to Angels.

   From this it does not follow, as some suppose, that the men who are
   saved in Christ are superior even to the holy angels; for how can those
   who are cast by the holy angels into vessels be compared with those who
   cast them into vessels, seeing that they have been put under the
   authority of the angels?  While we say this, we are not ignorant that
   the men who will be saved in Christ surpass some angels--namely, those
   who have not been entrusted with this office--but not all of them.  For
   we read, "Which things angels desire to look into," [5216] where it is
   not said "all" angels.  And we know also this--"We shall judge angels"
   [5217] where it is not said "all" angels.  Now since these things are
   written about the net and about those in the net, we say that he who
   desires that, before the consummation of the age, and before the coming
   of the angels to sever the wicked from among the righteous, there
   should be no evil persons "of every kind" in the net, seems not to have
   understood the Scripture, and to desire the impossible.  Wherefore let
   us not be surprised if, before the severing of the wicked from among
   the righteous by the angels who are sent forth for this purpose, we see
   our gatherings also filled with wicked persons.  And would that those
   who will be cast into the furnace of fire may not be greater in number
   than the righteous!  But since we said in the beginning, that the
   parables and similitudes are not to be accepted in respect of all the
   things to which they are likened or compared, but only in respect of
   some things, we must further establish from the things to be said, that
   in the case of the fishes, so far as their life is concerned, an evil
   thing happens to them when they are found in the net.  For they are
   deprived of the life which is theirs by nature, and whether they are
   cast into vessels or cast away, they suffer nothing more than the loss
   of the life as it is in fishes; but, in the case of those to whom the
   parable refers, the evil thing is to be in the sea and not to come into
   the net, in order to be cast along with the good into vessels.  And in
   like manner the bad fishes are cast without and thrown away; but the
   bad in the similitude before us are cast into "the furnace of fire,"
   that what is said in Ezekiel about the furnace of fire may also
   overtake them--"And the Word of the Lord came unto me saying, Son of
   man behold the house of Israel is become to me all mixed with brass and
   iron," etc., down to the words, "And ye shall know that I the Lord have
   poured My fury upon you." [5218]

   14.  The Disciples as Scribes.

   "Have ye understood all these things?  They say, Yea." [5219]   Christ
   Jesus, who knows the things in the hearts of men, [5220] as John also
   taught concerning Him in the Gospel, puts the question not as one
   ignorant, but having once for all taken upon Him the nature of man, He
   uses also all the characteristics of a man of which "asking" is one.
   And there is nothing to be wondered at in the Saviour doing this, since
   indeed the God of the universe, bearing with the manners of men as a
   man beareth with the manners of his son, makes inquiry, as--"Adam,
   where art thou?" [5221] and, "Where is Abel thy brother?" [5222]   But
   some one with a forced interpretation will say here that the words
   "have understood" are not to be taken interrogatively but
   affirmatively; and he will say that the disciples bearing testimony to
   His affirmation, say, "Yea."  Only, whether he is putting a question or
   making an affirmation, it is necessarily said not "these things"
   only,--which is demonstrative,--not "all things" only, but "all these
   things."  And here He seems to represent the disciples as having been
   scribes before the kingdom of heaven; [5223] but to this is opposed
   what is said in the Acts of the Apostles thus, "Now when they beheld
   the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned
   and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them that
   they had been with Jesus." [5224]   Some one may inquire in regard to
   these things--if they were scribes, how are they spoken of in the Acts
   as unlearned and ignorant men?  Or if they were unlearned and ignorant
   men, how are they very plainly called scribes by the Saviour?  And it
   might be answered to these inquiries that, as a matter of fact, not all
   the disciples but only Peter and John are described in the Acts as
   unlearned and ignorant, but that there were more disciples in regard to
   whom, because they understood all things, it is said, "Every scribe,"
   etc.  Or it might be said that every one who has been instructed in the
   teaching according to the letter of the law is called a scribe, so that
   those who were unlearned and ignorant and led captive by the letter of
   the law are spoken of as scribes in a particular sense.  And it is very
   specially the characteristic of ignorant men, who are unskilled in
   figurative interpretation and do not understand what is concerned with
   the mystical [5225] exposition of the Scriptures, but believe the bare
   letter, and, vindicate it, that they call themselves scribes.  And so
   one will interpret the words, "Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees,
   hypocrites," [5226] as having been said to every one that knows nothing
   but the letter.  Here you will inquire if the scribe of the Gospel be
   as the scribe of the law, and if the former deals with the Gospel, as
   the latter with the law, reading and hearing and telling "those things
   which contain an allegory," [5227] so as, while preserving the historic
   truth of the events, to understand the unerring principle of mystic
   interpretation applied to things spiritual, so that the things learned
   may not be "spiritual things whose characteristic is wickedness,"
   [5228] but may be entirely opposite to such, namely, spiritual things
   whose characteristic is goodness.  And one is a scribe "made a disciple
   to the kingdom of heaven" in the simpler sense, when he comes from
   Judaism and receives the teaching of Jesus Christ as defined by the
   Church; but he is a scribe in a deeper sense, when having received
   elementary knowledge through the letter of the Scriptures he ascends to
   things spiritual, which are called the kingdom of the heavens.  And
   according as each thought is attained, and grasped abstractly [5229]
   and proved by example and absolute demonstration, can one understand
   the kingdom of heaven, so that he who abounds in knowledge free from
   error is in the kingdom of the multitude of what are here represented
   as "heavens."  So, too, you will allegorise the word, "Repent, for the
   kingdom of the heavens is at hand," [5230] as meaning that the
   scribes--that is, those who rest satisfied in the bare letter--may
   repent of this method of interpretation and be instructed in the
   spiritual teaching which is called the kingdom of the heavens through
   Jesus Christ the living Word.  Wherefore, also, so far as Jesus Christ,
   "who was in the beginning with God, God the word," [5231] has not His
   home in a soul, the kingdom of heaven is not in it, but when any one
   becomes nigh to admission of the Word, to him the kingdom of heaven is
   nigh.  But if the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God are the same
   thing in reality, [5232] if not in idea, manifestly to those to whom it
   is said, "The kingdom of God is within you," [5233] to them also it
   might be said, "The kingdom of heaven is within you;" and most of all
   because of the repentance from the letter unto the spirit; since "When
   one turn to the Lord, the veil over the letter is taken away.  But the
   Lord is the Spirit." [5234]   And he who is truly a householder is both
   free and rich; rich because from the office of the scribe he has been
   made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven, in every word of the Old
   Testament, and in all knowledge concerning the new teaching of Christ
   Jesus, and has this riches laid up in his own treasure-house--in
   heaven, in which he stores his treasure as one who has been made a
   disciple to the kingdom of heaven,--where neither moth doth consume,
   nor thieves break through. [5235]   And in regard to him, who, as we
   have said, lays up treasure in heaven, we may truly lay down that not
   one moth of the passions can touch his spiritual and heavenly
   possessions.  "A moth of the passions," I said, taking the suggestion
   from the "Proverbs" in which it is written, "a worm in wood, so pain
   woundeth the heart of man." [5236]   For pain is a worm and a moth,
   which wounds the heart which has not its treasures in heaven and
   spiritual things, for if a man has his treasure in these--"for where
   the treasure is, there will the heart be also," [5237] --he has his
   heart in heaven, and on account of it he says, "Though an host should
   encamp against me, my heart shall not fear." [5238]   And so neither
   can thieves in regard to whom the Saviour said, "All that came before
   Me are thieves and robbers," [5239] break through those things which
   are treasured up in heaven, and through the heart which is in heaven
   and therefore says, "He raised us up with Him, and made us to sit with
   Him in the heavenly places in Christ," [5240] and, "Our citizenship is
   in heaven." [5241]

   15.  The Householder and His Treasury.

   Now since "every scribe who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of
   heaven is like unto a man that is a householder who bringeth forth out
   of his treasury things new and old," [5242] it clearly follows, by
   "conversion of the proposition," as it is called, that every one who
   does not bring forth out of his treasury things new and old, is not a
   scribe who has been made a disciple unto the kingdom of heaven.  We
   must endeavour, therefore, in every way to gather in our heart, "by
   giving heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching," [5243] and by
   "meditating in the law of the Lord day and night," [5244] not only the
   new oracles of the Gospels and of the Apostles and their Revelation,
   but also the old things in the law "which has the shadow of the good
   things to come," [5245] and in the prophets who prophesied in
   accordance with them.  And these things will be gathered together, when
   we also read and know, and remembering them, compare at a fitting time
   things spiritual with spiritual, not comparing things that cannot be
   compared with one another, but things which admit of comparison, and
   which have a certain likeness of diction signifying the same thing, and
   of thoughts and of opinions, so that by the mouth of two or three or
   more witnesses [5246] from the Scripture, we may establish and confirm
   every word of God.  By means of them also we must refute those who, as
   far as in them lies, cleave in twain the Godhead and cut off the New
   from the Old, [5247] so that they are far removed from likeness to the
   householder who brings forth out of his treasury things new and old.
   And since he who is likened to any one is different from the one to
   whom he is likened, the scribe "who is made a disciple unto the kingdom
   of heaven" will be the one who is likened, but different from him is
   the householder "who brings out of his treasury things new and old."
   But he who is likened to him, as in imitation of him, wishes to do that
   which is like.  Perhaps, then, the man who is a householder is Jesus
   Himself, who brings forth out of His treasury, according to the time of
   the teaching, things new, things spiritual, which also are always being
   renewed by Him in the "inner man" of the righteous, who are themselves
   always being renewed day by day, [5248] and old things, things "written
   and engraven on stones," [5249] and in the stony hearts of the old man,
   so that by comparison of the letter and by exhibition of the spirit He
   may enrich the scribe who is made a disciple unto the kingdom of
   heaven, and make him like unto Himself; until the disciple shall be as
   the Master, imitating first the imitator of Christ, and after him
   Christ Himself, according to that which is said by Paul, "Be ye
   imitators of me even as I also of Christ." [5250]   And likewise, Jesus
   the householder may in the simpler sense bring forth out of His
   treasury things new,--that is, the evangelic teaching--and things
   old,--that is, the comparison of the sayings which are taken from the
   law and the prophets, of which we may find examples in the Gospels.
   And with regard to these things new and old, we must attend also to the
   spiritual law which says in Leviticus, "And ye shall eat old things,
   and the old things of the old, and ye shall bring forth the old from
   before the new; and I will set my tabernacle among you." [5251]   For
   we eat with blessing the old things,--the prophetic words,--and the old
   things of the old things,--the words of the law; and, when the new and
   evangelical words came, living according to the Gospel we bring forth
   the old things of the letter from before the new, and He sets His
   tabernacle in us, fulfilling the promise which He spoke, "I will dwell
   among them and walk in them." [5252]

   16.  Parables in Relation to Similitudes.  Jesus in His Own Country.

   "And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, He
   departed thence.  And coming into His own country." [5253]   Since we
   inquired above whether the things spoken to the multitude were
   parables, and those spoken to the disciples were similitudes, and set
   forth observations bearing on this in my judgment not contemptible, you
   must know that the sentence which is subjoined, "And it came to pass
   when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed thence," will
   appear to be in opposition to all these arguments, as applying not only
   to the parables, but also to the similitudes as we have expounded.  We
   inquire therefore whether all these things are to be rejected, or
   whether we must speak of two kinds of parables, those spoken to the
   multitudes, and those announced to the disciples; or whether we are to
   think of the name of parable as equi-vocal; or whether the saying, "And
   it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables," is to be
   referred only to the parables above, which come before the
   similitudes.  For, because of the saying, "To you it is given to know
   the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to the rest in parables,"
   [5254] it was not possible to say to the disciples, inasmuch as they
   were not of those without, that the Saviour spoke to them in parables.
   And it follows from this, that the saying, "And it came to pass when
   Jesus had finished these parables, He departed thence," is to be
   referred to the parables spoken above, or that the name parable is
   equivocal, or that there are two kinds of parables, or that these which
   we have named similitudes were not parables at all.  And observe that
   it was outside of His own country He speaks the parables "which, when
   He had finished, He departed thence; and coming into His own country He
   taught them in their synagogue."  And Mark says, "And He came into His
   own country and His disciples follow Him." [5255]   We must therefore
   inquire whether, by the expression, "His own country," is meant
   Nazareth or Bethlehem,--Nazareth, because of the saying, "He shall be
   called a Nazarene," [5256] or Bethlehem, since in it He was born.  And
   further I reflect whether the Evangelists could have said, "coming to
   Bethlehem," or, "coming to Nazareth."  They have not done so, but have
   named it "His country," because of something being declared in a mystic
   sense in the passage about His country,--namely, the whole of
   Judæa,--in which He was dishonoured according to the saying, "A prophet
   is not without honour, save in his own country." [5257]   And if anyone
   thinks of Jesus Christ, "a stumbling-block to the Jews," [5258] among
   whom He is persecuted even until now, but proclaimed among the Gentiles
   and believed in,--for His word has run over the whole world,--he will
   see that in His own country Jesus had no honour, but that among those
   who were "strangers from the covenants," [5259] the Gentiles, He is
   held in honour.  But what things He taught and spake in their synagogue
   the Evangelists have not recorded, but only that they were so great and
   of such a nature that all were astonished.  And probably the things
   spoken were too high to be written down.  Only be it noted, He taught
   in their synagogue, not separating from it, nor disregarding it.

   17.  The Brethren of Jesus.

   And the saying, "Whence hath this man this wisdom," [5260] indicates
   clearly that there was a great and surpassing wisdom in the words of
   Jesus worthy of the saying, "lo, a greater than Solomon is here."
   [5261]   And He was wont to do greater miracles than those wrought
   through Elijah and Elisha, and at a still earlier date through Moses
   and Joshua the son of Nun.  And they spoke, wondering, (not knowing
   that He was the son of a virgin, or not believing it even if it was
   told to them, but supposing that He was the son of Joseph the
   carpenter,) "is not this the carpenter's son?" [5262]   And
   depreciating the whole of what appeared to be His nearest kindred, they
   said, "Is not His mother called Mary?  And His brethren, James and
   Joseph and Simon and Judas?  And His sisters, are they not all with
   us?" [5263]   They thought, then, that He was the son of Joseph and
   Mary.  But some say, basing it on a tradition in the Gospel according
   to Peter, [5264] as it is entitled, or "The Book of James," [5265] that
   the brethren of Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former wife, whom he
   married before Mary.  Now those who say so wish to preserve the honour
   of Mary in virginity to the end, so that that body of hers which was
   appointed to minister to the Word which said, "The Holy Ghost shall
   come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee,"
   [5266] might not know intercourse with a man after that the Holy Ghost
   came into her and the power from on high overshadowed her.  And I think
   it in harmony with reason that Jesus was the first-fruit among men of
   the purity which consists in chastity, and Mary among women; for it
   were not pious to ascribe to any other than to her the first-fruit of
   virginity.  And James is he whom Paul says in the Epistle to the
   Galatians that he saw, "But other of the Apostles saw I none, save
   James the Lord's brother." [5267]   And to so great a reputation among
   the people for righteousness did this James rise, that Flavius
   Josephus, who wrote the "Antiquities of the Jews" in twenty books, when
   wishing to exhibit the cause why the people suffered so great
   misfortunes that even the temple was razed to the ground, said, that
   these things happened to them in accordance with the wrath of God in
   consequence of the things which they had dared to do against James the
   brother of Jesus who is called Christ. [5268]   And the wonderful thing
   is, that, though he did not accept Jesus as Christ, he yet gave
   testimony that the righteousness of James was so great; and he says
   that the people thought that they had suffered these things because of
   James.  And Jude, who wrote a letter of few lines, it is true, but
   filled with the healthful words of heavenly grace, said in the preface,
   "Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James." [5269]
   With regard to Joseph and Simon we have nothing to tell; but the
   saying, "And His sisters are they not all with us," [5270] seems to me
   to signify something of this nature--they mind our things, not those of
   Jesus, and have no unusual portion of surpassing wisdom as Jesus has.
   And perhaps by these things is indicated a new doubt concerning Him,
   that Jesus was not a man but something diviner, inasmuch as He was, as
   they supposed, the son of Joseph and Mary, and the brother of four, and
   of the others--the women--as well, and yet had nothing like to any one
   of His kindred, and had not from education and teaching come to such a
   height of wisdom and power.  For they also say elsewhere, "How knoweth
   this man letters having never learned?" [5271] which is similar to what
   is here said.  Only, though they say these things and are so perplexed
   and astonished, they did not believe, but were offended in Him; as if
   they had been mastered in the eyes of their mind by the powers which,
   in the time of the passion, He was about to lead in triumph on the
   cross.

   18.  Prophets in Their Country.

   "But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his
   own country." [5272]   We must inquire whether the expression has the
   same force when applied universally to every prophet (as if each one of
   the prophets was dishonoured in his own country only, but not as if
   every one who was dishonoured was dishonoured in his country); or,
   because of the expression being singular, these things were said about
   one.  If, then, these words are spoken about one, these things which
   have been said suffice, if we refer that which is written to the
   Saviour.  But if it is general, it is not historically true; for Elijah
   did not suffer dishonour in Tishbeth of Gilead, nor Elisha in
   Abelmeholah, nor Samuel in Ramathaim, nor Jeremiah in Anathoth.  But,
   figuratively interpreted, it is absolutely true; for we must think of
   Judæa as their country, and that famous Israel as their kindred, and
   perhaps of the body as the house.  For all suffered dishonour in Judæa
   from the Israel which is according to the flesh, while they were yet in
   the body, as it is written in the Acts of the Apostles, as having been
   spoken in censure to the people, "Which of the prophets did not your
   fathers persecute, who showed before of the coming of the Righteous
   one?" [5273]   And by Paul in the First Epistle to the Thessalonians
   like things are said:  "For ye brethren became imitators of the
   churches of God which are in Judæa in Christ Jesus, for ye also
   suffered the same things of your own countrymen even as they did of the
   Jews, who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drave out
   us, and please not God, and are contrary to all men." [5274]   A
   prophet, then, is not without honour among the Gentiles; for either
   they do not know him at all, or, having learned and received him as a
   prophet, they honour him.  And such are those who are of the Church.
   Prophets suffer dishonour, first, when they are persecuted, according
   to historical fact, by the people, and, secondly, when their prophecy
   is not believed by the people.  For if they had believed Moses and the
   prophets they would have believed Christ, who showed that when men
   believed Moses and the prophets, belief in Christ logically followed,
   and that when men did not believe Christ they did not believe Moses.
   [5275]   Moreover, as by the transgression of the law he who sins is
   said to dishonour God, so by not believing in that which is prophesied
   the prophet is dishonoured by the man who disbelieves the prophecies.
   And so far as the literal truth is concerned, it is useful to recount
   what things Jeremiah suffered among the people in relation to which he
   said, "And I said, I will not speak, nor will I call upon the name of
   the Lord." [5276]   And again, elsewhere, "I was continually being
   mocked." [5277]   And how great sufferings he endured from the then
   king of Israel are written in his prophecy.  And it is also written
   that some of the people often came to stone Moses to death; for his
   fatherland was not the stones of any place, but the people who followed
   him, among whom also he was dishonoured.  And Isaiah is reported to
   have been sawn asunder by the people; and if any one does not accept
   the statement because of its being found in the Apocryphal Isaiah,
   [5278] let him believe what is written thus in the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, "They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted;"
   [5279] for the expression, "They were sawn asunder," refers to Isaiah,
   just as the words, "They were slain with the sword," refer to
   Zacharias, who was slain "between the sanctuary and the altar," [5280]
   as the Saviour taught, bearing testimony, as I think, to a Scripture,
   though not extant in the common and widely circulated books, but
   perhaps in apocryphal books.  And they, too, were dishonoured in their
   own country among the Jews who went about "in sheep-skins, in
   goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted," and so on; [5281] "For all
   that will to live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
   [5282]   And probably because Paul knew this, "That a prophet has no
   honour in his own country," though he preached the Word in many places
   he did not preach it in Tarsus.  And the Apostles on this account left
   Israel and did that which had been enjoined on them by the Saviour,
   "Make disciples of all the nations," [5283] and, "Ye shall be My
   witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judæa and Samaria, and unto the
   uttermost part of the earth." [5284]   For they did that which had been
   commanded them in Judæa and Jerusalem; but, since a prophet has no
   honour in his own country, when the Jews did not receive the Word, they
   went away to the Gentiles.  Consider, too, if, because of the fact that
   the saying, "I will pour forth of My Spirit upon all flesh, and they
   shall prophesy," [5285] has been fulfilled in the churches from the
   Gentiles, you can say that those formerly of the world and who by
   believing became no longer of the world, having received the Holy
   Spirit in their own country--that is, the world--and prophesying, have
   not honour, but are dishonoured.  Wherefore blessed are they who suffer
   the same things as the prophets, according to what was said by the
   Saviour, "For in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets."
   [5286]   Now if any one who attends carefully to these things be hated
   and attacked, because of his living with rigorous austerity, and his
   reproof of sinners, as a man who is persecuted and reproached for the
   sake of righteousness, he will not only not be grieved, but will
   rejoice and be exceeding glad, being assured that, because of these
   things, he has great reward in heaven from Him who likened him to the
   prophets on the ground of his having suffered the same things.
   Therefore, he who zealously imitates the prophetic life, and attains to
   the spirit which was in them, must be dishonoured in the world, and in
   the eyes of sinners, to whom the life of the righteous man is a burden.

   19.  Relation of Faith and Unbelief to the Supernatural Powers of
   Jesus.

   Following this you may see, "He did not there many mighty works because
   of their unbelief." [5287]   We are taught by these things that powers
   were found in those who believed, since "to every one that hath shall
   be given and he shall have abundance," [5288] but among unbelievers not
   only did the powers not work, but as Mark wrote, "They could not work."
   [5289]   For attend to the words, "He could not there do any mighty
   works," for it is not said, "He would not," but "He could not; "as if
   there came to the power when working co-operation from the faith of him
   on whom the power was working, but this co-operation was hindered in
   its exercise by unbelief.  See, then, that to those who said, "Why
   could we not cast it out?" He said, "Because of your little faith."
   [5290]   And to Peter, when he began to sink, it was said, "O thou of
   little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?" [5291]   But, moreover, she
   who had the issue of blood, who did not ask for the cure, but only
   reasoned that if she were to touch the hem of His garment she would be
   healed, was healed on the spot.  And the Saviour, acknowledging the
   method of healing, says, "Who touched Me?  For I perceived that power
   went forth from Me." [5292]   And perhaps, as in the case of material
   things there exists in some things a natural attraction towards some
   other thing, as in the magnet for iron, and in what is called naphtha
   for fire, so there is an attraction in such faith towards the divine
   power, according to what is said, "If ye have faith as a grain of
   mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder
   place, and it shall remove." [5293]   And Matthew and Mark, wishing to
   set forth the excellency of the divine power, that it has power even in
   unbelief, but not so great power as it has in the faith of those who
   are being benefited, seem to me to have said with accuracy, not that He
   did not "any" mighty works because of their unbelief, but that He did
   not "many" there. [5294]   And Mark also does not say, that He could
   not do any mighty work there, and stop at that point, but added, "Save
   that He laid His hands upon a few sick folk and healed them," [5295]
   the power in Him thus overcoming the unbelief.  Now it seems to me
   that, as in the case of material things, tillage is not sufficient in
   itself for the gathering in of the fruits, unless the air cooperates to
   this end, nay, rather, He who forms the air with whatever quality He
   wills and makes it whatever He wills; nor the air apart from tillage,
   but rather He who by His providence has enacted that the things which
   spring up from the earth could not spring up apart from tillage; for
   this He has done once for all in the law, "Let the earth put forth
   grass sowing seed after its kind and after its likeness;" [5296] so
   also neither do the operations of the powers, apart from the faith of
   those who are being healed, exhibit the absolute work of healing, nor
   faith, however great it may be, apart from the divine power.  And that
   which is written about wisdom, you may apply also to faith, and to the
   virtues specifically, so as to make a precept of this kind, "If any one
   be perfect in wisdom among the sons of men, and the power that comes
   from Thee be wanting, he will be reckoned as nothing;" [5297] or, "If
   any one be perfect in self-control, so far as is possible for the sons
   of men, and the control that is from Thee be wanting, he will be
   reckoned as nothing;" or, "If any one be perfect in righteousness, and
   in the rest of virtues, and the righteousness and the rest of the
   virtues that are from Thee be wanting to him, he will be reckoned as
   nothing."  Wherefore, "Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor
   the strong man in his strength," [5298] for that which is fit matter
   for glorying is not ours, but is the gift of God; the wisdom is from
   Him, and the strength is from Him; and so with the rest.

   20.  Different Conceptions of John the Baptist.

   "At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus
   and said unto his own servants, This is John the Baptist." [5299]   In
   Mark [5300] it is the same, and also in Luke. [5301]   The Jews had
   different opinions, some false, such as the Sadducees held about the
   resurrection of the dead, that they do not rise, and in regard to
   angels that they do not exist, but that those things which were written
   about them were only to be interpreted figuratively, but had no reality
   in point of fact; and some true opinions, such as were taught by the
   Pharisees about the resurrection of the dead that they rise.  We must
   therefore here inquire, whether the opinion regarding the soul,
   mistakenly held by Herod and some from among the people, was somewhat
   like this--that John, who a little before had been slain by him, had
   risen from the dead after he had been beheaded, and was the same person
   under a different name, and being now called Jesus was possessed of the
   same powers which formerly wrought in John.  For what credibility is
   there in the idea that One, who was so widely known to the whole
   people, and whose name was noised abroad in the whole of Judæa, whom
   they declared to be the son of the carpenter and Mary, and to have such
   and such for brothers and sisters, was thought to be not different from
   [5302] John whose father was Zacharias, and whose mother was Elisabeth,
   who were themselves not undistinguished among the people?  But it is
   probable that the fact of his being the Son of Zacharias was not
   unknown to the people, who thought with regard to John that he was
   truly a prophet, and were so numerous that the Pharisees, in order to
   avoid the appearance of saying that which was displeasing to the
   people, were afraid to answer the question, "Was his baptism from
   heaven or from men?" [5303]   And perhaps, also, to some of them had
   come the knowledge of the incident of the vision which was seen in the
   temple, when Gabriel appeared to Zacharias.  What credibility,
   forsooth, has the erroneous opinion, whether of Herod or of some of the
   people, that John and Jesus were not two persons, but that it was one
   and the same person John who rose from the dead after that he had been
   beheaded and was called Jesus?  Some one might say, however, that Herod
   and some of those of the people held the false dogma of the
   transmigration of souls into bodies, in consequence of which they
   thought that the former John had appeared again by a fresh birth, and
   had come from the dead into life as Jesus.  But the time between the
   birth of John and the birth of Jesus, which was not more than six
   months, does not permit this false opinion to be considered credible.
   And perhaps rather some such idea as this was in the mind of Herod,
   that the powers which wrought in John had passed over to Jesus, in
   consequence of which He was thought by the people to be John the
   Baptist.  And one might use the following line of argument.  Just as
   because of the spirit and the power of Elijah, and not because of his
   soul, it is said about John, "This is Elijah which is to come," [5304]
   the spirit in Elijah and the power in him having gone over to John--so
   Herod thought that the powers in John wrought in his case works of
   baptism and teaching,--for John did not one miracle, [5305] but in
   Jesus miraculous portents.  It may be said that something of this kind
   was the thought of those who said that Elijah had appeared in Jesus, or
   that one of the old prophets had risen. [5306]   But the opinion of
   those who said that Jesus was "a prophet even as one of the prophets,"
   [5307] has no bearing on the question.  False, then, is the saying
   concerning Jesus, whether that recorded to have been the view of Herod,
   or that spoken by others.  Only, the saying, "That John went before in
   the spirit and power of Elijah," [5308] which corresponds to the
   thoughts which they were now cherishing concerning John and Jesus,
   seems to me more credible.  But since we learned, in the first place,
   that when the Saviour after the temptation heard that John was given
   up, He retreated into Galilee, and in the second place, that when John
   was in prison and heard the things about Jesus he sent two of his
   disciples and said to Him, "Art thou He that cometh, or look we for
   another?" [5309] and in the third place, generally that Herod said
   about Jesus, "It is John the Baptist, he is risen from the dead,"
   [5310] but we have not previously learned from any quarter the manner
   in which the Baptist was killed, therefore Matthew has now recorded it,
   and Mark almost like unto him; but Luke passed over in silence the
   greater part of the narrative as it is found in them." [5311]

   21.  Herod and the Baptist.

   The narrative of Matthew is as follows,--"for Herod had laid hold on
   John and bound him in the prison." [5312]   In reference to these
   things, it seems to me, that as the law and the prophets were until
   John, [5313] after whom the grace of prophecy ceased from among the
   Jews; so the authority of those who had rule among the people, which
   included the power to kill those whom they thought worthy of death,
   existed until John; and when the last of the prophets was unlawfully
   killed by Herod, the king of the Jews was deprived of the power of
   putting to death; for, if Herod had not been deprived of it, Pilate
   would not have condemned Jesus to death; but for this Herod would have
   sufficed along with the council of the chief priests and elders of the
   people, met for the purpose.  And then I think was fulfilled that which
   was spoken as follows by Jacob to Judah:  "A ruler shall not depart
   from Judah, nor a leader from Israel, until that come which is laid up
   in store, and he is the expectation of the Gentiles." [5314]   And
   perhaps also the Jews were deprived of this power, the Providence of
   God arranging for the spread of the teaching of Christ among the
   people, so that even if this were hindered by the Jews, the opposition
   might not go so far as the slaying of believers, which seemed to be
   according to law.  "But Herod laid hold on John and bound him in prison
   and put him away," [5315] by this act signifying that, so far as it
   depended on his power and on the wickedness of the people, he bound and
   imprisoned the prophetic word, and prevented him from continuing to
   abide a herald the truth in freedom as formerly.  But this Herod did
   for the sake of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.  For John
   said unto him, "It is not lawful for thee to have her." [5316]   Now
   this Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituræa and of Trachonitis.
   Some, then, suppose that, when Philip died leaving a daughter,
   Herodias, Herod married his brother's wife, though the law permitted
   marriage only when there were no children.  But, as we find nowhere
   clear evidence that Philip was dead, we conclude that a yet greater
   transgression was done by Herod, namely, that he had induced his
   brother's wife to revolt from her husband while he was still living.

   22.  The Dancing of Herodias.  The Keeping of Oaths.

   Wherefore John, endued with prophetic boldness and not terrified at the
   royal dignity of Herod, nor through fear of death keeping silence in
   regard to so flagrant a sin, filled with a divine spirit said to Herod,
   "It is not lawful for thee to have her; for it is not lawful for thee
   to have the wife of thy brother."  For Herod having laid hold on John
   bound him and put him in prison, not daring to slay him outright and to
   take away the prophetic word from the people; but the wife of the king
   of Trachonitis--which is a kind of evil opinion and wicked
   teaching--gave birth to a daughter of the same name, whose movements,
   seemingly harmonious, pleasing Herod, who was fond of matters connected
   with birthdays, came the cause of there being no longer a prophetic
   head among the people.  And up to this point I think that the movements
   of the people of the Jews, which seem to be according to the law, were
   nothing else than the movements of the daughter of Herodias; but the
   dancing of Herodias was opposed to that holy dancing with which those
   who have not danced will be reproached when they hear the words, "We
   piped unto you, and ye did not dance." [5317]   And on birthdays, when
   the lawless word reigns over them, they dance so that their movements
   please that word.  Some one of those before us has observed what is
   written in Genesis about the birthday of Pharaoh, and has told that the
   worthless man who loves things connected with birth keeps birthday
   festivals; and we, taking this suggestion from him, find in no
   Scripture that a birthday was kept by a righteous man.  For Herod was
   more unjust than that famous Pharaoh; for by the latter on his birthday
   feast a chief baker is killed; [5318] but by the former, John, "than
   whom no one greater hath risen among those born of women," [5319] in
   regard to whom the Saviour says, "But for what purpose did ye go out?
   To see a prophet?  Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet."
   [5320]   But thanks be unto God, that, even if the grace of prophecy
   was taken from the people, a grace greater than all that was poured
   forth among the Gentiles by our Saviour Jesus Christ, who became "free
   among the dead;" [5321] for "though He were crucified through weakness,
   yet He liveth through the power of God." [5322]   Consider also the
   word in which pure and impure meats are inquired into; but prophecy is
   despised when it is brought forward in a charger instead of meat.  But
   the Jews have not the head of prophecy, inasmuch as they disown the
   crown of all prophecy, Christ Jesus; and the prophet is beheaded,
   because of an oath in a case where the duty was rather to break the
   oath than to keep the oath; for the charge of rashness in taking an
   oath and of breaking it because of the rashness is not the same in
   guilt as the death of a prophet.  And not on this account alone is he
   beheaded, but because "of those who sat at meat with him," who
   preferred that the prophet should be killed rather than live.  And they
   recline at the same table and also feast along with the evil word which
   reigns over the Jews, who make merry over his birth.  At times you may
   make a graceful application of the passage to those who swear rashly
   and wish to hold fast oaths which are taken with a view to unlawful
   deeds, by saying that not every keeping of oaths is seemly, just as the
   keeping of the oath of Herod was not.  And mark, further, that not
   openly but secretly and in prison does Herod put John to death.  For
   even the present word of the Jews does not openly deny the prophecies,
   but virtually and in secret denies them, and is convicted of
   disbelieving them.  For as "if they believed Moses they would have
   believed Jesus," [5323] so if they had believed the prophets they would
   have received Him who had been the subject of prophecy.  But
   disbelieving Him they also disbelieve them, and cut off and confine in
   prison the prophetic word, and hold it dead and divided, and in no way
   wholesome, since they do not understand it.  But we have the whole
   Jesus, the prophecy concerning Him being fulfilled which said, "A bone
   shall not be broken." [5324]

   23.  The Withdrawal of Jesus.

   And the disciples of John having come bury his remains, and "they went
   and told Jesus." [5325]   And He withdrew to a desert place,--that is,
   the Gentiles--and after the killing of the prophet multitudes followed
   Him from the cities everywhere; seeing which to be great He had
   compassion on them, and healed their sick; and afterwards with the
   loaves which were blessed and multiplied from a few loaves He feeds
   those who followed Him.  "Now when Jesus heard it He withdrew thence in
   a boat to a desert place apart." [5326]   The letter teaches us to
   withdraw as far as it is in our power from those who persecute us, and
   from expected conspiracies through words; for this would be to act
   according to prudence; and, when one can keep outside of critical
   positions, to go to meet them is rash and headstrong.  For who would
   still hesitate about avoiding such things, when not only did Jesus
   retreat in view of what happened to John, but also taught and said, "If
   they persecute you in this city, flee ye into the other"? [5327]   When
   a temptation comes which is not in our power to avoid, we must endure
   it with exceeding nobleness and courage; but, when it is in our power
   to avoid it, not to do so is rash.  But since after the letter we must
   also investigate the place according to the mystical meaning, we must
   say that, when prophecy was plotted against among the Jews and
   destroyed, because of their giving honour to matters of birthdays, and
   in respect of their reception of vain movements which, though conceived
   by the ruler of the wicked and those who feast along with him to be
   regular and pleasing to them, were irregular and out of tune, if truth
   be umpire, then Jesus withdraws from the place in which prophecy was
   attacked and condemned; and He withdraws to the place which had been
   barren of God among the Gentiles, in order that the Word of God, when
   the kingdom was taken from the Jews and "given to a nation bringing
   forth the fruits thereof," [5328] might be among the Gentiles; and, on
   account of it, "the children of the desolate one," who had not been
   instructed either in the law or the prophets, "might be more than of
   her who has the husband," [5329] that is, the law.  When, then, the
   word was of old among the Jews, it was not so among them as it is among
   the Gentiles; wherefore it is said that, "in a boat,"--that is, in the
   body--He went to the desert place apart, when He heard about the
   killing of the prophet.  And, having come into the desert place apart,
   He was in it, because that the Word dwelt apart, and His teaching was
   contrary to the customs and usages which obtained among the Gentiles.
   And the crowds among the Gentiles, when they heard that Jesus had come
   to stay in their desert, and that He was apart, as we have already
   reported, followed Him from their own cities, because each had left the
   superstitious customs of his fathers and come to the law of Christ.
   And by land they followed Him, and not in a boat, inasmuch as not with
   the body but with the soul only, and with the resolution to which they
   had been persuaded by the Word, they followed the Image of God.  And to
   them Jesus comes out, as they were not able to go to Him, in order
   that, having gone to those who were without, He might lead within those
   who were without.  And great is the crowd without to whom the Word of
   God goes out, and, having poured out upon it the light of His
   "visitation," beholds it; and, seeing that they were rather deserving
   of being pitied, because they were in such circumstances, as a lover of
   men He who was impassible suffered the emotion of pity, and not only
   had pity but healed their sick, who had sicknesses diverse and of every
   kind arising from their wickedness.

   24.  The Diverse Forms of Spiritual Sickness.

   And, if you wish to see of what nature are the sicknesses of the soul,
   contemplate with me the lovers of money, and the lovers of ambition,
   and the lovers of boys, and if any be fond of women; for these also
   beholding among the crowds and taking compassion upon them, He healed.
   For not every sin is to be considered a sickness, but that which has
   settled down in the whole soul.  For so you may see the lovers of money
   wholly intent on money and upon preserving and gathering it, the lovers
   of ambition wholly intent on a little glory, for they gape for praise
   from the masses and the vulgar; and analogously you will understand in
   the case of the rest which we have named, and if there be any other
   like to them.  Since, then, when expounding the words, "He healed their
   sick," [5330] we said that not every sin is a sickness, it is fitting
   to discuss from the Scripture the difference of these.  The Apostle
   indeed says, writing to the Corinthians who had diverse sicknesses,
   "For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few
   sleep." [5331]   Hear Him in these words, knitting a band and making it
   plaited of different sins, according as some are weak, and others
   sickly more than weak, and others, in comparison with both, are
   asleep.  For some, because of impotence of soul, having a tendency to
   slip into any sin whatever, although they may not be wholly in the
   grasp of any form of sin, as the sickly are, are only weak; but others
   who, instead of loving God "with all their soul and all their heart and
   all their mind," love money, or a little glory, or wife, or children,
   are suffering from something worse than weakness, and are sickly.  And
   those who sleep are those who, when they ought to be taking heed and
   watching with the soul, are not doing this, but by reason of great want
   of attention are nodding in resolution and are drowsy in their
   reflections, such as "in their dreamings defile the flesh, and set at
   naught that which is highest in authority, and rail at dignities."
   [5332]   And these, because they are asleep, live in an atmosphere of
   vain and dream-like fancies concerning realities, not admitting the
   things which are actually true, but deceived by what appears in their
   vain imaginations, in regard to whom it is said in Isaiah, "Like as
   when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but when he has risen up
   is still thirsty, and his soul has cherished a vain hope, so shall be
   the wealth of all the nations as many as have warred in Jerusalem."
   [5333]   If, then, we have seemed to make a digression in recounting
   the difference between the weak and the sickly and those that sleep,
   because of that which the Apostle said in the letter to the Corinthians
   which we have expounded, we have made the digression in our desire to
   represent what is meant to be understood by the saying, "And He healed
   their sick." [5334]

   25.  Healing Precedes Participation in the Loaves of Jesus.

   After this the word says, "And when even was come, His disciples came
   to Him, saying, The place is desert and the time is already past; send,
   therefore, the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages and
   buy themselves food." [5335]   And first observe that when about to
   give to the disciples the loaves of blessing, that they might set them
   before the multitudes, He healed the sick, in order that, having been
   restored to health, they might participate in the loaves of blessing;
   for while they are yet sickly, they are not able to receive the loaves
   of the blessing of Jesus.  But if any one, when he ought to listen to
   the precept, "But let each prove himself, and so let him eat of the
   bread," etc., [5336] does not obey these words, but in haphazard
   fashion participates in the bread of the Lord and His cup, he becomes
   weak or sickly, or even--if I may use the expression--on account of
   being stupefied by the power of the bread, asleep.

   Book XI.

   1.  Introduction to the Feeding of the Five Thousand.

   "And when even was come His disciples came to Him," [5337] that is, at
   the consummation of the age in regard to which we may fitly say what is
   found in the Epistle of John, "It is the last hour." [5338]   They, not
   yet understanding what the Word was about to do, say to Him, "The place
   is desert," [5339] seeing the desert condition of the masses in respect
   of God and the Law and the Word; but they say to Him, "The time is
   past," [5340] as if the fitting season of the law and prophets had
   passed.  Perhaps they spoke this saying, in reference to the word of
   Jesus, that because of the beheading of John both the law and the
   prophets who were until John had ceased. [5341]   "The time is past,"
   therefore they say, and no food is at hand, because the season of it is
   no longer present, that those who have followed Thee in the desert may
   serve the law and the prophets.  And, further, the disciples say, "Send
   them away," [5342] that each one may buy food, if he cannot from the
   cities, at least from the villages,--places more ignoble.  Such things
   the disciples said, because, after the letter of the law had been
   abrogated and prophecies had ceased, they despaired of unexpected and
   new food being found for the multitudes.  But see what Jesus answers to
   the disciples though He does not cry out and plainly say it:  "You
   suppose that, if the great multitude go away from Me in need of food,
   they will find it in villages rather than with Me, and among bodies of
   men, not of citizens but of villagers, rather than by abiding with Me.
   But I declare unto you, that in regard to that of which you suppose
   they are in need they are not in need, for they have no need to go
   away; but in regard to that of which you think they have no need--that
   is, of Me--as if I could not feed them, of this contrary to your
   expectation they have need.  Since, then, I have trained you, and made
   you fit to give rational food to them who are in need of it, give ye to
   the crowds who have followed Me to eat; for ye have the power, which ye
   have received from Me, of giving the multitudes to eat; and if ye had
   attended to this, ye would have understood that I am far more able to
   feed them, and ye would not have said, Send the multitudes away that
   they may go and buy food for themselves.'" [5343]

   2.  Exposition of the Details of the Miracle.

   Jesus, then, because of the power which He gave to the disciples, even
   the power of nourishing others, said, Give ye them to eat. [5344]   But
   (not denying that they can give loaves, but thinking that there were
   much too few and not sufficient to feed those who followed Jesus, and
   not considering that when Jesus takes each loaf--the Word--He extends
   it as far as He wills, and makes it suffice for all whomsoever He
   desires to nourish), the disciples say, We have here but five loaves
   and two fishes. [5345]   Perhaps by the five loaves they meant to make
   a veiled reference to the sensible words of the Scriptures,
   corresponding in number on this account to the five senses, but by the
   two fishes either to the word expressed [5346] and the word conceived,
   [5347] which are a relish, so to speak, to the sensible things
   contained in the Scriptures; or, perhaps, to the word which had come to
   them about the Father and the Son.  Wherefore also after His
   resurrection He ate of a broiled fish, [5348] having taken a part from
   the disciples, and having received that theology about the Father which
   they were in part able to declare to Him.  Such is the contribution we
   have been able to give to the exposition of the word about the five
   loaves and the two fishes; and probably those, who are better able than
   we to gather together the five loaves and the two fishes among
   themselves, would be able to give a fuller and better interpretation of
   their meaning.  It must be observed, however, that while in Matthew,
   Mark, and Luke, [5349] the disciples say that they have the five loaves
   and the two fishes, without indicating whether they were wheaten or of
   barley, John alone says, that the loaves were barley loaves. [5350]
   Wherefore, perhaps, in the Gospel of John the disciples do not
   acknowledge that the loaves are with them, but say in John, "There is a
   lad here who has five barley loaves and two fishes." [5351]   And so
   long as these five loaves and two fishes were not carried by the
   disciples of Jesus, they did not increase or multiply, nor were they
   able to nourish more; but, when the Saviour took them, and in the first
   placed looked up to heaven, with the rays of His eyes, as it were,
   drawing down from it power which was to be mingled with the loaves and
   the fishes which were about to feed the five thousand; and after this
   blessed the five loaves and the two fishes, increasing and multiplying
   them by the word and the blessing; and in the third place dividing and
   breaking He gave to the disciples that they might set them before the
   multitudes, then the loaves and the fishes were sufficient, so that all
   ate and were satisfied, and some portions of the loaves which had been
   blessed they were unable to eat.  For so much remained over to the
   multitudes, which was not according to the capacity of the multitudes
   but of the disciples who were able to take up that which remained over
   of the broken pieces, and to place it in baskets filled with that which
   remained over, which were in number so many as the tribes of Israel.
   Concerning Joseph, then, it is written in the Psalms, "His hands served
   in the basket," [5352] but about the disciples of Jesus that they took
   up that which remained over of the broken pieces twelve baskets, twelve
   baskets, I take it, not half-full but filled.  And there are, I think,
   up to the present time, and will be until the consummation of the age
   with the disciples of Jesus, who are superior to the multitudes, the
   twelve baskets, filled with the broken pieces of living bread which the
   multitudes cannot eat.  Now those who ate of the five loaves which
   existed before the twelve baskets that remained over, were kindred in
   nature to the number five; for those who ate had reached the stage of
   sensible things, since also they were nourished by Him who looked up to
   heaven and blessed and brake them, and were not boys nor women, but
   men.  For there are, I think, even in sensible foods differences, so
   that some of them belong to those who "have put away childish things,"
   [5353] and some to those who are still babes and carnal in Christ.

   3.  The Exposition of Details Continued.  The Sitting Down on the
   Grass.  The Division into Companies.

   We have spoken these things because of the words, "They that did eat
   were five thousand men, beside children and women," [5354] which is an
   ambiguous expression; for either those who ate were five thousand men,
   and among those who ate there was no child or woman; or the men only
   were five thousand, the children and the women not being reckoned.
   Some, then, as we have said by anticipation, have so understood the
   passage that neither children nor women were present, when the increase
   and multiplication of the five loaves and the two fishes took place.
   But some one might say that, while many ate and according to their
   desert and capacity participated in the loaves of blessing, some worthy
   to be numbered, corresponding to the men of twenty years old who are
   numbered in the Book of Numbers, [5355] were Israelitish men, but
   others who were not worthy of such account and numbering were children
   and women.  Moreover, interpret with me allegorically the children in
   accordance with the passage, "I could not speak unto you as unto
   spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ;" [5356] and the
   women in accordance with the saying, "I wish to present you all as a
   pure virgin to Christ;" [5357] and the men according to the saying,
   "When I am become a man I have put away childish things." [5358]   Let
   us not pass by without exposition the words, "He commanded the
   multitudes to sit down on the grass, and He look the five loaves and
   the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, He blessed, and brake, and
   gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
   And they did all eat." [5359]   For what is meant by the words, "And He
   commanded all the multitudes to sit down on the grass?"  And what are
   we to understand in the passage worthy of the command of Jesus?  Now, I
   think that He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass because
   of what is said in Isaiah, "All flesh is grass;" [5360] that is to say,
   He commanded them to put the flesh under, and to keep in subjection
   "the mind of the flesh," [5361] that so any one might be able to
   partake of the loaves which Jesus blesses.  Then since there are
   different orders of those who need the food which Jesus supplies and
   all are not nourished by equal words, on this account I think that Mark
   has written, "And He commanded them that they should all sit down by
   companies upon the green grass; and they sat down in ranks by hundreds
   and by fifties;" [5362] but Luke, "And He said unto His disciples, Make
   them sit down in companies about fifty each." [5363]   For it was
   necessary that those who were to find rest in the food of Jesus should
   either be in the order of the hundred--the sacred number--which is
   consecrated to God, because of the unit, (in it) or in the order of the
   fifty--the number which embraces the remission of sins, in accordance
   with the mystery of the Jubilee which took place every fifty years, and
   of the feast at Pentecost.  And I think that the twelve baskets were in
   the possession of the disciples to whom it was said "Ye shall sit upon
   twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel." [5364]   And as
   the throne of him who judges the tribe of Reuben might be said to be a
   mystery, and the throne of him who judges the tribe of Simeon, and
   another of him who judges the tribe of Judah, and so on with the
   others; so there might be a basket of the food of Reuben, and another
   of Simeon, and another of Levi.  But it is not in accordance with our
   present discourse now to digress so far from the subject in hand as to
   collect what is said about the twelve tribes, and separately what is
   said about each of them, and to say what each tribe of Israel may
   signify.

   4.  The Multitudes and the Disciples Contrasted.

   "And straightway He constrained the disciples to enter into the boat,
   and to go before Him unto the other side, till He should send the
   multitudes away." [5365]   It should be observed how often in the same
   passages is mentioned the word, "the multitudes," and another word,
   "the disciples," so that by observing and bringing together the
   passages about this matter it may be seen that the aim of the
   Evangelists was to represent by means of the Gospel history the
   differences of those who come to Jesus; of whom some are the multitudes
   and are not called disciples, and others are the disciples who are
   better than the multitudes.  It is sufficient, however, for the
   present, for us to set forth a few sayings, so that any one who is
   moved by them may do the like with the whole of the Gospels.  It is
   written then--as if the multitudes were below, but the disciples were
   able to come to Jesus when He went up into the mountain, where the
   multitudes were not able to be--as follows:  "And seeing the multitudes
   He went up into the mountain, and when He had sat down His disciples
   came unto Him; and He opened His mouth and taught them saying, Blessed
   are the poor in spirit," etc. [5366]   And again in another place, as
   the multitudes stood in need of healing, it is said, "Many multitudes
   followed Him and He healed them." [5367]   We do not find any healing
   recorded of the disciples; since if any one is already a disciple of
   Jesus he is whole, and being well he needs Jesus not as a physician but
   in respect of His other powers.  Again in another place, when He was
   speaking to the multitudes, His mother and His brethren stood without,
   seeking to speak to Him; this was made known to Him by some one to whom
   He answered, stretching forth His hand not towards the multitudes but
   towards the disciples, and said, "Behold My mother and My brethren,"
   [5368] and bearing testimony to the disciples as doing the will of the
   Father which is in heaven, He added, "He is My brother and sister and
   mother." [5369]   And again in another place it is written, "All the
   multitude stood on the beach and He spake to them many things in
   parables." [5370]   Then after the parable of the sowing, it was no
   longer the multitudes but the disciples who came and said to Him, not
   "Why speakest thou to us in parables," but, "Why speakest thou to them
   in parables." [5371]   Then also He answered and said, not to the
   multitudes but to the disciples, "To you it is given to know the
   mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to the rest in parables."
   [5372] Accordingly, of those who come to the name of Jesus some, who
   know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, would be called disciples;
   but those to whom such a privilege is not given would be called
   multitudes, who would be spoken of as inferior to the disciples.  For
   observe carefully that He said to the disciples, "To you it is given to
   know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven," but about the multitudes,
   "To them it is not given." [5373]   And in another place He dismisses
   the multitudes indeed, and goes into the house, [5374] but He does not
   dismiss the disciples; and there came to Him into His house, not the
   multitudes but His disciples, saying, "Declare to us the parable of the
   tares of the field." [5375]   Moreover, also, in another place when
   Jesus heard the things concerning John and withdrew in a boat to a
   desert place apart, the multitudes followed Him; when He came forth and
   saw a great multitude He had compassion on them and healed their
   sick--the sick of the multitudes, not of the disciples. [5376]   "And
   when even was come there came to Him," not the multitudes, but the
   disciples, as being different from the multitudes, saying, "Send the
   multitudes away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves
   food." [5377]   And, further, when Jesus took the five loaves and the
   two fishes, and looking up to heaven He blessed and brake the loaves,
   He gave not to the multitudes but to the disciples, [5378] that the
   disciples might give to the multitudes who were not able to take from
   Him, but received with difficulty at the hands of the disciples the
   loaves of the blessing of Jesus, and did not eat even all these; for
   the multitudes were filled and left that which remained over in twelve
   baskets which were full.

   5.  The Disciples in Conflict.  Jesus Walks Upon the Waters.

   The reason why we have taken up this subject is the passage under
   discussion which tells that Jesus separated the disciples from the
   multitudes, and constrained them to enter into the boat and to go
   before Him unto the other side until He Himself should send the
   multitudes away; [5379] for the multitudes were not able to go away to
   the other side, as they were not in the mystic sense Hebrews, which are
   by interpretation, "dwelling on the other side."  But this was the work
   of the disciples of Jesus--I mean to go away to the other side, and to
   pass beyond things seen and material, as temporal, and to go on to
   things unseen and eternal.  To be dismissed by Jesus was a sufficient
   act of kindness bestowed on the multitudes by Jesus; for just because
   they were multitudes they were not able to go away to the other side;
   and this kind of dismissal no one has the power to effect save Jesus
   only, and it is not possible for any one to be dismissed unless he has
   first eaten of the loaves which Jesus blesses.  Nor is it possible for
   any one to eat of the loaves of blessing of Jesus unless he has done as
   Jesus commanded and sat down upon the grass as we have told.  Nor again
   was it possible for the multitudes to do this unless they had followed
   Jesus from their own cities, when He withdrew into a desert place
   apart.  And at first, when He was asked by the disciples to send away
   the multitudes, He did not send them away until He had fed them with
   the loaves of blessing; but now He sends them away, having first
   constrained the disciples to enter into the boat; and He sends them
   away, while they were somewhere below,--for the desert was below,--but
   He Himself went up into the mountain to pray. [5380]   And you must
   observe this, that immediately after the five thousand had been fed,
   Jesus constrained the disciples to embark into the boat, and to go
   before Him unto the other side.  Only, the disciples were not able to
   go before Jesus to the other side; but, when they had got as far as the
   middle of the sea, and the boat was distressed "because the wind was
   contrary to them," [5381] they were afraid when about the fourth watch
   of the night Jesus came to them.  And if Jesus had not gone up into the
   boat neither would the wind which was contrary to the disciples who
   were sailing have ceased, nor would those who were sailing have gone
   across and come to the other side.  And, perhaps, wishing to teach them
   by experience that it was not possible apart from Him to go to the
   other side He constrained them to enter into the boat and go before Him
   to the other side; but, when they were not able to advance farther than
   the middle of the sea, He appeared to them, and did what is written,
   [5382] and showed that he who arrives at the other side reaches it
   because Jesus sails along with him.  But what is the boat into which
   Jesus constrained the disciples to enter?  Is it perhaps the conflict
   of temptations and difficulties into which any one is constrained by
   the Word, and goes unwillingly, as it were, when the Saviour wishes to
   train by exercise the disciples in this boat which is distressed by the
   waves and the contrary wind?  But since Mark has made a slight change
   in the reading, and for "Straightway He constrained the disciples to
   enter into the boat and to go before Him to the other side," has
   written, "And straightway He constrained His disciples to enter into
   the boat and to go before Him unto the other side unto Bethsaida,"
   [5383] we must attend to the word, "He constrained," when first we have
   seen to the slight variation in Mark who indicates something more
   definite by the addition of the pronoun; for the same thing is not
   expressed by the words, straightway "He constrained the disciples."
   Something more than "the" disciples simply is written in Mark, namely,
   "His" disciples.  Perhaps, therefore, to attend to the expression, the
   disciples who found it hard to tear themselves away from Jesus, and
   could not be separated from Him by any ordinary cause, wished to be
   present with Him; but He having judged that they should make trial of
   the waves and of the contrary wind, which would not have been contrary
   if they had been with Jesus, put on them the necessity of being
   separated from Him and entering into the boat.  The Saviour then
   compels the disciples to enter into the boat of temptations and to go
   before Him to the other side, and through victory over them to go
   beyond critical difficulties; but when they had come into the midst of
   the sea, and of the waves in the temptations, and of the contrary winds
   which prevented them from going away to the other side, they were not
   able, struggling as they were without Jesus, to overcome the waves and
   the contrary wind and reach the other side.  Wherefore the Word, taking
   compassion upon them who had done all that was in their power to reach
   the other side, came to them walking upon the sea, which for Him had no
   waves or wind that was able to oppose if He so willed; for it is not
   written, "He came to them walking upon the waves," but, "upon the
   waters;" [5384] Just as Peter, who at first when Jesus said to him,
   "Come," went down from the boat and walked not upon "the waves," but
   upon "the waters" [5385] to come to Jesus; but when he doubted he saw
   that the wind was strong, which was not strong to him who laid aside
   his little faith and his doubting.  But, when Jesus went up with Peter
   into the boat, the wind ceased, as it had no power to energise against
   the boat when Jesus had gone up into it.

   6.  Interpretation of the Details in the Narrative.  Application
   Thereof to All Disciples.

   And then the disciples "having crossed over came to the land
   Gennesaret," [5386] of which word, if we knew the interpretation, we
   might gain some assistance in the exposition of the present passage.
   And observe, since God is faithful, and will not suffer the multitudes
   to be tempted above that they are able, [5387] in what way the Son of
   God constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, as being stronger
   and able to get as far as the middle of the sea, and to endure the
   trials by the waves, until they became worthy of divine assistance, and
   saw Jesus and heard Him when He had gone up, and to cross over and come
   to the land Gennesaret; but as for the multitudes who, because they
   were weaker, did not make trial of the boat and the waves and the
   contrary wind, them He sent away, and went up into the mountain apart
   to pray. [5388]   To pray for whom?  Was it perhaps to pray for the
   multitudes that, when they were dismissed after the loaves of blessing,
   they might do nothing opposed to their dismissal by Jesus?  And for the
   disciples that, when they were constrained by Him to enter into the
   boat and to go before Him unto the other side, they might suffer
   nothing in the sea nor from the contrary wind?  And I would say with
   confidence, that, because of the prayer of Jesus to the Father for the
   disciples, they suffered nothing when sea and wave and contrary wind
   were striving against them.  The simpler disciple, then, may be
   satisfied with the bare narrative; but let us remember, if ever we fall
   into distressful temptations, that Jesus has constrained us to enter
   into their boat, wishing us to go before Him unto the other side; for
   it is not possible for us to reach the other side, unless we have
   endured the temptations of waves and contrary wind.  Then when we see
   many difficulties besetting us, and with moderate struggle we have swum
   through them to some extent, let us consider that our boat is in the
   midst of the sea, distressed at that time by the waves which wish us to
   make shipwreck concerning faith or some one of the virtues; but when we
   see the spirit of the evil one striving against us, let us conceive
   that then the wind is contrary to us.  When then in such suffering we
   have spent three watches of the night--that is, of the darkness which
   is in the temptations--striving nobly with all our might and watching
   ourselves so as not to make shipwreck concerning the faith or some one
   of the virtues,--the first watch against the father of darkness and
   wickedness, the second watch against his son "who opposeth and exalteth
   himself against all that is called God or thing that is worshipped,"
   [5389] and the third watch against the spirit [5390] that is opposed to
   the Holy Spirit, then we believe that when the fourth watch impendeth,
   when "the night is far spent, and the day is at hand," [5391] the Son
   of God will come to us, that He may prepare the sea for us, walking
   upon it.  And when we see the Word appearing unto us we shall indeed be
   troubled before we clearly understand that it is the Saviour who has
   come to us, supposing that we are still beholding an apparition, and
   for fear shall cry out; but He Himself straightway will speak to us
   saying, "Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid." [5392]   And if,
   warmly moved by His "Be of good cheer," any Peter be found among us,
   who is on his way to perfection but has not yet become perfect, having
   gone down from the boat, as if coming out of that temptation in which
   he was distressed, he will indeed walk at first, wishing to come to
   Jesus upon the waters; but being as yet of little faith, and as yet
   doubting, will see that the wind is strong and will be afraid and begin
   to sink; but he will not sink because he will call upon Jesus with loud
   voice, and will say to Him, "Lord, save me;" [5393] then immediately
   while such a Peter is yet speaking and saying, "Lord save me," the Word
   will stretch forth His hand, holding out assistance to such an one, and
   will take hold of him when he is beginning to sink, and will reproach
   him for his little faith and doubting. [5394]   Only, observe that He
   did not say, "O thou without faith," but, "O thou of little faith," and
   that it was said, "Wherefore didst thou doubt," as he had still a
   measure of faith, but also had a tendency towards that which was
   opposed to faith.

   7.  The Healing of the Sick on the Other Side.  The Method of Healing.

   But after this both Jesus and Peter will go up into the boat, and the
   wind will cease; and those in the boat, perceiving the great dangers
   from which they have been saved, will worship Him, saying, not simply,
   "Thou art the Son of God," as also the two demoniacs said, but, "Of a
   truth, Thou art the Son of God." [5395]   This the disciples in the
   boat say, for I do not think that others than the disciples said so.
   And when we have undergone all these experiences, having crossed over,
   we shall come to the land where Jesus commanded us to go before Him.
   And perhaps, also, some secret and occult mystery with reference to
   some who were saved by Jesus is indicated by the words, "And when the
   men of that place knew Him,"--plainly of the place on the other
   side,--"they sent into all that region round about,"--round about the
   other side, not on the other side itself, but round about it,--"and
   they brought unto Him all that were sick." [5396]   And here observe
   that they brought unto Him not only many that were sick, but all in
   that region round about; and the sick who were brought to Him besought
   Him that they might touch if it were only the border of His garment,
   [5397] beseeching this grace from Him, since they were not like "the
   woman who had an issue of blood twelve years, and who came behind Him
   and touched the border of His garment, saying within herself, If I do
   but touch His garment, I shall be made whole." [5398]   For observe in
   what is said about the border of His garment, on account of what the
   flowing of her blood ceased at once.  But those from the country round
   the land of Gennesaret, to which Jesus and His disciples crossed over
   and came, did not come of themselves to Jesus, but were brought by
   those who had sent the tidings, inasmuch as they were not able because
   of their extreme weakness to come of themselves.  Nor did they merely
   touch the garment, like the woman who had an issue of blood, but they
   touched after that they had besought Him.  Only, of these, "as many as
   touched were made whole." [5399]   And whether there be any difference
   between the "They were made whole," [5400] which is said in their case,
   and the "being saved," [5401] --for it was said to the woman with the
   issue of blood, "Thy faith hath saved thee," [5402] you may yourself
   consider.

   8.  Concerning the Pharisees and Scribes Who Came and Inquired, Why Do
   Thy Disciples Transgress the Tradition of the Elders?

   "Then there came to Him from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,
   Why do Thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?  For they
   wash not their hands when they eat bread." [5403]   He who observes at
   what time the Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to Jesus,
   saying, "Why do Thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders,"
   etc., will perceive that Matthew of necessity wrote not simply that
   Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to the Saviour to inquire of
   Him the matters before us, but put it thus, "Then come to Him from
   Jerusalem."  What time, therefore, are we to understand by "then"?  At
   the time when Jesus and His disciples crossed over and came in the boat
   to the land of Gennesaret, when the wind ceased from the time that
   Jesus entered into the boat, and when "the men of that place knowing
   Him sent into all that region round about, and brought unto Him all
   that were sick, and besought Him that they might touch if it were only
   the border of His garment, and as many as touched were made whole."
   [5404]   At that time came to Him from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes,
   not struck with admiration at the power which was in Jesus, which
   healed those who only touched even the border of His garment, but in a
   censorious spirit, accusing the disciples before their Teacher, not
   concerning the transgression of a commandment of God, but of a single
   tradition of the Jewish elders.  And it is probable that this very
   charge of these censorious persons is a proof of the piety of the
   disciples of Jesus, who gave to the Pharisees and scribes no
   opportunity of censure with reference to the transgression of the
   commandments of God, as they would not have brought the charge of
   transgression against the disciples, as transgressing the commandment
   of the elders, if they had had it in their power to censure those whom
   they accused, and to show that they were transgressing a commandment of
   God.  But do not suppose that these things go to establish the
   necessity of keeping the law of Moses according to the letter, because
   the disciples of Jesus up to that time kept it; for not before He
   suffered did He "redeem us from the curse of the law," [5405] who in
   suffering for men "became a curse for us."  But just as fittingly Paul
   became a Jew to the Jews that he might gain Jews, [5406] what strange
   thing is it that the Apostles, whose way of life was passed among the
   Jews, even though they understood the spiritual things in the law,
   should have used a spirit of accommodation, as Paul also did when he
   circumcised Timothy, [5407] and offered sacrifice in accordance with a
   certain legal vow, as is written in the Acts of the Apostles? [5408]
   Only, again, they appear fond of bringing accusations, as they have no
   charge to bring against the disciples of Jesus with reference to a
   commandment of God, but only with reference to one tradition of the
   elders.  And especially does this love of accusation become manifest in
   this, that they bring the charge in presence of those very persons who
   had been healed from their sickness; in appearance against the
   disciples, but in reality purposing to slander their Teacher, as it was
   a tradition of the elders that the washing of hands was a thing
   essential to piety.  For they thought that the hands of those who did
   not wash before eating bread were defiled and unclean, but that the
   hands of those who had washed them with water became pure and holy, not
   in a figurative sense, in due relation to the law of Moses according to
   the letter.  But let us, not according to the tradition of the elders
   among the Jews, but according to sound reason, endeavour to purify our
   own actions and so to wash the hands of our souls, when we are about to
   eat the three loaves which we ask from Jesus, who wishes to be our
   friend; [5409] for with hands that are defiled and unwashed and impure,
   we ought not to partake of the loaves.

   9.  Explanation of "Corban."

   Jesus, however, does not accuse them with reference to a tradition of
   the Jewish elders, but with regard to two most imperative commandments
   of God, the one of which was the fifth in the decalogue, being as
   follows:  "Honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with
   thee, and that thy days may be long on the land which the Lord thy God
   giveth thee;" [5410] and the other was written thus in Leviticus, "If a
   man speak evil of his father or his mother, let him die the death; he
   has spoken evil of his father or mother, he shall be guilty." [5411]
   But when we wish to examine the very letter of the words as given by
   Matthew, "He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the
   death," [5412] consider whether it was taken from the place where it
   was written, "Whoso striketh his father or mother, let him die the
   death; and he that speaketh evil of father or mother let him die the
   death." [5413]   For such are the exact words taken from the Law with
   regard to the two commandments; but Matthew has quoted them in part and
   in an abridged form, and not in the very words.  But what the nature of
   the charge is which the Saviour brings against the Pharisees and
   scribes from Jerusalem, when He says that they transgress the
   commandment of God because of their tradition we must consider.  And
   God said, "Honour thy father and thy mother," [5414] teaching that the
   child should pay the honour which is due to his parents.  Of this
   honour to parents one part was to share with them the necessaries of
   life, such as food and clothing, and if there was any other thing in
   which it was possible for them to show favour towards their own
   parents.  But the Pharisees and scribes promulgated in opposition to
   the law a tradition which is found rather obscurely in the Gospel, and
   which we ourselves would not have thought of, unless one of the Hebrews
   had given to us the following facts relating to the passage.
   Sometimes, he says, when money-lenders fell in with stubborn debtors
   who were able but not willing to pay their debts, they consecrated what
   was due to the account of the poor, for whom money was cast into the
   treasury by each of those who wished to give a portion of their goods
   to the poor according to their ability.  They, therefore, said
   sometimes to their debtors in their own tongue, "That which you owe to
   me is Corban,"--that is, a gift--"for I have consecrated it to the
   poor, to the account of piety towards God."  Then the debtor, as no
   longer in debt to men but to God and to piety towards God, was shut up,
   as it were, even though unwilling, to payment of the debt, no longer to
   the money-lender, but now to God for the account of the poor, in name
   of the money-lender.  What then the money-lender did to the debtor,
   that sometimes some sons did to their parents and said to them, "That
   wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me, father or mother,
   know that you will receive this from Corban," [5415] from the account
   of the poor who are consecrated to God.  Then the parents, hearing that
   that which should have been given to them was Corban,--consecrated to
   God,--no longer wished to take it from their sons, even though they
   were in extreme need of the necessaries of life.  The elders, then,
   declared to the people a tradition of this kind, "Whosoever said to his
   father or mother, that which should be given to any of them is Corban
   and a gift, that man was no longer a debtor to his father or mother in
   respect of giving to them the necessaries of life."  The Saviour
   censures this tradition, as not being sound but opposed to the
   commandment of God.  For if God says, "Honour thy father and thy
   mother," but the tradition said, he is not bound to honour his father
   or mother by a gift, who has consecrated to God, as Corban, that which
   would have been given to his parents, manifestly the commandment of God
   concerning the honour due to parents was made void by the tradition of
   the Pharisees and scribes which said, that he was no longer bound to
   honour his father or mother, who had, once for all, consecrated to God
   that which the parents would have received.  And the Pharisees, as
   lovers of money, in order that under pretext of the poor they might
   receive even that which would have been given to the parents of any
   one, gave such teaching.  And the Gospel testifies to their love of
   money, saying, "But the Pharisees who were lovers of money heard these
   things and they scoffed at Him." [5416]   If, then, any one of those
   who are called elders among us, or of those who are in any way rulers
   of the people, profess to give to the poor under the name of the
   commonweal, rather than to be of those who give to their kindred if
   they should chance to be in need of the necessaries of life, and those
   who give cannot do both, this man might with justice be called a
   brother of those Pharisees who made void the word of God through their
   own tradition, and were accused by the Saviour as hypocrites.  And as a
   very powerful deterrent to any one from being anxious to take from the
   account of the poor, and from thinking that "the piety of others is a
   way of gain," [5417] we have not only these things, but also that which
   is recorded about the traitor Judas, who in appearance championed the
   cause of the poor, and said with indignation, "This ointment might have
   been sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor," [5418] but in
   reality "was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put
   therein." [5419]   If, then, any one in our time who has the bag of the
   Church speaks likes Judas on behalf of the poor, but takes away what is
   put therein, let there be assigned to him the portion along with Judas
   who did these things; on account of which things eating like a gangrene
   into his soul, the devil cast it into his heart to betray the Saviour;
   and, when he had received the "fiery dart," [5420] with reference to
   this end, the devil afterwards himself entered into his soul and took
   full possession of him.  And perhaps, when the Apostle says, "The love
   of money is a root of all evils," [5421] he says it because of Judas'
   love of money, which was a root of all the evils that were committed
   against Jesus.

   10.  The Traditions of the Elders in Collision with Divine Law.

   But let us return to the subject before us, in which the Saviour
   abridged and expounded two commandments from the law, the one from the
   decalogue from Exodus, and the other from Leviticus, or the other from
   some one of the books of the Pentateuch.  Then since we have explained
   in what way they made void the word of God which said, "Honour thy
   father and thy mother," by saying, "Thou shalt not honour thy father or
   thy mother," whosoever shall say to his father or mother, "It is a gift
   that wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me," some one may
   inquire whether the words, "He that speaketh evil of father or mother,
   let him die the death," [5422] are not extraneous.  For, granted that
   he does not honour his father and mother, who consecrates to what is
   called Corban that which would have been given in honour of father and
   mother, in what way, therefore, does the tradition of the Pharisees
   make void the word which said, "He that speaketh evil of father or
   mother, let him die the death?"  But, perhaps, when any one said to his
   father or his mother, "It is a gift, that wherewith thou mightest have
   been profited by me," [5423] he, as it were, casts abuse on his father
   or mother as if he were calling his parents sacrilegious, in taking
   that which was consecrated to Corban from him who had consecrated it to
   Corban.  The Jews then punish their sons [5424] according to the law,
   as speaking evil of father or mother, when they say to their father or
   mother, "It is a gift, that wherewith thou mightest have been profited
   by me," but you by one of your traditions make void two commandments of
   God.  And then you are not ashamed to accuse My disciples who
   transgress no commandment; for they walk "in all His commandments and
   ordinances blamelessly," [5425] but transgress a tradition of the
   elders, so as not to transgress a commandment of God.  And if you had
   held this aim before you, you would have kept the commandment about the
   honour due to father and mother, and that which said, "He that speaketh
   evil of father and mother, let him die the death;" but the tradition of
   the elders which is opposed to these commandments you would not have
   kept.

   11.  Exposition of the Prophecy of Isaiah Quoted by Jesus.

   And, after this, wishing to refute completely from the words of the
   prophets all these traditions of the elders among the Jews, He brought
   before them a saying, from Isaiah, which in the exact words is as
   follows:  "And the Lord said, This people draws nigh to Me with their
   mouth," etc.; [5426] and, as we said before, Matthew has not written
   out the prophetical saying in the very words.  And, if it be necessary
   because of its use in the Gospel to interpret it according to our
   ability, we will take in addition the preceding passage which is, in my
   judgment, noted with advantage by us for the exposition of that passage
   in the Gospel which was taken from the prophet.  The passage in Isaiah
   from the beginning is thus, "Be ye faint, and be maddened:  be ye
   drunken, but not with strong drink nor with wine:  for the Lord hath
   given you to drink of the spirit of stupor, and He will close their
   eyes, both of their prophets, and of their rulers who see things
   secret.  And all these sayings shall be to you as the words of the
   book, which has been sealed, which if they give to a man who knows
   letters, saying, Read this, he shall answer, I cannot read, for it is
   sealed.  And this book will be given into the hands of a man who does
   not know letters, and one will say to him, Read this, and he will say,
   I know not letters.  And the Lord said, This people is nigh to Me,"
   etc., down to the words, "Woe unto them that form counsel in secret,
   and their works shall be in darkness." [5427]   Taking up then the
   passage before us in the Gospel, I have put some of the verses which
   come before it, and some which follow it, in order to show in what way
   the Word threatens to close the eyes of those of the people who are
   astonished and drunken, and have been made to drink of the spirit of
   deep sleep.  And it threatens also to close the eyes of their prophets
   and their rulers who profess to see things secret,--which things, I
   think, took place after the advent of the Saviour among that people;
   for all the words of the whole of the Scriptures, and of Isaiah also,
   have become to them as the words of a sealed book.  Now the expression
   "sealed" is used of a book closed in virtue of its obscurity and not
   open in virtue of its lucidity, which is equally obscure to those who
   are not able to read it at all because they do not know letters, and to
   those who profess to know letters but do not understand the meaning in
   the things which have been written.  Well, then, does he add to this,
   that when the people, fainting because of their sins and being in a
   state of madness rage against Him through those sins wherewith they
   shall be drunken against Him with the spirit of stupor, which shall be
   given to them to drink by the Lord when He closes their eyes, as
   unworthy to see, and the eyes of their prophets and of their rulers who
   profess to see the hidden things of the mysteries in the Divine
   Scriptures; and, when their eyes are closed, then shall the prophetic
   words be sealed to them and hidden, as has been the case with those who
   do not believe in Jesus as the Christ.  And when the prophetic sayings
   have become as the words of a sealed book, not only to those who do not
   know letters but to those who profess to know, then the Lord said, that
   the people of the Jews draw nigh to God with their mouth only, and He
   says that they honour Him with their lips, because their heart by
   reason of their unbelief in Jesus is far from the Lord.  And now,
   especially, from the time at which they denied our Saviour, it might be
   said about them by God, "But in vain do they worship Me;" [5428] for
   they no longer teach the precepts of God but of men, and doctrines
   which are human and no longer of the Spirit of wisdom.  Wherefore, when
   these things happen to them, God has removed the people of the Jews,
   and has caused to perish the wisdom of the wise men among them; for
   there is no longer wisdom among them, just as there is no prophecy; but
   God has utterly destroyed the prudence of the prudent and concealed it,
   [5429] and no longer is it splendid and conspicuous.  Wherefore,
   although they may seem to form some counsel in a deep fashion, because
   they do it not through the Lord they are called miserable; and even
   though they profess to tell some secrets of the Divine counsel they
   lie, since their works are not works of light, but of darkness and
   night. [5430]   I have thought it right briefly to set forth the
   prophecy, and to a certain extent elucidate its meaning, seeing that
   Matthew made mention of it.  And Mark also made mention of it, from
   whom we may usefully set down the following words in the place, with
   reference to the transgression of the elders who held that it was
   necessary to wash hands when the Jews ate bread, "For the Pharisees and
   all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding
   the tradition of the elders; and when they come from the market-place
   except they wash themselves they eat not.  And there are some other
   things which they have received to hold, washings of cups and pots and
   brazen vessels and couches." [5431]

   12.  Things Clean and Unclean According to the Law and the Gospel.

   "And He called to Him the multitude and said unto them, Hear and
   understand, " etc. [5432]   We are clearly taught in these words by the
   Saviour that, when we read in Leviticus and Deuteronomy the precepts
   about meat clean and unclean, for the transgression of which we are
   accused by the material Jews and by the Ebionites who differ little
   from them, we are not to think that the scope of the Scripture is found
   in any superficial understanding of them.  For if "not that which
   entereth into the mouth defileth the man, but that which proceedeth out
   of the mouth," [5433] and especially when, according to Mark, the
   Saviour said these things "making all meats clean," [5434] manifestly
   we are not defiled when we eat those things which the Jews who desire
   to be in bondage to the letter of the law declare to be unclean, but we
   are then defiled when, whereas our lips ought to be bound with
   perception and we ought "to make for them what we call a balance and
   weight," [5435] we speak offhand and discuss matters we ought not, from
   which there comes to us the spring of sins.  And it is indeed becoming
   to the law of God to forbid those things which arise from wickedness,
   and to enjoin those things which tend to virtue, but as for things
   which are in their own nature indifferent to leave them in their own
   place, as they may, according to our choice and the reason which is in
   us, be done ill if we sin in them, but if rightly directed by us be
   done well.  And any one who has carefully thought on these matters will
   see that, even in those things which are thought to be good, it is
   possible for a man to sin who has taken them up in an evil way and
   under the impulse of passion, and that these things called impure may
   be considered pure, if used by us in accordance with reason.  As, then,
   when the Jew sins his circumcision shall be reckoned for
   uncircumcision, but when one of the Gentiles acts uprightly his
   uncircumcision shall be reckoned for circumcision, [5436] so those
   things which are thought to be pure shall be reckoned for impure in the
   case of him who does not use them fittingly, nor when one ought, nor as
   far as he ought, nor for what reason he ought.  But as for the things
   which are called impure, "All things become pure to the pure," for, "To
   them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure, since both their
   minds and their conscience are defiled." [5437]   And when these are
   defiled, they make all things whatsoever they touch defiled; as again
   on the contrary the pure mind and the pure conscience make all things
   pure, even though they may seem to be impure; for not from
   intemperance, nor from love of pleasure, nor with doubting which draws
   a man both ways, do the righteous use meats or drinks, mindful of the
   precept, "Whether ye eat or drink or whatsoever other thing ye do, do
   all to the glory of God." [5438]   And if it be necessary to delineate
   the foods which are unclean according to the Gospel, we will say that
   they are such as are supplied by covetousness, and are the result of
   base love of gain, and are taken up from love of pleasure, and from
   deifying the belly which is treated with honour, when it, with its
   appetites, and not reason, rules our souls.  But as for us who know
   that some things are used by demons, or if we do not know, but suspect,
   and are in doubt about it, if we use such things, we have used them not
   to the glory of God, nor in the name of Christ; for not only does the
   suspicion that things have been sacrificed to idols condemn him who
   eats, but even the doubt concerning this; for "he that doubteth,"
   according to the Apostle, "is condemned if he eat, because he eateth
   not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin." [5439]   He then
   eats in faith who believes that that which is eaten has not been
   sacrificed in the temples of idols, and that it is not strangled nor
   blood; [5440] but he eats not of faith who is in doubt about any of
   these things.  And the man who knowing that they have been sacrificed
   to demons nevertheless uses them, becomes a communicant with demons,
   while at the same time, his imagination is polluted with reference to
   demons participating in the sacrifice.  And the Apostle, however,
   knowing that it is not the nature of meats which is the cause of injury
   to him who uses them or of advantage to him who refrains from their
   use, but opinions and the reason which is in them, said, "But meat
   commendeth us not to God, for neither if we eat are we the better, nor
   if we eat not are we the worse." [5441]   And since he knew that those
   who have a loftier conception of what things are pure and what impure
   according to the law, turning aside from the distinction about the use
   of things pure and impure, and superstition, I think, in respect of
   things being different, become indifferent to the use of meats, [5442]
   and on this account are condemned by the Jews as transgressors of law,
   he said therefore, somewhere, "Let no man therefore judge you in meat
   or in drink," etc., [5443] teaching us that the things according to the
   letter are a shadow, but that the true thoughts of the law which are
   stored up in them are the good things to come, in which one may find
   what are the pure spiritual meats of the soul, and what are the impure
   foods in false and contradictory words which injure the man who is
   nourished in them, "For the law had a shadow of the good things to
   come." [5444]

   13.  The Offence of the Pharisees.

   And as in many cases we have to consider the astonishment of the Jews
   at the words of the Saviour, because they were spoken with authority,
   so also in regard to the words in this place.  Having called the
   multitudes therefore, He said unto them, "Hear and understand," [5445]
   etc.  And He said this, the Pharisees being offended at this saying,
   as, because of their evil opinions and their worthless interpretation
   of the law, they were not the plant of his own Father in heaven, and on
   this account were being rooted up; [5446] for they were rooted up as
   they did not receive the true vine, which was cultivated by the Father,
   even Jesus Christ. [5447]   For how could they be a plant of His Father
   who were offended at the words of Jesus, words which turn men away from
   the precept, "Handle not, nor taste, nor touch,--all which things were
   to perish in the using--after the precepts and doctrines of men,"
   [5448] but induce the intelligent hearer of them to seek in regard to
   them the things which are above and not the things upon the earth as
   the Jews do? [5449]   And since, because of their evil opinions, the
   Pharisees were not the plant of His Father in heaven, on this account,
   as about such as were incorrigible, He says to the disciple, "Let them
   alone;" [5450] "Let them alone," He said for this reason, that as they
   were blind they ought to become conscious of their blindness and seek
   guides; but they, being unconscious of their own blindness, profess to
   guide the blind, not reckoning that they would fall into a pit, about
   which it is written in the Psalms, "He hath made a pit, and digged it,
   and will fall into the ditch which he hath made." [5451]   Again,
   elsewhere it is written, "And seeing the multitudes, He went up into
   the mountain, and when He had sat down His disciples came unto Him;"
   [5452] but here He stretches forth His hand to the multitude, calling
   them unto Him, and turning their thoughts away from the literal
   interpretation of the questions in the law, when He in the first place
   said to them, who did not yet understand what they heard, "Hear and
   understand," and thereafter as in parables said to them, "Not that
   which entereth into the mouth defileth the man, but that which
   proceedeth out of the mouth." [5453]

   14.  Why the Pharisees Were Not a Plant of God.  Teaching of Origen on
   the "Bread of the Lord."

   After this, it is worth while to look at the phrase which has been
   assailed in a sophistical way by those who say [5454] that the God of
   the law and the God of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is not the same; for
   they say that the heavenly Father of Jesus Christ is not the husbandman
   of those who think that they worship God according to the law of
   Moses.  Jesus Himself said that the Pharisees, who were worshipping the
   God who created the world and the law, were not a plant which His
   heavenly Father had planted, and that for this reason it was being
   rooted up. [5455]   But you might also say this, that even if it were
   the Father of Jesus who "brought in and planted the people," when it
   came out of Egypt, "to the mountain of His own inheritance, to the
   place which He had prepared for Himself to dwell in," [5456] yet Jesus
   would have said, in regard to the Pharisees, "Every plant which My
   heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up."  Now, to this we will
   say, that as many as on account of their perverse interpretation of the
   things in the law were not a plant of His Father in heaven, were
   blinded in their minds, as not believing the truth, but taking pleasure
   in unrighteousness, [5457] by him who is deified by the sons of this
   world, and on this account is called by Paul the god of this world.
   [5458]   And do not suppose that Paul said that he was truly God; for
   just as the belly, though it is not the god of those who prize pleasure
   too highly, being lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, is said
   by Paul to be their god, [5459] so the prince of this world, in regard
   to whom the Saviour says, "Now has the prince of this world been
   judged," [5460] though he is not God, is said to be the god of those
   who do not wish to receive the spirit of adoption, in order that they
   may become sons of that world, and sons of the resurrection from the
   dead, [5461] and who, on this account, abide in the sonship of this
   world.  I have deemed it necessary to introduce these matters, even
   though they may have been spoken by way of digression, because of the
   saying, "They are blind guides of the blind." [5462]   Who are such?
   The Pharisees, whose minds the god of this world hath blinded as they
   are unbelieving, because they have not believed in Jesus Christ; and he
   hath blinded them so that the "light of the Gospel of the glory of God
   in the face of Christ should not dawn upon them." [5463]   But not only
   must we avoid being guided by those blind ones who are conscious that
   they are in need of guides, because they have not yet received the
   power of vision of themselves; but even in the case of all who profess
   to guide us in sound doctrine, we must hear with care, and apply a
   sound judgment to what is said, lest being guided according to the
   ignorance of those who are blind, and do not see the things that
   concern sound doctrine, we ourselves may appear to be blind because we
   do not see the sense of the Scriptures, so that both he who guides and
   he who is guided will fall into the ditch of which we have spoken
   before.  Next to this, it is written in what way Peter answered and
   said to the Saviour, as if he had not understood the saying, "Not that
   which cometh into the mouth defileth the man, but that which goeth out
   of the mouth," "Declare unto us the parable." [5464]   To which the
   Saviour says, "Are ye also, even yet, without understanding?" [5465]
   As if He had said, "Having been so long time with Me, do ye not yet
   understand the meaning of what is said, and do ye not perceive that for
   this reason that which goeth into his mouth does not defile the man,
   because it passeth into the belly, and going out from it is cast into
   the draught?" [5466]   It was not in respect of the law in which they
   appeared to believe, that the Pharisees were not a plant of the Father
   of Jesus, but in respect of their perverse interpretation of the law
   and the things written in it.  For since there are two things to be
   understood in regard to the law, the ministration of death which was
   engraven in letters [5467] and which had no kinship with the spirit,
   and the ministration of life which is understood in the spiritual law,
   those who were able with a sincere heart to say, "We know that the law
   is spiritual," [5468] and therefore "the law is holy, and the
   commandment holy and righteous and good," [5469] were the plant which
   the heavenly Father planted; but those who were not such, but guarded
   with care the letter which killeth only, were not a plant of God but of
   him who hardened their heart, and put a veil over it, which veil had
   power over them so long as they did not turn to the Lord; "for if any
   one should turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away, and the Lord is
   the Spirit." [5470]   Now some one when dealing with the passage might
   say, that just as "not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the
   man," [5471] of even though it may be thought by the Jews to be
   defiled, so not that which entereth into the mouth sanctifieth the man,
   even though what is called the bread of the Lord may be thought by the
   simpler disciples to sanctify.  And the saying is I think, not to be
   despised, and on this account, demands clear exposition, which seems to
   me to be thus; as it is not the meat but the conscience of him who eats
   with doubt which defiles him that eateth, for "he that doubteth is
   condemned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith," [5472] and as
   nothing is pure to him who is defiled and unbelieving, not in itself,
   but because of his defilement and unbelief, so that which is sanctified
   through the word of God and prayer [5473] does not, in its own nature,
   sanctify him who uses it, for, if this were so, it would sanctify even
   him who eats unworthily of the bread of the Lord, and no one on account
   of this food would become weak or sickly or asleep for something of
   this kind Paul represented in saying, "For this cause many among you
   are weak and sickly and not a few sleep." [5474]   And in the case of
   the bread of the Lord, accordingly, there is advantage to him who uses
   it, when with undefiled mind and pure conscience he partakes of the
   bread.  And so neither by not eating, I mean by the very fact that we
   do not eat of the bread which has been sanctified by the word of God
   and prayer, are we deprived of any good thing, nor by eating are we the
   better by any good thing; for the cause of our lacking is wickedness
   and sins, and the cause of our abounding is righteousness and right
   actions; so that such is the meaning of what is said by Paul, "For
   neither if we eat are we the better, nor if we eat not are we the
   worse." [5475]   Now, if "everything that entereth into the mouth goes
   into the belly and is cast out into the drought," [5476] even the meat
   which has been sanctified through the word of God and prayer, in
   accordance with the fact that it is material, goes into the belly and
   is cast out into the draught, but in respect of the prayer which comes
   upon it, according to the proportion of the faith, becomes a benefit
   and is a means of clear vision to the mind which looks to that which is
   beneficial, and it is not the material of the bread but the word which
   is said over it which is of advantage to him who eats it not unworthily
   of the Lord.  And these things indeed are said of the typical and
   symbolical body.  But many things might be said about the Word Himself
   who became flesh, [5477] and true meat of which he that eateth shall
   assuredly live for ever, no worthless person being able to eat it; for
   if it were possible for one who continues worthless to eat of Him who
   became flesh, who was the Word and the living bread, it would not have
   been written, that "every one who eats of this bread shall live for
   ever." [5478]

   15.  Eating with Unwashed Heart Defiles the Man.

   Next to this let us see how the things which proceed out and defile the
   man do not defile the man because of their proceeding out of the mouth,
   but have the cause of their defilement in the heart, when there come
   forth out of it, before those things which proceed through the mouth,
   evil thoughts, of which the species are--murders, adulteries,
   fornications, thefts, false witness, railings. [5479]   For these are
   the things which defile the man, when they come forth out of the heart,
   and going out from it proceed through the mouth; so that, if they did
   not come out of the heart, but were retained there somewhere about the
   heart, and were not allowed to be spoken through the mouth, they would
   very quickly disappear, and a man would be no more defiled.  The spring
   and source, then, of every sin are evil thoughts; for, unless these
   gained the mastery, neither murders nor adulteries nor any other such
   thing would exist.  Therefore, each man must keep his own heart with
   all watchfulness; [5480] for when the Lord comes in the day of
   judgment, "He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and
   will make manifest the counsels of the hearts," [5481] "all the
   thoughts of men meanwhile accusing or else excusing them," [5482] "when
   their own devices have beset them about." [5483]   But of such a nature
   are the evil thoughts that sometimes they make worthy of censure even
   those things which seem good, and which, so far as the judgment of the
   masses is concerned, are worthy of praise.  Accordingly, if we do alms
   before men, having in our thoughts the design of appearing to men
   philanthropic, and of being honoured because of philanthropy, we
   receive the reward from men; [5484] and, universally, everything that
   is done with the consciousness in the doer that he will be glorified by
   men, has no reward from Him who beholds in secret, and renders the
   reward to those who are pure, in secret.  So, too, therefore, is it
   with apparent purity if it is influenced by considerations of vain
   glory or love of gain; and the teaching which is thought to be the
   teaching of the Church, if it becomes servile through the word of
   flattery, either when it is made the excuse for covetousness, or when
   any one seeks glory from men because of his teaching, is not reckoned
   to be the teaching of those "who have been set by God in the Church:
   first, apostles; secondly, prophets; and thirdly, teachers." [5485]
   And you will say the like in the case of him who seeks the office of a
   bishop for the sake of glory with men, or of flattery from men, or for
   the sake of the gain received from those who, coming over to the word,
   give in the name of piety; for a bishop of this kind at any rate does
   not "desire a good work," [5486] nor can he be without reproach, nor
   temperate, nor sober-minded, as he is intoxicated with glory and
   intemperately satiated with it.  And the same also you will say about
   the elders and deacons.  And if we seem to some to have made a
   digression in speaking of these things, consider if it were not
   necessary that they should be said, because that evil thoughts are the
   spring of all sins, and can pollute even those actions which, if they
   were done apart from evil thoughts, would have justified the man who
   did them.  We have thus investigated according to our ability what are
   the things which defile; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile
   the man; but if we must say it with boldness, with unwashed heart to
   eat anything whatsoever which is the natural food of our reason,
   defileth the man.

   16.  Concerning the Canaanitish Woman.  Meaning of the "Borders of Tyre
   and Sidon."

   "And Jesus went out thence and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and
   Sidon.  And behold a Canaanitish woman." [5487]   Whence the "thence"?
   Was it from the land of Gennesaret, concerning which it was said
   before, "And when they had crossed over they came into the land of
   Gennesaret?" [5488]   But He withdrew, perhaps because the Pharisees
   were offended when they heard that "not that which entereth in, but
   that which proceedeth out, defileth the man;" [5489] and that, because
   of their being suspected of plotting against Him, it is said, "He
   withdrew," is manifest from the passage, "And when He heard that John
   was delivered up He withdrew into Galilee." [5490]   Perhaps also on
   this account, when describing the things in this place, Mark says that
   "He rose up and went into the borders of Tyre, and having entered into
   the house wished no man to know it." [5491]   It is probable that He
   sought to avoid the Pharisees who were offended at His teaching,
   waiting for the time for His suffering, which was more fitting and
   rightly appointed.  But some one might say that Tyre and Sidon are used
   for the Gentiles; accordingly when He withdrew from Israel He came into
   the parts of the Gentiles.  Among the Hebrews, then, Tyre is called
   Sor, and it is interpreted "anguish."  Sidon, which is also the Hebrew
   name, is rendered "hunters."  And among the Gentiles likewise the
   hunters are the evil powers, and among them is great distress, the
   distress, namely, which exists in wickedness and passions.  When Jesus,
   then, went out from Gennesaret He withdrew indeed from Israel and came,
   not to Tyre and Sidon, but into "the parts" of Tyre and Sidon, with the
   result that those of the Gentiles now believe in part; so that if He
   had visited the whole of Tyre and Sidon, no unbeliever would have been
   left in it.  Now, according to Mark, "Jesus rose up and went into the
   borders of Tyre," [5492] --that is, the distress of the Gentiles,--in
   order that they also from these borders who believe can be saved, when
   they come out of them; for attend to this:  "And behold a Canaanitish
   woman came out from these borders and cried saying, Have mercy on me, O
   Lord, Thou Son of David, my daughter is terribly vexed with a demon."
   [5493]   And I think that if she had not come out from those borders
   she would not have been able to cry to Jesus with the great faith to
   which testimony was borne; and according to the proportion of faith one
   comes out from the borders among the Gentiles, which "when the Most
   High divided the nations He set up according to the number of the sons
   of Israel," [5494] and prevented their further advance.  Here, then,
   certain borders are spoken of as the borders of Tyre and Sidon, but in
   Exodus the borders of Pharaoh, [5495] in which, they say, were formed
   the plagues against the Egyptians.  And we must suppose that each of us
   when he sins is in the borders of Tyre or Sidon or of Pharaoh and
   Egypt, or some one of those which are outside the allotted inheritance
   of God; but when he changes from wickedness to virtue he goes out from
   the borders of evil, and comes to the borders of the portion of God,
   there being among these also a difference which will be manifest to
   those who are able to understand the things that concern the division
   and the inheritance of Israel, in harmony with the spiritual law.  And
   attend also to the meeting, so to speak, which took place between Jesus
   and the Canaanitish woman; for He comes as to the parts of Tyre and
   Sidon, and she comes out of those parts, and cried, saying, "Have mercy
   on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David." [5496]   Now the woman was
   Canaanitish, which is rendered, prepared for humiliation.  The
   righteous, indeed, are prepared for the kingdom of heaven and for the
   exaltation in the kingdom of God; [5497] but sinners are prepared for
   the humiliation of the wickedness which is in them, and of the deeds
   which flow from it and prepare them for it, and of the sin which reigns
   in their mortal body.  Only, the Canaanitish woman came out of those
   borders and went forth from the state of being prepared for
   humiliation, crying and saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of
   David."

   17.  Exposition of the Details in the Narrative.

   Now bring together from the Gospels those who call Him Son of David, as
   she, and the blind men in Jericho; [5498] and who call Him Son of God,
   and that without the addition "truly" like the demoniacs who say, "What
   have we to do with Thee, Thou Son of God;" [5499] and who call Him so
   with the addition "truly," like those in the boat who worshipped Him
   saying, "Truly Thou art the Son of God." [5500]   For the bringing
   together of these passages will, I think, be useful to you with a view
   to seeing the difference of those who come (to Jesus); some indeed come
   as to Him "who was born of the seed of David according to the flesh;"
   [5501] but others come to Him who "was declared to be the Son of God
   with power, according to the spirit of holiness;" [5502] and of these
   some with the "truly," and some without it.  Further, observe, that the
   Canaanitish woman besought Him not about a son, whom she does not seem
   to have brought forth at all, but about a daughter who was terribly
   vexed with a demon; but another mother receives back alive her son who
   was being carried forth dead. [5503]   And again the ruler of the
   synagogue makes supplication for a daughter twelve years old, as being
   dead, [5504] but the nobleman about a son as being still sick, and at
   the point of death. [5505]   The daughter, accordingly, who was
   distressed by a demon, and the dead son sprang from two mothers; and
   the dead daughter, and the son who was sick unto death, sprang from two
   fathers, of whom the one was a ruler of the synagogue, and the other
   was a nobleman.  And I am persuaded these things contain reasons
   concerning the diverse kinds of souls which Jesus vivifies and heals.
   And all the cures that He works among the people, especially those
   recorded by the Evangelists, took place at that time, that those who
   would not otherwise have believed unless they saw signs and wonders
   might believe; [5506] for the things aforetime were symbols of the
   things that are ever being accomplished by the power of Jesus; for
   there is no time when each of the things which are written is not done
   by the power of Jesus according to the desert of each.  The Canaanitish
   woman, therefore, because of her race was not worthy even to receive an
   answer from Jesus, who acknowledged that He had not been sent by the
   Father for any other thing than to the lost sheep of the house of
   Israel, [5507] --a lost race of souls possessed of clear vision; but,
   because of her resolution and of having worshipped Jesus as Son of God,
   she obtains an answer, which reproaches her with baseness of birth and
   exhibits the measure of her worthiness, namely, that she was worthy of
   crumbs as the little dogs, but not of the loaves.  But when she with
   intensified resolution, accepting the saying of Jesus, puts forth the
   claim to obtain crumbs even as a little dog, and acknowledges that the
   masters are of a nobler race, then she gets a second answer, which
   bears testimony to her faith as great, and a promise that it shall be
   done unto her as she wills. [5508]   And corresponding, I think, "to
   the Jerusalem above, which is free, the mother" [5509] of Paul and
   those like to him, must we conceive of the Canaanitish woman, the
   mother of her who was terribly distressed with a demon, who was the
   symbol of the mother of such a soul.  And consider whether it is not
   according to sound reason that there are also many fathers and many
   mothers corresponding to the fathers of Abraham to whom the patriarch
   went away, [5510] and to Jerusalem the "mother," as Paul says,
   concerning himself and those like to him.  And it is probable that she
   of whom the Canaanitish woman was a symbol came out of the borders of
   Tyre and Sidon, of which the places on earth were types, and came to
   the Saviour and besought Him and even now beseeches Him saying, "Have
   mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David, my daughter is terribly vexed
   with a demon." [5511]   Then also to those without and to the disciples
   when necessary He answers and says, "I was not sent;" [5512] teaching
   us that there are some lost souls pre-eminently intellectual and clear
   of vision, figuratively called sheep of the house of Israel; which
   things, I think, the simpler who are of opinion that they are spoken in
   regard to the Israel which is after the flesh will of necessity admit,
   namely, that our Saviour was sent by the Father to no others than to
   those lost Jews.  But we, who can truthfully boast that "if we have
   once known Christ after the flesh, but now no longer do we know Him
   so," [5513] are assured that it is pre-eminently the work of the Word
   to save the more intelligent, for these are more akin to Him than those
   who are duller.  But since the lost sheep of the house of Israel, with
   the exception of "the remnant according to the election of grace,"
   [5514] disbelieved the Word, on this account "God chose the foolish
   things of the world," [5515] namely, that which was not Israel, nor
   clear of vision, that He might put to shame the wise ones of Israel;
   and He called "the things which are not," [5516] handing over to them
   an intelligent nation who were able to admit "the foolishness of the
   preaching," [5517] and of His good pleasure saved those who believe in
   this, that He might refute "the things which are," having perfected
   praise for Himself, "out of the mouths of babes and sucklings," [5518]
   when they became hostile to truth.  Now, the Canaanitish woman, having
   come, worshipped Jesus as God, saying, "Lord, help me," but He answered
   and said, "It is not possible to take the children's bread and cast it
   to the little dogs." [5519]   But some one might inquire also into the
   meaning of this saying, since,--inasmuch as there was a measure of
   loaves such that both the children and the dogs of the household could
   not eat loaves, unless the dogs ate other loaves than those which were
   well made,--it was not possible according to right reason for the
   well-made loaf of the children to be given as food to the little dogs.
   But no such thing appears in the case of the power of Jesus, for of
   this it was possible both for the children and those called little dogs
   to partake.  Consider, then, whether perhaps with reference to the
   saying, "It is not possible to take the bread of children," we ought to
   say that, "He who emptied Himself and took upon Him the form of a
   servant," [5520] brought a measure of power such as the world was
   capable of receiving, of which power also He was conscious that a
   certain quantity went forth from Him as is plain from the words, "Some
   one did touch Me, for I perceived that power had gone forth from Me."
   [5521]   From this measure of power, then, He dispensed, giving a
   larger portion to those who were pre-eminent and who were called sons,
   but a smaller portion to those who were not such, as to the little
   dogs.  But though these things were so, nevertheless where there was
   great faith, to her, who because of her base birth in Canaanitish land
   was a little dog, He gave as to a child the bread of the children.  And
   perhaps, also, of the words of Jesus there are some loaves which it is
   possible to give to the more rational, as to children only; and other
   words, as it were, crumbs from the great house and table of the
   wellborn and the masters, which may be used by some souls, like the
   dogs.  And according to the law of Moses it is written about certain
   things, "Ye shall cast them to the dogs," [5522] and it was a matter of
   care to the Holy Spirit to give instruction about certain foods that
   they should be left to the dogs.  Let others, then, who are strangers
   to the doctrine of the Church, assume that souls pass from the bodies
   of men into the bodies of dogs, according to their varying degree of
   wickedness; but we, who do not find this at all in the divine
   Scripture, say that the more rational condition changes into one more
   irrational, undergoing this affection in consequence of great
   slothfulness and negligence.  But, also, in the same way, a will which
   was more irrational, because of its neglect of reason, sometimes turns
   and becomes rational, so that that which at one time was a dog, loving
   to eat of the crumbs that fell from the table of its masters, comes
   into the condition of a son.  For virtue contributes greatly to the
   making of one a son of God, but wickedness, and mad fury in wanton
   discourses and shamelessness, contribute to the giving of a man the
   name of dog according to the word of the Scripture. [5523]   And the
   like you will also understand in the case of the other names which are
   applied to animals without reason.  Only, he who is reproached as a dog
   and yet is not indignant at being called unworthy of the bread of
   children and with all forbearance repeats the saying of that
   Canaanitish woman, "Yea, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the
   crumbs which fall from their masters' [5524] table," will obtain the
   very gentle answer of Jesus saying to him, "Great is thy faith,"--when
   he has received so great faith--and saying, "Be it done unto thee even
   as thou wilt," [5525] so that he himself may be healed, and if he has
   produced any fruit which stands in need of healing, that this, too, may
   be cured.

   18.  Concerning the Multitudes Who Were Healed.  Comparison of the
   Mountain Where Jesus Sat to the Church.

   "And Jesus departed thence,"--manifestly, from what has been said
   before, from the parts of Tyre and Sidon,--"and came nigh unto the sea
   of Galilee," [5526] which is commonly called the Lake of Gennesaret,
   and again went up into the mountain where He went up and sat.  We may
   say, then, that into this mountain where Jesus sits, not only the sound
   in health go up, but along with the sound, those also who were
   suffering from various disorders.  And, perhaps, this mountain to which
   Jesus went up and sat is that which is more commonly called the Church,
   which has been set up through the word of God over the rest of the
   world and the men upon it; whither go not the disciples only, leaving
   the multitudes as in the case of the beatitudes, but great multitudes
   who were not accused themselves of being deaf or suffering from any
   affection, but who had such along with themselves.  For you may see,
   along with the multitudes who come to this mountain where the Son of
   God sits, some who have become deaf to the things promised, and others
   blind in soul and not looking at the true light, and others who are
   lame and not able to walk according to reason, and others who are
   maimed and not able to work according to reason.  Those, accordingly,
   who are suffering in soul from such things, though they go up along
   with the multitudes into the mountain where Jesus was, so long as they
   are outside of the feet of Jesus, are not healed by Him; but when, as
   men suffering from such disorders, they are cast by the multitude at
   His feet, [5527] and at the extremities of the body of Christ, not
   being worthy to obtain such things so far as they themselves are
   concerned, they are then healed by Him.  And when you see in the
   congregation of what is more commonly called the church the catechumens
   cast behind those who are at the extreme end of it, and as it were at
   the feet of the body of Jesus--the church--coming to it with their own
   deafness and blindness and lameness and crookedness, and in time cured
   according to the Word, you would not err in saying that such having
   gone up with the multitudes of the church to the mountain where Jesus
   was, are cast at His feet and are healed; so that the multitude of the
   church is astonished at beholding transformations which have taken
   place from so great evils to that which is better, so that it might
   say, those who were formerly dumb afterwards speak the word of God, and
   the lame walk, the prophecy of Isaiah being fulfilled, not only in
   things bodily but in things spiritual, which said, "Then shall the lame
   man leap as an hart, and the tongue of him that hath an impediment in
   his speech be plain." [5528]   And there, unless the expression, "the
   lame man shall leap as an hart," is to be taken as accidental, we will
   say that those formerly lame, and who now through the power of Jesus
   leap as an hart are not without design compared to a hart, which is a
   clean animal, and hostile to serpents and cannot at all be injured by
   their poison.  But also, in respect of the fact that the dumb are seen
   speaking is the prophecy fulfilled which said, "And the tongue of him
   that hath an impediment shall be plain," or rather that which said,
   "Hear ye deaf;" but the blind see according to the prophecy following,
   "Hear ye deaf, and ye blind look up that ye may see." [5529]   Now the
   blind see, when they see the world and from the exceeding great beauty
   of the things created they contemplate the Creator corresponding in
   greatness and beauty to them; and when they see clearly "the invisible
   things of God Himself from the creation of the world, which are
   perceived through the things that are made;" [5530] that is, they see
   and understand with care and clearness.  Now the multitudes seeing
   these things, glorified the God of Israel, [5531] and glorify Him in
   the persuasion that it is the same God, who is the Father of Him who
   healed those previously mentioned, and the God of Israel.  For He is
   not the God of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles. [5532]   Let us
   then cause to go up along with ourselves to the mountain where Jesus
   sits--His church--those who wish to go up to it along with us, the
   deaf, the blind, the lame, the maimed and many others, and let us cast
   them at the feet of Jesus that He may heal them, so that the multitudes
   are astonished at their healing; for it is not the disciples who are
   described as wondering at such things, although at that time they were
   present with Jesus, as is manifest from the words, "And Jesus called
   unto Him His disciples and said, I have compassion on the multitudes,"
   [5533] etc.; and perhaps if you attend carefully to the words, "There
   came unto Him great multitudes," [5534] you would find that the
   disciples at that time did not come to Him, but had begun long ago to
   follow Him and followed Him into the mountain.  But there came unto Him
   those who were inferior to the disciples, and were then for the first
   time approaching Him, who had not the same experience as those who had
   gone up with them.  Observe, moreover, in the Gospel who are described
   as having followed Jesus, and who as having come to Him, and who as
   having been brought to Him, and the division between those who go
   before and of those who follow; and of those who came, who came to Him
   in the house, and who when He was elsewhere.  For by observation, and
   by comparing things spiritual with spiritual, you would find many
   things worthy of the accurate wisdom in the Gospels.

   19.  Concerning the Seven Loaves.  The Narrative of the Feeding of the
   Four Thousand Compared with that of the Five Thousand.

   "And Jesus called unto Him His disciples and said." [5535]   Above in
   the similar history to this about the loaves, before the loaves are
   spoken of, "Jesus came forth and saw a great multitude and had
   compassion upon them and healed their sick.  And when even was come the
   disciples came to Him saying, The place is desert and the time is
   already past, send them away," [5536] etc.  But now after the healing
   of the deaf and the rest, He takes compassion on the multitude which
   had continued with Him now three days and had nothing to eat.  And
   there the disciples make request concerning the five thousand; [5537]
   but here He speaks of His own accord about the four thousand. [5538]
   Those, too, are fed when it was evening after they had spent a day with
   Him; but these, who are testified to have continued with Him three
   days, partake of the loaves lest they might faint by the way.  And
   there the disciples say to Him when He was not inquiring, that they had
   only five loaves and two fishes; but here to Him making inquiry, they
   give answer about the seven loaves and the few small fishes.  And there
   He commands the multitudes to sit down or lie upon the grass; for Luke
   also wrote, "Make them sit down," [5539] and Mark says, "He commanded
   them all to sit down;" [5540] but here He does not command but
   proclaims [5541] to the multitude to sit down.  Again, there, the three
   Evangelists say in the very same words that "He took the five loaves
   and the two fishes and looking up to heaven He blessed;" [5542] but
   here, as Matthew and Mark have written, "Jesus gave thanks and brake;"
   [5543] there, they recline upon the grass, but here they sit down upon
   the ground.  You will moreover investigate in the accounts in the
   different places the variation found in John, who wrote in regard to
   that transaction that Jesus said, "Make the men sit down," [5544] and
   that, having given thanks, He gave of the loaves to them that were set
   down, but he did not mention this miracle at all. [5545]   Attending,
   then, to the difference of those things which are written in the
   various places in regard to the loaves, I think that these belong to a
   different order from those; wherefore these are fed in a mountain, and
   those in a desert place; and these after they had continued three days
   with Jesus, but those one day, on the evening of which they were fed.
   And further, unless it be the same thing for Jesus to do a thing of
   Himself and to act after having heard from the disciples, consider if
   those to whom Jesus shows kindness are not superior when He fed them on
   the spot with a view to showing them kindness.  And, if according to
   John, [5546] they were barley loaves of which the twelve baskets
   remained over, but nothing of this kind is said about these, how are
   not these superior to the former?  And the sick of those He healed,
   [5547] but here He heals these, along with the multitudes, who were not
   sick but blind, and lame, and deaf, and maimed; wherefore also in
   regard to these the four thousand marvel, [5548] but in regard to the
   sick no such thing is said.  And these I think who ate of the seven
   loaves for which thanks were given, are superior to those who ate of
   the five which were blessed; and these who ate the few little fishes to
   those who ate of the two, and perhaps also these who sat down upon the
   ground to those who sat down on the grass.  And those from fewer loaves
   leave twelve baskets, but these from a greater number leave seven
   baskets, inasmuch, as they were able to receive more.  And perhaps
   these tread upon all earthly things and sit down upon them, but those
   upon the grass--upon their flesh only--for "all flesh is grass." [5549]
     Consider also after this, that Jesus does not wish to send them away
   fasting lest they faint on the way, as being without the loaves of
   Jesus, and while they were still on the way--the way to their own
   concerns--might suffer injury.  Take note also of the cases where Jesus
   is recorded to have sent any one away, that you may see the difference
   of those who were sent away by Him after being fed, and those who had
   been sent away otherwise; and, as a pattern of one who was sent away
   otherwise, take "Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity." [5550]
   But further the disciples who are always with Jesus are not sent away
   by Him; but the multitudes after they have eaten are sent away.
   Likewise, again, the disciples who conceive nothing great about the
   Canaanitish woman say, "Send her away, for she crieth after us;" [5551]
   but the Saviour does not at all appear to send her away; for saying
   unto her, "O woman, great is thy faith, be it done to thee even as thou
   wilt," [5552] He healed her daughter from that hour:  it is not however
   written that He sent her away.  So far at the present time have we been
   able to investigate and see into the passage before us.

   Book XII.

   1.  Concerning Those Who Asked Him to Show Them a Sign from Heaven.

   "And the Sadducees and Pharisees came, and tempting Him kept asking Him
   to shew them a sign from heaven." [5553]   The Sadducees and Pharisees
   who disagreed with each other in regard to the most essential
   truths,--for the Pharisees champion the doctrine of the resurrection of
   the dead, hoping that there will be a world to come, while the
   Sadducees know nothing after this life in store for a man whether he
   has been advancing towards virtue, or has made no effort at all to come
   out from the mountains of wickedness,--these, I say, agree that they
   may tempt Jesus.  Now, a similar thing, as Luke has narrated, [5554]
   happened in the case of Herod and Pilate, who became friends with one
   another that they might kill Jesus; for, perhaps, their hostility with
   one another would have prevented Herod from asking that He should be
   put to death, in order to please the people, who said, "Crucify Him,
   Crucify Him," [5555] and would have influenced Pilate, who was somewhat
   inclined against His condemnation, his hostility with Herod giving
   fresh impulse to the inclination which he previously cherished to
   release Jesus.  But their apparent friendship made Herod stronger in
   his demand against Jesus with Pilate, who wished, perhaps, also because
   of the newly-formed friendship to do something to gratify Herod and all
   the nation of the Jews.  And often even now you may see in daily life
   those who hold the most divergent opinions, whether in the philosophy
   of the Greeks or in other systems of thought, appearing to be of one
   mind that they may scoff at and attack Jesus Christ in the person of
   His disciples.  And from these things I think you may go on by rational
   argument to consider, whether when forces join in opposition which are
   in disagreement with one another, as of Pharaoh with Nebuchadnezzar,
   [5556] and of Tirhakah, king of the Ethiopians, with Sennacherib,
   [5557] a combination then takes place against Jesus and His people.  So
   perhaps, also, "The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers
   were gathered together," [5558] though not at all before at harmony
   with one another, that having taken counsel against the Lord and His
   Christ, they might slay the Lord of glory.

   2.  Why the Pharisees Asked a Sign from Heaven.

   Now, to this point we have come in our discourse, because of the
   Pharisees and Sadducees coming together unto Jesus, who disagreed in
   matters relating to the resurrection, but came, as it were, to an
   agreement for the sake of tempting our Saviour, and asking Him to show
   them a sign from heaven.  For, not satisfied with the wonderful signs
   shown among the people in the healing of all forms of disease and
   sickness, and with the rest of the miracles which our Saviour had done
   in the knowledge of many, they wished Him to show to them also a sign
   from heaven.  And I conjecture that they suspected that the signs upon
   earth might possibly not be of God; for they did not hesitate indeed to
   say, "Jesus casts out demons by Beelzebub the prince of the demons;"
   [5559] and it seemed to them that a sign from heaven could not spring
   from Beelzebub or any other wicked power.  But they erred in regard to
   both, in regard to signs upon earth as well as to signs from heaven,
   not being "approved money-changers," [5560] nor knowing how to
   distinguish between the spirits that are working, which kind are from
   God, and which have revolted from Him.  And they ought to have known
   that even many of the portents wrought against Egypt in the time of
   Moses, though they were not from heaven, were clearly from God, and
   that the fire which fell from heaven upon the sheep of Job was not from
   God; [5561] for that fire belonged to the same one as he to whom
   belonged those who carried off, and made three bands of horsemen
   against, the cattle of Job.  I think, moreover, that in Isaiah--as if
   signs could be shown both from the earth and from heaven, the true
   being from God, but "with all power and signs and lying wonders" [5562]
   those from the evil one--it was said to Ahaz, "Ask for thyself a sign
   from the Lord thy God in the depth or in the height." [5563]   For,
   unless there had been some signs in the depth or in the height which
   were not from the Lord God, this would not have been said, "Ask for
   thyself a sign from the Lord thy God in the depth or in the height."
   But I know well that such an interpretation of the passage, "Ask for
   thyself a sign from the Lord thy God," will seem to some one rather
   forced; but give heed to that which is said by the Apostle about the
   man of sin, the son of perdition, that, "with all power and signs and
   lying wonders and with all deceit of unrighteousness," [5564] he shall
   be manifested to them that are perishing, imitating all kinds of
   wonders, to-wit, those of truth.  And as the enchanters and magicians
   of the Egyptians, as being inferior to the man of sin and the son of
   perdition, imitated certain powers, both the signs and wonders of
   truth, doing lying wonders so that the true might not be believed; so I
   think the man of sin will imitate signs and powers.  And perhaps, also,
   the Pharisees suspected these things because of the prophecies
   concerning Him; but I inquire whether also the Sadducees tempting Him
   asked Jesus to show them a sign from heaven.  For unless we say that
   they suspected this, how shall we describe their relation to the
   portents which Jesus wrought, who continued hard-hearted and were not
   put to shame by the miraculous things that were done?  But if any one
   supposes that we have given an occasion of defence to the Pharisees and
   Sadducees, both when they say that the demons were cast out by Jesus
   through Beelzebub, and when tempting Him, they ask Jesus about a
   heavenly sign, let him know that we plausibly say that they were drawn
   away to the end that they might not believe in the miracles of Jesus;
   but not as to deserve forgiveness; for they did not look to the words
   of the prophets which were being fulfilled in the acts of Jesus, which
   an evil power was not at all capable of imitating.  But to bring back a
   soul which had gone out, so that it came out of the grave when already
   stinking and passing the fourth day, [5565] was the work of no other
   than Him who heard the word of the Father, "Let us make man after our
   image and likeness." [5566]   But also to command the winds and to make
   the violence of the sea cease at a word, was the work of no other than
   Him through whom all things, both the sea itself and the winds, have
   come into being.  Moreover also as to the teaching which stimulates men
   to the love of the Creator, in harmony with the law and the prophets,
   and which checks passions and moulds morals according to piety, what
   else did it indicate to such as were able to see, than that He was
   truly the Son of God who wrought works so mighty?  In respect of which
   things He said also to the disciples of John, "Go your way and tell
   John what great things ye see and hear; the blind receive their sight,"
   etc. [5567]

   3.  The Answer of Jesus to Their Request.

   Next let us remark in what way, when asked in regard to one sign, that
   He might show it from heaven, to the Pharisees and Sadducees who put
   the question, He answers and says, "An evil and adulterous generation
   seeketh after a sign, and there shall be no sign given to it, but the
   sign of Jonah the prophet, " when also, "He left them and departed."
   [5568]   But the sign of Jonah, in truth, according to their question,
   was not merely a sign but also a sign from heaven; so that even to
   those who tempted Him and sought a sign from heaven He, nevertheless,
   out of His own great goodness gave the sign.  For if, as Jonah passed
   three days and three nights in the whale's belly, so the Son of man did
   in the heart of the earth, and after this rose up from it,--whence but
   from heaven shall we say that the sign of the resurrection of Christ
   came?  And especially when, at the time of the passion, He became a
   sign to the robber who obtained favour from Him to enter into the
   paradise of God; after this, I think, descending into Hades to the
   dead, "as free among the dead." [5569]   And the Saviour seems to me to
   conjoin the sign which was to come from Himself with the reason of the
   sign in regard to Jonah when He says, not merely that a sign like to
   that is granted by Him but that very sign; for attend to the words,
   "And there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Jonah the
   prophet." [5570]   Accordingly that sign was this sign, because that
   became indicative of this, so that the elucidation of that sign, which
   was obscure on the face of it, might be found in the fact that the
   Saviour suffered, and passed three days and three nights in the heart
   of the earth.  At the same time also we learn the general principle
   that, if the sign signifies something, each of the signs which are
   recorded, whether as in actual history, or by way of precept, is
   indicative of something afterwards fulfilled; as for example, the sign
   of Jonah going out after three days from the whale's belly was
   indicative of the resurrection of our Saviour, rising after three days
   and three nights from the dead; and that which is called circumcision
   is the sign of that which is indicated by Paul in the words:  "We are
   the circumcision." [5571]   Seek you also every sign in the Old
   Scriptures as indicative of some passage in the New Scripture, and that
   which is named a sign in the New Covenant as indicative of something
   either in the age about to be, or even in the subsequent generations
   after that the sign has taken place.

   4.  Why Jesus Called Them an Adulterous Generation.  The Law as
   Husband.

   And He called them, indeed, "an evil generation," because of the
   quality arising from evil which had been produced in them, for
   wickedness is voluntary evil-doing, but "adulterous" because that when
   the Pharisees and Sadducees left that which is figuratively called man,
   the word of truth or the law, they were debauched by falsehood and the
   law of sin.  For if there are two laws, the law in our members warring
   against the law of the mind, and the law of the mind, [5572] we must
   say that the law of the mind--that is, the spiritual--is man, to whom
   the soul was given by God as wife, that is, to the man who is law,
   according to what is written, "A wife is married to a man by God;"
   [5573] but the other is a paramour of the soul which is subject to it,
   which also on account of it is called an adulteress.  Now that the law
   is husband of the soul Paul clearly exhibits in the Epistle to the
   Romans, saying, "The law hath dominion over a man for so long time as
   he liveth; for the woman that hath a husband is bound to the husband
   while he liveth, to the husband who is law," [5574] etc.  For consider
   in these things that the law hath dominion over the man so long time as
   the law liveth,--as a husband over a wife.  "For the woman that hath a
   husband," that is, the soul under the law, "is bound to the husband
   while he liveth," to the husband who is the law; but if the
   husband--that is, the law die--she is discharged from the law, which is
   her husband.  Now the law dies to him who has gone up to the condition
   of blessedness, and no longer lives under the law, but acts like to
   Christ, who, though He became under law for the sake of those under
   law, that He might gain those under law, [5575] did not continue under
   law, nor did He leave subject to law those who had been freed by Him;
   for He led them up along with Himself to the divine citizenship which
   is above the law, which contains, as for the imperfect and such as are
   still sinners, sacrifices for the remission of sins.  He then who is
   without sin, and stands no longer in need of legal sacrifices, perhaps
   when he has become perfect has passed beyond even the spiritual law,
   and comes to the Word beyond it, who became flesh to those who live in
   the flesh, but to those who no longer at all war after the flesh, He is
   perceived as being the Word, as [5576] He was God in the beginning with
   God, and reveals the Father.  Three things therefore are to be thought
   of in connection with this place--the woman that hath a husband, who is
   under a husband--the law; and the woman who is an adulteress, to-wit,
   the soul, which, while her husband, the law, liveth, has become joined
   to another husband, namely, the law of the flesh; and the woman who is
   married to the brother of the dead husband, to the Word who is alive
   and dies not, who "being raised from the dead dieth no more, for death
   hath no more dominion over Him." [5577]   So far then because of the
   saying, "But if the husband die she is discharged from the law, the
   husband," and because of this, "so then, while her husband liveth, she
   shall be called an adulteress, if she be joined to another man," and
   because of this, "but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so
   that she is no adulteress though she be joined to another man." [5578]
     But this very saying, "So then while her husband liveth, she shall be
   called an adulteress," we have brought forward, wishing clearly to show
   why in answer to the Pharisees and Sadducees who were tempting Him and
   asking Him to show them a sign from heaven, He said not only "a wicked
   generation," but an "adulterous" generation. [5579]   In a general way,
   then, the law in the members which wars against the law of the mind,
   [5580] as a man who is an adulterer, is an adulterer of the soul.  But
   now also every power that is hostile, which gains the mastery over the
   human soul, and has intercourse with it, commits adultery with her who
   had a bridegroom given to her by God, namely, the Word.  After these
   things it is written that "He left them and departed."  For how was the
   bridegroom--the Word--not going to leave the adulterous generation and
   depart from it?  But you might say that the Word of God, leaving the
   synagogue of the Jews as adulterous, departed from it, and took a wife
   of fornication, [5581] namely, those from the Gentiles; since those who
   were "Sion, a faithful city," [5582] have become harlots; but these
   have become like the harlot Rahab, who received the spies of Joshua,
   and was saved with all her house; [5583] after this no longer playing
   the harlot, but coming to the feet of Jesus, and wetting them with the
   tears of repentance, and anointing them with the fragrance of the
   ointment of holy conversation, on account of whom, reproaching Simon
   the leper,--the former people,--He spoke those things which are
   written. [5584]

   5.  Concerning the Leaven of the Pharisees.

   "And His disciples came to the other side and forgot to take loaves."
   [5585]   Since the loaves which they had before they came to the other
   side were no longer useful to the disciples when they came to the other
   side, for they needed one kind of loaves before they crossed and a
   different kind when they crossed,--on this account, being careless of
   taking loaves when going to the other side, they forgot to take loaves
   with them.  To the other side then came the disciples of Jesus who had
   passed over from things material to things spiritual, and from things
   sensible to those which are intellectual.  And perhaps that He might
   turn back those who, by crossing to the other side, "had begun in
   spirit," [5586] from running back to carnal things, Jesus said to them
   when on the other side, "Take heed and beware." [5587]   For there was
   a certain lump of teaching and of truly ancient leaven,--that according
   to the bare letter, and on this account not freed from those things
   which arise from wickedness,--which the Pharisees and Sadducees
   offered, of which Jesus does not wish His own disciples any longer to
   eat, having made for them a new and spiritual lump, offering Himself to
   those who gave up the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees and had
   come to Him--"the living bread which came down from heaven and gives
   life to the world." [5588]   But since, to him who is no longer going
   to use the leaven and the lump and the teaching of the Pharisees and
   the Sadducees, the first thing is to "see" and then to "beware," so
   that no one, by reason of not seeing and from want of taking heed, may
   ever partake of their forbidden leaven,--on this account He says to the
   disciples, first, "see," and then, "beware."  It is the mark of the
   clear-sighted and careful to separate the leaven of the Pharisees and
   Sadducees and every food that is not of "the unleavened-bread of
   sincerity and truth" [5589] from the living bread, even that which came
   down from heaven, so that no one who eats may adopt the things of the
   Pharisees and the Sadducees, but by eating the living and true bread
   may strengthen his soul.  And we might seasonably apply the saying to
   those who, along with the Christian way of life, prefer to live as the
   Jews, materially, for these do not see nor beware of the leaven of the
   Pharisees and Sadducees, but, contrary to the will of Jesus who forbade
   it, eat the bread of the Pharisees.  Yea and also all, who do not wish
   to understand that the law is spiritual, and has a shadow of the good
   things to come, [5590] and is a shadow of the things to come, [5591]
   neither inquire of what good thing about to be each of the laws is a
   shadow, nor do they see nor beware of the leaven of the Pharisees; and
   they also who reject the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead are
   not on their guard against the leaven of the Sadducees.  And there are
   many among the heterodox who, because of their unbelief in regard to
   the resurrection of the dead, are imbued with the leaven of the
   Sadducees.  Now, while Jesus said these things, the disciples reasoned,
   saying not aloud, but in their own hearts, "We took no loaves." [5592]
     And something like this was what they said, "If we had loaves we
   would not have had to take of the leaven of the Pharisees and the
   Sadducees; but since, from want of loaves, we run the risk of taking
   from their leaven, while the Saviour does not wish us to run back to
   their teaching, therefore He said to us, "Take heed and beware of the
   leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."" [5593]   And these things
   then they reasoned; Jesus, while looking to that which was in their
   hearts, and hearing the reasons in them, as the true overseer of
   hearts, reproves them because they did not see nor remember the loaves
   which they received from Him; on account of which, even when they
   appeared to be in want of loaves, they did not need the leaven of the
   Pharisees and the Sadducees.

   6.  The Meaning of Leaven.  Jesus' Knowledge of the Heart.

   Then expounding clearly and representing to them, who were being
   distracted because of the equivocal meaning of loaf and leaven, in an
   undisguised fashion, that He was not speaking to them about sensible
   bread but about the leaven in the teaching, He subjoins, "How is it
   that ye do not perceive that I spake not you concerning bread?  But
   beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees." [5594]   And
   though He had not laid bare the interpretation, but still continued to
   use metaphorical language, the disciples would have understood that the
   discourse of the Saviour was about the teaching, figuratively called
   leaven, which the Pharisees and Sadducees were teaching.  So long,
   then, as we have Jesus with us fulfilling the promise which runs, "Lo,
   I am with you always unto the consummation of the age," [5595] we
   cannot fast nor be in want of food, so that, because of want of it we
   should desire to take and eat the forbidden leaven, even from the
   Pharisees and Sadducees.  Now there may sometimes be a time, when He is
   with us, that we are without food, as is spoken of in the passage
   above, "They continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat;"
   [5596] but, even though this should happen, being unwilling to send us
   away fasting lest we faint on the way, He gives thanks over the loaves
   which were with the disciples, and causes us to have the seven baskets
   over from the seven loaves, as we have recorded.  And moreover this
   also is to be observed, in view of those who think that the divinity of
   the Saviour is not at all demonstrable from the Gospel of Matthew, that
   the fact that, when the disciples were reasoning among themselves and
   saying, "We have no loaves," Jesus knew their reasonings and said, "Why
   reason ye among yourselves, O ye of little faith, because ye took no
   loaves," [5597] was beyond the power of man; for the Lord alone, as
   Solomon says in the third Book of Kings, knows the hearts of men.
   [5598]   But since the disciples understood, when Jesus said, "Beware
   of the leaven," [5599] that He did not tell them to beware of the
   loaves but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees, you will
   understand that whenever leaven is named it is put figuratively for
   teaching, whether in the law, or in the Scriptures which come after the
   law; and so perhaps leaven is not offered upon the altar; for it is not
   right that prayers should take the form of teaching, but should only be
   supplications of good things from God.  But one might inquire, on
   account of what has been said about disciples who came to the other
   side, if any one who has reached the other side can be reproached as
   one of little faith, and as not yet understanding nor remembering what
   was done by Jesus.  But it is not difficult, I think, to say to this,
   that in relation to that which is perfect, on the coming of which "that
   which is in part shall be done away," [5600] all our faith here is
   little faith, and in regard to that, we who know in part do not yet
   know nor remember; for we are not able to obtain a memory which is
   sufficient and able to attain to the magnitude of the nature of the
   speculations.

   7.  Relative Magnitude of Sins of the Heart and Actual Sins.

   But we may also learn from this, that in respect of the reasonings only
   which we reason within ourselves, we are sometimes convicted and
   reproached as being of little faith.  And I think that just as a man
   commits adultery in his heart only, though not proceeding altogether to
   the overt act, so he commits in his heart the rest of the things which
   are forbidden.  As then he who has committed adultery in his heart will
   be punished proportionately to adultery of this kind, so also he who
   has done in his heart any one of the things forbidden, for example, who
   has stolen in his heart only, or borne false witness in his heart only,
   will not be punished as he who has stolen in fact, or who has completed
   the very act of false testimony, but only as he who has done such
   things in his heart.  There is also the case of the man who while he
   did not arrive at the evil action, came short of it in spite of his own
   will.  For if, in addition to willing it, he has attempted it, but not
   carried it out, he will be punished not as one who has sinned in his
   heart alone but in deed.  To questions of this sort one might ask,
   whether any one commits adultery in his heart, even if he does not do
   the deed of adultery, but lacks self-control in heart only.  And the
   like also you will say concerning the rest of things which are
   deserving of praise.  But the passage possibly contains a plausible
   fallacy which must be cleared away, I think, in this manner:  adultery
   which takes place in the heart is a less sin, than if one were also to
   add to it the act.  But it is impossible that there can be chastity in
   the heart, hindering the chaste action--unless indeed one brings
   forward for an illustration of this the case of the virgin who
   according to the law was violated in solitude; [5601] for it may be
   granted that the heart of any one may be most pure, [5602] but that
   force in a matter of licentiousness has caused the corruption of the
   body of her who was chaste.  In truth she seems to me to be altogether
   chaste in secret heart, but no longer to be pure in body such as she
   was before the act of violence; but though she is not pure outwardly,
   is she therefore now also unchaste?  I have said these things because
   of the words, "They reasoned among themselves saying, We took no
   loaves," to which is added, "And Jesus perceiving it, said, O ye of
   little faith, why reason ye among yourselves," [5603] etc.; for it was
   necessary that investigation should be made in regard to the censure of
   things in secret and correlatively to the praise of things in secret.

   8.  The Leaven Figurative Like the Water Spoken of by Jesus to the
   Woman of Samaria.

   But I wonder if the disciples thought, before the saying was explained
   to them by Jesus, that their Teacher and Lord was forbidding them to
   beware of the sensible leaven of the Pharisees or the Sadducees as
   impure, and on this account forbidden, lest they might use that leaven
   because they had not taken loaves.  And we might make a like inquiry in
   regard to other things; but by-way of illustration the narrative about
   the woman of Samaria sufficeth, "Every one that drinketh of this water
   shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall
   give him shall never thirst." [5604]   For there, also, so far as the
   mere form of expression is concerned, the Samaritan woman would seem to
   have thought that the Saviour was giving a promise about sensible
   water, when He said, "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give
   him shall never thirst."  And those things then must be figuratively
   interpreted, and we must examine and compare the water of the spring of
   Jacob from which the woman of Samaria drew water with the water of
   Jesus; and here the like must be done; for perhaps the loaves were not
   baked, but a kind of raw leaven solely, the teaching, namely, of the
   Pharisees and Sadducees.

   9.  Concerning the Question of Jesus in Cæsarea, Who Do Men Say that I
   Am?  Different Conceptions of Jesus.

   "Now when Jesus came into the parts of Cæsarea Philippi, He asked His
   disciples." [5605]   Jesus inquires of the disciples, "Who do men say
   that I am," that we may learn from the answer of the Apostles the
   different conceptions then held among the Jews in regard to our
   Saviour; and perhaps also that the disciples of Jesus might learn to be
   interested in knowing what is said by men about them; [5606] because
   that will be an advantage to them who do it, by cutting off in every
   way occasions of evil if anything evil is spoken of, and by increasing
   the incitements to good, if anything good is spoken of.  Only, observe
   how, on account of the different movements of opinion among the Jews
   about Jesus, some, under the influence of unsound theories, said that
   He was John the Baptist, like Herod the tetrarch who said to his
   servants, "This is John the Baptist, he is risen from the dead, and
   therefore do the powers work in him;" [5607] but others that He who was
   now called Jesus was Elijah, either having been born a second time, or
   living from that time in the flesh, and appearing at the present time.
   But those who said that Jesus was Jeremiah, and not that Jeremiah was a
   type of the Christ, were perhaps influenced by what is said in the
   beginning of Jeremiah about Christ, which was not fulfilled in the
   prophet at that time, but was beginning to be fulfilled in Jesus, whom
   "God set up over nations and kingdoms to root up, and to break down,
   and to destroy, and to build up, and to transplant," [5608] having made
   Him to be a prophet to the Gentiles to whom He proclaimed the word.
   Moreover also those who said, "that he was a certain one of the
   prophets," [5609] conceived this opinion concerning Him because of
   those things which had been said in the prophets as unto them, but
   which had not been fulfilled in their case.  But also the Jews, as
   worthy of the veil which was upon their heart, held false opinions
   concerning Jesus; while Peter as not a disciple "of flesh and blood,"
   [5610] but as one fit to receive the revelation of the Father in
   heaven, confessed that He was the Christ.  The saying of Peter to the
   Saviour, "Thou art the Christ," when the Jews did not know that He was
   Christ, was indeed a great thing, but greater that he knew Him not only
   to be Christ, but also "the Son of the living God," [5611] who had also
   said through the prophets, "I live," [5612] and "They have forsaken Me
   the spring of living water;" [5613] --and He is life also, as from the
   Father the spring of life, who said, "I am the Life;" [5614] and
   consider carefully, whether, as the spring of the river is not the same
   thing as the river, the spring of life is not the same as life.  And
   these things we have added because to the saying, "Thou art the Christ,
   the Son of God," was subjoined the word "living;" [5615] for it was
   necessary to set forth something noteworthy in regard to that which is
   said about God and the Father of all things as living, both in relation
   to His absolute life, and in relation to those things which participate
   in it.  But since we said that they were under the influence of unsound
   opinions who declared that Jesus was John the Baptist, or any one of
   those named, in saying this let us prove that if they had fallen in
   with Jesus as He was going away to John for baptism, or with John when
   he was baptizing Jesus, or if they had heard it from any one, they
   would not have said that Jesus was John.  But also if they had
   understood the opinions under the influence of which Jesus said, "If ye
   are willing to receive it, this is Elijah which is to come," [5616] and
   had heard what was said, as men having ears, some would not have said
   that He was Elijah.  And if those who said that He was Jeremiah had
   perceived that the most of the prophets took upon themselves certain
   features that were symbolical of Him, they would not have said that He
   was Jeremiah; and in like manner the others would not have said that He
   was one of the prophets.

   10.  The Answer of Peter.

   And perhaps that which Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the
   Christ, the Son of the living God," [5617] if we say it as Peter, not
   by flesh and blood revealing it unto us, but by the light from the
   Father in heaven shining in our heart, we too become as Peter, being
   pronounced blessed as he was, because that the grounds on which he was
   pronounced blessed apply also to us, by reason of the fact that flesh
   and blood have not revealed to us with regard to Jesus that He is
   Christ, the Son of the living God, but the Father in heaven, from the
   very heavens, that our citizenship may be in heaven, [5618] revealing
   to us the revelation which carries up to heaven those who take away
   every veil from the heart, and receive "the spirit of the wisdom and
   revelation" of God. [5619]   And if we too have said like Peter, "Thou
   art the Christ, the Son of the living God," not as if flesh and blood
   had revealed it unto us, but by light from the Father in heaven having
   shone in our heart, we become a Peter, and to us there might be said by
   the Word, "Thou art Peter," etc. [5620]   For a rock [5621] is every
   disciple of Christ of whom those drank who drank of the spiritual rock
   which followed them, [5622] and upon every such rock is built every
   word of the church, and the polity in accordance with it; for in each
   of the perfect, who have the combination of words and deeds and
   thoughts which fill up the blessedness, is the church built by God.

   11.  The Promise Given to Peter Not Restricted to Him, But Applicable
   to All Disciples Like Him.

   But if you suppose that upon that one Peter only the whole church is
   built by God, what would you say about John the son of thunder or each
   one of the Apostles?  Shall we otherwise dare to say, that against
   Peter in particular the gates of Hades shall not prevail, but that they
   shall prevail against the other Apostles and the perfect?  Does not the
   saying previously made, "The gates of Hades shall not prevail against
   it," [5623] hold in regard to all and in the case of each of them?  And
   also the saying, "Upon this rock I will build My church"? [5624]   Are
   the keys of the kingdom of heaven given by the Lord to Peter only, and
   will no other of the blessed receive them?  But if this promise, "I
   will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven," [5625] be
   common to the others, how shall not all the things previously spoken
   of, and the things which are subjoined as having been addressed to
   Peter, be common to them?  For in this place these words seem to be
   addressed as to Peter only, "Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall
   be bound in heaven," [5626] etc.; but in the Gospel of John the Saviour
   having given the Holy Spirit unto the disciples by breathing upon them
   said, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit," [5627] etc.  Many then will say to
   the Saviour, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;" but not
   all who say this will say it to Him, as not at all having learned it by
   the revelation of flesh and blood but by the Father in heaven Himself
   taking away the veil that lay upon their heart, in order that after
   this "with unveiled face reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord"
   [5628] they may speak through the Spirit of God saying concerning Him,
   "Lord Jesus," and to Him, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
   God." [5629]   And if any one says this to Him, not by flesh and blood
   revealing it unto Him but through the Father in heaven, he will obtain
   the things that were spoken according to the letter of the Gospel to
   that Peter, but, as the spirit of the Gospel teaches, to every one who
   becomes such as that Peter was.  For all bear the surname of "rock" who
   are the imitators of Christ, that is, of the spiritual rock which
   followed those who are being saved, [5630] that they may drink from it
   the spiritual draught.  But these bear the surname of the rock just as
   Christ does.  But also as members of Christ deriving their surname from
   Him they are called Christians, and from the rock, Peters.  And taking
   occasion from these things you will say that the righteous bear the
   surname of Christ who is Righteousness, and the wise of Christ who is
   Wisdom. [5631]   And so in regard to all His other names, you will
   apply them by way of surname to the saints; and to all such the saying
   of the Saviour might be spoken, "Thou art Peter," etc., down to the
   words, "prevail against it."  But what is the "it"?  Is it the rock
   upon which Christ builds the church, or is it the church?  For the
   phrase is ambiguous.  Or is it as if the rock and the church were one
   and the same?  This I think to be true; for neither against the rock on
   which Christ builds the church, nor against the church will the gates
   of Hades prevail; just as the way of a serpent upon a rock, according
   to what is written in the Proverbs, [5632] cannot be found.  Now, if
   the gates of Hades prevail against any one, such an one cannot be a
   rock upon which Christ builds the church, nor the church built by Jesus
   upon the rock; for the rock is inaccessible to the serpent, and it is
   stronger than the gates of Hades which are opposing it, so that because
   of its strength the gates of Hades do not prevail against it; but the
   church, as a building of Christ who built His own house wisely upon the
   rock, [5633] is incapable of admitting the gates of Hades which prevail
   against every man who is outside the rock and the church, but have no
   power against it.

   12.  Every Sin--Every False Doctrine is a "Gate of Hades."

   But when we have understood how each of the sins through which there is
   a way to Hades [5634] is a gate of Hades, we shall apprehend that the
   soul, which has "spot or wrinkle or any such thing," [5635] and because
   of wickedness is neither holy nor blameless, is neither a rock upon
   which Christ builds, nor a church, nor part of a church which Christ
   builds upon the rock.  But if any one wishes to put us [5636] to shame
   in regard to these things because of the great majority of those of the
   church who are thought to believe, it must be said to him not only
   "Many are called, but few chosen;" [5637] but also that which was said
   by the Saviour to those who come to Him, as it is recorded in Luke in
   these words, "Strive to enter in by the narrow door, for many, I say
   unto you, shall seek to enter in through the narrow door and shall not
   be able;" [5638] and also that which is written in the Gospel of
   Matthew thus, "For narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that
   leadeth unto life, and few be they that find it." [5639]   Now, if you
   attend to the saying, "Many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in and
   shall not be able," [5640] you will understand that this refers to
   those who boast that they are of the church, but live weakly and
   contrary to the word.  Of those, then, who seek to enter in, those who
   are not able to enter will not be able to do so, because the gates of
   Hades prevail against them; but in the case of those against whom the
   gates of Hades will not prevail, those seeking to enter in will be
   strong, being able to do all things, in Christ Jesus, who strengtheneth
   them. [5641]   And in like manner each one of those who are the authors
   of any evil opinion has become the architect of a certain gate of
   Hades; but those who co-operate with the teaching of the architect of
   such things are servants and stewards, who are the bond-servants of the
   evil doctrine which goes to build up impiety.  And though the gates of
   Hades are many and almost innumerable, no gate of Hades will prevail
   against the rock or against the church which Christ builds upon it.
   Notwithstanding, these gates have a certain power by which they gain
   the mastery over some who do not resist and strive against them; but
   they are overcome by others who, because they do not turn aside from
   Him who said, "I am the door," [5642] have rased from their soul all
   the gates of Hades.  And this also we must know that as the gates of
   cities have each their own names, in the same way the gates of Hades
   might be named after the species of sins; so that one gate of Hades is
   called "fornication," through which fornicators go, and another
   "denial," through which the deniers of God go down into Hades.  And
   likewise already each of the heterodox and of those who have begotten
   any "knowledge which is falsely so called," [5643] has built a gate of
   Hades--Marcion one gate, and Basilides another, and Valentinus another.

   13.  The "Gates of Hades" And the "Gates of Zion" Contrasted.

   In this place, then, the gates of Hades are spoken of; but in the
   Psalms the prophet gives thanks saying, "He who lifteth me up from the
   gates of death that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the
   daughter of Zion." [5644]   And from this we learn that it is never
   possible for any one to be fit to declare the praises of God, unless he
   has been lifted up from the gates of death, and has come to the gates
   of Zion.  Now the gates of Zion may be conceived as opposed to the
   gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, dissoluteness, but
   a gate of Zion, self-control; and so a gate of death, unrighteousness,
   but a gate of Zion, righteousness, which the prophet shows forth
   saying, "This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter into
   it." [5645]   And again there is cowardice, a gate of death, but manly
   courage, a gate of Zion; and want of prudence, a gate of death, but its
   opposite, prudence, a gate of Zion.  But to all the gates of the
   "knowledge which is falsely so called" [5646] one gate is opposed, the
   gate of knowledge which is free from falsehood.  But consider if,
   because of the saying , "our wrestling is not against flesh and blood,"
   [5647] etc., you can say that each power and world-ruler of this
   darkness, and each one of the "spiritual hosts of wickedness in the
   heavenly places" [5648] is a gate of Hades and a gate of death.  Let,
   then, the principalities and powers with which our wrestling is, be
   called gates of Hades, but the "ministering spirits" [5649] gates of
   righteousness.  But as in the case of the better things many gates are
   first spoken of, and after the gates, one, in the passage, "Open to me
   the gates of righteousness, I will enter into them, and will make full
   confession to the Lord," and "this is the gate of the Lord, by it the
   righteous shall enter;" [5650] so also in the case of those gates which
   are opposed, many are the gates of Hades and death, each a power; but
   over all these the wicked one himself.  And let us take heed in regard
   to each sin, as if we were descending into some gate of death if we
   sin; but when we are lifted up from the gates of death let us declare
   all the praises of the Lord in the gates of the daughter of Zion; as,
   for example, in one gate of the daughter of Zion--that which is called
   self-control--we will declare by our self-control the praises of God;
   and in another which is called righteousness, by righteousness we will
   declare the praises of God; and, generally, in all things whatsoever of
   a praiseworthy character with which we are occupied, in these we are at
   some gate of the daughter of Zion, declaring at each gate some praise
   of God.  But we must make inquiry whether in one of the Twelve [5651]
   it is said, "They hated him that reproveth in the gates, and they
   loathed the holy word." [5652]   Perhaps, then, he who reproves in the
   gates is of the gates of the daughter of Zion, reproving those who are
   in sins which are opposed to this gate, even of the gates of Hades or
   death.  But if ye do not so understand the words, "They hated him that
   reproveth in the gates," either the expression "in the gates" will be
   held to be superfluous, or investigate how that which is said can be
   worthy of the prophetic spirit.

   14.  In What Sense the "Keys" Are Given to Peter, and Every Peter.
   Limitations of This Power.

   And after this let us see in what sense it is said to Peter, and to
   every Peter, "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven."
   [5653]   And, in the first place, I think that the saying, "I will give
   unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven," is spoken in consistency
   with the words, "The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it."
   [5654]   For he is worthy to receive from the same Word the keys of the
   kingdom of heaven, who is fortified against the gates of Hades so that
   they do not prevail against him, receiving, as it were, for a prize,
   the keys of the kingdom of heaven, because the gates of Hades had no
   power against him, that he might open for himself the gates that were
   closed to those who had been conquered by the gates of Hades.  And he
   enters in, as a temperate man, through an opened gate--the gate of
   temperance--by the key which opens temperance; and, as a righteous man,
   by another gate--the gate of righteousness--which is opened by the key
   of righteousness; and so with the rest of the virtues.  For I think
   that for every virtue of knowledge certain mysteries of wisdom
   corresponding to the species of the virtue are opened up to him who has
   lived according to virtue; the Saviour giving to those who are not
   mastered by the gates of Hades as many keys as there are virtues, which
   open gates equal in number, which correspond to each virtue according
   to the revelation of the mysteries.  And perhaps, also, each virtue is
   a kingdom of heaven, and all together are a kingdom of the heavens; so
   that according to this he is already in the kingdom of the heavens who
   lives according to the virtues, so that according to this the saying,
   "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand," [5655] is to be
   referred, not to the time, but to deeds and dispositions; for Christ,
   who is all virtue, has come, and speaks, and on account of this the
   kingdom of God is within His disciples, and not here or there. [5656]
   But consider how great power the rock has upon which the church is
   built by Christ, and how great power every one has who says, "Thou art
   the Christ, the Son of the living God," so that the judgments of this
   man abide sure, as if God were judging in him, that in the very act of
   judging the gates of Hades shall not prevail against him.  But when one
   judges unrighteously, and does not bind upon earth according to the
   Word of God, nor loose upon earth according to His will, the gates of
   Hades prevail against him; but, in the case of any one against whom the
   gates of Hades do not prevail, this man judges righteously.  Wherefore
   he has the keys of the kingdom of heaven, opening to those who have
   been loosed on earth that they may be also loosed in heaven, and free;
   and shutting to those who by his just judgment have been bound on earth
   that they also may be bound in heaven, and condemned.  But when those
   who maintain the function of the episcopate make use of this word as
   Peter, and, having received the keys of the kingdom of heaven from the
   Saviour, teach that things bound by them, that is to say, condemned,
   are also bound in heaven, and that those which have obtained remission
   by them are also loosed in heaven, we must say that they speak
   wholesomely if they have the way of life on account of which it was
   said to that Peter, "Thou art Peter;" [5657] and if they are such that
   upon them the church is built by Christ, and to them with good reason
   this could be referred; and the gates of Hades ought not to prevail
   against him when he wishes to bind and loose.  But if he is tightly
   bound with the cords of his sins, [5658] to no purpose does he bind and
   loose.  And perhaps you can say that in the heavens which are in the
   wise man--that, is the virtues,--the bad man is bound; and again in
   these the virtuous man is loosed, and has received an indemnity for the
   sins which he committed before his virtue.  But, as the man, who has
   not the cords of sins nor iniquities compared to a "long rope or to the
   strap of the yoke of a heifer," [5659] not even God could bind, in like
   manner, no Peter, whoever he may be; and if any one who is not a Peter,
   and does not possess the things here spoken of, imagines as a Peter
   that he will so bind on earth that the things bound are bound in
   heaven, and will so loose on earth that the things loosed are loosed in
   heaven, he is puffed up, not understanding the meaning of the
   Scriptures, and, being puffed up, has fallen into the ruin of the
   devil. [5660]

   15.  Relation of the Former Commission Given by Jesus to the Disciples,
   to His Present Injunction of Silence.  Belief and Knowledge Contrasted.

   "Then enjoined He His disciples that they should tell no man that He
   was the Christ." [5661]   It is written above that Jesus sent forth
   these twelve saying unto them, "Go not into any way of the Gentiles,"
   [5662] and the other words which are recorded to have been said to them
   when He sent them to the apostleship.  Did He then wish them when they
   were already discharging the function of Apostles to proclaim that He
   was the Christ?  For, if He wished it, it is fitting to inquire why He
   now at all commands the disciples that they should not say that He was
   the Christ?  Or if He did not wish it, how can the things concerning
   the apostleship be safely maintained?  And these things also one may
   inquire at this place,--whether, when He sent away the Twelve, He did
   not send them away with the understanding that He was the Christ?  But
   if the Twelve had such understanding, manifestly Peter had it also;
   how, then, is he now pronounced blessed?  For the expression here
   plainly indicates that now for the first time Peter confessed that
   Christ was the Son of the living God.  Matthew then, according to some
   of the manuscripts, has written, "Then He commanded His disciples that
   they should tell no man that He was the Christ," but [5663] Mark says,
   "He charged them that they should tell no man of Him;" [5664] and Luke,
   "He charged them and commanded them to tell this to no man." [5665]
   But what is the "this"?  Was it that also according to him, Peter
   answered and said to the question, "Who say ye that I am."--"The
   Christ, the Son of the living God?" [5666]   You must know, however,
   that some manuscripts of the Gospel according to Matthew have, "He
   charged." [5667]   The difficulty thus started seems to me a very real
   difficulty; but let a solution which cannot be impugned be sought out,
   and let the finder of it bring it forward before all, if it be more
   credible than that which shall be advanced by us as a fairly temperate
   view. [5668]   Consider, then, if you can say, that the belief that
   Jesus is the Christ is inferior to the knowledge of that which is
   believed.  And perhaps also there is a difference in the knowledge of
   Jesus as the Christ, as every one who knows does not know Him alike.
   From the words in John, "If ye abide in My word, ye shall know the
   truth, and the truth shall make you free," [5669] it is plain that
   belief without knowledge is inferior to knowing; but that there is a
   difference in the knowledge of Jesus as the Christ, as all who know Him
   do not know Him equally, is a fact self-evident to any one who gives
   even a very little consideration to the matter.  For who would not
   acknowledge, for example, that Timothy, though he knew that Jesus was
   the Christ, had not been enlightened to such an extent in the knowledge
   of Him as the Apostle had been enlightened?  And who would not also
   admit this--that though many, speaking the truth, say about God, "He
   has given to me a true knowledge of things that are," yet they will not
   say this with equal insight and apprehension of the things known, nor
   as knowing the same number of things?  But it is not only in respect of
   the difference of knowing that those who know do not know alike, but
   also according to that which is the source of the knowledge; so that
   according to this he who knows the Son by the revelation of the Father,
   [5670] as Peter is testified to have known, has the highest beatitude.
   Now, if these views of ours are sound, you will consider whether the
   Twelve formerly believed but did not know; but, after believing, they
   gained also the rudiments of knowledge and knew a few things about Him;
   and afterwards they continued to advance in knowledge so that they were
   able to receive the knowledge from the Father who reveals the Son; in
   which position Peter was, when he was pronounced blessed; for also he
   is pronounced blessed not merely because he said, "Thou art the
   Christ," but with the addition, "the Son of the living God."
   Accordingly Mark and Luke who have recorded that Peter answered and
   said, "Thou art the Christ," but have not given the addition found in
   Matthew, have not recorded that he was declared blessed for what had
   been said, nor the blessing which followed the declaration of
   blessedness, "Thou art Peter," [5671] etc.

   16.  Gradual Growth in Knowledge of the Disciples.

   But now we must first investigate the fact that they were declaring
   other things about Him as being great and wonderful, but did not yet
   proclaim that He was the Christ, lest the Saviour may not appear to
   take away from them the authority to announce that He was the Christ,
   which He had formerly bestowed upon them.  And perhaps some one will
   support an argument of this kind, saying that on their introduction
   into the school of Christ the Jews were taught by the disciples
   glorious things about Jesus, so that in due season there might be built
   upon these as a foundation the things about Jesus being the Christ; and
   perhaps many of the things which were said to them were said to all who
   virtually believed; for not to the Apostles alone did the saying apply,
   "Before governors and kings also shall ye be brought for My sake for a
   testimony to them and to the Gentiles;" [5672] and perhaps also not to
   the Apostles absolutely, but to all who were about to believe the word,
   "And brother shall deliver up brother to death," [5673] etc.; but,
   "Whosoever shall confess Me," [5674] etc., is said not specially to the
   Apostles, but also to all believers.  According to this, then, through
   that which was said to the Apostles an outline was given beforehand of
   the teaching which would afterwards come to be of service both to them
   and to every teacher.

   17.  Reasons for that Gradual Knowledge.

   And likewise he who holds that the fact that He was Christ had been
   formerly proclaimed by the Apostles when they heard the saying, "What I
   tell you in the darkness, speak ye in the light, and what ye hear in
   the ear proclaim on the housetops," [5675] will say, that He wished
   first to give catechetical instruction as it were to those of the
   Apostles who were to hear the name of Christ, then to permit this, so
   to speak, to be digested in the minds of the hearers, that, after there
   had been a period of silence in the proclamation of something of this
   kind about Him, at a more seasonable time there might be built up upon
   the former rudiments "Christ Jesus crucified and raised from the dead,"
   which at the beginning not even the Apostles knew; for it is written in
   the passage now under consideration, "From that time began Jesus to
   show unto His disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem" [5676] and
   suffer this and that.  But if now, for the first time, the Apostles
   learn from Jesus the things that were about to happen unto Him, namely,
   that the elders will plot against Him, and that He will be killed, and
   that after these things, on the third day, He will rise from the
   dead,--what necessity is there for supposing that those who had been
   taught by the Apostles concerning Jesus knew them before, or that
   although Christ was announced to them He was announced to them by way
   of an introduction which did not clearly elucidate the things
   concerning Him?  For our Saviour wished, when He enjoined the disciples
   to tell no man that He was the Christ, to reserve the more perfect
   teaching about Him to a more fitting time, when to those who had seen
   Him crucified, the disciples who had seen Him crucified and risen could
   testify the things relating to His resurrection.  For if the Apostles,
   who were always with Him and had seen all the wonderful things which He
   did, and who bore testimony to His words that they were words of
   eternal life, [5677] were offended on the night on which He was
   betrayed,--what do you suppose would have been the feelings of those
   who had formerly learned that He was the Christ?  To spare them, I
   think, He gave this command.

   18.  Jesus Was at First Proclaimed by the Twelve as a Worker and a
   Teacher Only.

   But he who holds that the things spoken to the Twelve refer to the
   times subsequent to this, and that the Apostles had not as yet
   announced to their hearers that He was the Christ, will say that He
   wished the conception of the Christ which was involved in the name of
   Jesus to be reserved for that preaching which was more perfect, and
   which brought salvation, such as Paul knew of when he said to the
   Corinthians, "I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus
   Christ and Him crucified." [5678]   Wherefore, formerly they proclaimed
   Jesus as the doer of certain things, and the teacher of certain things;
   but now when Peter confesses that He was the Christ, the Son of the
   living God, as He did not wish it to be proclaimed already that He was
   the Christ, in order that He might be proclaimed at a more suitable
   time, and that as crucified, He commands His disciples that they should
   tell no man that He was the Christ.  And that this was His meaning,
   when He forbade proclamation to be made that He was the Christ, is in a
   measure established by the words, "From that time began Jesus to show
   unto His disciples how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many
   things of the elders," and what is annexed; [5679] for then, at the
   fitting time, He proclaims, so to speak, to the disciples who knew that
   Jesus was Christ, the Son of the living God, the Father having revealed
   it to them, that instead of believing in Jesus Christ who had been
   crucified, they were to believe in Jesus Christ who was about to be
   crucified.  But also, instead of believing in Christ Jesus and Him
   risen from the dead, He teaches them to believe in Christ Jesus and Him
   about to be risen from the dead.  But since "having put off from
   Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them
   openly, triumphing over in the cross," [5680] if any one is ashamed of
   the cross of Christ, he is ashamed of the dispensation on account of
   which these powers were triumphed over; and it is fitting that he, who
   both believes and knows these things, should glory in the cross of our
   Lord Jesus Christ, [5681] through which, when Christ was crucified, the
   principalities--among which, I think, was also the prince of this
   world--were made a show of and triumphed over before the believing
   world.  Wherefore, when His suffering was at hand he said, "Now the
   prince of this world has been judged," [5682] and, "Now shall the
   prince of this world be cast out," and, "I, if I be lifted from the
   earth, will draw all men unto Myself;" [5683] as he no longer had
   sufficient power to prevent those going to Jesus who were being drawn
   by Him.

   19.  Importance of the Proclamation of Jesus as the Crucified.

   It is necessary, therefore, to the proclamation of Jesus as Christ,
   that He should be proclaimed as crucified; and the proclamation that
   Jesus was the Christ does not seem to me so defective when any of His
   other miracles is passed over in silence, as when the fact of His
   crucifixion is passed over.  Wherefore, reserving the more perfect
   proclamation of the things concerning Him by the Apostles, He commanded
   His disciples that they should tell no man that He was the Christ; and
   He prepared them to say that He was the Christ crucified and risen from
   the dead, "when He began" not only to say, nor even to advance to the
   point of teaching merely, but "to show" [5684] to His disciples that He
   must go to Jerusalem, etc.; for attend to the expression "show";
   because just as sensible things are said to be shown so the things
   spoken by Him to His disciples are said to be shown by Jesus.  And I do
   not think that each of the things seen was shown to those who saw Him
   suffering many things in body from the elders of the people, with such
   clearness as was the rational demonstration about Him to the disciples.

   20.  Why Jesus Had to Go to Jerusalem.

   "Then began He to show;" [5685] and probably afterwards when they were
   able to receive it He shewed more clearly, no longer beginning to show
   as to those who were learning the introduction, but already also
   advancing in the showing; and if it is reasonable to conceive that
   Jesus altogether completed what He began, then, some time, He
   altogether completed that which He began to show to His disciples about
   the necessity of His suffering the things which are written.  For, when
   any one apprehends from the Word the perfect knowledge of these things,
   then it must be said that, from a rational exhibition (the mind seeing
   the things which are shown,) the exhibition becomes complete for him
   who has the will and the power to contemplate these things, and does
   contemplate them.  But since "it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
   Jerusalem," [5686] --a perishing which corresponds to the words, "He
   that loseth his life for My sake shall find it," [5687] --on this
   account it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem, that having
   suffered many things in that Jerusalem, He might make "the
   first-fruits" [5688] of the resurrection from the dead in the Jerusalem
   above, doing away with and breaking up the city upon the earth with all
   the worship which was maintained in it.  For so long as Christ "had not
   been raised from the dead, the first-fruits of them that are asleep,"
   [5689] and those who become conformed to His death and resurrection had
   not yet been raised along with Him, the city of God was sought for
   below, and the temple, and the purifications, and the rest; but when
   this took place, no longer were the things below sought for, but the
   things above; and, in order that these might be set up, it was
   necessary that He should go unto the Jerusalem below, and there suffer
   many things from the elders in it, and the chief priests and scribes of
   the people, in order that He might be glorified by the heavenly elders
   who could receive his bounties, and by diviner high-priests who are
   ordained under the one High-Priest, and that He might be glorified by
   the scribes of the people who are occupied with letters "not written
   with ink" [5690] but made clear by the Spirit of the living God, and
   might be killed in the Jerusalem below, and having risen from the dead
   might reign in Mount Zion, and the city of the living God--the heavenly
   Jerusalem. [5691]   But on the third day He rose from the dead, [5692]
   in order that having delivered them from the wicked one, and his son,
   [5693] in whom was falsehood and unrighteousness and war and everything
   opposed to that which Christ is, and also from the profane spirit who
   transforms himself into the Holy Spirit, He might gain for those who
   had been delivered the right to be baptized in spirit and soul and
   body, into the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
   which represent the three days eternally present at the same time to
   those who by means of them are sons of light.

   21.  The Rebuke of Peter and the Answer of Jesus.

   "And Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be propitious
   to Thee.  Lord, this shall never be unto thee." [5694]   To whom He
   said, "Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art a stumbling-block unto Me;
   for thou mindest not the things of God but the things of men." [5695]
   Since Jesus had begun to show unto His disciples that He must go unto
   Jerusalem, and suffer many things, Peter up to this point learned the
   beginnings of those things which were shown. [5696]   But since he
   thought that the sufferings were unworthy of Christ the Son of the
   living God, and below the dignity of the Father who had revealed to him
   so great things about Christ,--for the things that concerned His coming
   suffering had not been revealed to him,--on this account he took Him,
   and as one forgetful of the honour due to the Christ, and that the Son
   of the living God neither does nor says anything worthy of rebuke, he
   began to rebuke Him; and as to one who needed propitiation,--for he did
   not yet know that "God had set Him forth to be a propitiation through
   faith in His blood," [5697] he said, "God be propitious to thee, O
   Lord." [5698]   Approving his purpose, indeed, but rebuking his
   ignorance, because of the purpose being right, He says to him, "Get
   thee behind Me," [5699] as to one who, by reason of the things of which
   he was ignorant and spake not rightly, had abandoned the following of
   Jesus; but because of his ignorance, as to one who had something
   antagonistic to the things of God, He said, "Satan," which in the
   Hebrew means "adversary."  But, if Peter had not spoken from ignorance,
   nor rebuked the Son of the living God, saying unto Him, "God be
   propitious to thee, Lord, this shall never be unto Thee," Christ would
   not have said to him, "Get thee behind Me," as to one who had given up
   being behind Him and following Him; nor would He have said as to one
   who had spoken things adverse to what He had said, "Satan."  But now
   Satan prevailed over him who had followed Jesus and was going behind
   Him, to turn aside from following Him and from being behind the Son of
   God, and to make him, by reason of the words which he spoke in
   ignorance, worthy of being called "Satan" and a stumbling-block to the
   Son of God, and "as not minding the things of God but the things of
   men."  But that Peter was formerly behind the Son of God, before he
   committed this sin, is manifest from the words, "Come ye behind Me, and
   I will make you fishers of men." [5700]

   22.  Importance of the Expressions "Behind" And "Turned."

   But you will compare together His saying to Peter, "Get thee behind me,
   Satan," [5701] with that said to the devil (who said to Him, "All these
   things will I give Thee if Thou wilt fall down and worship me"), [5702]
   "get thee hence," [5703] without the addition, "behind Me;" for to be
   behind Jesus is a good thing.  Wherefore it was said, "Come ye behind
   Me and I will make you fishers of men." [5704]   And to the same effect
   is the saying, "He that doth not take his cross and follow behind Me is
   not worthy of Me." [5705]  And as a general principle observe the
   expression "behind"; because it is a good thing when any one goes
   behind the Lord God and is behind the Christ; but it is the opposite
   when any one casts the words of God behind him, or when he transgresses
   the commandment which says, "Do not walk behind thy lusts." [5706]
   And Elijah also, in the third Book of Kings, says to the people, "How
   long halt ye on both your knees?  If God is the Lord, go behind Him,
   but if Baal is the Lord, go behind him." [5707]   And Jesus says this
   to Peter when He "turned," and He does so by way of conferring a
   favour.  And if therefore you will collect more illustrations of the
   "having turned," and especially those which are ascribed to Jesus, and
   compare them with one another, you would find that the expression is
   not superfluous.  But it is sufficient at present to bring forward this
   from the Gospel according to John, "Jesus turned and beheld
   them"--clearly, Peter and Andrew--"following, and saith unto them, What
   seek ye?" [5708]   For observe that, when He "turned," it is for the
   advantage of those to whom He turned.

   23.  Peter as a Stumbling-Block to Jesus.

   Next we must inquire how He said to Peter, "Thou art a stumbling-block
   unto Me," [5709] especially when David says, "Great peace have they
   that love Thy law, and there is no stumbling-block to them." [5710]
   For some one will say, if this is said in the prophet, because of the
   steadfastness of those who have love, and are incapable of being
   offended, for "love beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth
   all things, endureth all things, love never faileth," [5711] how did
   the Lord Himself, "who upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all that
   be bowed down," [5712] say to Peter, "Thou art a stumbling-block unto
   Me"?  But it must be said that not only the Saviour, but also he who is
   perfected in love, cannot be offended.  But, so far as it depends on
   himself, he who says or does such things is a stumbling-block even to
   him who will not be offended; unless perhaps Jesus calls the disciple
   who sinned a stumbling-block even to Himself, as much more than Paul He
   would have said from love, "Who is weak, and I am not weak?  Who is
   made to stumble, and I burn not?" [5713]   In harmony with which we may
   put, "Who is made to stumble, and I am not made to stumble?"  But if
   Peter, at that time because of the saying, "God be propitious to Thee,
   Lord, this shall not be unto Thee," [5714] was called a stumbling-block
   by Jesus, as not minding the things of God in what he said but the
   things of men, what is to be said about all those who profess to be
   made disciples of Jesus, but do not mind the things of God, and do not
   look to things unseen and eternal, but mind the things of man, and look
   to things seen and temporal, [5715] but that such still more would be
   stigmatized by Jesus as a stumbling-block to Him, and because
   stumbling-blocks to Him, as stumbling-blocks to His brethren also?  As
   in regard to them He says, "I was thirsty and ye gave Me no drink,"
   [5716] etc., so also He might say, "When I was running ye caused Me to
   stumble."  Let us not therefore suppose that it is a trivial sin to
   mind the things of men, since we ought in everything to mind the things
   of God.  And it will be appropriate also to say this to every one that
   has fallen away from the doctrines of God and the words of the church
   and a true mind; as, for example, to him who minds as true the teaching
   of Basilides, or Valentinus, or Marcion, or any one of those who teach
   the things of men as the things of God.

   24.  Self-Denial and Cross-Bearing.

   "Then Jesus said to His disciples, If any man wills to follow after
   Me," etc. [5717]   He shows by these words that, to will to come after
   Jesus and to follow Him, springs from no ordinary manly courage, and
   that no one who has not denied himself can come after Jesus.  And the
   man denies himself who wipes out by a striking revolution his own
   former life which had been spent in wickedness; as by way of
   illustration he who was once licentious denies his licentious self,
   having become self-controlled even abidingly.  But it is probable that
   some one may put the objection, whether as he denied himself so he also
   confesses himself, when he denied himself, the unjust, and confesses
   himself, the righteous one.  But, if Christ is righteousness, he who
   has received righteousness confesses not himself but Christ; so also he
   who has found wisdom, by the very possession of wisdom, confesses
   Christ.  And such a one indeed as, "with the heart believes unto
   righteousness, and with the mouth maketh confession unto salvation,"
   [5718] and bears testimony to the works of Christ, as making confession
   by all these things of Christ before men, will be confessed by Him
   before His Father in heaven. [5719]   So also he who has not denied
   himself but denied the Christ will experience the saying, "I also will
   deny him." [5720]   On this account let every thought and every purpose
   and every word and every action become a denial of ourselves, but a
   testimony about Christ and in Christ; for I am persuaded that every
   action of the perfect man is a testimony to Christ Jesus, and that
   abstinence from every sin is a denial of self, leading him after
   Christ.  And such an one is crucified with Christ, and taking up his
   own cross follows Him who for our sakes bears His own cross, according
   to that which is said in John:  "They took Jesus therefore and put it
   on Him," etc., down to the words, "Where they crucified Him." [5721]
   But the Jesus according to John, so to speak, bears the cross for
   Himself, and bearing it went out; but the Jesus according to Matthew
   and Mark and Luke, does not bear it for Himself, for Simon of Cyrene
   bears it. [5722]   And perhaps this man refers to us, who because of
   Jesus take up the cross of Jesus, but Jesus Himself takes it upon
   Himself; for there are, as it were, two conceptions of the cross, the
   one which Simon of Cyrene bears, and the other which Jesus Himself
   bears for Himself.

   25.  Reference to the Saying of Paul About Crucifixion with Christ.

   Moreover in regard to the saying, "Let him deny himself," [5723] the
   following saying of Paul who denied himself seems appropriate, "Yet I
   live, and yet no longer I but Christ liveth in me;" [5724] for the
   expression, "I live, yet no longer I," was the voice of one denying
   himself, as of one who had laid aside his own life and taken on himself
   the Christ, in order that He might live in him as Righteousness, and as
   Wisdom, and as Sanctification, and as our Peace, [5725] and as the
   Power of God, who worketh all things in him.  But further also, attend
   to this, that while there are many forms of dying, the Son of God was
   crucified, being hanged on a tree, in order that all who die unto sin
   may die to it, in no other way than by the way of the cross.  Wherefore
   they will say, "I have been crucified with Christ," and, "Far be it
   from me to glory save in the cross of the Lord, through which the world
   has been crucified unto me and I unto the world." [5726]   For perhaps
   also each of those who have been crucified with Christ puts off from
   himself the principalities and the powers, and makes a show of them and
   triumphs over them in the cross; [5727] or rather, Christ does these
   things in them.

   26.  The Less of Life; And the Saving of It.

   "For whosoever would save his own life shall lose it." [5728]   The
   first expression is ambiguous; for it may be understood in one way
   thus.  If any one as being a lover of life, and thinking that the
   present life is good, tends carefully his own life with a view to
   living in the flesh, being afraid to die, as through death going to
   lose it, this man, by the very willing to save in this way his own life
   will lose it, placing it outside of the borders of blessedness.  But if
   any one despising the present life because of my word, which has
   persuaded him to strive in regard to eternal life even unto death for
   truth, loses his own life, surrendering it for the sake of piety to
   that which is commonly called death, this man, as for my sake he has
   lost his life, will save it rather, and keep it in possession.  And
   according to a second way we might interpret the saying as follows.  If
   any one, who has grasped what salvation really is, wishes to procure
   the salvation of his own life, let this man having taken farewell of
   this life, and denied himself and taken up his own cross, and following
   me, lose his own life to the world; for having lost it for my sake and
   for the sake of all my teaching, he will gain the end of loss of this
   kind--salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [5728] Matt. xvi. 25.

   27.  Life Lost to the World is Saved.

   But at the same time also observe that at the beginning it is said,
   "Whosoever wills," but afterwards, "Whoso shall lose." [5729]   If we
   then wish it to be saved let us lose it to the world, as those who have
   been crucified with Christ and have for our glorying that which is in
   the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world is to be
   crucified unto us and we unto the world, [5730] that we may gain our
   end, even the salvation of our lives, which begins from the time when
   we lose it for the sake of the word.  But if we think that the
   salvation of our life is a blessed thing, with reference to the
   salvation which is in God and the blessednesses with Him, then any loss
   of life ought to be a good thing, and, for the sake of Christ must
   prove to be the prelude to the blessed salvation.  It seems to me,
   therefore, following the analogy of self-denial, according to what has
   been said, that each ought to lose his own life.  Let each one
   therefore lose his own sinning life, that having lost that which is
   sinful, he may receive that which is saved by right actions; but a man
   will in no way be profited if he shall gain the whole world.  Now he
   gains the world, I think, to whom the world is not crucified; and to
   whom the world is not crucified, to that man shall be the loss of his
   own life.  But when two things are put before us, either by gaining
   one's life to forfeit the world, or by gaining the world to forfeit
   one's life, much more desirable is the choice, that we should forfeit
   the world and gain our life by losing it on account of Christ.

   28.  The Exchange for One's Life.

   But the saying, "What shall a man give in exchange for his own life,"
   [5731] if spoken by way of interrogation, will seem to be able to
   indicate that an exchange for his own life is given by the man who
   after his sins has given up his whole substance, that his property may
   feed the poor, as if he were going by that to obtain salvation; but, if
   spoken affirmatively, I think, to indicate that there is not anything
   in man by the giving of which in exchange for his own life which has
   been overcome by death, he will ransom it out of its hand.  A man,
   therefore, could not give anything as an exchange for his own life, but
   God gave an exchange for the life of us all, "the precious blood of
   Christ Jesus," [5732] according as "we were bought with a price,"
   [5733] "having been redeemed, not with corruptible things as silver or
   gold, but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without
   spot," even of Christ. [5734]   And in Isaiah it is said to Israel, "I
   gave Ethiopia in exchange for thee, and Egypt and Syene for thee; from
   what time thou hast become honourable before Me thou wast glorified."
   [5735]   For the exchange, for example, of the first-born of Israel was
   the first-born of the Egyptians, and the exchange for Israel was the
   Egyptians who died in the last plagues that came upon Egypt, and in the
   drowning which took place after the plagues.  But, from these things,
   let him who is able inquire whether the exchange of the true Israel
   given by God, "who redeems Israel from all his transgressions," [5736]
   is the true Ethiopia, and, so to speak, spiritual Egypt, and Syene of
   Egypt; and to inquire with more boldness, perhaps Syene is the exchange
   for Jerusalem, and Egypt for Judæa, and Ethiopia for those who fear,
   who are different from Israel, and the house of Levi, and the house of
   Aaron.

   29.  The Coming of the Son of Man in Glory.

   "For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His own Father with His
   angels." [5737]   Now, indeed, the Son of man has not come in His
   glory; "for we saw Him, and He had no form nor beauty; but His form was
   dishonoured and defective compared with the sons of men; He was a man
   in affliction and toil, and acquainted with the enduring of sickness,
   because His face was turned away, He was dishonoured and not esteemed."
   [5738]   And it was necessary that He should come in such form that He
   might bear our sins [5739] and suffer pain for us; for it did not
   become Him in glory to bear our sins and suffer pain for us.  But He
   also comes in glory, having prepared [5740] the disciples through that
   epiphany of His which has no form nor beauty; and, having become as
   they that they might become as He, "conformed to the image of His
   glory," [5741] since He formerly became conformed to "the body of our
   humiliation," [5742] when He "emptied Himself and took upon Him the
   form of a servant," [5743] He is restored to the image of God and also
   makes them conformed unto it.

   30.  The Word Appears in Different Forms; The Time of His Coming in
   Glory.

   But if you will understand the differences of the Word which by "the
   foolishness of preaching" [5744] is proclaimed to those who believe,
   and spoken in wisdom to them that are perfect, you will see in what way
   the Word has the form of a slave to those who are learning the
   rudiments, so that they say, "We saw Him and He had no form or beauty."
   [5745]   But to the perfect He comes "in the glory of His own Father,"
   [5746] who might say, "and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the
   only-begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth." [5747]   For
   indeed to the perfect appears the glory of the Word, and the
   only-begotten of God His Father, and the fulness of grace and likewise
   of truth, which that man cannot perceive who requires the "foolishness
   of the preaching," in order to believe.  But "the Son of man shall come
   in the glory of His own Father" not alone, but "with His own angels."
   And if you can conceive of all those who are fellow-helpers in the
   glory of the Word, and in the revelation of the Wisdom which is Christ,
   coming along with Him, you will see in what way the Son of man comes in
   the glory of His own Father with His own angels.  And consider whether
   you can in this connection say that the prophets who formerly suffered
   in virtue of their word having "no form or beauty" had an analogous
   position to the Word who had "no form or beauty."  And, as the Son of
   man comes in the glory of His own Father, so the angels, who are the
   words in the prophets, are present with Him preserving the measure of
   their own glory.  But when the Word comes in such form with His own
   angels, He will give to each a part of His own glory and of the
   brightness of His own angels, according to the action of each.  But we
   say these things not rejecting even the second coming of the Son of God
   understood in its simpler form.  But when shall these things happen?
   Shall it be when that apostolic oracle is fulfilled which says, "For we
   must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may
   receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done,
   whether it be good or bad?" [5748]   But if He will render to each
   according to his deed, not the good deed only, nor the evil apart from
   the good, it is manifest that He will render to each according to every
   evil, and according to every good, deed.  But I suppose--in this also
   following the Apostle, but comparing also the sayings of Ezekiel, in
   which the sins of him who is a perfect convert are wiped out, and the
   former uprightness of him who has utterly fallen away is not held of
   account--that in the case of him who is perfected, and has altogether
   laid aside wickedness, the sins are wiped out, but that, in the case of
   him who has altogether revolted from piety, if anything good was
   formerly done by him, it is not taken into account. [5749]   But to us,
   who occupy a middle position between the perfect man and the apostate,
   when we stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, [5750] there is
   rendered what we have done, whether good or bad; for we have not been
   so pure that our evil deeds are not at all imputed unto us, nor have we
   fallen away to such an extent that our better actions are forgotten.

   31.  The Simpler Interpretation of the Promise About Not Tasting of
   Death.

   "Verily I say unto you there be some of them that stand here that shall
   not taste of death." [5751]   Some refer these things to the going
   up--six days after, or, as Luke says, [5752] eight days--of the three
   disciples into the high mountain with Jesus apart; and those who adopt
   this interpretation say that Peter and the remaining two did not taste
   of death before they saw the Son of man coming in His own kingdom and
   in His own glory.  For when they saw Jesus transfigured before them so
   that "His face shone," etc., "they saw the kingdom of God coming with
   power." [5753]   For even as some spear-bearers stand around a king, so
   Moses and Elijah appeared to those who had gone up into the mountains,
   talking with Jesus.  But it is worth while considering whether the
   sitting on the right hand and on the left hand of the Saviour in His
   kingdom refers to them, so that the words, "But for whom it is
   prepared," were [5754] spoken because of them.  Now this interpretation
   about the three Apostles not tasting of death until they have seen
   Jesus transfigured, is adapted to those who are designated by Peter as
   "new-born babes longing for the reasonable milk which is without
   guile," [5755] to whom Paul says, "I have fed you with milk, not with
   meat," [5756] etc.  Now, too, every interpretation of a text which is
   able to build up those who cannot receive greater truths might
   reasonably be called milk, flowing from the holy ground of the
   Scriptures, which flows with milk and honey.  But he who has been
   weaned, like Isaac, [5757] worthy of the good cheer and reception which
   Abraham gave at the weaning of his son, would seek here and in every
   Scripture food which is different, I think, from that which is meat,
   indeed, but is not solid food, and from what are figuratively called
   herbs, which are food to one who has been weaned and is not yet strong
   but weak, according to the saying, "He that is weak eateth herbs."
   [5758]   In like manner also he who has been weaned, like Samuel, and
   dedicated by his mother to God, [5759] --she was Hannah, which is, by
   interpretation, grace,--would be also a son of grace, seeking, like one
   nurtured in the temple, flesh of God, the holy food of those who are at
   once perfect and priests.

   32.  Standing by the Saviour.

   The reflections in regard to the passage before us that occur to us at
   the present time are these:  Some were standing where Jesus was, having
   the footsteps of the soul firmly planted with Jesus, and the standing
   of their feet was akin to the standing of which Moses said in the
   passage, "And I stood on the mountain forty days and forty nights,"
   [5760] who was deemed worthy to have it said to him by God who asked
   him to stand by Him, "But stand thou here with Me." [5761]   Those who
   really stand by Jesus--that is, by the Word of God--do not all stand
   equally; for among those who stand by Jesus are differences from each
   other.  Wherefore, not all who stand by the Saviour, but some of them
   as standing better, do not taste of death until they shall have seen
   the Word who dwelt with men, and on that account called Son of man,
   coming in His own kingdom; for Jesus does not always come in His own
   kingdom when He comes, since to the newly initiated He is such that
   they might say, beholding the Word Himself not glorious nor great, but
   inferior to many among them, "We saw Him, and He had no form or beauty,
   but His form was dishonoured, defective compared with all the sons of
   men." [5762]   And these things will be said by those who beheld His
   glory in connection with their own former times, when at first the Word
   as understood in the synagogue had no form nor beauty to them.  To the
   Word, therefore, who has assumed most manifestly the power above all
   words, there belongs a royal dignity which is visible to some of those
   who stand by Jesus, when they have been able to follow Him as He goes
   before them and ascends to the lofty mountain of His own
   manifestation.  And of this honour some of those who stand by Jesus are
   deemed worthy if they be either a Peter against whom the gates of Hades
   do not prevail, or the sons of thunder, [5763] and are begotten of the
   mighty voice of God who thunders and cries aloud from heaven great
   things to those who have ears and are wise.  Such at least do not taste
   death.

   33.  Interpretation of "Tasting of Death."

   But we must seek to understand what is meant by "tasting of death."
   And He is life who says, "I am the life," [5764] and this life
   assuredly has been hidden with Christ in God; and. "when Christ our
   life shall be manifested, then along with Him" [5765] shall be
   manifested those who are worthy of being manifested with Him in glory.
   But the enemy of this life, who is also the last enemy of all His
   enemies that shall be destroyed, is death, [5766] of which the soul
   that sinneth dies, having the opposite disposition to that which takes
   place in the soul that lives uprightly, and in consequence of living
   uprightly lives.  And when it is said in the law, "I have placed life
   before thy face," [5767] the Scripture says this about Him who said, "I
   am the Life," and about His enemy, death; the one or other of which
   each of us by his deeds is always choosing.  And when we sin with life
   before our face, the curse is fulfilled against us which says, "And thy
   life shall be hanging up before thee," etc., down to the words, "and
   for the sights of thine eyes which thou shalt see." [5768]   As,
   therefore, the Life is also the living bread which came down from
   heaven and gave life to the world, [5769] so His enemy death is dead
   bread.  Now every rational soul is fed either on living bread or dead
   bread, by the opinions good or bad which it receives.  As then in the
   case of more common foods it is the practice at one time only to taste
   them, and at another to eat of them more largely; so also, in the case
   of these loaves, one eats insufficiently only tasting them, but another
   is satiated,--he that is good or is on the way to being good with the
   living bread which came down from heaven, but he that is wicked with
   the dead bread, which is death; and some perhaps sparingly, and sinning
   a little, only taste of death; but those who have attained to virtue do
   not even taste of it, but are always fed on the living bread.  It
   naturally followed then in the case of Peter, against whom the gates of
   Hades will not prevail, that he did not taste of death, since any one
   tastes of death and eats death at the time when the gates of Hades
   prevail against him; and one eats or tastes of death in proportion as
   the gates of Hades to a greater or less extent, more or fewer in
   number, prevail against him.  But also for the sons of thunder who were
   begotten of thunder, which is a heavenly thing, it was impossible to
   taste of death, which is extremely far removed from thunder, their
   mother.  But these things the Word prophesies to those who shall be
   perfected, and who by standing with the Word advanced so far that they
   did not taste of death, until they saw the manifestation and the glory
   and the kingdom and the excellency of the Word of God in virtue of
   which He excels every word, which by an appearance of truth draws away
   and drags about those who are not able to break through the bonds of
   distraction, and go up to the height of the excellency of the Word of
   truth.

   34.  Meaning of "Until."  No Limitation of Promise.

   But since some one may think that the promise of the Saviour prescribes
   a limit of time to their not tasting of death, namely, that they will
   not taste of death "until" [5770] they see the Son of man coming in His
   own kingdom, but after this will taste of it, let us show that
   according to the scriptural usage the word "until" signifies that the
   time concerning the thing signified is pressing, but is not so defined
   that after the "until," that which is contrary to the thing signified
   should at all take place.  Now, the Saviour says to the eleven
   disciples when He rose from the dead, this among other things, "Lo, I
   am with you all the days, even until the consummation of the age."
   [5771]   When He said this, did He promise that He was going to be with
   them until the consummation of the age, but that after the consummation
   of the age, when another age was at hand, which is "called the age to
   come," He would be no longer with them?--so that according to this, the
   condition of the disciples would be better before the consummation of
   the age than after the consummation of the age?  But I do not think
   that any one will dare to say, that after the consummation of the age
   the Son of God will be no longer with the disciples, because the
   expression declares that He will be with them for so long, until the
   consummation of the age is at hand; for it is clear that the matter
   under inquiry was, whether the Son of God was forthwith going to be
   with His disciples before the age to come and the hoped for promises of
   God which were given as a recompense.  But there might have been a
   question--it being granted that He would be with them--whether
   sometimes He was present with them, and sometimes not present.
   Wherefore setting us free from the suspicion that might have arisen
   from doubt, He declared that now and even all the days He would be with
   the disciples, and that He would not leave those who had become His
   disciples until the consummation of the age; (because He said "all the
   days" He did not deny that by night, when the sun set, He would be
   present with them.)  But if such is the force of the words, "until the
   consummation of the age," plainly we shall not be compelled to admit
   that those who see the Son of man coming in His own kingdom shall taste
   of death, after being deemed worthy of beholding Him in such guise.
   But as in the case of the passage we brought forward, the urgent
   necessity was to teach us that "until the consummation of the age" He
   would not leave us but be with us all the days; so also in this case I
   think that it is clear to those who know how to look at the logical
   coherence of things that He who has seen once for all "the Son of man
   coming in His own kingdom," and seen Him "in His own glory," and seen
   "the kingdom of God come with power," could not possibly taste of death
   after the contemplation of things so good and great.  But apart from
   the word of the promise of Jesus, we have conjectured not without
   reason that we would taste of death, so long as we were not yet held
   worthy to see "the kingdom of God come with power," and "the Son of man
   coming in His own glory and in His own kingdom."

   35.  Scriptural References to Death.

   But since here it is written in the three Evangelists, "They shall not
   taste of death," [5772] but in other writers different things are
   written concerning death, it may not be out of place to bring forward
   and examine these passages along with the "taste."  In the Psalms,
   then, it is said, "What man is he that shall live and not see death?"
   [5773]   And again, in another place, "Let death come upon them and let
   them go down into Hades alive;" [5774] but in one of the prophets,
   "Death becoming mighty has swallowed them up;" [5775] and in the
   Apocalypse, "Death and Hades follow some." [5776]   Now in these
   passages it appears to me that it is one thing to taste of death, but
   another thing to see death, and another thing for it to come upon some,
   and that a fourth thing, different from the aforesaid, is signified by
   the words, "Death becoming mighty has swallowed them up," and a fifth
   thing, different from these, by the words, Death and Hades follow
   them."  And if you were to collect them, you would perhaps find also
   other differences than those which we have mentioned, by a comparison
   of which with one another and right investigation, you would find the
   things signified in each place.  But here I inquire whether it is a
   less evil to see death, but a greater evil than seeing to taste of it,
   but still worse than this that death should follow any one, and not
   only follow him, but also now come upon him and seize him whom it
   formerly followed; but to be swallowed up seems to be more grievous
   than all the things spoken of.  But giving heed to what is said, and to
   the differences of sins committed, you will not I think, be slow to
   admit that things of this kind were intended by the Spirit who caused
   these things to be written in the oracles of God.  But, if it be
   necessary to give an exposition clearer than what has been said of what
   is signified by seeing the Son of man coming in His own kingdom, or in
   His own glory, and what is signified by seeing the kingdom of God come
   with power, these things--whether those that are made to shine in our
   hearts, or that are found by those who seek, or that enter gradually
   into our thoughts,--let each one judge as he wills--we will set forth.
   He who beholds and apprehends the excellency of the Word, as he breaks
   down and refutes all the plausible forms of things which are truly lies
   but profess to be truths, sees the Son of man, (according to the word
   of John, "the Word of God,") coming in His own kingdom; but if such an
   one were to behold the Word, not only breaking down plausible
   oppositions, but also representing His own truths with perfect
   clearness, he would behold His glory in addition to His kingdom.  And
   such an one indeed would see in Him the kingdom of God come with power;
   and he would see this, as one who is no longer now under the reign of
   "sin which reigns in the mortal body of those who sin," [5777] but is
   ever under the orders of the king, who is God of all, whose kingdom is
   indeed potentially "within us," [5778] but actually, and, as Mark has
   called it, "with power," and not at all in weakness within the perfect
   alone.  These things, then, Jesus promised to the disciples who were
   standing, prophesying not about all of them, but about some.

   36.  Concerning the Transfiguration of the Saviour.

   "Now after six days," according to Matthew and Mark, [5779] "He taketh
   with him Peter and James and John his brother, and leads them up into a
   high mountain apart, and was transfigured before them."  Now, also, let
   it be granted, before the exposition that occurs to us in relation to
   these things, that this took place long ago, and according to the
   letter.  But it seems to me, that those who are led up by Jesus into
   the high mountain, and are deemed worthy of beholding His
   transfiguration apart, are not without purpose led up six days after
   the discourses previously spoken.  For since in six days--the perfect
   number--the whole world,--this perfect work of art,--was made, on this
   account I think that he who transcends all the things of the world by
   beholding no longer the things which are seen, for they are temporal,
   but already the things which not seen, and only the things which are
   not seen, because that they are eternal, is represented in the words,
   "After six days Jesus took up with Him" certain persons.  If therefore
   any one of us wishes to be taken by Jesus, and led up by Him into the
   high mountain, and be deemed worthy of beholding His transfiguration
   apart, let him pass beyond the six days, because he no longer beholds
   the things which are seen, nor longer loves the world, nor the things
   in the world, [5780] nor lusts after any worldly lust, which is the
   lust of bodies, and of the riches of the body, and of the glory which
   is after the flesh, and whatever things whose nature it is to distract
   and drag away the soul from the things which are better and diviner,
   and bring it down and fix it fast to the deceit of this age, in wealth
   and glory, and the rest of the lusts which are the foes of truth.  For
   when he has passed through the six days, as we have said, he will keep
   a new Sabbath, rejoicing in the lofty mountain, because he sees Jesus
   transfigured before him; for the Word has different forms, as He
   appears to each as is expedient for the beholder, and is manifested to
   no one beyond the capacity of the beholder.

   37.  Force of the Words "Before Them."

   But you will ask if, when He was transfigured before those who were led
   up by Him into the lofty mountain, He appeared to them in the form of
   God, in which He formerly was, so that He had to those below the form
   of a servant, but to those who had followed Him after the six days to
   the lofty mountain, He had not that form, but the form of God.  But
   hear these things, if you can, at the same time giving heed
   spiritually, that it is not said simply, "He was transfigured," but
   with a certain necessary addition, which Matthew and Mark have
   recorded; for, according to both, "He was transfigured before them."
   [5781]   And according to this, indeed, you will say that it is
   possible for Jesus to be transfigured before some with this
   transfiguration, but before others at the same time not to be
   transfigured.  But if you wish to see the transfiguration of Jesus
   before those who went up into the lofty mountain apart long with Him,
   behold with me the Jesus in the Gospels, as more simply apprehended,
   and as one might say, known "according to the flesh," by those who do
   not go up, through works and words which are uplifting, to the lofty
   mountain of wisdom, but known no longer after the flesh, but known in
   His divinity by means of all the Gospels, and beholden in the form of
   God according to their knowledge; for before them is Jesus
   transfigured, and not to any one of those below.  But when He is
   transfigured, His face also shines as the sun, that He may be
   manifested to the children of light, who have put off the works of
   darkness, and put on the armour of light, [5782] and are no longer the
   children of darkness or night, but have become the sons of day, and
   walk honestly as in the day; [5783] and being manifested, He will shine
   unto them not simply as the sun, but as demonstrated to be the sun of
   righteousness.

   38.  The Garments White as the Light.

   And not only is He transfigured before such disciples, nor does He only
   add to the transfiguration the shining of His face as the sun; but
   further also to those who were led up by Him into the high mountain
   apart, His garments appear white as the light. [5784]   But the
   garments of Jesus are the expressions and letters of the Gospels with
   which He invested Himself.  But I think that even the words in the
   Apostles which indicate the truths concerning Him are garments of
   Jesus, which become white to those who go up into the high mountain
   along with Jesus.  But since there are differences also of things
   white, His garments become white as the brightest and purest of all
   white things; and that is light.  When therefore you see any one not
   only with a thorough understanding of the theology concerning Jesus,
   but also making clear every expression of the Gospels, do not hesitate
   to say that to Him the garments of Jesus have become white as the
   light.  But when the Son of God in His transfiguration is so understood
   and beheld, that His face is a sun, and His garments white as the
   light, straightway there will appear to him who beholds Jesus in such
   form Moses,--the law--and Elijah,--in the way of synecdoche, not one
   prophet only, but all the prophets--holding converse with Jesus; for
   such is the force of the words "talking with Him;" [5785] but,
   according to Luke, "Moses and Elijah appeared in glory," down to the
   words, "in Jerusalem." [5786]   But if any one sees the glory of Moses,
   having understood the spiritual law as a discourse in harmony with
   Jesus, and the wisdom in the prophets which is hidden in a mystery,
   [5787] he sees Moses and Elijah in glory when he sees them with Jesus.

   39.  Jesus Was Transfigured--"As He Was Praying."

   Then, since it will be necessary to expound the passage as given in
   Mark, "And as He was praying He was transfigured before them," [5788]
   we must say that perhaps it is possible especially to see the Word
   transfigured before us if we have done the things aforesaid, and gone
   up into the mountain, and seen the absolute Word holding converse with
   the Father, and praying to Him for such things as the true High-Priest
   might pray for to the only true God.  But in order that He may thus
   hold fellowship with God and pray to the Father, He goes up into the
   mountain; and then, according to Mark, "His garments become white and
   glistening as the light, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them."
   [5789]   And perhaps the fullers upon the earth are the wise men of
   this world who are careful about the diction which they consider to be
   bright and pure, so that even their base thoughts and false dogmas seem
   to be beautified by their fulling, so to speak; but He who shows His
   own garments glistering to those who have ascended and brighter than
   their fulling can make them, is the Word, who exhibits in the
   expressions of the Scriptures which are despised by many the glistering
   of the thoughts, when the raiment of Jesus, according to Luke, becomes
   white and dazzling. [5790]

   40.  Discussion of the Saying of Peter.

   But let us next see what was the thought of Peter when he answered and
   said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; let us make three
   tabernacles," [5791] etc.  And on this account these words call for
   very special examination, because Mark, in his own person, has added,
   "For he wist not what to answer," [5792] but Luke, "not knowing," he
   says, "what he spake." [5793]   You will consider, therefore, if he
   spake these things as in a trance, being filled with the spirit which
   moved him to say these things, which could not be a Holy Spirit; for
   John taught in the Gospel that, before the resurrection of the Saviour,
   no one had the Holy Spirit, saying, "For the Spirit was not yet,
   because Jesus was not yet glorified." [5794]   But if the Spirit was
   not yet, and he, not knowing what he said, spoke under the influence of
   some spirit, the spirit which caused these things to be said was some
   one of the spirits which had not yet been triumphed over in the cross,
   nor made a show of along with them, about whom it is written, "Having
   put off from Himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show
   of them openly, triumphing over them in the cross." [5795]   But this
   spirit was perhaps that which is called a stumbling-block by Jesus, and
   which is spoken of as Satan in the passage, "Get thee behind Me, Satan;
   thou art a stumbling-block unto me." [5796]   But I know well that such
   things will offend many who meet with them, because they think that it
   is opposed to sound reason that he should be spoken ill of who a little
   before had been pronounced blessed by Jesus, on the ground that the
   Father in heaven had revealed to him the things concerning the Saviour,
   to-wit, that He was verily Jesus, and the Christ, and the Son of the
   living God.  But let such an one attend more exactly to the statements
   about Peter and the rest of the Apostles, how even they made requests
   as if they were yet alien from Him who was to redeem them from the
   enemy and purchase them with His own precious blood; or let them also,
   who will have it that even before the passion of Jesus the Apostles
   were perfect, tell us whence it came about that "Peter and they that
   were with him were heavy with sleep." [5797]   But to anticipate
   something else of what follows and apply it to the subject in hand, I
   would raise in turn these questions,--whether it is possible for any
   one to find occasion of stumbling in Jesus apart from the working of
   the devil who caused him to stumble; and whether it is possible for any
   one to deny Jesus, and that in presence of a little maid and a
   doorkeeper and men most worthless, unless a spirit had been with him in
   his denial hostile to the Spirit which is given and the wisdom, (which
   is given) to those who are assisted by God to make confession,
   according to a certain desert of theirs.  But he who has learned to
   refer the roots of sin to the father of sin, the devil, will not say
   that apart from him either the Apostles were caused to stumble, or that
   Peter denied Christ thrice before that well-known cock-crowing.  But if
   this be so, consider whether perhaps with a view to make Jesus stumble,
   so far as was in his power, and to turn Him aside from the dispensation
   whose characteristic was suffering that brought salvation to men, which
   He undertook with great willingness, seeking to effect these things
   which seemed to contribute to this end, he himself also here wishes as
   it were, by deceit, to draw away Jesus, as if calling upon Him no
   longer to condescend to men, and come to them, and undergo death for
   them, but to abide on the high mountain with Moses and Elijah.  But he
   promised also to build three tabernacles, one apart for Jesus, and one
   for Moses, and one for Elijah, as if one tabernacle would not have
   sufficed for the three, if it had been necessary for them to be in
   tabernacles and in the high mountain.  And perhaps also in this he
   acted with evil intent, when he incited him "who did not know what he
   said," not desiring that Jesus and Moses and Elijah should be together,
   but desiring to separate them from one another, under pretext of the
   three tabernacles."  And likewise it was a lie, "It is good for us to
   be here;" [5798] for if it had been a good thing they would also have
   remained there.  But if it were a lie, you will seek to know who caused
   the lie to be spoken; and especially since according to John, "When he
   speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar and the father
   thereof;" [5799] and as there is no truth apart from the working of Him
   who says, "I am the Truth," [5800] so there is no lie apart from him
   who is the enemy of truth.  These contrary qualities, accordingly, were
   still in Peter truth and falsehood; and from truth he said, "Thou art
   the Christ, the son of the living God," [5801] but from falsehood he
   said, "May God be propitious to Thee, Lord, this shall not be unto
   Thee," [5802] and also, "It is good for us to be here." [5803]   But if
   any one will not admit that Peter spoke these things from any evil
   inspiration, but that his words were of his own mere choice, and it is
   demanded of him how he will interpret, "not knowing what he said," and,
   [5804] "for he did not know what to answer," [5805] he will say, that
   in the former case Peter held it to be a shameful thing and unworthy of
   Jesus to admit that the Son of the living God, the Christ, whom already
   the Father had revealed to him, should be killed; and in the present
   case that, as having seen the two forms of Jesus and the one at the
   transfiguration which was much more excellent, being well pleased with
   that, he said that it was good to make their sojourning in that
   mountain, in order that he himself and those with him might rejoice as
   they beheld the transfiguration of Jesus and His face shining as the
   sun, and His garments white as the light, and, in addition to these
   things, might always behold in glory those whom they had once seen in
   glory, Moses and Elijah; and that they might rejoice at the things
   which they might hear, as they talked and held intercourse with each
   other, Moses and Elijah with Jesus, and Jesus with them.

   41.  Figurative Interpretation of the Same.

   But since we have not yet spent our energy in interpreting the things
   in the place figuratively, but have said these things by way of
   searching into the mere letter, let us in conformity with these things,
   consider whether the aforesaid Peter and the sons of thunder who were
   taken up into the mountain of the dogmas of the truth, and who saw the
   transfiguration of Jesus and of Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory
   with Him, might wish to make tabernacles in themselves for the Word of
   God who was going to dwell in them, and for His law which had been
   beholden in glory, and for the prophecy which spake of the decease of
   Jesus, which He was about to accomplish; [5806] and Peter, as one
   loving the contemplative life, and having preferred that which was
   delightsome in it to the life among the crowd with its turmoil, said,
   with the design of benefiting those who desired it, "It is good for us
   to be here." [5807]   But since "love seeketh not its own," [5808]
   Jesus did not do that which Peter thought good; wherefore He descended
   from the mountain to those who were not able to ascend to it and behold
   His transfiguration, that they might behold Him in such form as they
   were able to see Him.  It is, therefore, the part of a righteous man
   who possesses "the love which seeketh not its own" [5809] to be free
   from all, but to bring himself under bondage to all those below that He
   might gain the more of them. [5810]   But some one, with reference to
   what we have alleged about the trance and the working of an evil spirit
   in Peter, concerning the words, "not knowing what he said," [5811] not
   accepting that interpretation of ours, may say that there were certain
   mentioned by Paul "desiring to be teachers of the law," [5812] who do
   not know about what they speak, but who, though they do not clearly
   expound the nature of what is said, nor understand their meaning, make
   confident affirmations of things which they do not know.  Of such a
   nature was the affection of Peter also, for not apprehending what was
   good with reference to the dispensation of Jesus and of those who
   appeared in the mountain,--Moses and Elijah,--he says, "It is good for
   us to be here," etc., "not knowing what he said," "for he wist not what
   to say," for if "a wise man will understand the things from his own
   mouth, and carries prudence in his lips," [5813] he who is not so does
   not understand the things from his own mouth, nor comprehend the nature
   of the things spoken by him.

   42.  The Meaning of the "Bright Cloud."

   Next to these come the words, "While He was yet speaking, behold, also,
   a bright cloud overshadowed them," [5814] etc.  Now, I think that God,
   wishing to dissuade Peter from making three tabernacles, under which so
   far as it depended on his choice he was going to dwell, shows a
   tabernacle better, so to speak, and much more excellent, the cloud.
   For since it is the function of a tabernacle to overshadow him who is
   in it, and to shelter him, and the bright cloud overshadowed them, God
   made, as it were, a diviner tabernacle, inasmuch as it was bright, that
   it might be to them a pattern of the resurrection to come; for a bright
   cloud overshadows the just, who are at once protected and illuminated
   and shone upon by it.  But what might the bright cloud, which
   overshadows the just, be?  Is it, perhaps, the fatherly power, from
   which comes the voice of the Father bearing testimony to the Son as
   beloved and well-pleasing, and exhorting those who were under its
   shadow to hear Him and no other one?  But as He speaks of old, so also
   always does He speak through what He wills.  And perhaps, too, the Holy
   Spirit is the bright cloud which overshadows the just, and prophesies
   of the things of God, who works in it, and says, "This is My beloved
   Son in whom I am well-pleased;" but I would venture also to say that
   our Saviour is a bright cloud.  When, therefore, Peter said, "Let us
   make here three tabernacles," [5815] ...one from the Father Himself,
   and from the Son, and one from the Holy Spirit.  For a bright cloud of
   the Father, Son and Holy Spirit overshadows the genuine disciples of
   Jesus; or a cloud overshadows the Gospel and the law and the prophets,
   which is bright to him who is able to see the light of it in the
   Gospel, and the law, and the prophets.  But perhaps the voice from the
   cloud says to Moses and Elijah, "This is My beloved Son in whom I am
   well-pleased, hear Him," as they were desirous to see the Son of man,
   and to hear Him, and to behold Him as He was in glory.  And perhaps it
   teaches the disciples that He who was, in a literal sense, the Son of
   God, and His beloved in whom He was well-pleased, whom it behoved them
   especially to hear, was He who was then beheld, and transfigured, and
   whose face shone as the sun, and who was clothed with garments white as
   the light.

   43.  Relation of Moses and Elijah to Jesus.  The Injunction of Silence.

   But after these things it is written that, when they heard the voice
   from the cloud bearing testimony to the Son, the three Apostles, not
   being able to bear the glory of the voice and power resting upon it,
   "fell on their face," [5816] and besought God; for they were sore
   afraid at the supernatural sight, and the things which were spoken from
   the sight.  But consider if you can also say this with reference to the
   details in the passage, that the disciples, having understood that the
   Son of God had been holding conference with Moses, and that it was He
   who said, "A man shall not see My face and live," [5817] and taking
   further the testimony of God about Him, as not being able to endure the
   radiance of the Word, humbled themselves under the mighty hand of God;
   [5818] but, after the touch of the Word, lifting up their eyes they saw
   Jesus only and no other. [5819]   Moses, the law, and Elijah, the
   prophet, became one only with the Gospel of Jesus; and not, as they
   were formerly three, did they so abide, but the three became one.  But
   consider these things with me in relation to mystical matters; for in
   regard to the bare meaning of the letter, Moses and Elijah, having
   appeared in glory and talked with Jesus, went away to the place from
   which they had come, perhaps to communicate the words which Jesus spake
   with them, to those who were to be benefited by Him, almost
   immediately, namely, at the time of the passion, when many bodies of
   the saints that had fallen asleep, their tombs being opened, were to go
   to the city which is truly holy--not the Jerusalem which Jesus wept
   over--and there appear unto many. [5820]   But after the dispensation
   in the mountain, when the disciples were coming down from the mountain
   in order that, when they had come to the multitude, they might serve
   the Son of God concerning the salvation of the people, Jesus commanded
   the disciples saying, "Tell the vision to no man until the Son of man
   rise from the dead." [5821]   But that saying, "Tell the vision to no
   man," is like that which was investigated in the passage above, when
   "He enjoined the disciples to tell no man that He was the Christ."
   [5822]   Wherefore the things that were said at that passage may be
   useful to us also for the passage before us; since Jesus wishes also,
   in accordance with these, that the things of His glory should not be
   spoken of, before His glory after the passion; for those who heard, and
   in particular the multitudes, would have been injured when they saw Him
   crucified, who had been so glorified.  Wherefore since His being
   glorified in the resurrection was akin to His transfiguration, and to
   the vision of His face as the sun, on this account He wishes that these
   things should then be spoken of by the Apostles, when He rose from the
   dead.

   Book XIII.

   1.  Relation of the Baptist to Elijah.  The Theory of Transmigration
   Considered.

   "The disciples asked Him, saying, Why then say the scribes that Elijah
   must first come?" [5823]   The disciples indeed who went up with Jesus
   remembered the traditions of the scribes concerning Elijah, that before
   the advent of Christ, Elijah would come and prepare for Him the souls
   of those who were going to receive Him.  But the vision in the
   mountain, at which Elijah appeared, did not seem to be in harmony with
   the things which were said, since to them it seemed that Elijah had not
   come before Jesus but after Him; wherefore, they say these things,
   thinking that the scribes lied.  But to this the Saviour answers, not
   setting aside the traditions concerning Elijah, but saying that there
   was another advent of Elijah before that of Christ of which the scribes
   were ignorant; and, in regard to this, being ignorant of him, they "had
   done unto him whatsoever they listed," [5824] as if they had been
   accomplices in his having been cast into prison by Herod and slain by
   him; then He says that according as they had done towards Elijah so
   would He suffer at their hands. [5825]   And these things indeed as
   about Elijah the disciples asked and the Saviour answered, but when
   they heard they understood that the words, "Elijah has already come,"
   and that following which was spoken by the Saviour, had reference to
   John the Baptist. [5826]   And let these things be said by way of
   illustration of the passage before us.  But now according to our
   ability let us make investigation also into the things that are stored
   up in it.  In this place it does not appear to me that by Elijah the
   soul is spoken of, lest I should fall into the dogma of transmigration,
   which is foreign to the church of God, and not handed down by the
   Apostles, nor anywhere set forth in the Scriptures; for it is also in
   opposition to the saying that "things seen are temporal," [5827] and
   that "this age shall have a consummation," and also to the fulfilment
   of the saying, "Heaven and earth shall pass away," [5828] and "the
   fashion of this world passeth away," [5829] and "the heavens shall
   perish," [5830] and what follows.  For if, by hypothesis, in the
   constitution of things which has existed from the beginning unto the
   end of the world, the same soul can be twice in the body, for what
   cause should it be in it?  For if because of sin it should be twice in
   the body, why should it not be thrice, and repeatedly in it, since
   punishments, in respect of this life, and of the sins committed in it,
   shall be rendered to it only by the method of transmigration?  But if
   this be granted as a consequence, perhaps there will never be a time
   when a soul shall not undergo transmigration:  for always because of
   its former sins will it dwell in the body; and so there will be no
   place for the corruption of the world, at which "the heaven and the
   earth shall pass away." [5831]   And if it be granted, on this
   hypothesis, that one who is absolutely sinless shall not come into the
   body by birth, after what length of time do you suppose that a soul
   shall be found absolutely pure and needing no transmigration?  But
   nevertheless, also, if any one soul is always thus being removed from
   the definite number of souls and returns no longer to the body,
   sometime after infinite ages, as it were, birth shall cease; the world
   being reduced to some one or two or a few more, after the perfecting of
   whom the world shall perish, the supply of souls coming into the body
   having failed.  But this is not agreeable to the Scripture; for it
   knows of a multitude of sinners at the time of the destruction of the
   world.  This is manifest from consideration of the saying, "How-beit
   when the Son of man cometh shall He find faith on the earth?" [5832]
   So we find it thus said in Matthew, "As were the days of Noah so shall
   also be the coming of the Son of man; for as they were in the days of
   the flood," etc. [5833]   But to those who are then in existence there
   shall be the exaction of a penalty for their sins, but not by way of
   transmigration; for, if they are caught while still sinning, either
   they will be punished after this by a different form of
   punishment,--and according to this either there will be two general
   forms of punishment, the one by way of transmigration, and the other
   outside of a body of this kind, and let them declare the causes and
   differences of these,--or they will not be punished, as if those who
   were left at the consummation of things had forthwith cast away their
   sins; or, which is better, there is one form of punishment for those
   who have sinned in the body, namely, that they should suffer, outside
   of it, that is, outside the constitution of this life, what is
   according to the desert of their sins.  But to one who has insight into
   the nature of things it is clear that each of these things is fitted to
   overturn the doctrine of transmigration.  But if, of necessity, the
   Greeks who introduce the doctrine of transmigration, laying down things
   in harmony with it, do not acknowledge that the world is coming to
   corruption, it is fitting that when they have looked the Scriptures
   straight in the face which plainly declare that the world will perish,
   they should either disbelieve them, or invent a series of arguments in
   regard to the interpretation of the things concerning the consummation;
   which even if they wish they will not be able to do.  And this besides
   we will say to those who may have had the hardihood to aver that the
   world will not perish, that, if the world does not perish but is to
   exist for infinite periods of time, there will be no God knowing all
   things before they come into being.  But if, perhaps, He knows in part,
   either He will know each thing before it comes into being, or certain
   things, and after these again other things; for things infinite in
   nature cannot possibly be grasped by that knowledge whose nature it is
   to limit things known.  From this it follows that there cannot be
   prophecies about all things whatsoever, since all things are infinite.

   2.  "The Spirit and Power of Elijah"--Not the Soul--Were in the
   Baptist.

   I have thought it necessary to dwell some time on the examination of
   the doctrine of transmigration, because of the suspicion of some who
   suppose that the soul under consideration was the same in Elijah and in
   John, being called in the former case Elijah, and in the second case
   John; and that, not apart from God, had he been called John, as is
   plain from the saying of the angel who appeared to Zacharias, "Fear
   not, Zacharias, for thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth
   shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John;" [5834] and
   from the fact that Zacharias regained his speech after he had written
   in the tablet, that he who had been born should be called John. [5835]
     But if it were the soul of Elijah, then, when he was begotten a
   second time, he should have been called Elijah; or for the change of
   name some reason should have been assigned, as in the case of Abram and
   Abraham, Sarah and Sarrah, Jacob and Israel, Simon and Peter.  And yet
   not even thus would their argument in the case be tenable; for, in the
   case of the aforesaid, the changes of name took place in one and the
   same life.  But some one might ask, if the soul of Elijah was not first
   in the Tishbite and secondly in John, what might that be in both which
   the Saviour called Elijah?  And I say that Gabriel in his words to
   Zacharias suggested what the substance was in Elijah and John that was
   the same; for he says, "Many of the children of Israel shall he turn to
   the Lord their God; and he shall go before his face in the spirit and
   power of Elijah." [5836]   For, observe, he did not say in the "soul"
   of Elijah, in which case the doctrine of transmigration might have some
   ground, but "in the spirit and power of Elijah."  For the Scripture
   well knows the distinction between spirit and soul, as, "May God
   sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved
   entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ;" [5837]
   and the passage, "Bless the Lord, ye spirits and souls of the
   righteous" [5838] as it stands in the book of Daniel, according to the
   Septuagint, represents the difference between spirit and soul.  Elijah,
   therefore, was not called John because of the soul, but because of the
   spirit and the power, which in no way conflicts with the teaching of
   the church, though they were formerly in Elijah, and afterwards in
   John; and "the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,"
   [5839] but the souls of the prophets are not subject to the prophets,
   and "the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha." [5840]   But we ought to
   inquire whether the spirit of Elijah is the same as the spirit of God
   in Elijah, or whether they are different from each other, and whether
   the spirit of Elijah which was in him was something supernatural,
   different from the spirit of each man which is in him; for the Apostle
   clearly indicates that the Spirit of God, though it be in us, is
   different from the spirit of each man which is in Him, when he says
   somewhere, "The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we
   are the children of God;" [5841] and elsewhere, "No one of men knoweth
   the things of a man save the spirit of the man which is in him; even so
   the things of God none knoweth save the Spirit of God." [5842]   But do
   not marvel in regard to what is said about Elijah, if, just as
   something strange happened to him different from all the saints who are
   recorded, in respect of his having been caught up by a whirlwind into
   heaven, [5843] so his spirit had something of choice excellence, so
   that not only did it rest on Elisha, but also descended along with John
   at his birth; and that John, separately, "was filled with the Holy
   Ghost even from his mother's womb," and separately, "came before Christ
   in the spirit and power of Elijah." [5844]   For it is possible for
   several spirits not only worse, but also better, to be in the same
   man.  David accordingly asks to be established by a free spirit, [5845]
   and that a right spirit be renewed in his inward parts. [5846]   But
   if, in order that the Saviour may impart to us of "the spirit of wisdom
   and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of
   knowledge and reverence," [5847] he was filled also with the spirit of
   the fear of the Lord; it is possible also that these several good
   spirits may be conceived as being in the same person.  And this also we
   have brought forward, because of John having come before Christ "in the
   spirit and power of Elijah," [5848] in order that the saying, "Elijah
   has already come," [5849] may be referred to the spirit of Elijah that
   was in John; as also the three disciples who had gone up with Him
   understood that He spake to them about John the Baptist. [5850]   Upon
   Elisha, then, only the spirit of Elijah rested, but John came before,
   [5851] not only in the spirit, but also in the power of Elijah.
   Wherefore, also, Elisha could not have been called Elijah, but John was
   Elijah himself.  But if it be necessary to adduce the Scripture from
   which the scribes said that Elijah must first come, listen to Malachi
   who says, "And behold I will send to you Elijah the Tishbite," etc.,
   down to the words, "Lest I come and smite the earth utterly." [5852]
   And it seems to be indicated by these words, that Elijah was to prepare
   for the glorious coming of Christ by certain holy words and
   dispositions in their souls, those who had been made fittest for this,
   which those upon earth could not have endured, because of the
   excellency of the glory, unless they had been prepared before hand by
   Elijah.  And likewise, by Elijah, in this place, I do not understand
   the soul of that prophet but his spirit and his power; for these it is
   by which all things shall be restored, [5853] so that when they have
   been restored, and, as a result of that restoration, become capable of
   receiving the glory of Christ, the Son of God who shall appear in glory
   may sojourn with them.  But if also Elijah be in some sort a word
   inferior to "the Word who was in the beginning with God, God the Word,"
   [5854] this word also might come as a preparatory discipline to the
   people prepared by it, that they might be trained for the reception of
   the perfect Word.  But some one may raise the question whether the
   spirit and power of Elijah, suffered what was suffered in John,
   according to the words, "They did in him whatsoever they listed."
   [5855]   And to this it will be said on the one hand, in simpler
   fashion that there is nothing strange in the thought, that the things
   which assist do, because of love, suffer along with those that are
   assisted; and Jesus indeed says. "Because of the weak I was weak, and I
   hungered because of the hungry, and I thirsted because of the thirsty,"
   [5856] and, on the other hand, in a deeper sense that the words are
   not, "But they did unto him whatsoever they listed in him," for the
   things which suffered leaned upon the spirit and the power of Elijah,
   the soul of John being in no wise Elijah; and probably also the body
   (leaned upon them).  For in one fashion is the soul in the body, and
   the spirit, and the power; and in another fashion is the body of the
   righteous man in these better parts, as leaning upon them, and clinging
   to them; but "they who are in the flesh cannot please God; but ye are
   not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwell in
   you;" [5857] for the soul of the sinner is in the flesh, but of the
   righteous man in spirit.  And likewise, further, this might be inquired
   into, to whom refer the words, "But they did in him whatsoever they
   listed." [5858]   Was it to the scribes in regard to whom the disciples
   inquired and said, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must first
   come?" [5859]   But it is not at all evident that John suffered
   anything at the hands of the scribes, except, indeed, that they did not
   believe him; or, as we said also before, that they were accomplices in
   the wrongs which Herod dared to inflict on him.  But another might say
   that the words, "But they did in him whatsoever they listed," refer not
   to the scribes but to Herodias and her daughter, and Herod, who did in
   him whatsoever they listed.  And that which follows, "So shall the Son
   of man suffer from them," [5860] might be referred to the scribes, if
   the former were referred to them; but, if the former refers to Herod
   and Herodias and her daughter, the second passage will also refer to
   them; [5861] for Herod also seems to have joined in the vote that Jesus
   should die, perhaps his wife also taking part with him in the plot
   against Him.

   3.  Concerning the Epileptic.

   "And when they were come to the multitude, there came to Him a man
   kneeling to Him and saying, Lord, have mercy upon my son." [5862]
   Those who are suffering, or the kinsfolk of the sufferers, are along
   with the multitudes; wherefore, when He has dispensed the things that
   were beyond the multitudes, He descends to them, so that those, who
   were not able to ascend because of the sicknesses that repressed their
   soul, might be benefited when the Word descended to them from the
   loftier regions.  But we ought to make inquiry, in respect of what
   diseases the sufferers believe and pray for their own healing, and in
   respect of what diseases others do this for them, as, for example, the
   centurion for his servant, and the nobleman for his son, and the ruler
   of the synagogue for a daughter, and the Canaanitish woman for her
   female child who was vexed with a demon, and now the man who kneels to
   Him on behalf of his epileptic son.  And along with these you will
   investigate when the Saviour heals of Himself and unasked by any one,
   as for example, the paralytic; for these cures, when compared with one
   another for this very purpose, and examined together, will exhibit to
   him who is able to hear "the wisdom of God hidden in a mystery," [5863]
   many dogmas concerning the different diseases of souls, as well as the
   method of their healing.

   4.  Spiritual Epileptics.

   But since our present object is not to make inquiry about every case,
   but about the passage before us, let us, adopting a figurative
   interpretation, consider who we may say the lunatic was, and who was
   his father who prayed for him, and what is meant by the sufferer
   falling not constantly but oft-times, sometimes into the fire, and
   sometimes into the water, and what is meant by the fact that he could
   not be healed by the disciples but by Jesus Himself.  For if every
   sickness and every infirmity, which our Saviour then healed among the
   people, refers to different disorders in souls, it is also in
   accordance with reason that by the paralytics are symbolised the
   palsied in soul, who keep it lying paralysed in the body; but by those
   who are blind are symbolised those who are blind in respect of things
   seen by the soul alone, and these are really blind; and by the deaf are
   symbolised those who are deaf in regard to the reception of the word of
   salvation.  On the same principle it will be necessary that the matters
   regarding the epileptic should be investigated.  Now this affection
   attacks the sufferers at considerable intervals, during which he who
   suffers from it seems in no way to differ from the man in good health,
   at the season when the epilepsy is not working on him.  Similar
   disorders you may find in certain souls, which are often supposed to be
   healthy in point of temperance and the other virtues; then, sometimes,
   as if they were seized with a kind of epilepsy arising from their
   passions, they fall down from the position in which they seemed to
   stand, and are drawn away by the deceit of this world and other lusts.
   Perhaps, therefore, you would not err if you said, that such persons,
   so to speak, are epileptic spiritually, having been cast down by "the
   spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places," [5864] and are
   often ill, at the time when the passions attack their soul; at one time
   falling into the fire of burnings, when, according to what is said in
   Hosea, they become adulterers, like a pan heated for the cooking from
   the burning flame; [5865] and, at another time, into the water, when
   the king of all the dragons in the waters casts them down from the
   sphere where they appeared to breath freely, so that they come into the
   depths of the waves of the sea of human life.  This interpretation of
   ours in regard to the lunatic will be supported by him who says in the
   Book of Wisdom with reference to the even temperament of the just man,
   "The discourse of a pious man is always wisdom," but, in regard to what
   we have said, "The fool changes as the moon." [5866]   And sometimes
   even in the case of such you may see impulses which might carry away in
   praise of them those who do not attend to their want of ballast, so
   that they would say that it was as full moon in their case, or almost
   full moon.  And you might see again the light that seemed to be in them
   diminishing ,--as it was not the light of day but the light of
   night,--fading to so great an extent, that the light which appeared to
   be seen in them no longer existed.  But whether or not those who first
   gave their names to things, on account of this gave the name of lunacy
   to the disease epilepsy, you will judge for yourself.

   5.  The Deaf and Dumb Spirit.

   Now the father of the epileptic--perhaps the angel to whom he had been
   allotted, if we are to say that every human soul is put in subjection
   to some angel--prays the Physician of souls for his son that He may
   heal him who could not be healed from his disorder by the inferior word
   which was in the disciples.  But the dumb and deaf spirit, who was cast
   out by the Word, must be figuratively understood as the irrational
   impulses, even towards that which seems to be good, so that, what
   things any man once did by irrational impulse which seemed to onlookers
   to be good, he may do no longer irrationally but according to the
   reason of the teaching of Jesus.  Under the inspiration of this Paul
   also said, "If I have all faith so as to remove mountains;" [5867] for
   he, who has all faith, which is as a grain of mustard seed, [5868]
   removes not one mountain only, but also several analogous to it; for
   although faith is despised by men and appears to be something very
   little and contemptible; yet when it meets with good ground, that is
   the soul, which is able fittingly to receive such seed, it becomes a
   great tree, so that no one of those things which have no wings, but the
   birds of heaven which are winged spiritually, are able to lodge in the
   branches of faith so great. [5869]

   6.  Influence of the Moon and Stars on Men.

   Let us now, then, give heed to the very letter of the passage, and
   first let us inquire, how he who has been cast into darkness and
   repressed by an impure and deaf and dumb spirit is said to be a
   "lunatic," and for what reason the expression to be a "lunatic" derives
   its name from the great light in heaven which is next to the sun, which
   God appointed "to rule over the night." [5870]   Let physicians then,
   discuss the physiology of the matter, inasmuch as they think that there
   is no impure spirit in the case, but a bodily disorder, and inquiring
   into the nature of things let them say, that the moist humours which
   are in the head are moved by a certain sympathy which they have with
   the light of the moon, which has a moist nature; but as for us, who
   also believe the Gospel that this sickness is viewed as having been
   effected by an impure dumb and deaf spirit in those who suffer from it,
   and who see that those, who are accustomed like the magicians of the
   Egyptians to promise a cure in regard to such, seem sometimes to be
   successful in their case, we will say that, perhaps, with the view of
   slandering the creation of God, in order that "unrighteousness may be
   spoken loftily, and that they may set their mouth against the heaven,"
   [5871] this impure spirit watches certain configurations of the moon,
   and so makes it appear from observation of men suffering at such and
   such a phase of the moon, that the cause of so great an evil is not the
   dumb and deaf demon, but the great light in heaven which was appointed
   "to rule by night," and which has no power to originate such a disorder
   among men.  But they all "speak unrighteousness loftily," as many as
   say, that the cause of all the disorders which exist on the earth,
   whether of such generally or of each in detail, arises from the
   disposition of the stars; and such have truly "set their mouth against
   the heaven," when they say that some of the stars have a malevolent,
   and others a benevolent influence; since no star was formed by the God
   of the universe to work evil, according to Jeremiah as it is written in
   the Lamentations, "Out of the mouth of the Lord shall come things noble
   and that which is good." [5872]   And it is probable that as this
   impure spirit, producing what is called lunacy, observes the phases of
   the moon, that it may work on him who for certain causes has been
   committed to it, and who has not made himself worthy of the
   guardianship of angels, so also there are other spirits and demons who
   work at certain phases of the rest of the stars; so that not the moon
   only, but the rest of the stars also may be calumniated by those "who
   speak unrighteousness loftily."  It is worth while, then, to listen to
   the casters of nativities, who refer the origin of every form of
   madness and every demoniacal possession to the phases of the moon.
   That those, then, who suffer from what is called lunacy sometimes fall
   into the water is evident, and that they also fall into the fire, less
   frequently indeed, yet it does happen; and it is evident that this
   disorder is very difficult to cure, so that those who have the power to
   cure demoniacs sometimes fail in respect of this, and sometimes with
   fastings and supplications and more toils, succeed.  But you will
   inquire whether there are such disorders in spirits as well as in men;
   so that some of them speak, but some of them are speechless, and some
   of them hear, but some are deaf; for as in them will be found the cause
   of their being impure, so also, because of their freedom of will, are
   they condemned to be speechless and deaf; for some men will suffer such
   condemnation if the prayer of the prophet, as spoken by the Holy
   Spirit, shall be given heed to, in which it is said of certain sinners,
   "Let the lying lips be put to silence." [5873]   And so, perhaps, those
   who make a bad use of their hearing, and admit the hearing of vanities,
   will be rendered deaf by Him who said, "Who hath made the stone-deaf
   and the deaf," [5874] so that they may no longer lend an ear to vain
   things.

   7.  The Power of Faith.

   But when the Saviour said, "O faithfulness and perverse generation,"
   [5875] He signifies that wickedness, which is contrary to nature,
   stealthily enters in from perversity, and makes us perverted.  But of
   the whole race of men on earth, I think, being oppressed by reason of
   their wickedness and His tarrying with them, the Saviour said, "How
   long shall I be with you?"  We have already, then, spoken in part of
   the words, "If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say
   unto this mountain," [5876] etc.; but nevertheless also we shall speak
   in this place the things that appear to us fitted to increase
   perspicuity.  The mountains here spoken of, in my opinion, are the
   hostile powers that have their being in a flood of great wickedness,
   such as are settled down, so to speak, in some souls of men.  Whenever,
   then, any one has all faith so that he no longer disbelieves in any
   things which are contained in the Holy Scriptures, and has faith such
   as was that of Abraham, who believed in God to such a degree that his
   faith was counted for righteousness. he has all faith as a grain of
   mustard seed; then will such an one say to this mountain--I mean, the
   dumb and deaf spirit in him who is called lunatic,--"Remove hence,"
   clearly, from the man who is suffering, perhaps to the abyss, and it
   shall remove.  And the Apostle, taking, I think. his starting-point
   from this place, says with apostolical authority, "If I have all faith
   so as to remove mountains," [5877] for not one mountain merely, but
   also several analogous to it, he removes who has all faith which is as
   a grain of mustard-seed; and nothing shall be impossible to him who has
   so great faith. [5878]   But let us also attend to this, "This kind
   goeth not out save by prayer and fasting," [5879] in order that if at
   any time it is necessary that we should be engaged in the healing of
   one suffering from such a disorder, we may not adjure, nor put
   questions, nor speak to the impure spirit as if it heard, but devoting
   ourselves to prayer and fasting, may be successful as we pray for the
   sufferer, and by our own fasting may thrust out the unclean spirit from
   him.

   8.  Jesus' Prediction of His "Delivery" Into the Hands of Men.

   "And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man
   shall be delivered into the hands of men." [5880]   And these things
   will appear to be of the same effect as those, "that Jesus began to
   show unto His disciples that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many
   things of the elders and chief priests and scribes." [5881]   But it is
   not so; for it is not the same thing "to show unto the disciples that
   He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and
   chief priests and scribes," and, after suffering, "be killed," and,
   after being killed, "be raised up on the third day," as that which was
   said to them, when they were in Galilee,--which we did not learn
   before,--that the Son of man "would be delivered up;" for the being
   delivered up was not mentioned above, but now also it is said that "He
   is to be delivered up into the hands of men." [5882]   As for these
   matters let us inquire by what person or persons He will be delivered
   up into the hands of men; for there we are taught of whom He will
   suffer, and in what place He will suffer; but here, in addition, we
   learn that while His suffering many things takes place at the hands of
   the aforesaid, they are not the prime causes of His suffering many
   things, but the one or ones who delivered Him up into the hands of
   men.  For some one will say that the Apostle, interpreting this, says
   with reference to God, "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered
   Him up for us all;" [5883] but the Son also gave Himself to death for
   us, so that He was delivered up, not only by the Father but also by
   Himself.  But another will say not merely that, but also collecting the
   passages together, will say that the Son is first delivered up by
   God,--then about to be tempted, then to be in conflict, then to suffer
   for men, or even for the whole world that He might take away its sin,
   [5884] --to the prince of this age, and to the rest of its princes, and
   then by them delivered into the hands of men who would slay Him.  The
   case of Job will be taken as an illustration.  "Lo, all that is his I
   give into thy hands, but do not touch him;" [5885] thereafter, he was,
   as it were, delivered up by the devil to his princes, namely, to those
   who took prisoners of war, to the horsemen, to the fire that came down
   from heaven, to the great wind that came from the desert and broke up
   his house. [5886]   But you will consider if, as he delivered up the
   property of Job to those who took them captive, and to the horsemen, so
   also he delivered them up to a certain power, subordinate to "the
   prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the
   sons of disobedience," [5887] in order that the fire which descended
   thence on the sheep of Job might seem to fall from heaven, to the man
   who announced to Job that "fire fell from heaven, and burned up his
   sheep, and consumed the shepherds likewise." [5888]   And in the same
   way you will inquire whether also the sudden mighty wind, that came
   down from the desert and assailed the four corners of the dwelling, was
   one of those which are under the devils to whom the devil delivered up
   the banquet of the sons and daughters of Job, that the house might fall
   on the children of the just man, and they might die.  Let it be
   granted, then, that, as in the case of Job, the Father first delivered
   up the Son to the opposing powers, and that then they delivered Him up
   into the hands of men, among which men Judas also was, into whom after
   the sop [5889] Satan entered, who delivered Him up in a more
   authoritative manner than Judas.  But take care lest on comparing
   together the delivering up of the Son by the Father to the opposing
   powers, with the delivering up of the Saviour by them into the hands of
   men, you should think that what is called the delivering up is the same
   in the case of both.  For understand that the Father in His love of men
   delivered Him up for us all; but the opposing powers, when they
   delivered up the Saviour into the hands of men, did not intend to
   deliver Him up for the salvation of some, but, as far as in them lay,
   since none of them knew "the wisdom of God which was hidden in a
   mystery," [5890] they gave Him up to be put to death, that His enemy
   death might receive Him under its subjection, like those who die in
   Adam; [5891] and also the men who slew Him did so, as they were moulded
   after the will of those who wished indeed that Jesus should become
   subject to death.  I have deemed it necessary also to examine into
   these things, because that when Jesus was delivered up into the hands
   of men, He was not delivered up by men into the hands of men, but by
   powers to whom the Father delivered up His Son for us all, and in the
   very act of His being delivered up, and coming under the power of those
   to whom He was delivered up, destroying him that has the power of
   death; for "through death He brought to nought him that hath the power
   of death, that is, the devil, and delivered all them who through fear
   of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage." [5892]

   9.  Satan and the "Delivery" Of Jesus.

   Now we must think that the devil has the power of death,--not of that
   which is common and indifferent, in accordance with which those who are
   compacted of soul and body die, when their soul is separated from the
   body,--but of that death which is contrary to and the enemy of Him who
   said, "I am the Life," [5893] in accordance with which "the soul that
   sinneth, it shall die." [5894]   But that it was not God who gave Him
   up into the hands of men, the Saviour manifestly declares when He says,
   "If My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight that I
   should not be delivered to the Jews." [5895]   For, when He was
   delivered up to the Jews, He was delivered into the hands of men, not
   by His own servants, but by the prince of this age who says, concerning
   the powers which are in the sphere of the invisible, the kingdoms which
   are set up against men, "All these things will I give Thee, if Thou
   wilt fall down and worship Me." [5896]   Wherefore also we should think
   that in regard to them it was said, "The kings of the earth stood side
   by side, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and
   against His Christ." [5897]   And those kings, indeed, and those rulers
   stood side by side and were gathered against the Lord and against His
   Christ; but we, because we have been benefited by His being delivered
   by them into the hands of men and slain, say, "Let us break their bonds
   asunder and cast away their yoke from us." [5898]   For, when we become
   conformed to the death of Christ, we are no longer under the bonds of
   the kings of the earth, as we have said, nor under the yoke of the
   princes of this age, who were gathered together against the Lord.  And,
   on this account, "the Father spared not His own Son, but delivered Him
   up for us all," [5899] that those, who took Him and delivered Him up
   into the hands of men, might be laughed at by Him who dwells in the
   heavens, and might be derided by the Lord, inasmuch as, contrary to
   their expectation, it was to the destruction of their own kingdom and
   power, that they received from the Father the Son, who was raised on
   the third day, by having abolished His enemy death, and made us
   conformed, not only to the image of His death but also of His
   resurrection; through whom we walk in newness of life, [5900] no longer
   sitting "in the region and shadow of death," [5901] through the light
   of God which has sprung up upon us.  But when the Saviour said, "The
   Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall
   kill Him, and the third day He shall rise again," they were "exceeding
   sorry," [5902] giving heed to the fact that He was about to be
   delivered up into the hands of men, and that He would be killed, as
   matters gloomy and calling for sorrow, but not attending to the fact
   that He would rise on the third day, as He needed no longer time "to
   bring to nought through death him that had the power of death." [5903]

   10.  Concerning Those Who Demanded the Half-Shekel.

   "And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the
   half-shekel came to Peter." [5904]   There are certain kings of the
   earth, and the sons of these do not pay toll or tribute; and there are
   others, different from their sons, who are strangers to the kings of
   the earth, from whom the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute.
   And among the kings of the earth, their sons are free as among fathers;
   but those who are strangers to them, while they are free in relation to
   things beyond the earth, are as slaves in respect of those who lord it
   over them and keep them in bondage; as the Egyptians lorded it over the
   children of Israel, and greatly afflicted their life and violently held
   them in bondage. [5905]   It was for the sake of those who were in a
   bondage, corresponding to the bondage of the Hebrews, that the Son of
   God took upon Him only the form of a slave, [5906] doing no work that
   was foul or servile.  As then, having the form of that slave, He pays
   toll and tribute not different from that which was paid by His
   disciple; for the same stater sufficed, even the one coin which was
   paid for Jesus and His disciple.  But this coin was not in the house of
   Jesus, but it was in the sea, and in the mouth of a fish of the sea
   which, in my judgment, was benefited when it came up and was caught in
   the net of Peter, who became a fisher of men, in which net was that
   which is figuratively called a fish, in order also that the coin with
   the image of Cæsar might be taken from it, and that it might take its
   place among those which were caught by them who have learned to become
   fishers of men.  Let him, then, who has the things of Cæsar render them
   to Cæsar, [5907] that afterwards he may be able to render to God the
   things of God.  But since Jesus, who was "the image of the invisible
   God," [5908] had not the image of Cæsar, for "the prince of this age
   had nothing in Him," [5909] on this account He takes from its own
   place, the sea, the image of Cæsar, that He may give it to the kings of
   the earth for Himself and His disciple, so that those who receive the
   half-shekel might not imagine that Jesus was the debtor of them and of
   the kings of the earth; for He paid the debt, not having taken it up,
   nor having possessed it, nor having acquired it, nor at any time having
   made it His own possession, so that the image of Cæsar might never be
   along with the image of the invisible God.

   11.  The Freedom of Sons.

   And this may be put in another way.  There are some who are kings' sons
   on the earth, and yet they are not sons of those kings, but sons, and
   sons absolutely; but others, because of their being strangers to the
   sons of the kings of the earth, and sons of no one of those upon the
   earth, but on this very account are sons, whether of God or of His Son,
   or of some one of those who are God's.  If, then, the Saviour inquires
   of Peter, saying, "The kings of the earth from whom do they receive
   toll or tribute--from their own sons or from strangers?" [5910] and
   Peter replies not from their own sons, but "from strangers," then Jesus
   says about such as are strangers to the kings of the earth, and on
   account of being free are sons, "Therefore the sons are free;" [5911]
   for the sons of the kings of the earth are not free, since "every one
   that committeth sin is the bond-servant of sin," [5912] but they are
   free who abide in the truth of the word of God, and on this account,
   know the truth, that they also may become free from sin.  If, any one
   then, is a son simply, and not in this matter wholly a son of the kings
   of the earth, he is free.  And nevertheless, though he is free, he
   takes care not to offend even the kings of the earth, and their sons,
   and those who receive the half-shekel; wherefore He says, "Let us not
   cause them to stumble, but go thou and cast thy net, and take up the
   fish that first cometh up," [5913] etc.  But I would inquire of those
   who are pleased to make myths about different natures, of what sort of
   nature they were, whether the kings of the earth, or their sons, or
   those who receive the half-shekel, whom the Saviour does not wish to
   offend; it appears of a verity, ex hypothesi, that they are not of a
   nature worthy of praise, and yet He took heed not to cause them to
   stumble, and He prevents any stumbling-block being put in their way,
   that they may not sin more grievously, and that with a view to their
   being saved--if they will--even by receiving Him who has spared them
   from being caused to stumble.  And as in a place verily of
   consolation,--for such is, by interpretation, Capernaum,--comforting
   the disciple as being both free and a son, He gives to him the power of
   catching the fish first, that when it came up Peter might be comforted
   by its coming up and being caught, and by the stater being taken from
   its mouth, in order to be paid to those whose the stater was, and who
   demanded as their own such a piece of money.

   12.  The Stater Allegorized.

   But you might sometimes gracefully apply the passage to the lover of
   money, who has nothing in his mouth but things about silver, when you
   behold him healed by some Peter, who takes the stater, which is the
   symbol of all his avarice, not only from his mouth and words, but from
   his whole character.  For you will say that such an one was in the sea,
   and in the bitter affairs of life, and in the waves of the cares and
   anxieties of avarice, having the stater in his mouth when he was
   unbelieving and avaricious, but that he came up from the sea and was
   caught in the rational net, and being benefited by some Peter who has
   taught him the truth, no longer has the stater in his mouth, but in
   place of it those things which contain His image, the oracles of God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   13.  The Sacred Half-Shekel.

   Moreover to the saying, "They that received the half-shekel came to
   Peter," [5914] you will adduce from Numbers that, for the saints
   according to the law of God, is paid not a half-shekel simply, but a
   sacred half-shekel.  For it is written, "And thou shalt take five
   shekels per head, according to the sacred half-shekel." [5915]   But
   also on behalf of all the sons of Israel is given a sacred half-shekel
   per head.  Since then it was not possible for the saint of God to
   possess along with the sacred half-shekels the profane shekels, so to
   speak, on this account, to them who do not receive the sacred
   half-shekels, and who asked Peter and said, "Doth not your master pay
   the half-shekel?" the Saviour commands the stater to be paid, in which
   was the half-shekel which was found in the mouth of the first fish that
   came up, in order that it might be given for the Teacher and the
   disciple.

   14.  Concerning Those Who Said, Who is the Greatest? and Concerning the
   Child that Was Called by Jesus.

   "In that day came the disciples unto Jesus saying, Who then is greatest
   in the kingdom of heaven?" [5916]   In order that we might be taught
   what it was that the disciples came to Jesus and asked to learn of Him,
   and how He answered to their inquiry, Matthew, though he might have
   given an account of this very thing only, has added, according to some
   manuscripts, "In that hour the disciples came unto Jesus," but,
   according to others, "In that day;" and it is necessary that we should
   not leave the meaning of the evangelist without examination.  Wherefore
   giving attention to the words preceding "in that day," or "hour," let
   us see if it is possible from them to find a way to understand, as
   being necessary, the addition, "in that day," or "hour."  Jesus then
   had come to Capernaum along with His disciples, where "they that
   received the half-shekel came to Peter," and asked and said, "Doth not
   your Master pay the half-shekel?"  Then, when Peter answered and said
   to them, Yea, Jesus giving further a defence with reference to the
   giving of the half-shekel, sends Peter to drag up the fish into the
   net, in the mouth of which He said that a stater would be found which
   was to be given for Himself and Peter.  It seems to me, then, that
   thinking that this was a very great honour which had been bestowed on
   Peter by Jesus, who judged that he was greater than the rest of His
   friends, they wished to learn accurately the truth of their suspicion,
   by making inquiry of Jesus and hearing from Him, whether, as they
   supposed, He had judged that Peter was greater than they; and at the
   same time also they hoped to learn the ground on which Peter had been
   preferred to the rest of the disciples.  Matthew then, I think, wishing
   to make this plain, has subjoined to the words "that take"--the stater,
   to-wit--"and give unto them for thee and me," the words, "In that day
   came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is the greatest in the
   kingdom of heaven?" [5917]   And, perhaps, they were also in doubt
   because of the preference which had been given to the three at the
   transfiguration, and they were in doubt about this--which of the three
   was judged by the Lord to be greatest.  For John reclined on His breast
   through love, and we may conclude that before the Supper they had seen
   many tokens of special honour given by Jesus to John; but Peter on his
   confession was called blessed in their hearing, because of his saying,
   "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God;" [5918] but again
   because of the saying, "Get thee behind Me, Satan; thou art a
   stumbling-block unto Me, for thou mindest not the things of God but the
   things of men," [5919] they were distracted in mind as to whether it
   was not he but one of the sons of Zebedee, that was the greatest.  So
   much for the words "in that day" or "hour," on which took place the
   matters relating to the stater.

   15.  Greatness Varies in Degree.

   But next we must seek to understand this:  the disciples came to Him,
   as disciples to a teacher proposing difficult questions, and making
   inquiry, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? [5920]   And,
   in this respect, we must imitate the disciples of Jesus; for if, at any
   time, any subject of investigation among us should not be found out let
   us go with all unanimity in regard to the question in dispute to Jesus,
   who is present where two or three are gathered together in His name,
   [5921] and is ready by His presence with power to illumine the hearts
   of those who truly desire to become His disciples, with a view to their
   apprehension of the matters under inquiry.  And likewise it would be
   nothing strange for us to go to any of those who have been appointed by
   God as teachers in the church, and propose any question of a like order
   to this, "Who, then, is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"  What,
   then, was already known to the disciples of the matters relating to
   this question?  And what was the point under inquiry?  That there is
   not equality in regard to those who are deemed worthy of the kingdom of
   heaven they had apprehended, and that, as there was not equality, some
   one was greatest, and so in succession down to the least:  but of what
   nature was the greatest, and what was the way of life of him who was
   the least, and who occupied the middle position, they further desired
   to know; unless, indeed, it is more accurate to say that they knew who
   was least from the words, "Whosoever shall break one of these least
   commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the
   kingdom of heaven;" but who was the greatest of all they did not know,
   even if they had grasped the meaning of the words, "Whosoever shall do
   and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
   heaven;" [5922] for as there were many great, it was not clear to them
   who was the greatest of the great, to use a human standard.  And that
   many are great, but the great not equally great, will be manifest from
   the ascription of the epithet "great" to Isaac, "who waxed great, and
   became exceedingly great," [5923] and from what is said in the case of
   Moses, and John the Baptist, and the Saviour.  And every one will
   acknowledge that even though all these were great according to the
   Scripture, yet the Saviour was greater than they.  But whether John
   also (than whom there was no greater among those born of women), [5924]
   was greater than Isaac and Moses, or whether he was not greater, but
   equal to both, or to one of them, it would be hazardous to declare.
   And from the saying, "But Isaac, waxing great, became greater," [5925]
   until he became not simply great, but with the twice repeated addition,
   "exceedingly," we may learn that there is a difference among the great,
   as one is great, and another exceedingly great, and another exceedingly
   exceedingly great.  The disciples, therefore, came to Jesus and sought
   to learn, who was the greatest in the kingdom of heaven; and perhaps
   they wished to learn, hearing from Him sometimes like this, "A certain
   one is greatest in the kingdom of heaven;" but He gives a universal
   turn to the discourse, showing what was the quality of him who was
   greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  Let us seek to understand, from
   what is written, to the best of our ability, who this is.  "For Jesus
   called a little child," [5926] etc.

   16.  Why the Great are Compared to Little Children.

   But first we may expound it in simple fashion.  One, expounding the
   word of the Saviour here after the simple method, might say that, if
   any one who is a man mortifies the lusts of manhood, putting to death
   by the spirit the deeds of the body, and "always bearing about in the
   body the putting to death of Jesus," [5927] to such a degree that he
   has the condition of the little child who has not tasted sensual
   pleasures, and has had no conception of the impulses of manhood, then
   such an one is converted, and has become as the little children.  And
   the greater the advance he has made towards the condition of the little
   children in regard to such emotions, by so much the more as compared
   with those who are in training and have not advanced to so great a
   height of self-control, is he the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
   But that which has been said about little children in respect of
   lustful pleasures, the same might also be said in regard to the rest of
   the affections and infirmities and sicknesses of the soul, into which
   it is not the nature of little children to fall, who have not yet fully
   attained to the possession of reason; as, for example, that, if any one
   be converted, and, though a man, such an one becomes as a child in
   respect of anger; and, as is the child in relation to grief, so that
   sometimes he laughs and plays at the very time that his father or
   mother or brother is dead, he who is converted would become such an one
   as little children; and, having received from the Word a disposition
   incapable of grief, so that he becomes like the little child in regard
   to grief.  And the like you will say about what is called pleasure, in
   regard to which the wicked are irrationally lifted up, from which
   little children do not suffer, nor such as have been converted and
   become as little children.  As, then, it has been accurately
   demonstrated also by others, that no passion is incident to the little
   children who have not yet attained to full possession of reason; and if
   no passion, clearly fear also; but, if there be anything corresponding
   to the passions, these are faint, and very quickly suppressed, and
   healed in the case of little children, so that he is worthy of love,
   who, being converted as the little children, has reached such a point
   as to have, as it were, his passions in subjection like the little
   children.  And with regard to fear, therefore, similar things to those
   spoken might be conceived, that the little children do not experience
   the fear of the wicked, but a different thing, to which those who have
   an accurate knowledge of questions in regard to the passions and their
   names give the name of fear; as, for example, in the case of children
   there is a forgetfulness of their evils at the very time of their
   tears, for they change in a moment, and laugh and play along with those
   who were thought to grieve and terrify them, but in truth had wrought
   in them no such emotion.  So too, moreover, one will humble himself
   like the little child which Jesus called; for neither haughtiness, nor
   conceit in respect of noble birth, or wealth, or any of those things
   which are thought to be good, but are not, comes to a little child.
   Wherefore you may see those who are not altogether infants, up to three
   or four years of age, like to those who are of mean birth, though they
   may seem to be of noble birth, and not appearing at all to love rich
   children rather than the poor.  If, therefore, in the same way as
   according to their age children are affected towards those passions
   which exalt the senseless, the disciple of Jesus under the influence of
   reason [5928] has humbled himself like the little child which Jesus
   showed, not being exalted because of vainglory, nor puffed up on the
   ground of wealth, or raiment, nor elated because of noble birth, in
   particular are they to be received and imitated in the name of Jesus,
   who have been converted as the Word showed, like the little child which
   Jesus took to Him; since especially in such the Christ is, and
   therefore He says, "Whosoever shall receive one such little child in My
   name receiveth Me." [5929]

   17.  The Little Ones and Their Stumbling-Blocks.

   But it is a hard task to expound what follows in logical harmony with
   what has already been said; for one might say, how is it that he who is
   converted and has become as the little children, is a little one among
   such as believe in Jesus, and is capable of being caused to stumble?
   And likewise let us attempt to explain this coherently.  Every one that
   gives his adherence to Jesus as the Son of God according to the true
   history concerning Him, and by deeds done according to the Gospel, is
   on the way to living the life which is according to virtue, is
   converted and is on the way towards becoming as the little children;
   and it is impossible for him not to enter into the kingdom of heaven.
   There are, indeed, many such; but not all, who are converted with a
   view to becoming like the little children, have reached the point of
   being made like unto little children; but each wants so much of the
   likeness to the little children, as he falls short of the disposition
   of little children towards the passions, of which we have spoken.  In
   the whole multitude, then, of believers, are also those who, having
   been, as it were, just converted in regard to their becoming as the
   little children, at the very point of their conversion that they may
   become as the little children, are called little; and those of them,
   who are converted that they may become as the little children, but fall
   far short of having truly become as the little children, are capable of
   being caused to stumble; each of whom falls so far short of the
   likeness to them, as he falls short of the disposition of children
   towards the passions, of which we have spoken, to whom we ought not to
   give occasions of stumbling-block; but, if it be otherwise, he who has
   caused him to stumble will require, as contributing towards his cure,
   to have "an ass's millstone hanged about his neck, and be sunk into the
   depths of the sea." [5930]   For, in this way, when he has paid the due
   penalty in the sea, where is "the dragon which God formed to play in
   it," [5931] and, so far as is expedient for the end in view, has been
   punished and undergone suffering, he shall then [5932] have his part in
   those troubles which belong to the depths of the sea, which he endured
   when he was dragged down by the ass's millstone.  For there are also
   differences of millstones, so that one of them may be, so to call it,
   the millstone of a man, and another that of an ass; and that is human,
   about which it is written, "Two women shall be grinding at the mill;
   one is taken and one is left;" [5933] but the millstone of the ass is
   that which shall be put round him who has given occasion of
   stumbling-block.  But some one might say--I know not whether he would
   speak soundly or erroneously--that the ass's millstone is the heavy
   body of the wicked man, which is sunken downwards, and which he will
   receive at the resurrection that he may be sunk in the abyss which is
   called the depth of the sea, where "is the dragon which God formed to
   play therein." [5934]   But another will refer the creating of a
   stumbling-block to one of the little ones to the powers that are unseen
   by men; for from these arise many stumbling-blocks to the little ones
   pointed out by Jesus.  But when they cause to stumble one of the little
   ones pointed out by Jesus, who are believers in Him, he shall assume an
   ass's millstone, the corruptible body which presses heavily on the
   soul, which is itself hung from the neck, which is dragged down to the
   affairs in this life, that by means of these their conceit may be taken
   away, and having paid the penalty, they shall come, through means of
   the ass's millstone, to the condition expedient for them.

   18.  Who Was the Little Child Called by Jesus.

   Now another interpretation different from what is called the simpler
   may be uttered; whether as dogma, or for the sake of exercise, so to
   speak, let us also inquire what was the little child who was called by
   Jesus and set in the midst of the disciples.  Now consider if you can
   say that the little child, whom Jesus called, was the Holy Spirit who
   humbled Himself, when He was called by the Saviour, and set in the
   midst of the reason of the disciples of Jesus; if, indeed, He wishes
   us, being turned away from everything else, to be turned towards the
   examples suggested by the Holy Spirit, so that we may so become as the
   little children, who are themselves also turned and likened to the Holy
   Spirit; which little children God gave to the Saviour, according to
   what is said in Isaiah, "Behold, I and the little children which God
   has given to me." [5935]   And it is not possible for any one to enter
   into the kingdom of heaven, who has not been turned away from the
   affairs of this world, and made like unto the little children who
   possess the Holy Spirit; which Holy Spirit was called by Jesus, and,
   descending from His own perfection to men as a little child, was set by
   Jesus in the midst of the disciples.  It is necessary, then, for him
   who has turned away from the desires of this world to humble himself
   not simply as the little child, but, according to what is written, "as
   this little child." [5936]   But to humble oneself as that little child
   is to imitate the Holy Spirit, who humbled Himself for the salvation of
   men.  Now, that the Saviour and the Holy Spirit were sent by the Father
   for the salvation of men has been declared in Isaiah, in the person of
   the Saviour, saying, "And now the Lord hath sent me and His Spirit."
   [5937]   You must know, however, that this expression is ambiguous; for
   either God sent, but also the Holy Spirit sent, the Saviour; or, as we
   have taken it, the Father sent both--the Saviour and the Holy Spirit.
   He, therefore, who has humbled himself more than all those who have
   humbled themselves in imitation of that little child, is the greatest
   in the kingdom of heaven.  For there are many who are willing to humble
   themselves as that little child; but the man, who in every respect has
   become like to the little child who humbled himself, in the name of
   Jesus--especially in Jesus Himself,--in reality, would be found to be
   he who is named greater than all in the kingdom of heaven.  But as he
   receives Jesus, whosoever receives one such of the little children in
   His name, so he rejects Jesus and casts Him out, who does not wish to
   receive one such little child in the name of Jesus.  But if, also,
   there is a difference in those who are deemed worthy of the Holy
   Spirit, as believers receive more or less of the Holy Spirit, there
   would be some little ones among those who believe in God who can be
   made to stumble:  to avenge whose being made to stumble the Word says,
   with reference to those who had caused them to stumble, "It is
   profitable for him that an ass's millstone should be hanged about his
   neck, and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea." [5938]   Let
   these things be said in regard to the passage of Matthew before us.

   19.  The Parallel Passages in Mark and Luke.

   But let us consider also the like account in the other Evangelists.
   Mark, [5939] then, says, that the Twelve reasoned in the way as to
   which of them was the greatest.  Wherefore He sat down, and called
   them, and teaches who is the greatest, saying, that he who became last
   of all by means of his moderation and gentleness, would as the greatest
   obtain the first place, so that he did not receive the place of one who
   was being ministered unto, but the place of one who ministered, and
   that not to some but not to others, but to all absolutely; for attend
   to the words, "If any man would be first he shall be last of all, and
   minister of all." [5940]   And next to that He says, that "He,"--Jesus
   to-wit--"took a little child, and set him in the midst of His own
   disciples, and taking him in His arms, He said unto them, Whosoever
   shall receive one of the little children in My name receiveth Me."
   [5941]   But what was the little child which Jesus took and placed in
   His arms, according to the deeper meaning in the passage?  Was it the
   Holy Spirit?  And to this little child, indeed, some were likened, of
   whom He said, "Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in
   My name receiveth Me."  According to Luke, however, the reasoning did
   not arise spontaneously in the disciples, but was suggested to them by
   the question, "which of them should be greatest." [5942]   And Jesus,
   seeing the reasoning of their heart, as He had eyes that see the
   reasonings of hearts,--seeing the reasoning of their heart,--without
   being questioned, according to Luke, "took the little child and set
   him," not in the midst alone, as Matthew and Mark have said, but now,
   also, "by His side," and said to the disciples, not only, "Whosoever
   shall receive one such little child," or, "Whosoever shall receive one
   of such little ones in My name receiveth Me," but, now going even a
   step higher, "Whosoever shall receive this little child in My name
   receiveth Me." [5943]   It is necessary, therefore, according to Luke,
   to receive in the name of Jesus that very little child which Jesus took
   and placed by His side.  And I know not if there be any one who can
   interpret figuratively the word, "Whosoever shall receive this little
   child in My name."  For it is necessary that each of us should receive
   in the name of Jesus that little child which Jesus then took and set by
   His side; for he lives as immortal, and we must receive him from Jesus
   Himself in the name of Jesus; and without being separated from him,
   Jesus is with him who receives the little child, so that according to
   this it is said, "Whosoever shall receive this little child in My name
   receiveth Me."  Then, since the Father is inseparable from the Son, He
   is with him who receives the Son.  Wherefore it is said, "And whosoever
   shall receive Me receives Him that sent Me." [5944]   But he who has
   received the little child, and the Saviour, and Him that sent Him, is
   least of all the disciples of Jesus, making himself little.  But, so
   far as he belittles himself, to that extent does he become great; as
   that very thing, which caused him the more to make himself little,
   contributes to his advance in greatness; for attend to what is said,
   "He that is least among you all the same is great;" but in other
   manuscripts we read, "The same shall be great."  Now, according to
   Luke, "If any one shall not receive the kingdom of God as the little
   child, he shall in no wise enter therein." [5945]   And this expression
   is ambiguous; for either it means that he who receives the kingdom of
   God may become as a little child, or, that he may receive the kingdom
   of God, which has become to him as a little child.  And perhaps here
   those who receive the kingdom of God receive it, when it is as a little
   child, but in the world to come no longer as a little child; and they
   receive the greatness of the perfection in the spiritual manhood, so to
   speak, which perfection is manifested to all who in the present time
   receive it, when it is here as a little child.

   20.  The World and Offences.  Various Meanings of World.

   "Woe unto the world because of occasions of stumbling." [5946]   The
   expression "cosmos," is used in itself and absolutely in the passage,
   "He was in the cosmos and the cosmos knew Him not," [5947] but it is
   used relatively and in respect of its connection with that of which it
   is the cosmos, in the words, "Lest you look up to the heaven, and
   seeing the sun, and the moon, and all the cosmos of the heavens, you
   should stray and bow down to them and worship them." [5948]   And the
   like you will find in the Book of Esther, spoken about her, when it is
   written, stripping off all her "cosmos." [5949]   For the word
   "cosmos," simply, is not the same as the "cosmos" of heaven, or the
   "cosmos" of Esther; and this which we are now investigating is
   another.  I think, then, that the world is not this compacted whole of
   heaven and earth according to the Divine Scriptures, but only the place
   which is round about the earth, and this is not to be conceived in
   respect of the whole earth, but only in respect of ours which is
   inhabited; for the true light "was in the world," that is, in the place
   which is around, conceived in relation to our part of the earth; "and
   the world knew Him not," [5950] that is, the men in the region round
   about, and perhaps also the powers that have an affinity to this
   place.  For it is monstrous to understand by the world here the
   compacted whole formed of heaven and earth, and those in it; so that it
   could be said, that the sun and moon and the choir of the stars and the
   angels in all this world, did not know the true light, and, though
   ignorant of it, preserved the order which God had appointed for them.
   But when it is said by the Saviour in the prayer to the Father, "And,
   now, glorify me, O Father, with Thine own self, with the glory which I
   had with Thee before the world was," [5951] you must understand by the
   "world," that which is inhabited by us on the earth; for it was from
   this world that the Father gave men to the Son, in regard to whom alone
   the Saviour beseeches His Father, and not for the whole world of men.
   Moreover, also, when the Saviour says, "And I come to thee and am no
   longer in the world," [5952] He speaks of the terrestrial world; for it
   is not to be supposed that He spoke things contradictory when He said,
   "And I come to thee, and I am no longer in the world," and "I am in the
   world."  But also in this, "And these things I speak in the world,"
   [5953] we must think of the place round about the earth.  And this is
   clearly indicated also by the words, "And the world hated them, because
   they are not of the world." [5954]   For it hated us from the time when
   we no longer "look at the things which are seen, but at the things
   which are not seen," [5955] because of the teaching of Jesus; not the
   world of heaven and earth and them that are therein, all compacted
   together but the men on the earth along with us.  And the saying, "They
   are not of the world," [5956] is equivalent to, They are not of the
   place round about the earth.  And so also the disciples of Jesus are
   not of this world, as He was not of the world.  And further also the
   saying, "That the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me," [5957]
   twice spoken in the Gospel according to John, does not refer to the
   things that are superior to men, but to men who need to believe that
   the Father sent the Son into the world here.  Yea, and also in the
   Apostle, "Your faith is proclaimed in the whole world." [5958]

   21.  The "Woe" Does Not Apply to the Disciples of Jesus.

   But if there is woe unto men everywhere on the earth, because of
   occasions of stumbling to those who are laid hold of by them; but the
   disciples are not of the world, as they do not look at things seen,
   like as the Master is not of this world; to no one of the disciples of
   Jesus does the "woe because of occasions of stumbling" apply, since
   "great peace have they who love the law of God, and there is to them no
   occasion of stumbling." [5959]   But if any one seems to be called a
   disciple, but yet is of the world, because of his loving the world, and
   the things therein,--I mean, the life in the place round about the
   earth, and the property in it, or the possessions, or any form of
   wealth whatsoever,--so that the saying, "they are not of the world,"
   [5960] does not fit him; to him, as being really of the world, shall
   come that which happens to the world, the "woe, because of occasions of
   stumbling."  But let him who wishes to avoid this woe not be a lover of
   life, but let him say with Paul," "The world is crucified unto me, and
   I unto the world." [5961]   For the saints while "in the tabernacle, do
   groan being burdened" [5962] with "the body of humiliation," and do all
   things that they may become worthy to be found in the mystery of the
   resurrection, when God shall fashion anew the body of humiliation not
   of all, but of those who have been truly made disciples to Christ, so
   that it may be conformed to the body of the glory of Christ. [5963]
   For as none of the "woes" happen to any of the disciples of Christ, so
   does not this "woe, because of occasions of stumbling;" for, supposing
   that thousands of occasions should arise, they shall not touch those
   who are no longer of the world.  But if any one, because of his faith
   wanting ballast, and the instability of his submission in regard to the
   Word of God, is capable of being caused to stumble, let him know that
   he is not called by Jesus His disciple.  Now we must suppose that so
   many stumbling-blocks come, that, as a result, the woes extend not to
   some parts of the earth, but to the whole "world" which is in it.

   22.  What the "Occasions of Stumbling" Are.

   "And it must needs be that occasions of stumbling come," [5964] which I
   take to be different from the men by whom they come.  The occasions
   then which come are an army of the devil, his angels, and a wicked band
   of impure spirits, which, seeking out instruments through whom they
   will work, often find men altogether strangers to piety, and sometimes
   even some of those who are thought to believe the Word of God, for whom
   exists a worse woe than that which comes to him who is caused to
   stumble, just as also it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in
   the day of judgment, [5965] than for the places where Jesus did signs
   and wonders, and yet was not believed.  But as one might undertake to
   make a collection from the Scriptures of those who are pronounced
   blessed, and of the things in respect of which they are so called, so
   also he might undertake to do with the woes which are written, and
   those in whose case the woes are spoken.  But that the woe is worse in
   the case of him who causes to stumble, than in him who is made to
   stumble, you may prove by the passage, "Whoso shall cause to stumble
   one of these little ones which believe in Me, it is profitable for
   him," [5966] etc.; for, while the little one who is made to stumble
   receives retribution from him who caused him to stumble, it is
   expedient that the severe and intolerable punishment which is written
   should befall the man who has caused the stumbling.  But if we were to
   give more careful consideration to these things, we should be on our
   guard against sinning against the brethren, and wounding their
   conscience when it is weak, lest we sin against Christ; [5967] as often
   our brethren about us, "for whom Christ died," perish, not only through
   our knowledge, but also through some other causes connected with us; in
   the case of whom, we, sinning against Christ, shall pay the penalty,
   the soul of them who perish through us being required of us.

   23.  In What Sense "Necessary."

   Next we must test accurately the meaning of the word "necessity" in the
   passage, "For there is a necessity that the occasions come," [5968] and
   to the like effect in Luke, "It is inadmissible' but that occasions of
   stumbling should come," [5969] instead of "impossible."  And as it is
   necessary that that which is mortal should die, and it is impossible
   but that it should die, and as it must needs be that he who is in the
   body should be fed, for it is impossible for one who is not fed to
   live, so it is necessary and impossible but that occasions of stumbling
   should arise, since there is a necessity also that wickedness should
   exist before virtue in men, from which wickedness stumbling-blocks
   arise; for it is impossible that a man should be found altogether
   sinless, and who, without sin, has attained to virtue.  For the
   wickedness in the evil powers, which is the primal source of the
   wickedness among men, is altogether eager to work through certain
   instruments against the men in the world.  And perhaps also the wicked
   powers are more exasperated when they are cast out by the word of
   Jesus, and their worship is lessened, their customary sacrifices not
   being offered unto them; and there is a necessity that these offences
   come; but there is no necessity that they should come through any
   particular one; wherefore the "woe" falls on the man through whom the
   stumbling-block comes, as he has given a place to the wicked power
   whose purpose it is to create a stumbling-block.  But do not suppose
   that by nature, and from constitution, there are certain
   stumbling-blocks which seek out men through whom they come; for as God
   did not make death, so neither did He create stumbling-blocks; but
   free-will begot the stumbling-blocks in some who did not wish to endure
   toils for virtue.

   24.  The Offending Hand, or Foot, or Eye.

   And it is well, then, if the eye and the hand are deserving of praise,
   that the eye cannot with reason say to the hand, "I have no need of
   thee." [5970]   But if any one in the whole body of the congregations
   of the church, who because of his practical gifts has the name of hand,
   should change and become a hand causing to stumble, let the eye say to
   such a hand, "I have no need of thee," and, saying it, let him cut it
   off and cast it from him. [5971]   And so it is well, if any head be
   blessed, and the feet worthy of the blessed head, so that the head
   observing the things which are becoming to itself, may not be able to
   say to the feet, "I have no need of you."  If, however, any foot be
   found to become a stumbling-block to the whole body, let the head say
   to such a foot, "I have no need of thee," and having cast it off, let
   him cast it from himself; for even it is much better that the rest of
   the body should enter into life, wanting the foot or the hand which
   caused the stumbling-block, rather than, when the stumbling-block has
   spread over the whole body, it should be cast into the hell of fire
   with the two feet or the two hands.  And so it is well, that he who can
   become the eye of the whole body should be worthy of Christ and of the
   whole body; but if such an eye should ever change, and become a
   stumbling-block to the whole body, it is well to take it out and cast
   it outside the whole body, and that the rest of the body without that
   eye should be saved, rather than that along with it, when the whole
   body has been corrupted, the whole body should be cast into the hell of
   fire. [5972]   For the practical faculty of the soul, if prone to sin,
   and the walking faculty of the soul, so to speak, if prone to sin, and
   the faculty of clear vision, if prone to sin, may be the hand that
   causes to stumble, and the foot that causes to stumble, and the eye
   that causes to stumble, which things it is better to cast away, and
   having put them aside to enter into life without them, like as one
   halt, or maimed, or one-eyed, rather than along with them to lose the
   whole soul.  And likewise in the case of the soul it is a good and
   blessed thing to use its power for the noblest ends; but if we are
   going to lose one for any cause, it is better to lose the use of it,
   that along with the other powers we may be saved.

   25.  The Eye or Hand Allegorized.

   And it is possible to apply these words also to our nearest kinsfolk,
   who are our members, as it were; being considered to be our members,
   because of the close relationship; whether by birth, or from any
   habitual friendship, so to speak; whom we must not spare if they are
   injuring our soul.  For let us cut off from ourselves as a hand or a
   foot or an eye, a father or mother who wishes us to do that which is
   contrary to piety, and a son or daughter who, as far as in them lies,
   would have us revolt from the church of Christ and the love of Him.
   But even if the wife of our bosom, or a friend who is kindred in soul,
   become stumbling-blocks to us, let us not spare them, but let us cut
   them out from ourselves, and cast them outside of our soul, as not
   being truly our kindred but enemies of our salvation; for "whosoever
   hates not his father, and mother," [5973] and the others subjoined,
   when it is the fitting season to hate them as enemies and assailants,
   that he may be able to win Christ, this man is not worthy of the Son of
   God.  And in respect of these we may say, that from a critical position
   any lame one, so to speak, is saved, when he has lost a foot--say a
   brother--and alone obtains the inheritance of the kingdom of God; and a
   maimed one is saved, when his father is not saved, but they perish,
   while he is separated from them, that he alone may obtain the
   benedictions.  And so also any one is saved with one eye, who has cut
   out the eye of his own house, his wife, if she commit fornication, lest
   having two eyes he may go away into the hell of fire.

   26.  The Little Ones and Their Angels.

   "See that ye despise not one of these little ones." [5974]   It seems
   to me that as among the bodies of men there are differences in point of
   size,--so that some are little, and others great, and others of middle
   height, and, again, there are differences among the little, as they are
   more or less little, and the same holds of the great, and of those of
   middle height,--so also among the souls of men, there are some things
   which give them the stamp of littleness, and other things the stamp of
   greatness, so to speak, and generally, after the analogy of things
   bodily, other things the stamp of mediocrity.  But in the case of
   bodies, it is not due to the action of men but to the spermatic
   principles, that one is short and little, another great, and another of
   middle height; but in the case of souls, it is our free-will, and
   actions of such a kind, and habits of such a kind, that furnish the
   reason why one is great, or little, or of middle height; and it is of
   our free-will either by advancing in stature to increase our size, or
   not advancing to be short.  And so indeed I understand the words about
   Jesus having assumed a human soul, "Jesus advanced;" [5975] for as from
   the free-will there was an advance of His soul in wisdom and grace, so
   also in stature.  And the Apostle says, "Until we all attain unto a
   full-grown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of
   Christ;" [5976] for we must think that he attains unto a man, and that
   full-grown, according to the inner man, who has gone through the things
   of the child, and has reached the stage of the man, and has put away
   the things of the child, and generally, has perfected the things of the
   man. [5977]   And so we must suppose that there is a certain measure of
   spiritual stature unto which the most perfect soul can attain by
   magnifying the Lord, and become great.  Thus, then, these became great,
   of whom this is written, Isaac, and Moses, and John, and the Saviour
   Himself above all; for also about Him Gabriel said, "He shall be
   great;" [5978] but the little ones are "the newborn babes which long
   for the reasonable milk which is without guile," [5979] such as stand
   in need of nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers, spoken of in Isaiah
   when he says, about the calling from the Gentiles, "And they shall
   bring the sons in the bosom, and take their daughters on the shoulders,
   and kings shall be thy nursing-fathers and their princesses thy
   nursing-mothers." [5980]   For these reasons you will, then, attend to
   the word, "Do not despise one of these little ones," [5981] and
   consider whether it is their angels who bring them in their bosom,
   since they have become sons, and also take on their shoulders what are
   called daughters, and whether from them are the nursing-fathers who are
   called kings, and the nursing-mothers who are called princesses.  And
   since the little ones, pointed out by our Saviour, are under the
   stewardship as of nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers, on this account
   I think that Moses, who believed that he had been already assigned a
   place among the ranks of the great, said, with regard to the promise,
   "My angel shall go before you," [5982]   "If thou thyself do not go
   along with me, carry me not up hence." [5983]   For though the little
   one even be an heir, yet as being a child he differs nothing from a
   servant when he is a child, [5984] and to the extent to which he is
   little "has the spirit of bondage to fear;" [5985] but he who is not at
   all any longer such has no longer the spirit of bondage, but already
   the spirit of adoption, when "perfect love casteth out fear;" [5986] it
   will be plain to thee, how that according to these things "the angel of
   the Lord" is said "to encamp round about them that fear Him, and to
   save them." [5987]   But you will consider, according to these things
   also, whether these are indeed angels of the little ones "who are led
   by the spirit of bondage to fear," "when the angel of the Lord encamps
   round about them that fear Him and delivereth them;" but of the great,
   whether it is the Lord who is greater than the angels, who might say
   about each of them, "I am with him in affliction;" [5988] and, so long
   as we are imperfect, and need one to assist us that we may be delivered
   from evils, we stand in need of an angel of whom Jacob said, "The angel
   who delivered me from all the evils;" [5989] but, when we have become
   perfected, and have passed through the stage of being subject to
   nursing-fathers and nursing-mothers and guardians and stewards, [5990]
   we are meet to be governed by the Lord Himself.

   27.  When the Little Ones are Assigned to Angels.

   Then again one might inquire at what time those who are called their
   angels assume guardianship of the little ones pointed out by Christ;
   whether they received this commission to discharge concerning them,
   from what time "by the laver of regeneration," [5991] through which
   they were born "as new-born babes, they long for the reasonable milk
   which is without guile," [5992] and no longer are in subjection to any
   wicked power; or, whether from birth they had been appointed, according
   to the foreknowledge and predestination of God, over those whom God
   also foreknew, and foreordained to be conformed to the glory of the
   Christ. [5993]   And with reference to the view that they have angels
   from birth, one might quote, "He who separated me from my mother's
   womb," [5994] and, "From the womb of my mother thou hast been my
   protector," [5995] and, "He has assisted me from my mother's womb,"
   [5996] and, "Upon thee I was cast from my mother," [5997] and in the
   Epistle of Jude, "To them that are beloved in God the Father and are
   kept for Jesus Christ, being called," [5998] --kept completely by the
   angels who keep them.

   28.  Close Relationship of Angels to Their "Little Ones."

   With reference to the words, "When through the laver I became a child
   in Christ," [5999] it may be said, that there is no holy angel present
   with those who are still in wickedness, but that during the period of
   unbelief they are under the angels of Satan; [6000] but, after the
   regeneration, He who has redeemed us with His own blood consigns us to
   a holy angel, who also, because of his purity, beholds the face of
   God.  And a third exposition of this passage might be something like
   the following, which would say, that as it is possible for a man to
   change from unbelief to faith, and from intemperance to temperance, and
   generally from wickedness to virtue, so also it is possible that the
   angel, to whom any soul has been entrusted at birth, may be wicked at
   the first, but afterwards may at some time believe in proportion as the
   man believes, and may make such advance that he may become one of the
   angels who always behold the face of the Father in heaven, [6001]
   beginning from the time that he is yoked along with the man who was
   foreknown and foreordained to believe at that time, the judgments of
   God, which are unspeakable and unsearchable and like to the depths,
   fitly bringing together all this harmonious relationship--angels with
   men.  And it may be that as when a man and his wife are both
   unbelievers, sometimes it is the man who first believes and in time
   saves his wife, and sometimes the wife who begins and afterwards in
   time persuades her husband, so it happens with angels and with men.
   If, however, anything of this kind takes place in the case of other
   angels or not, you may seek out for yourself.  But consider whether it
   may not be appropriate to say something of this kind in regard to each
   angel who is so honoured according to the word of the Saviour, that he
   is said to behold always the face of the Father who is in heaven.  But
   since in what we said above, that the little ones have angels, but that
   the great have passed beyond such a position, some one will quote in
   opposition to us from the Acts of the Apostles, where it is written,
   that a certain maid Rhoda, when Peter knocked at the door, came to
   answer, and recognizing the voice of Peter, ran in and announced that
   Peter stood before the gate; but when they who were gathered together
   in the house wondered, and thought that it was quite impossible that
   Peter verily stood before the gate, they said, It is his angel. [6002]
     For the objector will say that, as they had learned once for all that
   each of the believers had some definite angel, they knew that Peter
   also had one.  But he, who adheres to what we have previously said,
   will say that the word of Rhoda was not necessarily a dogma, and
   perhaps also the word of those who did not accurately know, when one as
   being little and God-fearing is governed by angels, and when now by the
   Lord Himself.  After this, in order to establish our conception of the
   little one which we have brought forward, it will be said that we need
   no command about "not despising" in the case of the great, but we do
   need it in the case of the little; wherefore it is not merely said, "Do
   not despise one of these," pointing to all the disciples, but "one of
   these little ones," [6003] pointed out by Him, who sees the littleness
   and the greatness of the soul.

   29.  The Little Ones and the Perfect.

   But another might say that the perfect man is here called little,
   applying the word, "For he that is least among you all, the same is
   great," [6004] and will affirm that he who humbles himself and becomes
   a child in the midst of all that believe, though he be an apostle or a
   bishop, and becomes such "as when a nurse cherisheth her own children,"
   [6005] is the little one pointed out by Jesus, and that the angel of
   such an one is worthy to behold the face of God.  For to say that the
   little are here called perfect, according to the passage, "He that is
   least among you all, the same is great," [6006] and as Paul said, "Unto
   me who am less than the least of all saints was this grace given,"
   [6007] will seem to be in harmony with the saying, "Whoso shall cause
   one of these little ones to stumble," [6008] and "So it is not the will
   of My Father in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish."
   [6009]   For he, as has been stated, who is now little, could not be
   made to stumble nor perish, for "great peace have they who love the law
   of God, and there is no stumbling-block to them;" [6010] and he could
   not perish, who is least of all among all the disciples of Christ, and
   on this account becomes great; and, since he could not perish, he could
   say, "Who shall separate us from the love," [6011] etc.  But he who
   wishes to maintain this last exposition will say that the soul even of
   the just man is changeable, as Ezekiel also testifies, saying, that the
   righteous man may abandon the commandments of God, so that his former
   righteousness is not reckoned unto him; [6012] wherefore it is said,
   "Whoso shall cause to stumble one of these little ones, [6013] and, "It
   is not the will of My Father which is in heaven that one of these
   little ones should perish." [6014]

   30.  The Sinning Brother.

   "If thy brother sin against thee, go, shew him his fault between thee
   and him alone. [6016] "  He, then, who attends closely to the
   expression, in proof of the surpassing philanthropy of Jesus, will say,
   that as the words do not suggest a difference of sins, they will act in
   a singular manner and contrary to the goodness of Jesus, who supply the
   thought, that these words are to be understood as being limited in
   their application to lesser sins.  But another, also attending closely
   to the expression, and not wishing to introduce these extraneous
   thoughts, nor admitting that it is spoken about every sin, will say,
   that he who commits those great sins is not a brother, even if he be
   called a brother, as the Apostle says, "If any one that is named a
   brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, etc., with such
   an one not to eat;" [6017] for no one who is an idolater, or a
   fornicator, or covetous, is a brother; for if he, who seems to bear the
   name of Christ, though he is named a brother, has something of the
   features of these, he would not rightly be called a brother.  As then
   he, who says that such words are spoken about every sin, whether the
   sin be murder, or poisoning, or pæderasty, or anything of that sort,
   would give occasion of injury to the exceeding goodness of Christ, so,
   on the contrary, he who distinguishes between the brother and him who
   is called the brother, might teach that, in the case of the least of
   the sins of men, he who has not repented after the telling of the fault
   is to be reckoned as a Gentile and a publican, for sins which are "not
   unto death," [6018] or, as the law has described them in the Book of
   Numbers, not "death-bringing." [6019]   This would seem to be very
   harsh; for I do not think that any one will readily be found who has
   not been censured thrice for the same form of sin, say, reviling, with
   which revilers abuse their neighbours, or those who are carried away by
   passion, or for over-drinking, or lying and idle words, or any of those
   things which exist in the masses.  You will inquire, therefore, whether
   any observation of the passage has escaped the notice of those, who are
   influenced by their conception of the goodness of the Word, and grant
   pardon to those who have committed the greatest sins, as well as of
   those who teach that, in the case of the very least sins, he is to be
   reckoned as a Gentile and a publican, making him a stranger to the
   church, after he has committed three very trivial transgressions.  But
   the following seems to me to have been overlooked by both of them,
   namely, the words, "Thou hast gained thy brother." [6020]   It is
   assigned by the Word to him only who heard, and He no longer applies it
   in the case of him who has stumbled twice or thrice and been censured;
   but that which was to be said about him who was censured twice or
   thrice, corresponding to the saying, "Thou hast gained thy brother," He
   has left in the air, so to speak.  He is not, therefore, altogether
   gained, nor will he altogether perish, or he will receive stripes.  And
   attend carefully to the first passage, "If he hear thee, thou hast
   gained thy brother," and to the second passage, which is literally, "If
   he hear thee not, take with thyself one or two more, that at the mouth
   of two or three witnesses every word may be established." [6021]
   What, then, will happen to him who has been censured for the second
   time, after every word has been established by two or three witnesses,
   He has left us to conceive.  And, again, "If he refuse to hear
   them"--manifestly, the witnesses who have been taken--"tell it," he
   says, "to the church;" [6022] and He does not say what he will suffer
   if he does not hear the church, but He taught that if he refused to
   hear the church, then he who had thrice admonished, and had not been
   heard, was to regard him for the future as the Gentile and the
   publican. [6023]   Therefore he is not altogether gained, nor will he
   altogether perish.  But what at all he will suffer, who at first did
   not hear, but required witnesses, or even refused to hear these, but
   was brought to the church, God knows; for we do not declare it,
   according to the precept, "Judge not that ye be not judged," [6024]
   "until the Lord come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of
   darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts." [6025]   But,
   with reference to the seeming harshness in the case of those who have
   committed less sins, one might say that it is not possible for him who
   has not heard twice in succession to hear the third time, so as, on
   this account, no longer to be as a Gentile or a publican, or no longer
   to stand in need of the censure in presence of all the church.  For we
   must bear in mind this, "So it is not the will of My Father in heaven
   that one of these little ones should perish." [6026]   For if "we must
   all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, that each one may receive
   the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it
   be good or bad," [6027] let each one with all his power do what he can
   so that he may not receive punishment for more evil things done in the
   body, even if he is going to receive back for all the wrongs which he
   has done; but it should be our ambition to procure the reward for a
   greater number of good deeds, since "with what measure we mete, it
   shall be measured to us," [6028] and, "according to the works of our
   own hands shall it happen unto us," [6029] and not in infinite wise,
   but either double or sevenfold shall sinners receive for their sins
   from the hand of the Lord; since He does not render unto any one
   according to the works of his hands, but more than that which he has
   done, for "Jerusalem," as Isaiah taught, "received from the hand of the
   Lord double for her sins;" [6030] but the neighbours of Israel, whoever
   they may be, will receive sevenfold, according to the following
   expression in the Psalms, "Render unto our neighbours sevenfold into
   their bosom the reproach with which they have reproached Thee, O Lord."
   [6031]   And other forms of payment in return could be found, which, if
   we apprehend, we shall know that to repent after any sin, whatever its
   greatness, is advantageous, in order that, in addition to our not being
   punished for more offences, there may be some hope left to us
   concerning good deeds done afterwards at some time, even though, before
   them, thousands of errors have been committed by anyone of us.  For it
   would be strange that evil deeds should be reckoned to any one, but the
   better which are done after the bad should profit nothing; which may
   also be learned from Ezekiel, [6032] by those who pay careful
   consideration to the things said about such cases.

   31.  The Power to Bind on Earth and in Heaven.

   But to me it seems that, to the case of him who after being thrice
   admonished was adjudged to be as the Gentile and the publican, it is
   fitly subjoined, "Verily, I say unto you,"--namely, to those who have
   judged any one to be as the Gentile and the publican,--"and what things
   soever ye shall bind on the earth," [6033] etc.; for with justice has
   he, who has thrice admonished and not been heard, bound him who is
   judged to be as a Gentile and a publican; wherefore, when such an one
   is bound and condemned by one of this character, he remains bound, as
   no one of those in heaven overturns the judgment of the man who bound
   him.  And, in like manner, he who was admonished once for all, and did
   things worthy of being gained, having been set free by the admonition
   of the man who gained him, and no longer bound by the cords of his own
   sins, [6034] for which he was admonished, shall be adjudged to have
   been set free by those in heaven.  Only, it seems to be indicated that
   the things, which above were granted to Peter alone, are here given to
   all who give the three admonitions to all that have sinned; so that, if
   they be not heard, they will bind on earth him who is judged to be as a
   Gentile and a publican, as such an one has been bound in heaven.  But
   since it was necessary, even if something in common had been said in
   the case of Peter and those who had thrice admonished the brethren,
   that Peter should have some element superior to those who thrice
   admonished, in the case of Peter, this saying "I will give to thee the
   keys of the kingdom of the heavens," [6035] has been specially set
   before the words, "And what things soever ye shall bind on earth,"
   etc.  And, indeed, if we were to attend carefully to the evangelical
   writings, we would also find here, and in relation to those things
   which seem to be common to Peter and those who have thrice admonished
   the brethren, a great difference and a pre-eminence in the things said
   to Peter, compared with the second class.  For it is no small
   difference that Peter received the keys not of one heaven but of more,
   and in order that whatsoever things he binds on the earth may be bound
   not in one heaven but in them all, as compared with the many who bind
   on earth and loose on earth, so that these things are bound and loosed
   not in the heavens, as in the case of Peter, but in one only; for they
   do not reach so high a stage, with power as Peter to bind and loose in
   all the heavens. [6036]   The better, therefore, is the binder, so much
   more blessed is he who has been loosed, so that in every part of the
   heavens his loosing has been accomplished.

   Book XIV.

   1.  The Power of Harmony in Relation to Prayer.

   "Again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree [6037] on earth as
   touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them."
   [6038]   The word symphony is strictly applied to the harmonies of
   sounds in music.  And there are indeed among musical sounds some
   accordant and others discordant.  But the Evangelic Scripture is
   familiar with the name as applied to musical matters in the passage,
   "He heard a symphony and dancing." [6039]   For it was fitting that
   when the son who had been lost and found came by penitence into concord
   with his father a symphony should be heard on the occasion of the
   joyous mirth of the house.  But the wicked Laban was not acquainted
   with the word symphony in his saying to Jacob, "And if thou hadst told
   me I would have sent thee away with mirth and with music and with drums
   and a harp." [6040]   But akin to the symphony of this nature is that
   which is written in the second Book of Kings when "the brethren of
   Aminadab went before the ark, and David and his son played before the
   Lord on instruments artistically fitted with might and with songs;"
   [6041] for the instruments thus fitted with might and with songs, had
   in themselves the musical symphony which is so powerful that when two
   only, bring along with the symphony which has relation to the music
   that is divine and spiritual, a request to the Father in heaven about
   anything whatsoever, the Father grants the request to those who ask
   along with the symphony on earth,--which is most miraculous,--those
   things which those who have made the symphony spoken of may have
   asked.  So also I understand the apostolic saying "Defraud ye not one
   the other except it be by agreement for a season that ye may give
   yourselves unto prayer." [6042]   For since the word harmony is applied
   to those who marry according to God in the passage from Proverbs which
   is as follows:  "Fathers will divide their house and substance to their
   sons, but from God the woman is married to the man," [6043] it is a
   logical consequence of the harmony being from God, that the name and
   the deed should enjoy the agreement with a view to prayer, as is
   indicated in the word, "unless it be by agreement." [6044]   Then the
   Word repeating that the agreeing of two on the earth is the same thing
   as the agreeing with Christ, adds, "For where two or three are gathered
   together in My name." [6045]   Therefore the two or three who are
   gathered together in the name of Christ are those who are in agreement
   on earth, not two only but sometimes also three.  But he who has the
   power will consider whether this agreement and a congregation of this
   sort in the midst of which Christ is, can be found in more, since
   "narrow and straightened is the way that leadeth unto life, and few be
   they that find it." [6046]   But perhaps also not even few but two or
   three make a symphony as Peter and James and John, to whom as making a
   symphony the Word of God showed His own glory.  But two made a
   symphony, Paul and Sosthenes, when writing the first Epistle to the
   Corinthians; [6047] and after this Paul and Timothy when sending the
   second Epistle to the same. [6048]   And even three made a symphony
   when Paul and Silvanus and Timothy gave instruction by letter to the
   Thessalonians. [6049]   But if it be necessary also from the ancient
   Scriptures to bring forward the three who made a symphony on earth, so
   that the Word was in the midst of them making them one, attend to the
   superscription of the Psalms, as for example to that of the
   forty-first, which is as follows:  "Unto the end, unto understanding,
   for the sons of Korah." [6050]   For though there were three sons of
   Korah whose names we find in the Book of Exodus, [6051] Aser, which is,
   by interpretation, "instruction," and the second Elkana, which is
   translated, "possession of God," and the third Abiasaph, which in the
   Greek tongue might be rendered, "congregation of the father," yet the
   prophecies were not divided but were both spoken and written by one
   spirit, and one voice, and one soul, which wrought with true harmony,
   and the three speak as one, "As the heart panteth after the springs of
   the water, so panteth my soul after thee, O God." [6052]   But also
   they say in the plural in the forty-fourth Psalm, "O God, we have heard
   with our ears." [6053]   But if you wish still further to see those who
   are making symphony on earth look to those who heard the exhortation,
   "that ye may be perfected together in the same mind and in the same
   judgment," [6054] and who strove after the goal, "the soul and the
   heart of all the believers were one," [6055] who have become such, if
   it be possible for such a condition to be found in more than two or
   three, that there is no discord between them, just as there is no
   discord between the strings of the ten-stringed psaltery with each
   other.  But they were not in symphony in earth who said, "I am of Paul,
   and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ," [6056] but there
   were schisms among them, upon the dissolution of which they were
   gathered together in company with the spirit in Paul, with the power of
   the Lord Jesus Christ, [6057] that they might no longer "bite and
   devour one another so that they were consumed by one another;" [6058]
   for discord consumes, as concord brings together, and admits [6059] the
   Son of God who comes in the midst of those who have become at concord.
   And strictly, indeed, concord takes place in two things generic,
   through the perfecting together, as the Apostle has called it, of the
   same mind by an intellectual grasp of the same opinions, and through
   the perfecting together of the same judgment, by a like way of living.
   But if whenever two of us agree on earth as touching anything that they
   shall ask, it shall be done for them of the Father of Jesus who is in
   heaven, [6060] plainly when this is not done for them of the Father in
   heaven as touching anything that they shall ask, there the two have not
   been in agreement on earth; and this is the cause why we are not heard
   when we pray, that we do not agree with one another on earth, neither
   in opinions nor in life.  But further also if we are the body of Christ
   and God hath set the members each one of them in the body that the
   members may have the same care one for another, and may agree with one
   another, and when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it,
   and if one be glorified, they rejoice with it, [6061] we ought to
   practise the symphony which springs from the divine music, that when we
   are gathered together in the name of Christ, He may be in the midst of
   us, the Word of God, and the Wisdom of God, and His Power. [6062]

   2.  The Harmony of Husband and Wife.

   So much then for the more common understanding of the two or three whom
   the Word exhorts to be in agreement.  But now let us also touch upon
   another interpretation which was uttered by some one of our
   predecessors, exhorting those who were married to sanctity and purity;
   for by the two, he says, whom the Word desires to agree on earth, we
   must understand the husband and wife, who by agreement defraud each
   other of bodily intercourse that they may give themselves unto prayer;
   [6063] when if they pray for anything whatever that they shall ask,
   they shall receive it, the request being granted to them by the Father
   in heaven of Jesus Christ on the ground of such agreement.  And this
   interpretation does not appear to me to cause dissolution of marriage,
   but to be an incitement to agreement, so that if the one wished to be
   pure, but the other did not desire it, and on this account he who
   willed and was able to fulfil the better part, condescended to the one
   who had not the power or the will, they would not both have the
   accomplishment from the Father in heaven of Jesus Christ, of anything
   whatever that they might ask.

   3.  The Harmony of Body, Soul, and Spirit.

   And next to this about the married, I am familiar also with another
   interpretation of the agreement between the two which is as follows.
   In the wicked, sin reigns over the soul, being settled as on its own
   throne in this mortal body, so that the soul obeys the lusts thereof;
   [6064] but in the case of those, who have stirred up the sin which
   formerly reigned over the body as from a throne and who are in conflict
   with it, "the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against
   the flesh;" [6065] but in the case of those who have now become
   perfected, the spirit has gained the mastery and put to death the deeds
   of the body, and imparts to the body of its own life, so that already
   this is fulfilled, "He shall quicken also your mortal bodies because of
   His Spirit that dwelleth in you;" [6066] and there arises a concord of
   the two, body and spirit, on the earth, on the successful
   accomplishment of which there is sent up a harmonious prayer also of
   him who "with the heart believes unto righteousness, but with the mouth
   maketh confession unto salvation," [6067] so that the heart is no
   longer far from God, and along with this the righteous man draws nigh
   to God with his own lips and mouth.  But still more blessed is it if
   the three be gathered together in the name of Jesus that this may be
   fulfilled, "May God sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul
   and body be preserved entire without blame at the coming of our Lord
   Jesus Christ." [6068]   But some one may inquire with regard to the
   concord of spirit and body spoken of, if it is possible for these to be
   at concord without the third being so,--I mean the soul--and whether it
   does not follow from the concord of these on the earth after the two
   have been gathered together in the name of Christ, that the three also
   are already gathered together in His name, in the midst of whom comes
   the Son of God as all are dedicated to Him,--I mean the three,--and no
   one is opposed to Him, there being no antagonism not only on the part
   of the spirit, but not even of the soul, nor further of the body.

   4.  Harmony of the Old and New Covenants.

   And likewise it is a pleasant thing to endeavour to understand and
   exhibit the fact of the concord of the two covenants,--of the one
   before the bodily advent of the Saviour and of the new covenant; for
   among those things in which the two covenants are at concord so that
   there is no discord between them would be found prayers, to the effect
   that about anything whatever they shall ask it shall be done to them
   from the Father in heaven.  And if also you desire the third that
   unites the two, do not hesitate to say that it is the Holy Spirit,
   since "the words of the wise," whether they be of those before the
   advent, or at the time of the advent, or after it, "are as goads, and
   as nails firmly fixed, which were given by agreement from one
   shepherd." [6069]   And do not let this also pass unobserved, that He
   did not say, where two or three are gathered together in My name, there
   "shall I be" in the midst of them, but "there am I," [6070] not going
   to be, not delaying, but at the very moment of the concord being
   Himself found, and being in the midst of them.

   5.  The Limit of Forgiveness.

   "Then came Peter and said unto Him, Lord, how often shall my brother
   sin against me and I forgive him?" [6071]   The conception that these
   things were said in a simple sense by Peter, as if he were inquiring
   whether he was to forgive his brother when he sinned against him seven
   times, but no longer if he sinned an eighth time, and by the Saviour,
   as if He thought that one should sit still and reckon up the sins of
   his neighbours against him in order that he might forgive seventy times
   and seven, but that from the seventy-eighth he should not forgive the
   man who wronged him, seems to me altogether silly and unworthy alike of
   the progress which Peter had made in the company of Jesus and of the
   divine magnanimity of Jesus.  Perhaps, then, these things also border
   on an obscurity akin to the words, "Hear My voice, ye wives of Lamech,"
   [6072] etc.  If any one has already become a friend of Jesus so as to
   be taught by His spirit which illumines the reason of him who has
   advanced so far according to his desert, he might know the true
   meaning, therefore, in regard to these things, and such as Jesus
   Himself would have clearly expounded it; but we who fall short of the
   greatness of the friendship of Jesus must be content if we can babble a
   little about the passage.  The number six, then, appears to be working
   and toilsome, but the number seven to contain the idea of repose.  And
   consider if you can say that he, who loves the world and works the
   things of the world, and does those things which are material, sins six
   times, and that the number seven is the end of sin in his case, so that
   Peter with some such thought in his mind wished to pardon seven sins of
   those which his brother had committed against him.  But since as units
   the tens and the hundreds have a certain common measure of proportion
   to the number which is in units, and Jesus knew that the number might
   be exceeded, on this account, I think, that He added to the number
   seven also the seventy, [6073] and said that there ought to be
   forgiveness to brethren here, and to them who have sinned in respect to
   things here.  But if any one going beyond the things about the world
   and this age were to commit sin, even if it were trifling, he could not
   longer reasonably have forgiveness of sins; for forgiveness extends to
   the things here, and in relation to the sins committed here, whether
   the forgiveness comes late or soon; but there is no forgiveness, not
   even to a brother, who has sinned beyond the seven and seventy times.
   But you might say that he who has sinned in such wise, whether as
   against Peter his brother, or as against Peter, against whom the gates
   of Hades do not prevail, is by sins of this kind in the smaller number
   of the sin, but according to sins still worse is in the number which
   has no forgiveness of sins.

   6.  Concerning the King Who Made a Reckoning with His Own Servants, to
   Whom Was Brought a Man Who Owed Ten Thousand Talents.

   "Therefore I say unto you the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
   certain king, who wished to make a reckoning with his own servants."
   [6074]   The general conception of the parable is to teach us that we
   should be inclined to forgive the sins committed against us by those
   who have wronged us, and especially if after the wrongdoing he who has
   done it supplicates him who has been wronged, asking forgiveness for
   the sins which he has committed against him.  And this the parable
   wishes to teach us by representing that even when forgiveness has been
   granted by God to us of the sins in respect of which we have received
   remission, exaction will be demanded even after the remission, unless
   we forgive the sins of those who have wronged us, so that there is no
   longer left in us the least remembrance of the wrong that was done, but
   the whole heart, assisted by the spirit of forgetfulness of wrongs,
   which is no common virtue, forgives him who has wronged us those things
   which have been wickedly done against any of us by him, even
   treacherously.  But next to the general conception of the parable, it
   is right to examine the whole of it more simply according to the
   letter, so that he who advances with care to the right investigation of
   each detail of the things previously written may derive profit from the
   examination of what is said.  Now there is, as is probable, an
   interpretation, transcendental and hard to trace, as it is somewhat
   mystical, according to which, after the analogy of the parables which
   are interpreted by the Evangelists, one would investigate each of the
   details in this; as, for example, who the king was, and who the
   servants were, and what was the beginning of his making a reckoning,
   and who was the one debtor who owed many talents, and who was his wife
   and who his children, and what were the "all things" spoken of besides
   those which the king ordered to be sold in order that the debt might be
   paid out of his belongings, and what was meant by the going out of the
   man who had been forgiven the many talents, and who was the one of the
   servants who was found and was a debtor not to the householder, but to
   the man who had been forgiven, and what is meant by the number of the
   hundred pence, and what by the word, "He took him by the throat saying,
   Pay what thou owest," and what is the prison into which he who had been
   forgiven all the talents went out and cast his fellow-servant, and who
   were the fellow-servants who were grieved and told the lord all that
   had been done, and who were the tormentors to whom he who had cast his
   fellow-servant into prison was delivered, and how he who was delivered
   to the tormentors paid all that was due, so that he no longer owed
   anything. [6075]   But it is probable also that some other things could
   be added to the number by a more competent investigator, the exposition
   and interpretation of which I think to be beyond the power of man, and
   requiring the Spirit of Christ who spoke them in order that Christ may
   be understood as He spoke; for as "no one among men knows the things of
   the man, save the spirit which is in him," and "no one knows the things
   of God, save the Spirit of God," [6076] so no one knows after God the
   things spoken by Christ in proverbs and parables save the Spirit of
   Christ, in which he who participates in Christ not only so far as He is
   Spirit, but in Christ as He is Wisdom, as He is Word, would behold the
   things which were revealed to him in this passage.  But with regard to
   the interpretation of the loftiest type, we make no profession; nor on
   the other hand with the assistance of Christ who is the Wisdom of God
   do we despair of apprehending the things signified in the parable; but
   whether it shall be the case that such things shall be dictated to us
   in connection with this Scripture or not, may God in Christ suggest the
   doing of that which is pleasing to Him, if only there be granted to us
   also concerning these things, the word of wisdom which is given from
   God through the Spirit, and the word of knowledge which is supplied
   according to the Spirit. [6077]

   7.  Exposition Continued:  the King and the Servants.

   "The kingdom of heaven," He says, "is likened," [6078] etc.  But if it
   be likened to such a king, and one who has done such things, who must
   we say that it is but the Son of God?  For He is the King of the
   heavens, and as He is absolute Wisdom and absolute Righteousness and
   absolute Truth, is He not so also absolute Kingdom?  But it is not a
   kingdom of any of those below, nor of a part of those above, but of all
   the things above, which were called heavens.  But if you enquire into
   the meaning of the words, "Theirs is the kingdom of heaven," [6079] you
   may say that Christ is theirs in so far as He is absolute Kingdom,
   reigning in every thought of the man who is no longer under the reign
   of sin which reigns in the mortal body of those who have subjected
   themselves to it. [6080]   And if I say, reigning in every thought, I
   mean something like this, reigning as Righteousness and Wisdom and
   Truth and the rest of the virtues in him who has become a heaven,
   because of bearing the image of the heavenly, and in every power,
   whether angelic, or the rest that are named saints, not only in this
   age, but also in that which is to come, and who are worthy of a kingdom
   of such a kind.  Accordingly this kingdom of heaven (when it was made
   "in the likeness of sinful flesh," [6081] that for sin it might condemn
   sin, when God made "Him who knew no sin to be sin on behalf of us,"
   [6082] who bear the body of our sin), is likened to a certain king who
   is understood in relation to Jesus being united to Him, if we may dare
   so to speak, having more capacity towards being united and becoming
   entirely one with the "First-born of all creation," [6083] than he,
   who, being joined to the Lord, becomes one spirit with Him. [6084]
   Now of this kingdom of the heavens which is likened unto a certain
   king, according to the conception of Jesus, and is united to Him, it is
   said by anticipation that he wished to make a reckoning with his
   servants.  But he is about to make a reckoning with them in order that
   it may be manifested how each has employed the tried money of the
   householder and his rational coins.  And the image in the parables was
   indeed taken from masters who made a reckoning with their own servants;
   but we shall understand more accurately what is signified by this part
   of the parable, if we fix our thought on the things done by the slaves
   who had administered their master's goods, and who were asked to give a
   reckoning concerning them.  For each of them, receiving in different
   measure from his master's goods, has used them either for that which
   was right so as to increase the goods of his master, or consumed it
   riotously on things which he ought not, and spent profusely without
   judgment and without discretion that which had been put into his
   hands.  But there are those who have wisely administered these goods
   and goods so great, but have lost others, and whenever they give the
   reckoning when the master makes a reckoning with them, there is
   gathered together how much loss each has incurred, and there is
   reckoned up how much gain each has brought, and according to the
   worthiness of the way in which he has administered it, he is either
   honoured or punished, or in some cases the debt is forgiven, but in
   others the talents are taken away.  Well, then, from what has been
   said, let us first look at the rational coins and the tried money of
   the householder, of which one receives more and another less, for
   according to the ability of each, to one are given five talents as he
   has the ability to administer so many, but to another two as not being
   able to receive the amount of the man before him, and to another one as
   being also inferior to the second. [6085]   Are these, then, the only
   differences, or are we to recognize these differences in the case of
   certain persons of whom the Gospel goes on to speak while there are
   also others besides these:  In other parables also are found certain
   persons, as the two debtors, the one who owed five hundred pence, and
   the other fifty; [6086] but whether these had been entrusted with them
   and had administered them badly as being inferior in ability to him who
   had been entrusted with a talent, or had received them, we have not
   learned; but that they owed so much, we seem to be taught from the
   parable.  And there are found other ten servants who were each
   entrusted with a pound separately. [6087]   And if any one understood
   the varied character of the human soul and the wide differences from
   each other in respect of natural aptitude, or want of aptitude for more
   or fewer of the virtues, and for these virtues or for those, perhaps he
   would comprehend how each soul has come with certain coins of the
   householder which come to light with the full attainment of reason, and
   with the attention which follows the full attainment of reason, and
   with exercise in things that are right, or with diligence and exercise
   in other things, whether they be useful as pursuits, or in part useful
   and in part not useful, such as the opinions which are not wholly true
   nor wholly false.

   8.  The Principle of the Reckoning.

   But you will here inquire whether all men can be called servants of the
   king, or some are servants whom he foreknew and fore-ordained, while
   there are others who transact business with the servants, and are
   called bankers. [6088]   And in like manner you will inquire if there
   are those outside the number of the slaves from whom the householder
   declares that he will exact his own with usury, not only men alien from
   piety, but also some of the believers.  Now the servants alone are the
   stewards of the Word, but the king, making a reckoning with the
   servants, demands from those who have borrowed from the servants,
   whether a hundred measures of wheat or a hundred measures of oil,
   [6089] or whatever in point of fact those who are outside of the
   household of the king have received; for he who owed the hundred
   measures of wheat or the hundred measures of oil is not found to be,
   according to the parable, a fellow-servant of the unjust steward, as is
   evident from the question--how much owest thou to my lord? [6090]   But
   mark with me that each deed which is good or seemly is like a gain and
   an increment, but a wicked deed is like a loss; and as there is a
   certain gain when the money is greater and another when it is less, and
   as there are differences of more or less, so according to the good
   deeds, there is as it were a valuing of gains more or less.  To reckon
   what work is a great gain, and what a less gain, and what a least, is
   the prerogative of him who alone knows to investigate such things,
   looking at them in the light of the disposition, and the word, and the
   deed, and from consideration of the things which are not in our power
   cooperating with those that are; and so also in the case of things
   opposite, it is his to say what sin, when a reckoning is made with the
   servants, is found to be a great loss, and what is less, and what, if
   we may so call it, is the loss of the very last mite, [6091] or the
   last farthing. [6092]   The account, therefore, of the entire and whole
   life is exacted by that which is called the kingdom of heaven which is
   likened to a king, when "we must all stand before the judgment-sent of
   Christ that each one may receive the things done in the body according
   to what he hath done, whether good or bad;" [6093] and then when the
   reckoning is being made, shall there be brought into the reckoning that
   is made also every idle word that men shall speak, [6094] and any cup
   of cold water only which one has given to drink in the name of a
   disciple. [6095]

   9.  The Time Occupied by the Reckoning.

   And these things will take place whenever that happens which is written
   in Daniel, "The books were opened and the judgment was set;" [6096] for
   a record, as it were, is made of all things that have been spoken and
   done and thought, and by divine power every hidden thing of ours shall
   be manifested, and everything that is covered shall be revealed, [6097]
   in order that when any one is found who has not "given diligence to be
   freed from the adversary," he may go in succession through the hands of
   the magistrate, and the judge, and the attendant into the prison, until
   he pays the very last mite; [6098] but when one has given diligence to
   be freed from him and owes nothing to any one, and already has made the
   pound ten pounds or five pounds, or doubled the five talents, or made
   the two four, he may obtain the due recompense, entering into the joy
   of his Lord, either being set over all His possessions, [6099] or
   hearing the word, "Have thou authority over ten cities," [6100] or
   "Have thou authority over five cities." [6101]   But we think that
   these things are spoken of as if they required a long period of time,
   in order that an account may be made by us of the whole times of the
   earthly life, so that we might suppose that when the king makes a
   reckoning with each one of his many servants the matter would require
   so vast a period of time, until these things come to an end which have
   existed from the beginning of the world down to the consummation of the
   age, not of one age, but of many ages.  But the truth is not so; for
   when God wished all at once to rekindle in the memories of all
   everything that had been done by each one throughout the whole time, in
   order that each might become conscious of his own doings whether good
   or bad, He would do it by His ineffable power.  For it is not with God
   as with us; for if we wish to call some things to remembrance, we
   require sufficient time for the detailed account of what has been said
   by us, and to bring to our remembrance the things which we wish to
   remember; but if He wished to call to our memory the things which have
   been done in this life, in order that becoming conscious of what we
   have done we may apprehend for what we are punished or honoured, He
   could do so.  But if any one disbelieves the swiftness of the power of
   God in regard to these matters, he has not yet had a true conception of
   the God who made the universe, who did not require times to make the
   vast creation of heaven and earth and the things in them; for, though
   He may seem to have made these things in six days, there is need of
   understanding to comprehend in what sense the words "in six days" are
   said, on account of this, "This is the book of the generation of heaven
   and earth," [6102] etc.  Therefore it may be boldly affirmed that the
   season of the expected judgment does not require times, but as the
   resurrection is said to take place "in a moment, in the twinkling of an
   eye," [6103] so I think will the judgment also be.

   10.  The Man Who Owed Many Talents.

   Next we must speak in regard to this, "And when he had begun to reckon,
   there was brought unto him one which owed many talents." [6104]   The
   sense of this appears to me to be as follows:  The season of beginning
   the judgment is with the house of God, who says, as also it is written
   in Ezekiel, to those who are appointed to attend to punishments, "Begin
   ye with My saints;" [6105] and it is like "the twinkling of an eye;"
   but, the time of making a reckoning includes the same "twinkling,"
   ideally apprehended, for we are not forgetful of what has been
   previously said of those who owe more.  Wherefore it is not written,
   when he was making reckoning, but it is said, "When he began to
   reckon," there was brought, at the beginning of his making a reckoning,
   one who owed many talents; he had lost tens of thousands of talents,
   having been entrusted with great things, and having had many things
   committed to his care, but he had brought no gain to his master, but
   had lost tens of thousands so that he owed many talents; and, perhaps
   on this account, he owed many talents, seeing that he followed often
   the woman, who was sitting upon the talent of lead, whose name is
   wickedness. [6106]   But observe here that every great sin is a loss of
   the talents of the master of the house, and such sins are committed by
   fornicators, adulterers, abusers of themselves with men, effeminate,
   idolaters, murderers.  Perhaps then the one who is brought to the king
   owing many talents has committed no small sin but all that are great
   and heinous; and if you were to seek for him among men, perhaps you
   would find him to be "the man of sin, the son of perdition, he that
   opposeth and exalteth himself against every God or object of worship;"
   [6107] but if you seek him outside the number of men, who can this be
   but the devil who has ruined so many who received him, who wrought sin
   in them.  For "man is a great thing, and a pitiful man is precious,"
   [6108] precious so as to be worthy of a talent, whether of gold like as
   the lamp which was equal to a talent of gold, [6109] or of silver or of
   any kind of material whatsoever understood intellectually, the symbols
   of which are recorded in the Words of the Days, [6110] when David
   became enriched with many talents of which the number is mentioned, so
   many talents of gold, and so many of silver, and of the rest of the
   material there named, from which the temple of God was built.

   11.  The Servant Who Owed a Hundred Pence.

   Only, though he cannot pay the talents, for he has lost them, he has a
   wife and children and other things, of which it is written, "All that
   he has." [6111]   And it was possible that when he had been sold along
   with his own, he would have prospered if some one had bought him, and,
   by his worth and the things that were his, have paid the whole debt in
   full; and it was possible that he might no longer be the servant of the
   king, but become that of his purchaser.  And he makes a request that he
   be not sold along with his own, but may continue to abide in the house
   of the king; wherefore he fell down and worshipped him, knowing that
   the king was God, and said, "Have patience with me, and I will pay thee
   all;" [6112] for he was, as is probable, an active man, who knew that
   he could by a second course of action fill up the whole deficiency of
   the former loss of many talents.  And this truly good king was moved
   with compassion for the man who owed him many talents and then released
   him, having bestowed upon him a favour greater than the request which
   had been made; for the debtor promised to the long-suffering master to
   pay all his debts, but the Lord moved with compassion for him did not
   merely forgive him with the idea of receiving his own back as a result
   of his patience, but even entirely released him and forgave him the
   whole debt.  But this wicked servant, who had besought his master to
   have patience for his many talents, acted without mercy, for, having
   found one of his fellow-servants which owed him a hundred pence, he
   laid hold on him and took him by the throat, saying, "Pay if thou
   owest." [6113]   And did he not exhibit the very excess of wickedness
   who laid hold of his fellow-servant for a hundred pence, and took him
   by the throat and deprived him of freedom to breathe, when he himself,
   for the many talents, had neither been laid hold of, nor seized by the
   throat, but at first was ordered to be sold along with his wife and
   children and all that was his own; but afterwards, when he had
   worshipped him, the master was moved with compassion for him, and he
   was released and forgiven in regard to the whole of the debt.  But it
   were indeed a hard task to tell according to the conception of Jesus
   who is the one fellow-servant who was found to be owing a hundred
   pence, not to his own lord, but to him who owed many talents, and who
   are the fellow-servants who saw the one taking by the throat, and the
   other taken, and were exceedingly sorry, and represented clearly unto
   their own lord all that had been done.  But what the truth in these
   matters is, I declare that no one can interpret unless Jesus, who
   explained all things to His own disciples privately, takes up His abode
   in his reason, and opens up all the treasures in the parable which are
   dark, hidden, unseen, and confirms by clear demonstrations the man whom
   He desires to illumine with the light of the knowledge of the things
   that are in this parable, that he may at once represent who is brought
   to the king as the debtor of many talents, and who is the other one who
   owes to him a hundred pence, etc.; whether he can be the man of sin
   previously mentioned, [6114] or the devil, or neither of these, but
   some other, whether a man, or some one of these under the sway of the
   devil; for it is a work of the wisdom of God to exhibit the things that
   have been prophesied concerning those who are in themselves of a
   certain nature, or have been made according to such and such qualities,
   whether among visible powers or also among some men, in whatever way
   they may have been written by the Holy Spirit.  But as we have not yet
   received the competent mind which is able to be blended with the mind
   of Christ, and which is capable of attaining to things so great, and
   which is able with the Spirit to "search all things, even the deep
   things of God," [6115] we, forming an impression still indefinitely
   with regard to the matters in this passage, are of opinion that the
   wicked servant indicated by the parable who is here represented in
   regard to the debt of many talents, refers to some definite one.

   12.  The Time of the Reckoning.

   But it is fitting to examine at what time the man--the king--in the
   parable wished to make a reckoning with his own servants, and to what
   period we ought to refer the things that are said.  For if it be after
   the consummation, or at it at the time of the expected judgment, how
   are we to maintain the things about him who owed a hundred pence, and
   was taken by the throat by the man who had been forgiven the many
   talents?  But if, before the judgment, how can we explain the reckoning
   that was made before this by the king, with his own servants?  But we
   ought to think in a general way about every parable, the interpretation
   of which has not been recorded by the evangelists, even though Jesus
   explained all things to His own disciples privately; [6116] and for
   this reason the writers of the Gospels have concealed the clear
   exposition of the parables, because the things signified by them were
   beyond the power of the nature of words to express, and every solution
   and exposition of such parables was of such a kind that not even the
   whole world itself could contain the books that should be written
   [6117] in relation to such parables.  But it may happen that a fitting
   heart be found, and, because of its purity, able to receive the letters
   of the exposition of the parable, so that they could be written in it
   by the Spirit of the living God.  But some one will say that, perhaps,
   we act with impiety, who, because of the secret and mystical import of
   some of the Scriptures which are of heavenly origin, wish them to be
   symbolic, and endeavour to expound them, even though it might seem ex
   hypothesi that we had an accurate knowledge of their meaning.  But to
   this we must say that, if there be those who have obtained the gift of
   accurate apprehension of these things, they know what they ought to do;
   but as for us, who acknowledge that we fall short of the ability to see
   into the depth of the things here signified, even though we obtain a
   somewhat crass perception of the things in the passage, we will say,
   that some of the things which we seem to find after much examination
   and inquiry, whether by the grace of God, or by the power of our own
   mind, we do not venture to commit to writing; but some things, for the
   sake of our own intellectual discipline, and that of those who may
   chance to read them, we will to some extent set forth.  But let these
   things, then, be said by way of apology, because of the depth of the
   parable; but, with regard to the question at what time the man--the
   king--in the parable wished to make a reckoning with his own servants,
   we will say that it seems that this takes place about the time of the
   judgment which had been proclaimed.  And this is confirmed by two
   parables, one at the close of the Gospel before us, [6118] and one from
   the Gospel according to Luke. [6119]   And not to prolong the
   discussion by quoting the very letter, as any one who wishes can take
   it from the Scripture himself, we will say that the parable according
   to Matthew declares, "For it is as when a man going into another
   country called his own servants, and delivered unto them his own goods,
   and to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one
   talent;" [6120] then they took action with regard to that which had
   been entrusted to them, and, after a long time, the lord of those
   servants cometh, and it is written in the very words, that he also
   makes a reckoning with them. [6121]   And compare the words, "And when
   he began to make a reckoning," [6122] and consider that he called the
   going of the householder into another country the time at which "we are
   at home in the body but absent from the Lord;" [6123] but his advent,
   when, "after a long time the lord of those servants cometh," [6124] the
   time at the consummation in the judgment; for after a long time the
   lord of those servants cometh and makes a reckoning with them, and
   those things which follow take place.  But the parable in Luke
   represents with more clearness, that "a certain nobleman went into a
   far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return," and when
   going, "he called ten servants, and gave to them ten pounds, and said
   unto them, Trade ye till I come." [6125]   But the nobleman, being
   hated by his own citizens, who sent an ambassage after him, as they did
   not wish him to reign over them, came back again, having received the
   kingdom, and told the servants to whom he had given the money to be
   called to himself that he might know what they had gained by trading.
   And, seeing what they had done, to him who had made the one pound ten
   pounds, rendering praise in the words, "Well done, thou good servant,
   because thou wast found faithful in a very little," [6126] he gives to
   him authority over ten cities, to-wit, those which were under his
   kingdom.  And to another, who had multiplied the pound fivefold, he did
   not render the praise which he assigned to the first, nor did he
   specify the word "authority," as in the case of the first, but said to
   him, "Be thou also over five cities." [6127]   But to him who had tied
   up the pound in a napkin, he said, "Out of thine own mouth will I judge
   thee, thou wicked servant;" [6128] and he said to them that stood by,
   Take from him the pound, and give it unto him that hath the ten pounds.
   [6129]   Who, then, in regard to this parable, will not say that the
   nobleman, who goes into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom
   and to return, is Christ, going, as it were, into another country to
   receive the kingdoms of this world, and the things in it?  And those
   who have received the ten talents are those who have been entrusted
   with the dispensation of the Word which has been committed unto them.
   And His citizens who did not wish Him to reign over them when He was a
   citizen in the world in respect of His incarnation, [6130] are perhaps
   Israel who disbelieved Him, and perhaps also the Gentiles who
   disbelieved Him.

   13.  No Forgiveness to the Unforgiving.

   Only, I have said these things with the view of referring his return
   when he comes with his kingdom to the consummation, when he commanded
   the servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him that he
   might know what they had gained by trading, and from a desire to
   demonstrate from this, and from the parable of the Talents, that the
   passage "he who wished to make a reckoning with his own servants"
   [6131] is to be referred to the consummation when now he is king,
   receiving the kingdom, on account of which, according to another
   parable, [6132] he went into a far country, to receive for himself a
   kingdom and to return.  Therefore, when he returned after receiving the
   kingdom, he wished to make a reckoning with his own servants.  And
   "when he had begun to reckon, there was brought unto him one who owed
   many talents," [6133] and he was brought as to a king by those who had
   been appointed his ministers--I think, the angels.  And perhaps he was
   one of those under the kingdom who had been entrusted with a great
   administration and had not dispensed it well, but had wasted what had
   been entrusted to him, so that he came to owe the many talents which he
   had lost.  This very man, perhaps not having the means to pay, is
   ordered by the king to be sold along with his wife, by intercourse with
   whom he became the father of certain children.  But it is no easy task
   to see what is intellectually meant by father and mother and children.
   What this means in point of truth God may know, and whether He Himself
   has given insight to us or not, he who can may judge.  Only this is our
   conception of the passage; that, as "the Jerusalem which is above" is
   "the mother" [6134] of Paul and of those like unto him, so there may be
   a mother of others after the analogy of Jerusalem, the mother, for
   example, of Syene in Egypt, or Sidon, or as many cities as are named in
   the Scriptures.  Then, as Jerusalem is "a bride adorned for her
   husband," [6135] Christ, so there may be those mothers of certain
   powers who have been allotted to them as wives or brides.  And as there
   are certain children of Jerusalem, as mother, and of Christ, as father,
   so there would be certain children of Syene, or Memphis, or Tyre, or
   Sidon, and the rulers set over them.  Perhaps then, too, this one, the
   debtor of many talents who was brought to the king, has, as we have
   said, a wife and children, whom at first the king ordered to be sold,
   and also all that he had to be sold; but afterwards, being moved with
   compassion, he released him and forgave him all the debt; not, as if he
   were ignorant of the future, but, in order that we might understand
   what happened, it was written that he did so.  Each one then of those
   who have, as we have said, a wife and children will render an account
   whenever the king comes to make a reckoning, having received the
   kingdom and having returned; and each of them as a ruler of any Syene
   or Memphis, or Tyre or Sidon, or any like unto them, has also debtors.
   This one, then, having been released, and having been forgiven all the
   debt, "went out from the king and found one of his fellow-servants,"
   [6136] etc.; and, on this account, I suppose that he took him by the
   throat, when he had gone out from the king, for unless he had gone out
   he would not have taken his own fellow-servant by the throat.  Then
   observe the accuracy of the Scripture, how that the one fell down and
   "worshipped," but the other fell down and did not worship but
   "besought;" [6137] and the king being moved with compassion released
   him and forgave him all the debt, but the servant did not wish even to
   pity his own fellow-servant; and the king before his release ordered
   him to be sold and what was his, while he who had been forgiven cast
   him into prison.  And observe that his fellow-servants did not bring
   any accusation or "said," but "told," [6138] and that he did not use
   the epithet "wicked" at the beginning in regard to the money lost, but
   reserved it afterwards for his action towards the fellow-servant.  But
   mark also the moderation of the king; he does not say, You worshipped
   me, but You besought me; and no longer did he order him and his to be
   sold, but, what was worse, he delivered him to the tormentors, because
   of his wickedness. [6139]   But who may these be but those who have
   been appointed in the matter of punishments?  But at the same time
   observe, because of the use made of this parable by adherents of
   heresies, that if they accuse the Creator [6140] of being passionate,
   because of words that declare the wrath of God, they ought also to
   accuse this king, because that "being wroth," he delivered the debtor
   to the tormentors.  But it must further be said to those whose view it
   is that no one is delivered by Jesus to the tormentors,--pray, explain
   to us, good sirs, who is the king who delivered the wicked servant to
   the tormentors?  And let them also attend to this, "So therefore also
   shall My heavenly Father do unto you;" [6141] and to the same persons
   also might rather be said the things in the parable of the Ten Pounds
   that the Son of the good God said, "Howbeit these mine enemies which
   would not that I should reign over them," [6142] etc.  The conclusion
   of the parable, however, is adapted also to the simpler; for all of us
   who have obtained the forgiveness of our own sins, and have not
   forgiven our brethren, are taught at once that we shall suffer the lot
   of him who was forgiven but did not forgive his fellow-servant.

   14.  How Jesus Finished His Words.

   "And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words." [6143]   He
   who gives a detailed and complete account of each of the questions
   before him so that nothing is left out, finishes his own words.  But he
   will give a declaration on this point with more confidence who devotes
   himself with great diligence to the entire reading of the Old and New
   Testament; for if the expression, "he finished these words," may be
   applied to no other, neither to Moses, nor to any of the prophets, but
   only to Jesus, then one would dare to say that Jesus alone finished His
   words, He who came to put an end to things, and to fulfil what was
   defective in the law, by saying, "It was said to them of old time,"
   [6144] etc., and, again, "That the things spoken through the prophets
   might be fulfilled." [6145]   But if it is written somewhere also in
   them, then you may compare and contrast the discourses finished by them
   with those finished by the Saviour, that you may find the difference
   between them.  And yet at this point, also, investigation might be made
   whether in the case of the things spoken by way of oracle the
   expression, "he finished," is applied either to the things spoken by
   Moses, or any of the prophets, or of both together; for careful
   observation would suggest very weighty thoughts to those who know how
   "to compare spiritual things with spiritual," and on this account
   "speak not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Spirit
   teacheth." [6146]   But perhaps some other one, attending with
   over-curious spirit to the word "finished," which is assigned to things
   of a more mystical order, just as we say that some one delivered to
   those who were under his control mysteries and rites of "perfecting"
   [6147] not in a praiseworthy fashion, and another delivered the
   mysteries of God to those who are worthy, and rites of "perfecting"
   proportionate to such mysteries, might say that having initiated them,
   he made a rite of "perfecting," by which "perfecting" the words were
   shown to be powerful, so that the gospel of Jesus was preached in the
   whole world, and by virtue of the divine "perfecting" gained the
   mastery of every soul which the Father draws to the Son, according to
   what is said by the Saviour, "No one comes to Me except the Father
   which has sent Me draw him." [6148]   Wherefore also "the word" of
   those who by the grace of God are ambassadors of the gospel, "and their
   preaching, is not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration
   of the spirit of power," [6149] to those for whom the words of the
   doctrine of Jesus were finished.  You will therefore observe how often
   it is said, "He finished," and of what things it is said, and you will
   take as an illustration that which is said in regard to the beatitudes,
   and the whole of the discourse to which is subjoined, "And it came to
   pass when Jesus had finished these words, all the multitudes were
   astonished at His teaching." [6150]   But now the saying, "Jesus
   finished these words," is referred also immediately to the very
   mystical parable according to which the kingdom of heaven is likened
   unto a king, but also beyond this parable to the sections which were
   written before it.

   15.  How Men Followed Jesus.

   Only, when Jesus had finished these words, having spoken them in
   Galilee about Capernaum, then "He departed thence, and came into the
   borders of Judæa," [6151] which were different from Galilee.  But He
   came to the borders of Judæa, and not to the middle of it, but, as it
   were, to the outermost parts, where great multitudes followed Him,
   [6152] whom He healed at "the borders of Judæa beyond Jordan,"--where
   baptism had been given. [6153]   But you will observe the difference
   between the crowds who simply followed, and Peter and the others who
   gave up everything and followed, and Matthew, who arose and followed
   him; [6154] he did not simply follow, but "having arisen;" for "having
   arisen" is an important addition.  There are always those, then, who
   follow like the great multitudes, who have not arisen that they may
   follow, nor have given up all that was theirs formerly, but few are
   they who have arisen and followed, who also, in the regeneration, shall
   sit on twelve thrones. [6155]   Only, if one wishes to be healed, let
   him follow Jesus.

   16.  Concerning the Pharisees and Scribes Tempting Jesus (by Asking)
   Whether Was Lawful for a Man to Put Away His Wife for Every Cause.

   After this it is written that "there came unto Him the Pharisees
   tempting Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to wife for every
   cause?" [6156]   Mark, also, has written to the like effect. [6157]
   Accordingly, of those who came to Jesus and inquired of Him, there were
   some who put questions to tempt Him; and if our Saviour so transcendent
   was tempted, which of His disciples who is ordained to teach need be
   vexed, when he is tempted by some who inquire, not from the love of
   learning, but from the wish to tempt?  And you might find many
   passages, if you brought them together, in which the Pharisees tempted
   our Jesus, and others, different from them, as a certain lawyer, [6158]
   and perhaps also a scribe, [6159] that by bringing together what is
   said about those who tempted Him, you might find by investigation what
   is useful for this kind of inquiries.  Only, the Saviour, in response
   to those who tempted Him, laid down dogmas; for they said, "Is it
   lawful for a man to put away his own wife for every cause?" and He
   answered and said, "Have ye not read that He who created them from the
   beginning made them male and female?" [6160] etc.  And I think that the
   Pharisees put forward this word for this reason, that they might attack
   Him whatever He might say; as, for example, if He had said, "It is
   lawful," they would have accused Him of dissolving marriages for
   trifles; but, if He had said, "It is not lawful," they would have
   accused Him of permitting a man to dwell with a woman, even with sins;
   so, likewise, in the case of the tribute-money, [6161] if He had told
   them to give, they would have accused Him of making the people subject
   to the Romans, and not to the law of God, but if He had told them not
   to give, they would have accused Him of creating war and sedition, and
   of stirring up those who were not able to stand against so powerful an
   army.  But they did not perceive in what way He answered blamelessly
   and wisely, in the first place, rejecting the opinion that a wife was
   to be put away for every cause, and, in the second place, giving answer
   to the question about the bill of divorcement; for He saw that not
   every cause is a reasonable ground for the dissolution of marriage, and
   that the husband must dwell with the wife as the weaker vessel, giving
   honour, [6162] and bearing her burdens in sins; [6163] and by what is
   written in Genesis, He puts to shame the Pharisees who boasted in the
   Scriptures of Moses, by saying, "Have ye not read that He who created
   them from the beginning made them male and female," etc., and,
   subjoining to these words, because of the saying, "And the twain shall
   become one flesh," teaching in harmony with one flesh, namely, "So that
   they are no more twain, but one flesh." [6164]   And, as tending to
   convince them that they should not put away their wife for every cause,
   is it said, "What God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."
   [6165]   It is to be observed, however, in the exposition of the words
   quoted from Genesis in the Gospel, that they were not spoken
   consecutively as they are written in the Gospel; and I think that it is
   not even said about the same persons, namely, of those who were formed
   after the image of God, and of those who were formed from the dust of
   the ground and from one of the ribs of Adam.  For where it is said,
   "Male and female made He them," [6166] the reference is to those formed
   "after the image," but where He also said, "For this cause shall a man
   leave his own father and mother," [6167] etc., the reference is not to
   those formed after the image; for some time after the Lord God formed
   the man, taking dust from the ground, and from his side the helpmate.
   And mark, at the same time, that in the case of those who are formed
   "after the image," the words were not "husband and wife" but "male and
   female."  But we have also observed this in the Hebrew, for man is
   indicated by the word "is," but male by the word "zachar," and again
   woman by the word "essa," but female by the word "agkeba."  For at no
   time is it "woman" or "man" "after the image," but the superior class,
   the male, and the second, the female.  But also if a man leave his
   mother and his father, he cleaves not to the female, but to his own
   wife, and "they become," since man and woman are one in flesh, "one
   flesh."  Then, describing what ought to be in the case of those who are
   joined together by God, so that they may be joined together in a manner
   worthy of God, the Saviour adds, "So that they are no more twain;"
   [6168] and, wherever there is indeed concord, and unison, and harmony,
   between husband and wife, when he is as ruler and she is obedient to
   the word, "He shall rule over thee," [6169] then of such persons we may
   truly say, "They are no more twain."  Then since it was necessary that
   for "him who was joined to the Lord," it should be reserved "that he
   should become one spirit with Him," [6170] in the case of those who are
   joined together by God, after the words, "So that they are no more
   twain," it is said, "but one flesh."  And it is God who has joined
   together the two in one so that they are no more twain, from the time
   that [6171] the woman is married to the man.  And, since God has joined
   them together, on this account in the case of those who are joined
   together by God, there is a "gift"; and Paul knowing this, that
   marriage according to the Word of God was a "gift," like as holy
   celibacy was a gift, says, "But I would that all men were like myself;
   howbeit, each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner,
   and another after that." [6172]   And those who are joined together by
   God both mind and keep the precept, "Husbands love your wives, as
   Christ also the church." [6173]   The Saviour then commanded, "What God
   hath joined together, let not man put asunder," [6174] but man wishes
   to put asunder what God hath joined together, when, "falling away from
   the sound faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of
   demons, through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their
   own conscience as with a hot iron, forbidding," not only to commit
   fornication, but "to marry," [6175] he dissolves even those who had
   been before joined together by the providence of God.  Let these things
   then be said, keeping in view what is expressly said concerning the
   male and the female, and the man and the woman, as the Saviour taught
   in the answer to the Pharisees.

   17.  Union of Christ and the Church.

   But since the Apostle understands the words, "And they twain shall be
   one flesh," [6176] of Christ and the church, [6177] we must say that
   Christ keeping the saying, "What God hath joined together let not man
   put asunder," [6178] did not put away His former wife, so to
   speak--that is, the former synagogue--for any other cause than that
   that wife committed fornication, being made an adulteress by the evil
   one, and along with him plotted against her husband and slew Him,
   saying, "Away with such a fellow from the earth, crucify Him, crucify
   Him." [6179]   It was she therefore who herself revolted, rather than
   her husband who put her away and dismissed her; wherefore, reproaching
   her for falling away from him, it says in Isaiah, "Of what kind is the
   bill of your mother's divorcement, with which I sent her away?" [6180]
     And He who at the beginning created Him "who is in the form of God"
   after the image, made Him male, and the church female, granting to both
   oneness after the image.  And, for the sake of the church, the
   Lord--the husband--left the Father whom He saw when He was "in the form
   of God," [6181] left also His mother, as He was the very son of the
   Jerusalem which is above, and was joined to His wife who had fallen
   down here, and these two here became one flesh.  For because of her, He
   Himself also became flesh, when "the Word became flesh and dwelt among
   us," [6182] and they are no more two, but now they are one flesh, since
   it is said to the wife, "Now ye are the body of Christ, and members
   each in his part;" [6183] for the body of Christ is not something apart
   different from the church, which is His body, and from the members each
   in his part.  And God has joined together these who are not two, but
   have become one flesh, commanding that men should not separate the
   church from the Lord.  And he who takes heed for himself so as not to
   be separated, is confident as one who will not possibly be separated
   and says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" [6184]
   Here, therefore, the saying, "What God hath joined together, let not
   man put asunder," [6185] was written with relation to the Pharisees,
   but to those who are superior to the Pharisees, it could be said, "What
   then God hath joined together, let nothing put asunder," neither
   principality nor power; for God, who has joined together is stronger
   than all those which any one could conceive and name.

   18.  The Bill of Divorcement.

   After this we will discuss the saying of the Pharisees which they said
   to Jesus, "Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement and
   put her away?" [6186]   And with good reason we will bring forward for
   this purpose the passage from Deuteronomy concerning the bill of
   divorcement, which is as follows:  "But if a man taketh a wife and
   cohabit with her, and it shall be, if she do not find favour in his
   sight because he hath found in her a thing unseemly," etc., down to the
   words, "and ye shall not pollute the land which the Lord your God
   giveth you for an inheritance." [6187]   Now I inquire whether in these
   things according to this law, we are to seek nothing in it beyond the
   letter seeing that God has not given it, or whether to the Pharisees
   who quoted the saying, "Moses commanded to give a bill of divorcement
   and put her away," it was of necessity said, "Moses, for your hardness
   of heart, suffered you to put away your wives; but from the beginning
   it hath not been so." [6188]   But if any one ascends to the Gospel of
   Christ Jesus which teaches that the law is spiritual, he will seek also
   the spiritual understanding of this law.  And he who wishes to
   interpret these things figuratively will say that, just as it was said
   by Paul confident in the grace which he had, "A wife is bound for so
   long time as her husband liveth, but if the husband be dead she is free
   to be married to whom she will, only in the Lord; but she is happier if
   she abide as she is, after my judgment, and I think that I also have
   the Spirit of God" [6189] (for here to the words, "after my judgment,"
   lest it should be despised as being without the Spirit of God, he well
   added, "and I think that I also have the Spirit of God)," so also it
   would be possible for Moses, by reason of the power given to him to
   make laws, to the effect that he suffered for the hardness of heart of
   the people certain things, among which was the putting away of wives,
   to be persuaded in regard to the laws which he promulgated according to
   his own judgment, that in these also the legislation took place with
   the Spirit of God.  And he will say that, unless one law is spiritual
   and another is not such, this is a law, and this is spiritual, and its
   spiritual significance ought to be investigated.

   19.  The Divorce of Israel.

   Now, keeping in mind what we said above in regard to the passage from
   Isaiah about the bill of divorcement, we will say that the mother of
   the people separated herself from Christ, her husband, without having
   received the bill of divorcement, but afterwards when there was found
   in her an unseemly thing, and she did not find favour in his sight, the
   bill of divorcement was written out for her; for when the new covenant
   called those of the Gentiles to the house of Him who had cast away his
   former wife, it virtually gave the bill of divorcement to her who
   formerly separated from her husband--the law, and the Word.  Therefore
   he, also, having separated from her, married, so to speak, another,
   having given into the hands of the former the bill of divorcement;
   wherefore they can no longer do the things enjoined on them by the law,
   because of the bill of divorcement.  And a sign that she has received
   the bill of divorcement is this, that Jerusalem was destroyed along
   with what they called the sanctuary of the things in it which were
   believed to be holy, and with the altar of burnt offerings, and all the
   worship associated with it.  And a further sign of the bill of
   divorcement is this, that they cannot keep their feasts, even though
   according to the letter of the law designedly commanded them, in the
   place which the Lord God appointed to them for keeping feasts; but
   there is this also, that the whole synagogue has become unable to stone
   those who have committed this or that sin; and thousands of things
   commanded are a sign of the bill of divorcement; and the fact that
   "there is no more a prophet," and that they say, "We no longer see
   signs;" [6190] for the Lord says, "He hath taken away from Judæa and
   from Jerusalem," according to the word of Isaiah, "Him that is mighty,
   and her that is mighty, a powerful giant," etc., down to the words, "a
   prudent hearer." [6191]   Now, He who is the Christ may have taken the
   synagogue to wife and cohabited with her, but it may be that afterwards
   she found not favour in His sight; and the reason of her not having
   found favour in His sight was, that there was found in her an unseemly
   thing; for what was more unseemly than the circumstance that, when it
   was proposed to them to release one at the feast, they asked for the
   release of Barabbas the robber, and the condemnation of Jesus? [6192]
   And what was more unseemly than the fact, that they all said in His
   case, "Crucify Him, crucify Him," and "Away with such a fellow from the
   earth"? [6193]   And can this be freed from the charge of unseemliness,
   "His blood be upon us, and upon our children"? [6194]   Wherefore, when
   He was avenged, Jerusalem was compassed with armies, and its desolation
   was near, [6195] and their house was taken away from it, and "the
   daughter of Zion was left as a booth in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a
   garden of cucumbers, and as a besieged city." [6196]   And, about the
   same time, I think, the husband wrote out a bill of divorcement to his
   former wife, and gave it into her hands, and sent her away from his own
   house, and the bond of her who came from the Gentiles has been
   cancelled about which the Apostle says, "Having blotted out the bond
   written in ordinances, which was contrary to us, and He hath taken it
   out of the way, nailing it to the cross;" [6197] for Paul also and
   others became proselytes of Israel for her who came from the Gentiles.
   [6198]   The first wife, accordingly, not having found favour before
   her husband, because in her had been found an unseemly thing, went out
   from the dwelling of her husband, and, going away, has become joined to
   another man, to whom she has subjected herself, whether we should call
   the husband Barabbas the robber, who is figuratively the devil, or some
   evil power.  And in the case of some of that synagogue there has
   happened the former thing which was written in the law, but in the case
   of others, that which was second.  For the last husband [6199] hated
   his wife and will write out for her some day at the consummation of
   things a bill of divorcement, when God so orders it, and will give it
   into her hands and will send her away from his dwelling; for as the
   good God will put enmity between the serpent and the woman, and between
   his seed and her seed, [6200] so will He order it that the last husband
   shall hate her.

   20.  Christ and the Gentiles.

   Now there are those in whose case it has happened that the man dwells
   with them without having hated them, because they abide in the house of
   the last husband, who took to himself their synagogue as wife.  But
   also in their case the latter husband dies, [6201] perhaps whenever the
   last enemy of Christ, death, is destroyed.  But whichever of these
   things may happen, whether the former or the latter to the wife, the
   former husband, it says, who sent her away, will not he able to turn
   back and take her to be a wife to himself after she has been defiled,
   since "it is abomination," it says, "before the Lord thy God." [6202]
   But these things will not seem to be consistent with this, "If the
   fulness of the Gentiles be come in, all Israel shall be saved." [6203]
     But consider if it can be said to this, that, if she shall be saved
   by her former husband returning and taking her to himself as wife, she
   will in any case be saved after she has been polluted.  A priest, then,
   will not take to himself as a wife one who has been a harlot and an
   outcast, [6204] but no other, as being inferior to the priest, is
   hindered from doing so.  But if you seek for the harlot in regard to
   the calling of the Gentiles, you may use the passage, "Take to yourself
   a wife of fornication, and children of fornication," [6205] etc.; for,
   as "the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless,"
   [6206] so he who, casting out his former wife, takes in due season "a
   wife of fornication," having done it according to the command of Him
   who says, when it is necessary, and so long as it was necessary, "He
   shall not take a harlot to wife," and, when it was reasonable, He says,
   "Take to yourself a wife of fornication."  For as the Son of man is
   Lord of the sabbath, [6207] and not the slave of the sabbath as the
   people are, so He who gives the law has power to give it "until a time
   of reformation," [6208] and to change the law, and, when the time of
   the reformation is at hand, also to give after the former way and after
   the former heart another way and another heart, "in an acceptable time,
   and in a day of salvation." [6209]   And let these things be said
   according to our interpretation of the law in regard to the bill of
   divorcement.

   21.  Union of Angels and the Souls of Men.

   But some one may inquire whether the human soul can be figuratively
   called a wife, and the angel who is set over her and is her ruler, with
   whom as her sovereign she holds conversation, can be called her
   husband; so that according to this each lawfully dwells along with the
   soul which is worthy of the guardianship of a divine angel; but
   sometimes after long sojourning and intercourse a cause may arise in
   the soul why she does not find favour in the eyes of the angel who is
   her lord and ruler, because that in it there is found an unseemly
   thing; and bonds may be written out, as such are written, and a bill of
   divorcement be written and put into the hands of her who is cast out,
   so that she may no longer be familiar with her former guardian, when
   she is cast out from his dwelling.  And even she who has gone away from
   her former dwelling may be joined to another husband, and be
   unfortunate with him, not only, as in the case of the former, not
   finding favour in his sight because an unseemly thing was found in her,
   but even being hated by him. [6210]   Yea, and even there might be
   written out from the second husband a bill of divorcement and it might
   be put into her hands from the last husband who sends her away from his
   dwelling.  But whether there can be such a change of the life of angels
   with men, as to amount, so far as concerns their relation to us, to
   their death, one may put the question rash though it be; but be that as
   it may, she also who has once fallen away from the former husband will
   not return again to him, for the former husband who sent her away will
   not be able to turn back and take her as wife to himself, after she was
   defiled. [6211]   And if one should dare, using a Scripture which is in
   circulation in the church, but not acknowledged by all to be divine, to
   soften down a precept of this kind, the passage might be taken from The
   Shepherd, concerning some who as soon as they believe are put in
   subjection to Michael, [6212] but falling away from him from love of
   pleasure, are put in subjection to the angel of luxury, [6213] then to
   the angel of punishment, [6214] and after this to the angel of
   repentance; for you observe that the wife or soul who has once been
   given to luxury no longer returns to the first ruler, but also besides
   suffering punishment, is put in subjection to one inferior to Michael;
   for the angel of penitence is inferior to him.  We must therefore take
   heed lest there be found in us any unseemly thing, and we should not
   find favour in the eyes of our husband Christ, or of the angel who has
   been set over us.  For if we do not take heed, perhaps we also shall
   receive the bill of divorcement, and either be bereft of our guardian,
   or go to another man.  But I consider that it is not of good omen to
   receive, as it were, the marriage of an angel with our own soul. [6215]

   22.  The Marriage of Church Dignitaries.

   But, while dealing with the passage, I would say that we will be able
   perhaps now to understand and clearly set forth a question which is
   hard to grasp and see into, with regard to the legislation of the
   Apostle concerning ecclesiastical matters; for Paul wishes no one of
   those of the church, who has attained to any eminence beyond the many,
   as is attained in the administration of the sacraments, to make trial
   of a second marriage.  For laying down the law in regard to bishops in
   the first Epistle to Timothy, he says, "If a man seeketh the office of
   a bishop, he desireth a good work.  The bishop, therefore, must be
   without reproach, the husbands of one wife, temperate, sober-minded,"
   [6216] etc.; and, in regard to deacons, "Let the deacons," he says, "be
   the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses
   well," [6217] etc.  Yea, and also when appointing widows, he says, "Let
   there be no one as a widow under threescore years old, having been the
   wife of one man;" [6218] and after this he says the things superadded,
   as being second or third in importance to this.  And, in the Epistle to
   Titus, "For this cause," he says, "I left thee in Crete that thou
   shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders
   in every city as I gave thee charge.  If any one is blameless, the
   husband of one wife, having children, that believe" [6219] --of
   course--and so on.  Now, when we saw that some who have been married
   twice may be much better than those who have been married once, we were
   perplexed why Paul does not at all permit those who have been twice
   married to be appointed to ecclesiastical dignities; for also it seemed
   to me that such a thing was worthy of examination, as it was possible
   that a man, who had been unfortunate in two marriages, and had lost his
   second wife while he was yet young, might have lived for the rest of
   his years up to old age in the greatest self-control and chastity.
   Who, then, would not naturally be perplexed why at all, when a ruler of
   the church is being sought for, we do not appoint such a man, though he
   has been twice married, because of the expressions about marriage, but
   lay hold of the man who has been once married as our ruler, even if he
   chance to have lived to old age with his wife, and sometimes may not
   have been disciplined in chastity and temperance?  But, from what is
   said in the law about the bill of divorcement, I reflect whether,
   seeing that the bishop and the presbyter and the deacon are a symbol of
   things that truly exist in accordance with these names, he wished to
   appoint those who were figuratively once married, in order that he who
   is able to give attention to the matter, may find out from the
   spiritual law the one who was unworthy of ecclesiastical rule, whose
   soul did not find favour in the eyes of her husband because there had
   been found in her an unseemly thing, and she had become worthy of the
   bill of divorcement; for such a soul, having dwelt along with a second
   husband, and having been hated by such an one, can no longer, after the
   second bill of divorcement, return to her former husband. [6220]   It
   is likely, therefore, also, that other arguments will be found by those
   who are wiser than we, and have more ability to see into such things,
   whether in the law about the bill of divorcement, or in the apostolic
   writings which prohibit those who have been twice married from ruling
   over the church or being preferred to preside over it.  But, until
   something shall be found that is better and able by the excessive
   brilliancy of the light of knowledge to cast into the shade what we
   have uttered, we have said the things which have occurred to us in
   regard to the passages.

   23.  Some Laws Given by Concession to Human Weakness.

   But, even if we have seemed to touch on things too deep for our
   capacity in the passages, nevertheless, because of the literal
   expression these things must further be said, that some of the laws
   were written not as excellent, but as by way of accommodation to the
   weakness of those to whom the law was given; for something of this kind
   is indicated in the words, "Moses for your hardness of heart suffered
   you to put away your wives;" [6221] but that which is pre-eminent and
   superior to the law, which was written for their hardness of heart, is
   indicated in this, "But from the beginning it hath not been so."  But
   in the new covenant also there are some legal injunctions of the same
   order as, "Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away
   your wives;" for example, because of our hardness of heart, it has been
   written on account of our weakness, "But because of fornications, let
   each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband;"
   [6222] and this, "Let the husband render unto the wife her due, and
   likewise also the wife unto the husband." [6223]   To these sayings it
   is accordingly subjoined, "But this I say by way of permission, not of
   commandment." [6224]   But this also, "A wife is bound for so long time
   as her husband liveth, but if her husband be dead, she is free to be
   married to whom she will, only in the Lord," [6225] was said by Paul in
   view of our hardness of heart and weakness, to those who do not wish to
   desire earnestly the greater gifts [6226] and become more blessed.  But
   now contrary to what was written, some even of the rulers of the church
   have permitted a woman to marry, even when her husband was living,
   doing contrary to what was written, where it is said, "A wife is bound
   for so long time as her husband liveth," and "So then if while her
   husband liveth, she shall be joined to another man she shall be called
   an adulteress," [6227] not indeed altogether without reason, for it is
   probable this concession was permitted in comparison with worse things,
   contrary to what was from the beginning ordained by law, and written.

   24.  Jewish Criticism of the Law of Christ.

   But perhaps some Jewish man of those who dare to oppose the teaching of
   our Saviour will say, that when Jesus said, "Whosoever shall put away
   his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an
   adulteress," [6228] He also gave permission to put away a wife like as
   well as Moses did, who was said by Him to have given laws for the
   hardness of heart of the people, and will hold that the saying,
   "Because he found in her an unseemly thing," [6229] is to be reckoned
   as the same as fornication on account of which with good cause a wife
   could be cast away from her husband.  But to him it must be said that,
   if she who committed adultery was according to the law to be stoned,
   clearly it is not in this sense that the unseemly thing is to be
   understood.  For it is not necessary for adultery or any such great
   indecency to write a bill of divorcement and give it into the hands of
   the wife; but indeed perhaps Moses called every sin an unseemly thing,
   on the discovery of which by the husband in the wife, as not finding
   favour in the eyes of her husband, the bill of divorcement is written,
   and the wife is sent away from the house of her husband; "but from the
   beginning it hath not been so." [6230]   After this our Saviour says,
   not at all permitting the dissolution of marriages for any other sin
   than fornication alone, when detected in the wife, "Whosoever shall put
   away his own wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an
   adulteress." [6231]   But it might be a subject for inquiry if on this
   account He hinders any one putting away a wife, unless she be caught in
   fornication, for any other reason, as for example for poisoning, or for
   the destruction during the absence of her husband from home of an
   infant born to them, or for any form of murder whatsoever.  And
   further, if she were found despoiling and pillaging the house of her
   husband, though she was not guilty of fornication, one might ask if he
   would with reason cast away such an one, seeing that the Saviour
   forbids any one to put away his own wife saving for the cause of
   fornication.  In either case there appears to be something monstrous,
   whether it be really monstrous, I do not know; for to endure sins of
   such heinousness which seem to be worse than adultery or fornication,
   will appear to be irrational; but again on the other hand to act
   contrary to the design of the teaching of the Saviour, every one would
   acknowledge to be impious.  I wonder therefore why He did not say, Let
   no one put away his own wife saving for the cause of fornication, but
   says, "Whosoever shall put away his own wife, saving for the cause of
   fornication, maketh her an adulteress." [6232]   For confessedly he who
   puts away his wife when she is not a fornicator, makes her an
   adulteress, so far as it lies with him, for if, "when the husband is
   living she shall be called an adulteress if she be joined to another
   man;" [6233] and when by putting her away, he gives to her the excuse
   of a second marriage, very plainly in this way he makes her an
   adulteress.  But as to whether her being caught in the act of poisoning
   or committing murder, furnishes any defence of his dismissal of her,
   you can inquire yourselves; for the husband can also in other ways than
   by putting her away cause his own wife to commit adultery; as, for
   example, allowing her to do what she wishes beyond what is fitting, and
   stooping to friendship with what men she wishes, for often from the
   simplicity of husbands such false steps happen to wives; but whether
   there is a ground of defence or not for such husbands in the case of
   such false steps, you will inquire carefully, and deliver your opinion
   also in regard to the difficult questions raised by us on the passage.
   And even he who withholds himself from his wife makes her oftentimes to
   be an adulteress when he does not satisfy her desires, even though he
   does so under the appearance of greater gravity and self-control.  And
   perhaps this man is more culpable who, so far as it rests with him,
   makes her an adulteress when he does not satisfy her desires than he
   who, for other reason than fornication, has sent her away,--for
   poisoning or murder or any of the most grievous sins.  But as a woman
   is an adulteress, even though she seem to be married to a man, while
   the former husband is still living, so also the man who seems to marry
   her who has been put away, does not so much marry her as commit
   adultery with her according to the declaration of our Saviour.

   25.  Chastity and Prayer.

   Now after these things, having considered how many possible accidents
   may arise in marriages, which it was necessary for the man to endure
   and in this way suffer very great hardships, or if he did not endure,
   to transgress the word of Christ, the disciples say to him, taking
   refuge in celibacy as easier, and more expedient than marriage, though
   the latter appears to be expedient, "If the case of the man is so with
   his wife, it is not expedient to marry." [6234]   And to this the
   Saviour said, teaching us that absolute chastity is a gift given by
   God, and not merely the fruit of training, but given by God with
   prayer, "All men cannot receive the saying, but they to whom it is
   given." [6235]   Then seeing that some make a sophistical attack on the
   saying. "To whom it is given," as if those who wished to remain pure in
   celibacy, but were mastered by their desires, had an excuse, we must
   say that, if we believe the Scriptures, why at all do we lay hold of
   the saying, "But they to whom it is given," but no longer attend to
   this, "Ask and it shall be given you," [6236] and to that which is
   added to it, "For every one that asketh receiveth"? [6237]   For if
   they "to whom it is given" can receive this saying about absolute
   purity, let him who wills ask, obeying and believing Him who said, "Ask
   and it shall be given you," [6238] and not doubting about the saying,
   "Every one that asketh receiveth." [6239]   But when there you will
   inquire who it is that asketh, for no one of those who do not receive
   has asked, even though he seems to have done so, since it is not lawful
   to say that the saying, "Every one that asketh receiveth," is a lie.
   Who then is he that asketh, but he who has obeyed Jesus when He says,
   "If ye stand praying, believe that ye receive, and ye shall receive"?
   [6240]   But he that asketh must do everything in his power that he may
   pray "with the spirit" and pray also "with the understanding," [6241]
   and pray "without ceasing," [6242] keeping in mind also the saying,
   "And He spake a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to
   pray, and not to faint, saying, There was in a city a judge," [6243]
   etc.  And it is useful to know what it is to ask, and what it is to
   receive, and what is meant by "Every one that asketh, receiveth,"
   [6244] and by "I say unto you though he will not rise and give him,
   because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity, he will arise
   and give him as many as he needeth." [6245]   It is therefore added,
   "And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you," and so on.
   Further, let the saying, "All men cannot receive the saying but they to
   whom it is given," [6246] be a stimulus to us to ask worthily of
   receiving; and this, "What son is there of you who shall ask his father
   for a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent," [6247] etc.  God
   therefore will give the good gift, perfect purity in celibacy and
   chastity, to those who ask Him with the whole soul, and with faith, and
   in prayers without ceasing.
