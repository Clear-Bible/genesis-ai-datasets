  THE

PREFACE

   THE kind Reception which has been given to all the other Works of this
   incomparable Author, particularly to his Private Thoughts, written in
   his younger Years; has encouraged the Publishing of another Volume of
   his Thoughts, upon Subjects of the most importance to the Christian
   Life, in all the chief Scenes of it; and those compos'd when Age and
   Experience in the Course of his Parochial Ministry had taught him, what
   Directions were most necessary for the Conduct of every Disciple of
   Christ, through all the Stages of that Race that is set before us, that
   he so run that he may obtain. Accordingly the Reader is here furnish'd,
   not only with such Instructions, as are most proper for the Entrance
   upon this Race, and the early Discipline of those who are new listed
   under Christ's Banner; but also with such other Points both of Faith
   and Practice, as are most fit to be afterwards inculcated and press'd
   upon them, for their successful carrying on of this Holy Warfare, and
   finishing their Course, so as at last to attain the Crown of
   Righteousness, laid up for all those that continue Christ's faithful
   Soldiers and Servants to their lives end.

   AS in, his Private Thoughts and Resolutions, this Excellent Bishop
   seems to have chiefly aim'd at settling his own Principles, and
   regulating his Practice, as became a Follower of the Holy Jesus, and a
   Minister of his Gospel: So in These which are more Publick, he carries
   on the same pious Design with respect to others, and Executes that
   Sacred Office, for which Those were to prepare him. Indeed, great and
   indefatigable as his Labours were (for few ever labour'd more) the End
   of them was always the Salvation of Souls. And as that Spirit of Piety
   which runs through all his Writings, together with his plain,
   unaffected, familiar, and yet most solid way of Argument and
   Perswasion, are both admirably adapted to this great End: (to say
   nothing of all his other daily and unwearied pains in the Ministry
   while living) so, through God's great Blessing upon his Endeavours,
   they were then, and have been since crowned with great Success; and it
   is the Hopes and Prayers of all good Men, that they may continue so to
   be, to the End of the World, and daily add to our Holiness, and his
   Happiness.

   AMONG many Instances that might be given of this happy Success, I have
   now one before me in a Relation of the Behaviour of one of this
   vigilant Pastor's Flock, in his last Sickness, as it is Attested by
   Eye-witness of it, I will not trouble the Reader with the Particulars;
   the sum is, That this pious Gentleman, with his last Breath, expressed
   so much Resignation to God's Will, and so little fear of Death, such
   Comfort in reflecting upon the better part of his Life, especially his
   Charity to the Poor; and so much Zeal in recommending that Duty to
   those about him; and above all, such an Anticipation of those Extasies
   of Joy and Happiness which he was going to in another World, and so
   uncommon and enlarg'd an Understanding of the great Mysteries of
   Religion; that if, in the midst of these Holy Raptures, he had not
   own'd his great Obligations to Dr. Beveridge, for these Spiritual
   Blessings, yet we might have easily judged that so great a Proficient
   in the School of Religion, could be indebted, under God, to the Care
   and Instruction of no less a Master for such extraordinary
   Acquirements.

   AND, with respect that Good, which it is piously hoped this great
   Prelate's Works have done since his Death, and may continue to do
   daily; it has been observ'd by some devout Persons, that since the
   Publication of them, our Churches have been generally fuller than they
   us'd to be; to which, as nothing would contribute more, than that
   Spirit of Devotion and true Piety, which in all his practical Writings
   this Holy Man both expresses himself, and labours to create in others:
   So, if after all these Pious Endeavours to Cultivate and Promote it in
   the World, we are sensible of the least growth of it, I know not why we
   may not ascribe so good an effect to the Blessing of God upon so
   probable a Cause.

   HOWEVER, if the Piety of some among us, which we hope increaseth, be
   not a sufficient Argument of a probable increase of true Religion, to
   be expected from the Influence of this great Man's Works, yet I am
   sorry to say, that the Wickedness of others does abundantly make up
   that Defect; I mean the restless Endeavours of all the Enemies of God
   and Religion, to Discredit and Defame them; if by any means they could
   be able to ward such a Blow to the Kingdom of Darkness, as they seem to
   apprehend from his pious Labours. And what wonder if those who mock
   God, and would bring Religion itself into Contempt, use their utmost
   Endeavours to blast the Reputation of an Author, whose Writings are so
   eminently serviceable to Religion, and tend so much to advance the
   Glory of God? All their Attempts of this Nature, are so many Arguments
   of the Excellency of what they would decry; they are the Testimonies
   even of Enemies, in behalf of those admirable Books which they pretend
   to Ridicule: And all the Scorn and Contempt they express upon this
   Occasion, reflects more Honour upon Bishop Beveridge and his Works; I
   had almost said, even than the Approbation and Esteem of all his and
   Religion's Friends. So, much Good does God in his Infinite Wisdom and
   Mercy produce out of the greatest Evil, by turning all the Wit and
   Malice of these Reprobates against themselves, and making them, even
   against their own Wills, Instruments of sounding forth the Praises of
   this Excellent Writer, at the same Time, and by the very same Means,
   that they vainly attempt to Dishonour and Reproach him. As the Devils
   themselves were forc'd to own our Blessed Saviour, though they knew he
   came on purpose to destroy them. It were only to be wished, that in
   this, as in most other Instances, those Children of this Word were not
   in their Generation, so much wiser than the Children of Light. 'Tis
   true, we may as well fear, that Dogs should bark out the Moon, as that
   the utmost Malice of these Enemies to Truth, shall ever be able to
   sully a Reputation, that has long shin'd, with so much brightness,
   among all Learned and Good Men, both at home and abroad: Insomuch, that
   when this Illustrious Prelate was dying, one of the Chief of his Order,
   deservedly said of him, There goes one of the greatest, and of the best
   Men that ever England bred. No, we have seen that all their Attempts
   against him, do but add lustre to his Fame: However, it cannot be less
   the Interest of Religion to promote the Works of so able a Divine, than
   it is that of Atheism and Irreligion to oppose them; and if all good
   Men would shew as much Zeal in the defence of them and their great
   Author, and be as industrious to recommend both his Writings and
   Example, as Atheists and Libertines are to Obstruct the Influence of
   both, this would still be another Addition to the Glory of so great a
   Name; and the good Effects we might hope or, on the Lives of Men, from
   such Excellent Books, dispersed into many Hands, would be, at once, the
   best Attestation that could be given to the wondrous Benefit and
   Usefulness of them, and also the most effectual Means to stop the
   Mouths of Gainsayers, by lessening the number of them daily, and
   bringing them over from Infidelity, and Atheism; to the Cause of God
   and Religion.

   AND, I cannot close this Preface better, than with earnest Prayers to
   God, that this, and all the other Works of Bishop Beveridge may have
   that Blessed effect; and that in return to all the Malice of those, who
   seem to Envy us the great Good we may hope for from such Pious and
   Instructive Discourses, they may, by degrees, instill even into their
   Breasts, some of that Spirit of Piety, diffus'd through every Page; and
   of Atheists and Libertines, make them sober Men, and Christians.

   An Exhortation to it.

   168

   Mistaken Notions about Christianity.

   170

   How to know what it is to be a true Christian.

   171

   It is not so easy to be, as some imagine.

   174

   They that will be such, must deny themselves.

   ibid.

   Deny their Reason in Matters of Divine Revelation, which are above it.

   176

   Their Wills in submission to God's.

   178

   And their Affections.

   180

   And the Enjoyment of their Estates, when they come in competition with
   their Duty.

   182

   They must deny themselves in those Sins and Lusts they are us'd to
   indulge.

   183

   And must renounce their own Righteousness.

   184

   Which will not justify, but rather condemn.

   185

   Why we must thus deny our selves.

   189

   We must also take up the Cross.

   192

   Which they only do, who suffer for Conscience.

   195

   The reasonableness of this Duty.

   196

   An Exhortation to it.

   On striving to enter at the streght Gate.

   All must expect e're long to be in another World.

   200

   Either of endless Happiness.

   201.

   Or of Eternal Misery.

   202

   Our Saviour's Direction in this case.

   204

   The Way to Misery is broad and easy.

   ibid.

   That to Happiness narrow and difficult.

   207

   It implies the forsaking of all Sin.

   210

   The performance of many hard Duties.

   212

   Yet it is worth striving to obtain it.

   217

   For, tho' hard, yet 'tis possible.

   218

   We are invited to it by God himself.

   220

   Who affords us all necessary means to obtain it.

   221

   The Difficulties will soon be over.

   222

   Heaven will make amends for all.

   223

   In order hereto we must resolve,

   225

   And then set upon a new Life.

   226

   Depending intirely on the Merits of Christ.

   227

   Praying for the assistance of his Grace,

   228

   And waiting his Answer to our Prayers.

   229

   On the Imitation of Christ.

   Christ came into the World to save Sinners.

   231

   saying, by his Death, the Debts we ow'd to God.

   233

   Giving us a Pattern of holiness in his life.

   233

   More perfect than any before or since.

   235

   Which we are bound to follow.

   236

   But we must not presume to follow Christ in what he did as God.

   237

   Nor in what he did as God-man.

   239

   But only in what he did as meer Man.

   ibid.

   Both in his behaviour towards Men.

   241

   In his Duty to his Parents.

   ibid.

   And to his Governours.

   242

   In his Meekness towards all Men.

   244

   In his Bounty and Goodness to all, even to his Enemies.

   ibid.

   And in his Piety towards God.

   246

   Increasing in Wisdom as in Stature.

   247

   Tho' as Man, his Knowledge was finite, yet that implies no Imperfection
   or Sin.

   243

   Such Ignorance is no Sin.

   249

   But only the Ignorance of what we ought to know.

   ibid.

   At least we should thus increase in godly Wisdom, when grown up.

   250

   Teach our Children after Xt's Example.

   251

   Who, as he grew in godly Wisdom when a Child, also us'd that Wisdom
   when grown up, and devoted himself wholly to the service of God.

   ibid.

   His resignation to God's Will, love of him, Zeal for him, trust in him,
   were also most exemplary.

   253

   So were also his external Acts of Devotion, frequently retiring to
   pray.

   254

   The meaning of Proseuche.

   ibid.

   Frequenting the Synagog. on the Sab.

   256

   An Exhortation to follow Christ.

   259

   On our Call and Election.

   Many call'd but few chosen, a hard saying.

   262

   The Jews rejecting Christ's invitation, the Gentiles are call'd.

   263

   What is meant by bring called.

   267

   We are called from Darkness to Light.

   ibid.

   From Superst. and Idolat. to the true worship.

   268

   From Sin unto Holiness.

   269

   From Temporal things to Eternal.

   270

   From Misery to Happiness.

   272

   God hath call'd some by immediate revelations.

   271

   He calls all by his Works and Providences.

   ibid.

   But our Saviour means his Call by the Ministry of his Word.

   274

   That many have been, and are thus called.

   277

   But few chosen.

   279

   Not absolutely, but comparatively few.

   280

   Only such as do God's Will.

   283

   No Atheistical Persons.

   285

   None that are ignorant of the Pr. of Religion.

   286

   On the appearance of Ch. the Sun of Right.

   Why the Scripture represents Spiritual Things by sensible Objects.

   315

   As Xt's coming by the rising of the Sun of Right.

   ib.

   To burn up the Wicked.

   316

   But what healing in his Wings to such at fear God, that is to all true
   Believers.

   318

   This Sun is the Object only of our Faith.

   329

   He gave some light before his rising.

   320

   Christ is often foretold under this Emblem.

   321

   Is properly styled the Sun with respect both to what he is in himself.

   324

   And to what he is to us, the Fountain of our Light and of our Life.

   ibid.

   (Who by Nature are dead in Sins.

   331

   And of all our Joy and Comfort.

   333

   Of our fruitfulness in good Works.

   ibid

   Which receive all their lustre from the reflection of his
   Righteousness, as colours owe their being to the Reflection of the Sun.

   335

   This Sun of Righteousness thus displayed,

   ibid.

   By a lively Faith,

   337

   Would have great influence on the Holiness and Happiness of our lives.

                                    THOUGHTS

  UPON

                              Christian Education.

   IF the Principles of the Christian Religion were well rooted in the
   Hearts of all Mankind, what excellent Fruit would they produce! The
   Earth would put on another Face, bearing some resemblance of Heaven it
   self: Idolatry, with all sorts of Wickedness and Vice; would be every
   where discountenanced and suppressed for all would worship the one
   living and true God, and him only: There would be no more Wars, nor
   rumors of Wars; Kingdom would not rise against Kingdom, nor Nation
   against Nation, but all Princes would be at Peace with their
   Neighbours, and their Subjects at Unity among themselves, striving
   about nothing but which should serve God best, and do most good in the
   World. Then Piety, and Justice and Charity, would revive and flourish
   again all the World over, and particularly in the Church and Kingdom to
   which we belong. Then the Prayers would be read twice a Day in every
   Parish, as the Law requires, and all People would heartily joyn
   together in offering them up to the Almighty Creator of the World. Then
   all that are of riper Years would, at least every Lord's-Day, celebrate
   the Memory of the Death of Christ, by which their Sins are expiated,,
   and the Most High God reconciled to them, and become their God and
   Father: And as all sorts of People would thus continually worship God
   in his own house, so wheresoever they are, they would do all they could
   to serve and honour him; Whether they eat or drink, or whatsoever they
   do, they would do all to his glory. And as for their Fellow-servants,
   they would all love as Brethren, and every one seek another's good as
   well as their own: Whatsoever they would that men should do to them,
   they would do the same to all other Men. In short, all would then deny
   Ungodliness and worldly Lusts; and live soberly, righteously and
   godlily in this present world, and so walk Hand in Hand together in the
   narrow way that leads to everlasting Life. This would be the happy
   state of all Mankind, if they were but well grounded in that Religion
   which the Eternal Son of God hath planted upon Earth.

   But not to speak of other People, we of this Nation rarely find any
   such effect of this Religion among our selves, though it be as
   generally professed, and as clearly taught among us, as ever it was in
   any Nation, there are but few that are ever the better for it; the most
   being here also as bad both in their Principles, and Practices, as they
   which live in the darkest Corners of the Earth, where the light of the
   Gospel never yet shined: Tho' the Kingdoms in general be Christian,
   there are many Heathens in it, People that were never Christened many
   that were once Christened, and are now turned Heathens again, living as
   without God in the world: Many that would still be thought Christians,
   and yet have apostatized so far as to lay aside both the Sacraments
   which Christ ordained, and every thing else that can shew them to be
   so: Many that privily bring in damnable Heresies, even denying the Lord
   that bought them, and so bring upon themselves swift Destruction: Many
   that follow their pernicious Ways, by reason of whom the way of Truth
   is evil spoken of, and through Covetousness wish feigned works, make
   merchandise of men,, as St. Peter foretold, 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3. Many who
   will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts, heap to
   themselves Teachers, having itching ears, and so fulfil the Prophecy,
   of St. Paul; 2 Tim. 4. 3. And of those who still continue in the
   Communion of the Church, and in the outward profession of the true
   Christian Faith, There are many who although they profess to know God,
   yet in works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto
   every good Work reprobate, Tit. 1. 16. Many, did I say? I wish I could
   not say almost all: But alas! it is too plain to be denyed.

   For, of that vast Company of People that are called Christians in this
   Kingdom, how few are there that live as becometh the Gospel of Christ?
   that finish the Work which God hath given them to do, even glorifie him
   in the World? How many that refuse or neglect to worship and serve him
   upon his own Day? how few that do it upon any other Day, when they have
   any thing else to do? How many that never received the Sacrament of the
   Lord's Supper in their whole lives? How few that receive it above two
   or three times in the Year, how often soever they are invited to it?
   How many are the Proud, the Passionate, the Covetous; the Intemperate,
   the Incontinent, the Unjust, the Prophane and Impious, in comparison of
   the Humble and Meek, and Liberal, and Sober, and Modest, and Righteous,
   and Holy among us? The disproportion is so vastly great, that none but
   God. himself can make the Comparison: So little of Christianity is now
   to be found amongst Christians themselves; to our shame be it spoken.

   It is indeed smatter of so much Shame as well as Grief, to all that
   have any regard for the Honour of Christ their Saviour, that they
   cannot but be very solicitous to know how it comes to pass, that his
   Doctrine and Precepts are so generally slighted and neglected as they
   are in our Days? and how they may be observed better for the future
   than now they are? Both which Questions maybe easily resolved; for we
   cannot wonder, that of the many which profess the Christian Religion,
   there are so few that live up to it, when we consider how few are duly
   instructed in the first Principles of it.

   The Religion which Christ hath revealed to the World, is by his Grace
   and Blessing settled and established among us, so as to be made the
   Religion of the Kingdom in general: And therefore all that are Born in
   it, are, or ought to be, according to his Order or Institution, soon
   after baptized, and so made his Disciples, or Christians by Profession,
   And the Church takes Security of those who thus bring a Child to be
   baptized, that when it comes to be capable of it, it shall be
   instructed in the Catechism, which she for that purpose hath set forth,
   containing all the Principles of that Religion into which it was
   baptized. But notwithstanding this hath been neglected for many Years,
   whereby it is come to pass that the far greatest part of the People in
   this Kingdom, know little or nothing of the Religion they profess, but
   only to profess it as the Religion of the Country where they live; they
   may perhaps be very zealous for it, as all People are for the Religion
   in which they are born and bred, but take no care to frame their Lives
   according to it, because they were never rightly informed about it; or,
   at least, not soon enough, before Error or Sin hath got possession of
   them, which one or other of them commonly doth before they are aware of
   it; for they are always as Children tossed to and fro, and carried
   about with every wind of Doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning
   craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, Eph. 4. 14. And
   whatsoever Sin gets dominion over them, there it reigns and domineers
   in their mortal Bodies, so that they obey it in the Lusts thereof, in
   spight of all that can be said to them out of God's own Word; for they
   are no way edified by any thing they hear, in that the Foundation is
   not first laid upon which they should build up themselves, in that most
   holy Faith that is preached to them. The Word they hear is as Seed that
   falls by the way side, or upon a rock, or else among thorns,, and so
   never comes to perfection; their Hearts not being prepared before-hand,
   and rightly disposed for it, by having the Principles of the Doctrine
   of Christ first infused into them.

   This therefore being the great cause of that shameful Decay of the
   Christian Religion that is so visible among us, we can never expect to
   see it repaired, unless the great Duty of Catechising be revived, and
   the Laws that are made about it, be strictly observed all the Kingdom
   over; as most certainly they ought to be, not only as they are the Laws
   both of the Church and State, under which we live, but likewise for
   that they are grounded upon the Word of God himself, who expresly
   commands the same thing by his Apostle, saying, Fathers provoke not
   your Children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition
   of the Lord.

   For here, by nurture, we are to understand, as the Greek Word paideia
   signifies, that Discipline which Parents ought to exercise over their
   Children, to prevent their falling into, or continuing in any wicked
   course. And by the Admonition of the Lord, is meant the Catechising, or
   putting them in mind of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of what he would
   have them believe and do, that they may be saved. For the Original Word
   nouthesia, which we translate Admonition, properly signifies
   Catechising. (Katekizein noutheteinHesych.) And therefore to chatechise
   or instruct Children in the Knowledge of God and our Lord Jesus Christ,
   is a Duty here laid upon all Parents by Almighty God himself; and all
   that neglect to educate or bring up their Children in the Admonition of
   the Lord, by catechising or teaching them the Principles of his
   Religion, they all live in the breach of a plain Law, a Law made by the
   supreme Law giver of the World, and must accordingly answer for it at
   the Last-day.

   Wherefore all that are sensible of the great Account which they must
   give of all their Actions, at that time, to the Judge of the whole
   World, cannot but make as much Conscience of this as of any Duty
   whatsoever, so as to use the utmost of their Care and Diligence, that
   their Children may grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of Our Lord and
   Saviour Jesus Christ, and so be wise unto Salvation. Neither is this
   any hard matter for those to do, who live in the Communion of our
   Church, having such a Catechism or Summary of the Christian Religion
   drawn up to their Hands, which is easie both for Parents to teach, and
   for Children to learn: And yet full and comprehensive, that it contains
   all things necessary for any Man to know in order to his being saved.
   As you may clearly see if you do but cast your Eye upon the Method and
   Contents of it; which may be all reduced to these five Heads, The
   Baptismal Vow, the Apostles Creed, the Ten Commandments, the Lord's
   Prayer, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments, ordained by our Lord
   Christ.

   It begins where a Child begins to be a Christian, and therefore hath a
   Christian Name given him, even at his Baptism, wherein he was made a
   Member of Christ, a Child of God, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of
   Heaven: Which great Privileges belong to all that are baptized, and to
   none else. None else being in the number of Christ's Disciples; for our
   Lord Christ, a little before his Ascension into Heaven, left Orders
   with his Apostles, and in them, with all that should succeed in the
   Ministry of the Church to the End of the World, to make all Nations his
   Disciples, by baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy
   Ghost, as the Original Words plainly import, Mat. 28. 19. And therefore
   as People of all Nations are capable of being made his Disciples, so
   none now are, nor ever can be made so any other way, than by being
   baptized according to his Order. But they who are not thus made his
   Disciples by being baptized unto him, are not the Members of Christ;
   and if they be not the Members of Christ, they cannot be the Children
   of God, nor have any right to the Kingdom of Heaven, that being
   promised onlyto such as believe and are baptized, Mark 16. 16. And our
   Saviour himself elsewhere also saith, That except a man be born again
   of water, and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God,
   John 3. 5. Whereby we may perceive the great Necessity of this
   Sacrament, where it may be had, as our Church observes in her Office
   for the Ministration of it, to such as are of riper Years.

   It is to be further observed, that when our Saviour ordained Baptism to
   be the Way or Means of admitting Persons into his Church, or the
   Congregation of his Disciples, lest we should think, as some have done,
   that he meant it only of those who are of riper Years, he used the most
   general Terms that could be invented, requiring that all Nations should
   be so baptized, and if all Nations, then Children also, which are a
   great, if not the greatest part of every Nation. And accordingly his
   Church hath always baptized Children as well as adult Persons: When any
   who were come to Years of Discretion, were willing and desirous to
   become Christ's Disciples, that they might learn of him the Way to
   Heaven, they were made so by being baptized; and if they had Children,
   they were also baptized at the same time with their Parents And so were
   the Children which were afterwards born to them; they also were
   baptized soon after they were born: And that it is our Saviour's
   pleasure that Children also should be brought into his Church, appears
   likewise in that when his Disciples rebuked those who brought Children
   to him, he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little
   Children, to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the
   Kingdom of Heaven, Mark 10. 14.

   But seeing they who are thus baptized according to the Institution of
   Christ, are thereby made his Disciples, and in him the Children of God,
   it is necessary they should then promise to believe, and live from that
   time forward according as he hath commanded; which Promise therefore
   all that are grown up, always used to make everyone in his own Person,
   and for that purpose were, and ought to be catechized before hand, and
   put in mind of what they were to promise when they were baptized; and
   therefore were called Catechumens. But Children not being capable of
   making any such Promise themselves, in their own Persons, they were
   always admitted, and required to do it by their Guardians, that is, by
   their Godfathers and Godmothers, which brought and offer'd them to be
   baptized; and are therefore obliged to take care that they be
   afterwards catechised, or instructed in the Principles of that Religion
   into which they were admitted, and put in mind of the Promise which
   they then made of framing their Jives according to it.

   This Promise therefore which Children make at their Baptism by their
   Sureties, and which is implied in the very nature of the Sacrament,
   whether they have any Sureties or no, it consists of Three general
   Heads.

   First, That they will renounce the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps
   and Vanities of this wicked World, and all the sinful Lusts of the
   Flesh.

   Secondly, That they will believe all the Articles of the Christian
   Faith.

   Thirdly, That they will keep God's holy Will and Commandments, and walk
   in the same all the days of their life.

   Which Three Things, under which the whole substance of the Christian
   Religion is contained, being all promised by Children when they are
   baptized into it, it is absolutely necessary that they be afterwards
   put in mind so soon as they are capable of the Promise which they then
   made, and of the Obligation which lies upon them to perform it: For
   otherwise it can never be expected, that they should either do, or so
   much as know it; whereas the instructing them in this the first Part of
   the Catechism will prepare and dispose them for the understanding all
   the rest.

   Particularly the Apostles Creed, which is next taught them, containing
   all those Articles of the Christian faith, which they promised to
   believe, and nothing else; nothing but what is grounded upon plain
   Texts of Scripture, and hath been always believed by the whole
   Catholick Church, in all Ages and Places all the World over: Here are
   none of those private Opinions and controverted Points which have so
   long disturbed the Church, and serve only to perplex Mens Minds, and
   take them off from the more substantial and necessary Duties of
   Religion, as we have found by woful Experience, which our Church hath
   taken all possible care to prevent, by inserting no other Articles of
   Faith into the Chatechism which her Members are to learn, than what are
   contained in this Creed, received and approved of by the whole
   Christian World; and then acquainting them what they chiefly learn in
   it, even to believe in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
   Ghost, in whose Name they were Christened, and therefore must continue
   in this Faith, or cease to be Christians.

   The other thing which they who are baptized promise; is, That they will
   keep God's Commandments, which therefore are next taught in the
   Catechism, without any mixture of Humane Inventions or Constitutions:
   Those Ten Commandments which the supreme Lawgiver himself proclaimed
   upon Mount Sinai, and afterwards wrote with his own Finger upon two
   Tables of Stone. These they all are bound to learn, because they are
   bound to keep them all, as they will answer it at the Last-day, when
   all Mankind shall be judged by them.

   But no Man can keep these Commandments without God's special Grace,
   which we have no ground to expect, without praying to him for it. And
   therefore Children are in the next place taught how to pray according
   to that Form which Christ himself composed, and commanded us to say,
   whensoever we pray, Luke 11. 2. And as he who believes all that is in
   the Apostles Creed, believes all that he need believe; and that keeps
   all the Ten Commandments, doth all that he need to do; so he that prays
   this Prayer aright, prays for all things which he can have need of: So
   that in this short Catechism, which Children of five Years old may
   learn, they are taught all that is needful for them, either to believe
   or do, or pray for.

   The last Part of the Catechism, in concerning the two Sacraments which
   Christ hath ordained in his Church, as generally necessary to
   Salvation; that is to say, Baptism and the Lord's Supper: Both which
   our Church hath there explain'd with such extraordinary Prudence and
   Caution, as to take in all that is necessary to be known of either of
   them, without touching upon any of the Disputes that have been raised
   about them, to the great prejudice of the Christian Religion.

   Seeing therefore this Catechism is so full, that it contains all that
   any Man needs to know, and yet so short, that a Child may learn it: I
   do not see how Parents can bring up their Children in the Nurture and
   Admonition of the Lord, better than by instructing them in it. I do not
   say, by teaching them only to say it by rote, but by instructing them
   in it, so that they may understand, as soon and as far as they are
   capable, the true Sense and Meaning of all the Words and Phrases in
   every Part of it; for which purpose it will be necessary to observe
   these Rules.

   First, You must begin betime, before your Children have got any ill
   Habits, which may be easily prevented, but are not so easily cured.
   When Children are baptized, being born again of Water and of the
   Spirit, as the Guilt of their Original Sin is washed away in the laver
   of Regeneration, so that it will never be imputed to them, unless it
   break forth afterwards into actual Transgressions; so they receive also
   the Spirit of God to prevent all such Eruptions, by enabling them to
   resist the Temptations of the World, the Flesh and the Devil, to
   believe and serve God according as they then promised; so far at least,
   that sin shall not have dominion over them, that they should obey it in
   the lusts thereof, seeing now they are not under the Law, but under the
   Grace of Christ, Rom. 6. 12, 14. But that the Seeds of Grace which were
   then sown in their Hearts, may not be lost, or stifled, butt grow up to
   perfection. Great care must be taken that they may be taught, so soon
   as they are capable to discern between Good and Evil, to avoid the Evil
   and do the Good, and to believe and live as they promised, when they
   were endued with Grace to do it. Hast thou Children? saith the Son of
   Sirach, Instruct them, and bow down their neck from their youth,
   Eccles. 7. 23. Give thy Son no Liberty in his youth, and wink not at
   his Follies. Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat him on the
   sides while he is a child, lest he wax stubborn and be disobedient unto
   thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart, cap. 30. 11, 12. Whereas he
   that gathereth Instruction from his youth, shall find Wisdom till his
   old age. c. 6. 18. According to that of the Wise Man: Train up a child
   in the way that he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart
   from it, Prov. 22. 6. As Timothy from a Child had known the holy
   Scriptures, 2 Tim. 3. 15. And that was the reason that he was so expect
   in them when he became a Man: Which therefore that your Children may
   also be, the first thing they learn, must be their Catechism, where
   they are taught all the great Truths and Duties that are revealed in
   the Holy Scripture; as necessary to Salvation.

   But how can such Parents do this, that cannot read, nor say the
   Catechism themselves? This, I fear, is the case of too many among us:
   There are many who having not been taught to read when they were young,
   neglect or think scorn to learn it afterwards, and so lose all the
   Benefit and Comfort which they might receive by reading of the Holy
   Scriptures: But this, I confess, is not so necessary, especially in our
   Church, where the Holy Scriptures are so constantly read in publick;
   that if People would as constantly come and hearken to them, they might
   be wise unto Salvation, although they cannot read; as few heretofore
   could, at least in the Primitive times, when notwithstanding they
   attained to the Knowledge of God, and of their Duty to him, as well as
   if they had been the greatest Scholars in the World. But then
   considering that they could not read, they supplied that Defect by
   attending more diligently to what they heard out of God's Holy Word,
   and laying it up in their Hearts, so that they understood all the
   Principles of the Christian Religion, and were able to instruct their
   Children in the same, as well as if they could read. But this is not
   our case; for now there are many who can neither read, nor so much as
   say the Catechism, having never learned it themselves, and therefore
   cannot possibly teach it their Children. Such as the Apostle speaks of,
   who when, for the time, they ought to be Teachers, they have need that
   one teach them again, which be the first Principles of the Oracles of
   God, and are became flesh as have need of Milk, and not of strong meat,
   Heb. 5. 12. And what must such do? They certainly, as they tender their
   own good, must be doubly diligent in the use of all means that may tend
   to their Edification and Instruction: And as they desire the good of
   their Children, they must send them to School, or provide some other
   Person to teach them; which if the Parents neglect to do, the
   Godfathers and Godmothers of every Child, should put them in mind of
   it, and see that the Child be taught so soon as he is able to learn,
   what a solemn Vow, Promise and Profession he made by them at his
   Baptism. And that he may know these things the better, they must call
   upon him to hear Sermons; and chiefly they must provide that he may
   learn the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments in the
   vulgar Tongue, and all other things which a Christian ought to know and
   believe to his Soul's health, as they are contained in the Church
   Catechism, and then to bring him to the Bishop to be Confirmed by him.

   But for that purpose, when Children have been taught the Catechism,
   they must be sent to the Minister or Curate of the Parish where they
   live, that he may examin and instruct them in it: Examin whether they
   can say it, and instruct them so as to make them understand it. For
   though the Words be all as plain at they can be well made, yet the
   things signified by those Words, are many of them so high, that it
   cannot be expected that Children should reach and apprehend them
   without help: Which therefore they must go to their Minister for, whose
   Duty and Office it is to acquaint them with the full Sense and Meaning
   of every Word, what is signified by it, and what ground they have to
   believe it in God's Holy Word. But to do this to any purpose, requires
   more time than is commonly allowed for it its our Days: And that is one
   great Reason there are so few among us that are built up, as they ought
   to be, in their most holy Faith. Many refuse or neglect to send their
   Children to be Catechized at all; and they who send them, send them so
   little, and for so little a time, that it is morally impossible they
   should be much the better for it: As many have found by Experience;
   who, although in their Childhood they were taught the Catechism, and
   could say it readily, yet having not been sufficiently instructed in
   it, they afterwards forgot it again, and knew no more than as if they
   had never learnt it. I wish this be not the Case of too many Parents;
   Wherefore that this great Work may be done effectually, so as to answer
   its End, as Children should begin as soon as ever they are able to
   learn the Catechism, and go on by degrees till they can say it
   perfectly by heart, so when they can do that, they are still to
   continue to be instructed in it all along, till they understand it all
   so well, as to be fit to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper,
   which usually may be about 16 or 17 Years of Age, more or less,
   according to their several Capacities. By this means, as they grow in
   Years, they would grow also in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord
   and Saviour Jesus Christ, 2 Pet. 3. 18. This likewise would be a great
   Encouragement to the Minister to take pains with them, when they are
   such as can understand what he saith to them, and will continue under
   his Care and Conduct 'till they are settled and grounded in the Faith,
   and have their Senses exercised to discern between Good and Evil; and
   so shall be every way qualify'd to serve God, and do their Duty to him
   in that state of life, to which he shall be pleased afterwards to call
   them, upon Earth, and then to go to Heaven.

   If this could once be brought about throughout the Kingdom, that all
   Children that are born and bred up in it, were thus fully instructed in
   the Knowledge of Christ, and of that Religion which he hath revealed to
   the World, till they are fit for the Holy Communion, and ready to
   engage in the Affairs of the World, the next Generation would be much
   better than this, and Christianity would then begin to flourish again,
   and appear in its native Beauty and Lustre. And verily, whatsoever some
   may think, such especially as were never catechized themselves, this is
   as great and necessary a Duty as any that is required in all the Bible.
   For God himself by his Apostle, expresly commands all Parents to bring
   up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord; that is,
   as I have shewed, to catechize or instruct them in the Principles of
   the Doctrine of our Lord Christ. And therefore they who do it not, live
   in the breach of a known Law, yea, of many Laws. There being many
   Places in God's Holy Word, where the same thing is commanded in other
   Terms by Almighty God himself, saying, These Words which I command thee
   this Day, shall be in thy Heart, and thou shalt teach then diligently
   thy Children, Deut. 6. 7. And again, Therefore shall ye lay up these
   Words in your Heart, and in your Soul, and bind them for a Sign upon
   your Hand, that they may be as Frontlets between your Eyes, and ye
   shall teach them your Children, ch. 11. 18, 19. So also ch. 4. 10. This
   is that which he commands also by the wise Man, Train up a child in the
   way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it, Prov.
   22. 6. The Word in the Original which we translate, train up, signifies
   also to dedicate or devote a Child to the service of God, by
   instructing him how to do it, and exercising him continually in it; and
   therefore in the Margin of our Bibles, it is translated Catechize a
   Child: So that we have here both the Necessity and Usefulness of this
   Duty: The Necessity, in that it is commanded to train up, or catechize
   a Child in the Ways of God: And the Usefulness, in that what a Child is
   thus taught, will remain with him all his Life long.

   Seeing therefore that God hath laid so strict a Command upon all
   Parents; to bring up their Children in the Knowledge of himself, and of
   their Duty to him, they can expect no other, but that he should take
   particular notice whether they do it or not; and reward or punish them
   accordingly. As we see in Abraham, what a special Kindness had God for
   him upon this account? Shall I hide from him, said the Lord, that thing
   which I do? Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
   Nation, and all the Nations upon Earth shall be blessed in him. But why
   had he such an extraordinary Favour for Abraham above all other Men?
   God himself gives us the Reason of it, saying: For I know that he will
   command his Children and his Household after him, and they shall keep
   the way of the Lord, Gen. 18. 19. This was the Reason that Abraham was
   so much in his favour, that he was called the Friend of God, Jam 2. 23.

   And how much God is displeased with Parents neglecting to bring up
   their Children in his true Faith and Fear, and suffering them to grow
   up and go on in a course of Vice and Prophaneness, appears sufficiently
   from that severe Judgment which he inflicted upon Eli and his whole
   House for it, saying to Samuel, For I have told him, even Eli, that I
   will judge his House for ever, for the Iniquity which he knoweth,
   because his Sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. And
   therefore I have sworn to the House of Eli, That the Iniquity of Eli's
   House shall not be purged with Sacrifice nor Offering for ever, 1 Sa.
   3. 13, 14. The Execution or which dreadful Judgment is left upon Record
   in the Holy Scriptures, as a standing Monument and Caution to all
   Parents, to take heed how they educate their Children.

   Be sure the Saints of God in all Ages have taken as much care to bring
   up their Children well, as to live well themselves; making as much
   Conscience of this, as of any Duty whatsoever which they owe to God:
   That the Children which he hath given them, may answer his End in
   giving them; that they may not be insignificant Cyphers in the World,
   or as fruitless Trees that serve only to cumber the ground, but that
   they may serve and glorify God whilst they are upon Earth, so as to be
   meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.

   And verily all Parents would make this their continual care and study,
   if they minded either their own or their Childrens good, Many complain,
   not without cause, that their Children are Disobedient and Undutiful to
   them; but the cause is chiefly in themselves. When they have neglected
   their Duty to their Children, how can they expect their Children should
   perform their Duty to them? They were never taught it, how then can
   they do it? If therefore they prove stubborn and obstinate, if they
   give themselves up to all manner of Vice and Wickedness, if instead of
   a Comfort they be a Grief and Trouble to their Parents, their Parents
   must blame themselves for it: And when they come to reflect upon it,
   their Sin in neglecting their Duty to God and their Children in their
   Education, will be a greater trouble to them, than any their Children
   can give them. Whereas when Parents bring up their Children in the
   Nurture and Admonition of the Lord, if their Children notwithstanding
   happen to miscarry afterwards, they have this to comfort them, that
   they did their Duty, and have nothing to answer for upon that account.

   But what a mighty Advantage would it be to the Children themselves, to
   be thus continually put in mind of their Baptismal Vow, the Articles of
   our Faith, the Duties of Religion, and what else is contained in the
   Catechism, from their Childhood all along till they come to be Men or
   Women? Their Minds would be then filled with such Divine Truths, and
   with so great a sense of their Duty, that there would be no room left
   for Heresy or Sin to enter, at least not so as to get possession, and
   exercise any dominion there. The first Impressions that are made upon
   us, are not soon worn out; but usually remain as long as we live. As
   the Wise Man observes, Train up a child in the way he should go, and
   when he is old, he will not depart from it, Prov. 22. 6. When one hath
   been all along from his Childhood brought up in the Knowledge of God
   and his holy Will, it will stick by him so as to be a constant check
   upon him, to keep him within the compass of his Duty in all ordinary
   cases; and if any thing extraordinary happen to draw him aside it will
   make him restless and uneasy, till he hath recovered himself, and got
   into the right way again; and so it will either keep him Innocent, or
   make him penitent. In short, by the Blessing of God attending, as it
   usually doth, this great Duty, when it is conscienciously performed,
   this is the best means that Parents can use, whereby to breed up their
   Children for Heaven, to make them Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and
   of the Houshold of God, both in this World, and for ever.

   Wherefore, If we have any regard either to our own, or to our Childrens
   Eternal Welfare, let us set upon this Duty in good earnest; let us
   bring up our Children so long in the Nurture and Admonition of the
   Lord, till they fully know him, and all that he would have them believe
   and do, that they may be saved: but we must be sure to teach them by
   our Example as well as Instructions; we must not tell them one thing
   and do another our selves; but shew them how to keep the Faith and the
   Laws of God, by keeping them our selves before their Eyes, all the
   while we live together upon Earth: That when we are all got, one after
   another, out of this troublesome and naughty World, we and our Children
   may at last meet together in Heaven, and there praise and glorify
   Almighty God, we for them, and they for us, and all for his Grace and
   Truth in Jesus Christ our Lord.

   After this general Instruction in the Principles of our Holy Religion,
   it will be necessary, as soon as our young Christian is capable of it,
   to inform him more particularly in the Nature of God, and the great
   Mystery of the Trinity, into which we are all Baptiz'd which therefore
   shall be my next Subject.

                                    THOUGHTS

  UPON THE

                               Knowledge of G0D.

   THOUGH Religion in general be a thing that all Men naturally agree in,
   yet there is nothing, I think, that Men differ so much about, as about
   the particular Acts and Exercise of it: For all Nations in the World
   have some Religion; but there is scarce two amongst them all that have
   the same; yea, in one and the same Nation too, there are divers Modes
   of Religion professed and practised. No Nation or Country in the World
   but will afford us Instances of this; and our own, I think, as many as
   any other whatsoever: For could we but cast our Eyes into the several
   Corners of this Land, at this very Moment, what variety might we
   observe in these Acts which the several Parties amongst us account to
   be Religious! Some we should see sitting silently for a while together,
   without either speaking, or hearing of a Word spoken, until at length
   up starts a Man or a Woman, or some such thing, and entertains them
   with a Discourse made up of Censures and Malice, Blasphemy and
   Nonsense; and this is all the Religion they pretend to. Others we
   should find crowded together in several Corners, sometimes praying,
   sometimes discoursing, as it were, sometimes arguing the Case with
   Almighty God, and acquainting him with what happens in the World, and
   that with as much Confidence and Malapertness, as if he was their
   Fellow-Creature, and then very gravely walk home and please themselves
   with a vain conceit that they are more Religious than their Neighbours.
   Another sort of People there are amongst us, who are as Superstitious
   as the former were slovenly and irreverent in their Devotions: For
   these having been sprinkled with a little Holy Water, and performed
   their Obeisance to a Crucifix or Picture, presently fall a pattering
   over Ave Maria's and Pater Nosters: to themselves, as fast as they can,
   whilst the Priest, in the mean while, says something too, but the
   People generally know not what it is, nor indeed what themselves say,
   it being all in an unknown Tongue. But howsoever, though they know not
   what they say, they think that God doth, and therefore satisfy
   themselves, that they have said something, though they know not what,
   and think that God is well pleased with what they have done, because
   themselves are so.

   Others there are, and by the Blessing of God, far more than all the
   rest, in this Nation, who presenting themselves before the great
   Creator and Possessor of the World, in that solemn and reverent manner
   as the Constitutions of our Church directs, humbly confessing their
   manifold Sins against God, begging Mercy and Pardon from him, imploring
   his Favour, and praising his Name for all the expressions of his
   undeserved Love to Mankind: And all this in our vulgar Tongue, that we
   all understand, and so perform a reasonable Service unto God.

   And, verily, if we consider the Institution on itself, of that
   religious Worship which we thus perform, it is certainly the best that
   ever was prescribed by any Church, as being most consonant to the
   general Rules of Devotion laid down in Scripture; as also most
   conformable to the Discipline and Practice of the Primitive Church. But
   we must not think that we serve God aright, because we be present with
   them that do so. I do not doubt but that there are many amongst us, who
   sincerely endeavour to worship God, whensoever they present themselves
   before him in publick. I wish that all of us would do so. But we must
   still remember, that we should serve the Lord elsewhere, as well as at
   Church, and on all other Days as well as upon the Lord's Day And that
   if we would be truly Religious, our whole Man must be devoted to the
   Service of God, yea, and our whole Time too. We must not think that it
   is enough to do something, but we must do all things that are required
   of us, which notwithstanding we can never do, unless we know both that
   GOD whom we ought to serve, and that Service which we ought to perform
   unto him. And therefore David directs his Son to the right and only way
   to true Religion, saying, 1 Chron. 28. 9. And thou Solomon my Son, know
   thou the God of thy Father, and serve him with a perfect Heart, and
   with a willing Mind: Which Words, did we apply them to ourselves,
   would, by the Blessing of God, put us upon sincere Endeavours after
   real and universal Obedience to all the Commands of God: And perswade
   us not to content ourselves with vain Pretences to, and Professions of
   Religion, as most do; but strive to live up unto our Profession, and
   carry and behave ourselves so as becometh those who desire to be
   religious, and to serve God in good earnest. Which that we may do, let
   us observe the Rule and Method which David here prescribes to his Son:
   First to know God, and then to serve him with a perfect Heart and a
   willing Mind.

   I shall not trouble the Reader with any critical division of the Words,
   for they naturally divide themselves into two Parts.

   First, That we should know, and then that we should serve God with a
   perfect Heart, and with a willing Mind.

   I shass begin with the First, not only because it is first placed, but
   because it necessarily must precede the Second; is being impossible for
   us to serve God aright unless we know him: For without this, all our
   Services will be but like the Altar which the Athenians Dedicated, To
   agnosto Theo, To the unknown God. By which, Inscription, they
   manifested to the World, that they knew that they ought to serve some
   God, but that they knew not that God whom they ought to serve. But that
   we may so know him as to serve him aright, I shall first shew what it
   is a God which we must know, in order to our serving him aright.

   First, Therefore he that would serve God aright, must believe and know
   that he is, Heb. 11. 6. that is, That there is such a supreme and
   all-glorious Being in, and over the World that we call God, that made,
   preserves, governs, and disposes of every Thing in the World, as
   seemeth best to him: And that it is not only probable that there is
   such a One, but that it is the must certain and necessary Truth in the
   World; without which, there would be no such thing as Truth or
   Certainty. For indeed if God was not, nothing could be; He alone being
   the Basis and Foundation of all Being in the World, yea, and of all
   Motion too, Acts 17. 28. And therefore every thing that lives, every
   thing that moves, nay, every thing that is, argues God to Be, which
   therefore is the first great Truth, upon which all the rest depend;
   without which nothing would be True, much less wou'd our Services be
   so: So that the first thing to be done in order to our serving God, is
   to know and believe that he is, and that he ought to be served and
   adored by us.

   Secondly., It is necessary to know his Essence too, as well as his
   Existence; what, as well as that he is; what he is in himself, and what
   he is to us; that in himself he is what he is, in and of himself, the
   source of all Wisdom, the Abyss of all Power, the Ocean of all
   Goodness, the Fountain of all Happiness, the Principle of all Motion,
   and the Center, yea, Perfection of all Perfections in the World; whose
   Nature or Essence is so Pure, so Glorious, so Immense, so Infinite, so
   Eternal, so every way Perfect, Transcendent, and Incomprehensible, that
   the more we think of him, the more we contemplate upon him; the more we
   praise and admire him, the more we may. And the highest Apprehensions
   that we can have of him, is still to apprehend him infinitely higher
   than all our Apprehensions of him. And therefore that Man best knows
   God, that knows him to be beyond his Knowledge; and that knows he can
   never know him enough.

   But we must know too what he is to us, even the Author and Giver of
   every good thing we have, and who in himself is whatsoever we can
   desire to make us happy: And therefore it is that in the Covenant of
   Grace, when he would assure us that we shall have all things that we
   can enjoy, he only promises to be our God, Heb. 8. 10. which is as much
   as we can desire, and indeed as himself can promise; for in promising
   himself, he hath promised whatsoever he is, whatsoever he hath,
   whatsoever he doth, nay, whatsoever he can do as God. And thus are we
   to look upon God as the only Object of all true Happiness, and the only
   Centre wherein all the Desires and Inclinations of our Souls can rest.

   Thirdly, It is necessary also to know the several Attributes and
   Perfections which he hath revealed of himself in Scripture; that he is
   so Wise as to know whatsoever can be known; so Powerful as to do
   whatsoever can be done: So Great and Glorious in himself, that we have
   all just cause to fear him; so Kind and Gracious in his Son, that it is
   our Duty also to trust in him; so True, that whatsoever he says is True
   because he saith it; so Good, that whatsoever he doth is good because
   he doth it; so Just as to punish every Sin that is committed, and yet
   so Merciful as to pardon every Sinner that repenteth; that he is Pure
   without mixture, Infinite without Bounds, Eternal without Beginning,
   Everlasting without End, and every way Perfect, without Comparison.

   Fourthly, We must know also the Works of God, what he hath done,
   wherein he hath manifested himself to us. But what hath God done? or
   rather, what hath he not done? It was he that raised this stately
   Fabrick of the World we live in, out of the Womb of Nothing, It was he
   that extracted Light out of Darkness, Beauty and Perfection out of a
   confused Chaos. It was he that bedecked the glorious Canopy of Heaven
   with those glittering Spangles the Stars. It was he that commanded the
   Sun to run his course by Day, and the Moon to ride her Circuit by Night
   about the World, to shew the Inhabitants thereof the Glory of their
   All-glorious Maker. It was he that hung the Earth upon Nothing, and
   spread upon the Surface of it a curious Carpet, embroidered with all
   manner, not of painted, but real Flowers, and Plants, and Trees. It was
   he that at first produced all Things out of Nothing; and it is he that
   still preserves all Things in their Being. It is he that orders the
   Affairs of Kingdoms, manageth the Intrigues of State, directeth the
   Events of Wars, and disposes of every particular Person as himself sees
   good. In a word, Whatsoever was ever made in Heaven above, or on Earth
   beneath, it was he that made it; and whatsoever is still done in Heaven
   above, or on Earth beneath, it is he that doth it, so that nothing ever
   was, or is, or ever will be, or can be done, but what is done by him,
   as the First and Universal Cause of all Things.

   Fifthly, It is necessary also to know so as to believe, that though
   there is but One God, yet there are Three Persons; all and every one of
   which is that One God. I do not say it is necessary to understand, or
   comprehend this Mystery, for that we cannot do; but we are not
   therefore the less to believe it, because we cannot understand it: For
   there are many other things in Divinity; yea, many things in Natural
   Philosophy, and in Geometry itself, which we cannot understand, and yet
   for all that, both know and believe them to be true. But how much more
   cause have we to believe this, which God himself hath asserted of
   himself! Nay, and besides that, we have the same Obligations to serve
   and honour every Person, as we have to serve and honour any one Person
   in the Sacred Trinity, our Saviour himself having expresly told us,
   That all Men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father, Joh.
   5. 23. But that we cannot do, unless we believe the Son to be God as
   well as the Father; and, by consequence, unless we acknowledge this
   Fundamental Article of our Christian Faith, into which we were all
   baptized.

   Secondly, We must consider what kind of Knowledge we ought to have of
   God, in reference unto our serving him aright.

   For we must not think that it is enough to know in general that there
   is a God, and that he is Wise and Powerful, Great and Glorious, True
   and Faithful, Good and Gracious; these things a Man may know in
   general, so as to be able to discourse of them, and dispute for them
   too, and yet come short of that Knowledge which is requisite to our
   true serving of God: Which should be such a Knowledge as will not only
   swim in the Brain, but sink down into the Heart; whereby a Man is
   possessed with a due sense of those things he knows, so that he doth
   not only know, but in a manner feel them to be so. Thus David, who, in
   the Text, calls upon his Son to know the God of his Fathers, intimates
   elsewhere, what Knowledge he means; saying, Oh taste and see that the
   Lord is good, Psal. 34. 8. Where we may observe, how he requires our
   Spiritual Senses to be employ'd in our Knowledge of God, so as to see
   that he is good, yea, and taste it too; that is, feel and experience it
   in our selves; which though it may seem a Paradox to many of us, yet
   there is none of us but may find it to be a real Truth, and attain unto
   it, if we be but careful and constant in our Meditations upon God, and
   sincere in performing our Devotions to him; for, by these means, our
   Notions of God will be refined, our Conceptions cleared, and our
   Affections, by consequence, so moved towards him, that we shall taste
   and experience in our selves, as well as know from others, that he is
   Good, and that all Perfections are concentred in him.

   But this practical and experimental Knowledge of God, doth necessarily
   presuppose the other, or the general Knowledge of him, so as to be
   acquainted with the several Expressions which God in Scripture hath
   made use of, whereby to reveal himself and his Perfections to us; as
   when he is pleased to call himself the Almighty God, the All-wise and
   Infinite, the Just and Gracious God, and the like; or to say of
   himself, I am that I am, that is, in and of my self Eternal. Unless we
   first know that these and such like Expressions belong to God, and what
   is the true meaning and purport of them, it is impossible for us to
   arrive at that Knowledge of him, which is necessary to our serving him
   aright. And so I come to the last thing to be consider'd here
   concerning the Knowledge of God, even that it is necessary to our
   serving him; so that none can serve him that does not first know him,
   and therefore that the Method as well as Matter of David's Advice is
   here observable, Know thou the God of thy Fathers, and serve jim; or,
   first know him, and then serve him with a perfect Heart, and a willing
   Mind.

   And, verily, one would think that this is a Truth so clear, so evident
   of it self, that it needs no Proof or Demonstration; for how is it
   possible for us to know how to serve God, unless we first know that God
   whom we ought to serve? For all our Services unto god should be both
   proper to his Nature, and suitable to his Perfections; and therefore
   unless I first know his Nature and Perfections, how can I adjust my
   Services to them? As for Example, I am to fear his Greatness and trust
   on his Mercy, and rejoyce in his Goodness, and desire his Favour: But
   how can I do this, unless I know that he is thus Great and Merciful,
   Good and Favourable.

   Moreover, as a Man cannot serve God. when he hath a Mind to do it, so
   neither will he have a Mind or Heart to serve him unless he unless
   knows him. For the motions of the Will are always regulated by the
   ultimate Dictates of the practical Understanding, so that a Man chuses
   or refuses, loves or hates, desires or abhors, according as he knows
   any Object that is presented to him to be Good Or Evil. And therefore
   how can I chuse God as my chiefest Good, unless I first know him to be
   so; or love him as I ought, above all things, unless I first know him
   to be better than all things; or perform any true Service to him,
   unless first know him to be such a one, as deserves to have true
   service performed unto him.

   Nay, Lasty, Nothing that we do can be accepted as a Service to God,
   unless it be both grounded upon, and directed by a right Knowledge of
   him. God would not accept of blind Sacrifices under the Law; much less
   will he accept of blind Services now under the Gospel and therefore he
   expects and requires now, that whatsoever we do, either to or for him,
   be a logiken latreia,. a reasonable Service, Rom. 12. 1. That our Souls
   as well as Bodies, yea, and the Rational as well as Sensitive Part be
   employ'd in all the Services which we perform to him; which certainly
   can not be, unless we first know him; so that there is an indispensable
   Connection betwixt our knowing and serving God; it being as impossible
   for any Man to serve him, that doth not first know him, as it is to
   know him aright, and not to serve him.

   But howsoever indispensable this Connection be in its own nature, the
   Church of Rome can make a shift to dispense with it; yea, so far as to
   assert, That Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion: But you must excuse
   them, for they do not mean by Devotion as we do, the real serving of
   God, but only the performing of some outward Services to him. And such
   a kind of Devotion, I confess, Ignorance may be the Mother of: But a
   Man must be grosly ignorant that thinks this to be Devotion, which is
   but a piece of Pageantry, a mocking instead of serving God. And, for my
   part, I cannot but tremble to think what a dismal, what a dreadful
   Account the Heads of that Church must hereafter give for daring to keep
   the People in so much Ignorance as they do; so as to render them
   uncapable of serving God, that so they may be the more ready to serve
   the Church; that is, the Interests and Designs of the Court of Rome.

   But let them look to that; whilst we, in the mean while, study to know
   God before all things else, considering,

   First, God therefore made us that we might know him, and that we might
   know that he made us. And therefore it is that he hath made Rational
   Creatures capable of reflecting upon him that made us so: Neither did
   he only make us at first, but he still preserves us; we feed daily at
   his Table, and live upon his Bounty. And the very Beasts, that any of
   us keep, know those that keep them; and shall we be more brutish than
   Brutes themselves, and not know him that keeps and maintains us? O how
   justly may God then call Heaven and Earth to witness against us, as he
   did once against his People Israel! Isa. 1. 2, 3, 4.

   Secondly, There is none of us but have attained to Knowledge in other
   things: Some of us have searched into Arts and Sciences, others are
   acquainted with several Languages, none of us but are, or would be
   expect in the Affairs of this World, and understand the Mysteries of
   our several Trades and Callings; what, and shall he alone, by whom we
   know other things, be himself unknown unto us? What is, if this be not,
   a just Cause, wherefore God should infatuate and deprive us of all our
   Knowledge in other things? seeing we labour more to know them, than him
   from whom we receive our Knowledge.

   Thirdly, Ignorance of God is itself one of the greatest Sins that we
   can be guilty of, and which God is most angry for, Hos. 4. 4. And there
   God himself imputes the Destruction of his People, to the want of
   Knowledge, v. 6. Nay, and it is that Sin too that makes way for all the
   rest. For what is the Reason that many so frequently Blaspheme God's
   Name, slight his Service, transgress his Laws, and incense his Wrath
   against them, but meerly because they do not know him, how Great, how
   Glorious, how Terrible a God he is? For did they but thus rightly know
   him, they could not but regard the Thoughts of doing any thing that is
   offensive to him: And therefore the true Knowledge of God would be the
   best Security and the most sovereign Antidote in the World against the
   Infection of Sin, and the prevalency of Temptations over us; neither
   would it only preserve us from Sin, but put us upon Duty and Service,
   and direct us also in the performance of it. Insomuch that the hardest
   Duty will be easy to one that knows God; the easiest will be hard to
   one that knows him not. Hard, did I say? Yea, and impossible too; for
   although a Man may know God, and yet not serve him, it is impossible
   that any Man should serve God unless he knows him; Knowledge itself
   being both the first Duty that we owe to God, and the Foundation of all
   the rest.

   And therefore, to conclude, if any desire to perform the Vow they made
   in their Baptism, to love and fear, to honour and obey the Eternal God
   that made them? If any desire to be Christians indeed, and holy in all
   manner of Conversation? If any desire to trust on the Promises, and
   observe the Precepts of the Great Creator and Possessor of the World,
   to live above the Snares of Death, and to antedate the Joys of Heaven?
   If any desire to live the Life, and to die the Death of the Righteous,
   to serve God here, so as to enjoy him hereafter? Let all such but study
   the Scriptures, and frequent the publick Ordinances; be constant and
   sincere in Prayer and Meditation, neglecting no Opportunity of
   acquainting themselves with God, but make use of all means possible, to
   get their Hearts possessed with a reverential Apprehension of God's
   Greatness and Glory, and with a due sense of his Goodness and
   Perfections, and their Work will soon be done; for if they thus know
   God, they will serve him too with a perfect Heart, and a willing Mind.

   We have seen how we ought to know God; we are now to consider how we
   ought to serve him; without which, indeed, our Knowledge of him will
   avail us nothing. For, as the Apostle argues, though I speak with
   Tongues of Men and Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as
   sounding Brass, and a tinkling Cymbal, 1 Cor. 13. 12. So here: Though
   we should have the highest Notions and Speculations in Divinity, that
   Men or Angels ever had; though we should understand the highest
   Mysteries in Religion, and dive into the profoundest Secrets of
   Christian Philosophy; though we should excel the greatest School-Men,
   and the most learned Doctors that ever lived; and were able to baffle
   Heresies, dispute Error and Schism out of the Christian Church, and
   evince the Truth of the Articles of our Faith, by more than
   Mathematical Demonstrations; Yet, if after all this, our Knowledge be
   only Notional, not moving our Affections, nor putting us upon the
   Practice of what we know, it is but as sounding Brass, and tinkling
   Cymbal; it may make a noise in the World, and get us Applause amongst
   Men, but it will stand us in no stead at all before the Eternal God;
   yea, it will rise up in judgment against us another Day, and sink us
   lower into the Abyss of Torments. And therefore, tho' Men may, God doth
   not look upon this as the true Knowledge of himself. Neither can any
   one be properly said to know God that doth not serve him with a perfect
   Heart, and a willing Mind. And therefore having discoursed of that
   Knowledge which is necessary to our serving God, I shall now endeavour
   to shew, how we ought to serve God according to our Knowledge.

   In speaking unto which, I must beg the Reader's most serious and
   Christian attention, as to a Matter which concerns our Lives; yea, our
   Eternal Lives in another World: I hope there is none of those that
   pretends to Instruct, so Brutish and Atheistical, as not to desire to
   serve God: None so Proud and Self-conceited, as to think that they
   serve him well enough already, or at least know how to do it. I write
   only to such as desire to be instructed, read Books of practical
   Religion with no other Design but to serve God, and to learn how to
   serve him better. And if this be our only Design, as I hope it is, let
   us manifest it to the World, and to our Consciences, by attending to,
   and fixing what we read upon our own Hearts. For I may venture to say,
   that this is the noblest and most necessary Subject that I can write,
   or any one can read of; and that which, if seriously weighed, rightly
   considered, and truly practised, will most certainly bring us to the
   highest Happiness which our Natures are capable of, or our Persons were
   at first designed for.

   Now, for our clearer proceeding in a Matter of so great Importance, we
   will best consider, what it is to serve God? A Question very necessary
   to be treated of and resolved, because of the general Mistakes that are
   in the World about it: Many People fancying the Service of God to
   consist in some few particular Acts; as in saying their Prayers,
   reading the Scriptures, going to Church, and giving an Alms now and
   then to the Poor, especially if they be but zealous and resolute in the
   Defence of the Party or Faction they are of, so as to promote it to the
   highest of their Parts, Estates, or Power, then they think they do God
   good service, and that this is all he requires of them. Others think
   they serve God by serving of his Creatures, as in praying to Saints,
   bowing to Images, and falling down before the Eucharist, when it is
   carried in Procession: Nay, many there are, who think they serve God
   when they dishonour him, wresting his Scriptures, corrupting his
   Doctrines, opposing his Vicegerents, seducing his People and Servants
   into Error, and all for the promoting of some Temporal Interests, or
   groundless Opinions. But we might know that the Service of God is a
   Thing of an higher Nature, and nobler Stamp than such silly Mortals
   would perswade us it is: Consisting in nothing less than,

   1. In devoting of our selves, and all we have, or are, or do unto the
   Honour of the Eternal God; resigning our Hearts wholly to him, and
   subduing all our Passions and Affections before him. For seeing we were
   wholly made by him, and wholly depend upon him, if we would serve God
   at all, we must serve him with all we are; every Faculty of our Souls,
   and Members of our Bodies employing themselves in those Services which
   he hath set them, so as to live as none of our own, but as wholly
   God's; his by Creation, it was he that made us; his by Preservation, it
   is he that maintains us; and his by Redemption, it is he that hath
   purchased us with his own most precious Blood; and therefore being thus
   bought with a price, we should glorify God both in our Souls and Bodies
   which are his, 1 Cor. 6. 20.

   And as we are to serve him with all we are, so also with all we have,
   Honour the Lord with thy Substance, and with the first fruits of all
   thine increase, Prov. 3. 9. Whatsoever we have, we receive from his
   Bounty, and therefore whatsoever we have we should employ for his
   Glory: Our Parts, our Gifts, our Estates, our Power, our Time;
   whatsoever we can call ours, is his in our Hands, and therefore to be
   improved, not for our selves but him; as our Saviour shews in the
   Parable of the Talents which the Master of the House distributed
   amongst his Servants, to some he gave one, to some five, to others ten,
   that every one might employ his Proportion to his Master's use, neither
   squandering it away, nor yet laying it up in a Napkin. It is God that
   to the grand Master and Possessor of the World, who parcels it out
   amongst his Creatures, as himself sees good; but wheresoever he
   entrusteth any thing, he expects the improvement of it for himself, And
   so, I suppose, doth every one of us from such Servants as we keep; we
   expect that what we put into their Hands, be laid out, nor for
   themselves, but for us; and that they spend their Time in our service,
   not their own: And if they do otherwise, none of us but will say, they
   do not serve us, but themselves. How then can we expect that God should
   look upon us, as serving him, when we do not do so much for him, as we
   expect from our own Servants, though our Fellow-Creatures? Or how can
   we think that we serve him as we ought, unless we serve him as much as
   we can? Or that God should look upon us as his Servants, unless we
   employ and improve whatsoever we have, not for our own Pleasure, Profit
   or Applause, but for his Honour and Glory, from whom we did receive it?
   Let us remember our Saviour's Words, Mat. 5. 16. Let your Light so
   shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your
   Father which is in Heaven.

   2. Hence the serving of God consisteth also in the performing of
   sincere and universal Obedience to all his Laws and Commands, which is
   but the natural consequent of the former: For if our whole Man, both
   Soul and Body, and whatsoever we have, or are, ought to be devoted to
   his Glory; it must needs follow, that whatsoever we do, should be
   conformable to his Precepts; which also is no more than every one of us
   expects from our Servants: For those whom we have covenanted with to be
   our Servants, and whom we keep upon that very account; that they may
   serve us, we all expect that they should observe all our Commands, and
   do whatsoever in Justice, and by our Covenants, we can enjoyn them. But
   how much more more then must we ourselves be obliged to obey all the
   Laws and Precepts of him that made us, whose Creatures we are, and
   whose Servants, by consequence, we ought to be.

   I say, all his Laws and Precepts, for we must not think to pick and
   chuse, to do some things, and leave other things undone: For we should
   take it ill if our Servants should serve us so; if when we send them
   upon several Businesses, they should mind only one of them, and neglect
   all the other, we should questionless look upon them as very idle and
   careless Servants: But let us consider and bethink ourselves, whether
   we have not served our Master, the Eternal God, as bad as our Servants
   have, or can serve us. He hath given us several Laws to observe, and
   hath set us several Works to do, and we, perhaps, can make a shift to
   do something that is required of us; but never think of the other, and
   perhaps, the principal things too that he expects from us.

   Just as if when Moses had broke the two Tables of Stone, whereon the
   Ten Commandments were written, one Man should have come and snatched
   away one piece, a second ran away with another piece, and a third with
   another, till at length ten several Persons had gotten several Pieces,
   wherein in the Ten Commandments were severally written; and when they
   had done so, every one of them should have striven to keep the Law that
   was written in his own Piece, never minding what was written in the
   others. Do you think that such Persons as these are, could be reputed
   the Servants of God, and to observe his Laws, when they minded only one
   particular Branch or Piece of them. The Case is our own; we hearing of
   several Laws and Commands which the most high God hath set us, get some
   one of them by the end, and run away with that, as if we were not
   concerned in any of the rest. But let us still remember, that the same
   Finger that wrote one of the Commands, wrote all the other too. And
   therefore he that doth not observe all, as well as one, cannot properly
   be said to observe any at all. Neither indeed doth he serve God in any
   thing: For though he may do something that God requires, yet it is
   plain, that he doth not therefore do it, because God requires it; for
   if he did so, he would do all things else too that God requires. And
   therefore such a Person doth not serve God at all in what he doth no,
   he serves himself rather than God, in that he doth it not in obedience
   to God, but with respect unto himself; as to get himself a Name and
   Credit amongst Men, or perhaps to satisfy his troublesome Conscience,
   which would not let him be at quiet unless he did it.

   But now one that would serve God indeed, hath respect to all his
   Commandments, Psal. 119. 6. And walks in all the Commandments and
   Ordinances of the Lord blameless, as Zacharias and Elizabeth are said
   to have done, Luke 1. 6. And thus, Whosoever would serve the Lord in
   any thing, must serve him in all things that be requireth. And this is
   that which David means in this Advice to his Son, saying, Know thou the
   God of thy Fathers and serve him; that is, observe and do whatsoever he
   enjoyns, and that too, with a perfect Heart and a willing Mind.

   And so I come to the Second thing to be consider'd here; that is, The
   manner how we ought to serve God, even with a perfect heart and with a
   willing Mind.

   First, With a perfect Heart: That is, With Integrity and Sincerity of
   Heart, not from any By-ends, or sinister Designs but out of pure
   Obedience to the Laws of God, as he is the Sovereign of Heaven and
   Earth, and, in Christ, our Lord and our God. A thing much to be
   observed in all our Services, without which, indeed, they are no
   Services at all. Insomuch, that should we pray our Tongues to the
   Stumps, and fast our Bodies into Skeletons; should we fill the Air with
   Sighs, and the Sea with Tears for Sin; should we spend all our Time in
   hearing of Sermons, and our whole Estates in relieving the Poor; should
   we hazard our Lives, yea, give our Bodies to be burnt for our Religion,
   yet nothing of all this would be accepted as a Service unto God, unless
   it be performed out of sincere Obedience to his Laws, and with a single
   Eye, aiming at nothing but his Glory, which ought to be the ultimate
   End of all our Actions, 1 Cor. 10. 31.

   Secondly, We must not only serve with a perfect Heart, but with a
   willing Mind too; vnphs chphtsh properly with a willing Soul; that is,
   our Will, and all the Affections of our Souls should be carried after,
   and exercised in the Service of Almighty God. Our Desires are to be
   enflamed towards it, our Love fixed upon it, and our Delight placed in
   it. Thus the Israelites are said to have sought the Lord with their
   whole desire, 2 Chron. 15. 15. And we are commanded to love the Lord
   our God, and so to serve him with all our Heart, and with all our Soul,
   Deut. 11. 13. Yea, we are to delight to do the Will of God, Psal. 40.
   8. As our Saviour did, saying, It is my Meat to do the Will of him that
   sent me, and to finish his Work, Joh. 4. 34. Thus are we too to esteem
   the Service of God above our necessary Food, pleasing our selves in
   pleasing him, and so make his Service not only our Business, but our
   Recreation too; and whosoever doth not so, whatsoever he doth for God,
   he cannot be said to serve him, because he doth it against his Will,
   and against the Bent and Inclination of his Soul. And therefore,
   though, as to the outward Act, he may do that which God commands, yet
   inwardly he doth it not; because his Soul is still averse from it, by
   which means it ceaseth to be the Service of God; because it is not
   performed by the Whole Man, even Soul and Body, both which are
   necessarily required in our Performance of real Service to him that
   made them both.

   Thirdly, What is the Reason why we ought to serve God so? Because he
   searcheth the Hearts, and understandeth all the Imagination of the
   Thoughts: that is, He is throughly acquainted with every Thought in our
   Hearts, and with every Motion and Inclination of our Souls, infinitely
   better than our selves are. And therefore it is in vain for us to think
   to put him off with outward and formal, instead of inward and real
   Service. For he doth not only see what we do, but knows too what we
   think, while we are doing of it; and doth not only observe the Matter
   of our Actions, but the manner also of our performing them. It being
   his great Prerogative to search the heart, and to try the reins, and to
   have all things naked and open unto him, Heb. 4. 13. So that he sees
   what the Soul doth within doors, in the secret Closets of the Heart, as
   clearly as what it doth without, in the open Streets of the World;
   every Affection of the Soul being as manifest unto him, as the Actions
   of the Body are: And therefore Hypocrisy is the most foolish and
   ridiculous Sin imaginable, making as if we could Cheat and Deceive God,
   and hide our Sins from the All-seeing Eyes of Omniscience itself, or
   make God believe that we are Holy, because we appear to be so to Men.

   But to bring this home more closely to ourselves. We have been all at
   Church, perhaps, performing our Service and Devotions to him that made
   us; it is true, as to our outward Appearance, there hath been no great
   difference betwixt us, we have been equally present at these Publick
   Ordinances, and we do not know but one hath prayed and heard the Word
   of God both read and preached as well as another; so that seemingly our
   Services are all alike as to us; but are they so to God too? that I
   much question: For he hath taken especial notice all along, not only of
   the outward Gestures of our Bodies, but likewise of the inward
   Behaviour of our Hearts and Souls before him: And therefore, as I hope
   he hath seen many of us serving him with a perfect heart, and willing
   mind; so, I fear, he hath found too many of us tardy, coming before him
   as his People come, and sitting before him as his People sit, while our
   Hearts in the mean time have been about our Covetousness; and hath
   plainly seen, that though your Bodies have been at Church, our Souls
   have been elsewhere, thinking upon our Relations, or Estates, or
   something or other, besides what our Thoughts should have been employ'd
   about in so solemn a Duty as the Publick Worship. But know this, Oh
   vain man, whosoever thou art, art, that God will not be mocked: And
   though thou hast not seen, or perhaps so much as thought of him, he
   hath seen thee and thy Thoughts too; yea, at this very Moment looks
   upon thee. And what wilt thou answer him, the great Judge of the whole
   World, when he shall tell thee to thy Face, and call his Omniscience to
   witness, That he saw thee at this, as at other times, play the
   Hypocrite with him, making as if thou servedst him, when thou servedst
   him not; and instead of serving him with a perfect Heart, and a willing
   Mind, servedst him neither in Heart nor Mind. Let us all remember this
   when we approach God's House, and also bethink ourselves afterwards
   whether we have not been guilty of this Sin? if we have, we may be sure
   God knows it, and we shall hear of it another Day. But to prevent what
   justly may be our Doom, let us repent of our former neglects in this
   kind; and, for the future, whensoever we are serving God, let us still
   look upon him as looking upon us, and fix in our Hearts this one thing,
   That God knows all things in the World. And therefore let us not think
   to put God off with such careless and perfunctory Services as
   heretofore too many of us have done but if we desire to serve him at
   all, let us serve him with a perfect Heart and a willing Mind.

   Thus 1 have endeavoured to shew both what it is to serve God, and how
   we ought to do it: Now let us not think it sufficient that we know how
   to serve God, unless we serve him according to our Knowledge. Let us
   remember our Saviour's Words: If ye know these things, happy are ye if
   you do them, Joh. 13. 17. Which Happiness, that all who read this, may
   attain unto, let me advise them, in the Name of the Eternal God that
   made them, to renounce and forsake their former Masters, Sin, Satan and
   the World, whoever may have hitherto been inflaved to them, and now
   dedicate themselves wholly to the Service of him, that made them for
   that very purpose, that they might serve him; yea, and who hath
   composed our Natures so, that the highest Happiness that we are capable
   of, consists in our serving him And therefore let us not think that he
   calls upon us to serve him, because he wants our Service; no, be it
   known unto all, that he is infinitely happy in the enjoyment of his own
   Perfections, and needs not the Services of such poor silly Mortals as
   we are, who have nothing but what we receive from him: And therefore he
   doth not call upon us to serve him, because he cannot be happy without
   us, but because we cannot be happy without him: Not because he wants
   our Service, but because we want it; it being impossible for us to be
   Happy, unless we be Holy; or to enjoy God, unless we serve him.

   Wherefore all ye that desire to go to Heaven, to have him that made you
   reconciled unto you, and smile upon you; or that desire to be really
   and truly Happy, set upon the Work which God sent you into the World
   about, put it not off any longer, make no more vain Excuses, but from
   this Day forward, let the Service of God be your daily, your continual
   Employment and Pleasure: Study and contrive each Day how to advance his
   Glory and Interest in the World, and how you may walk more strictly,
   more circumspectly, more conformably to his Laws than ever. But
   whatsoever Service you perform unto him, be sure to do it with a
   perfect Heart, and with a willing Mind. Think not to put him off with
   Fancy instead of Faith, or with outward Performances instead of real
   Duties: But remember that he searcheth the Hearts, and tryeth the Reins
   of the Sons of Men, and observes the inward Motions of the Soul, as
   well as the outward Actions of the Life: And therefore wheresoever you
   are, whatsoever you bethink your selves, that he that made you, still
   looks upon you; taking notice, not only of the matter of the Actions
   which you do perform, but also of the manner of your performing them;
   and therefore be sure to have a special care in all your Services for,
   or unto God, that your Hearts be sincere before him, and your Minds
   inclined to him, that so you may serve him with a perfect Heart and a
   willing Mind.

   But to conclude; Whoever ye are that read this Discourse, I have here
   shewn you the things that belong unto your Everlasting Peace, having
   acquainted you with the Method and Manner of your serving God in Time,
   in order to your Enjoyment of him to Eternity; how you are affected
   with what you have read, and whether you be resolved to practice it,
   yea, or no, 'tis only the Eternal God that knows. But this I know, that
   if you will not be perswaded to serve God, yea, and to serve him too
   with a perfect Heart, and a willing Mind, you will one Day wish you
   had, but then it will be too late. And therefore if you will put it to
   the venture, go on still, and with the unprofitable Servant, hide your
   Talents in a Napkin, or lavish them out in the Revels of Sin and
   Vanity; let thy Belly be still thy God, and the World thy Lord, serve
   thy Self or Satan, instead of the living God: But know that for all
   this, God will bring thee into Judgment; after which, expect nothing
   else but to be overwhelmed with Horror and Confusion to Eternity.

   Whereas on the other side, such amongst you as shall sincerely
   endeavour from henceforth to serve God with a perfect Heart, and with a
   willing Mind, I dare, I do assure them, in the Name of God, their
   Labour shall not be in vain in the Lord: For God suffers not his
   Enemies to go unpunish'd, nor his Servants unrewarded.

   And therefore go on with joy and triumph in the Service of so Great and
   so Good a Master, and devote your selves wholly to his Service, and
   employ your Talents faithfully for his Glory. Remember the time is but
   short and Christ himself will receive you into Eternal Glory, saying,
   Well done, good and faithful Servant,

                                    THOUGHTS

  UPON THE

                            Mystery of the Trinity.

   THOUGH there be many in the World that seem to be Religious, there are
   but few that are so: One great Reason whereof is, because there are so
   many Mistakes about Religion, that it is an hard matter to hit upon the
   true Notion of it: And therefore desiring nothing in this World, so
   much as to be an Instrument in God's Hand to direct Men unto true
   Religion, my great Care must, and, by the Blessing of God, shall be to
   instil into them right Conceptions of him, that is the only Object of
   all Religious Acts, without which, it is impossible to continue, or
   indeed to be Religious. The true Nature and Notion of Religion
   consisting in the right Carriage and Deportment of our whole Man, both
   Soul and Body, towards him that made us; whom therefore, unless we
   truly know, we can never be truly Religious; and therefore they that
   begin their Religion with Zeal and Passion, begin at the wrong end; for
   indeed they begin where they shou'd end: Our Zeal for God, and love
   unto him being the highest Acts of Religion, and therefore cannot be
   the first: But they necessarily presuppose the true Knowledge of God,
   without which our Zeal will be blind, and our Love both groundless and
   transient.

   But as it is impossible to be truly Religious, unless we know God, so
   is it very difficult so to know him, as to become truly Religious. It
   is true that there is such a Supreme Being in and over the World, as we
   call God; the the very Light of Nature teaches, and Reason itself
   demonstrates it to be most certain and undeniable. But what he is, and
   what Apprehensions we ought to have of this glorious Being, none but
   himself is able to describe and manifest unto us, so that our
   Conceptions of him are still to be regulated by the Discoveries that he
   hath made of himself to us; without which, though we may have some
   confused Notions of him, yet we can never so know him; as to serve him
   faithfully, and, by consequence, be truly Religious.

   Hence therefore if we would know God, we mus search the Scriptures of
   the Old and New Testament, wherein God hath been pleased most clearly
   to manifest and discover himself unto us: I say, both the Old and New
   Testament; for otherwise, our Knowledge of God may be very Defective
   and Erroneous, there being several things which God, in the New
   Testament, hath most plainly revealed of himself, which in the Old
   Testament are more darkly and obscurely delivered to us. As for
   Example, The great Mystery of the Trinity; though it be frequently
   intimated in the Old Testament, yet it is an hard matter rightly to
   understand it without the New: Insomuch, that the Jews, tho' they have
   had the Law above three Thousand, and the Prophets above two Thousand
   Years amongst them, yet, to this Day, they could never yet make this an
   Article of Faith; but they, as well as the Mahometans, still assert,
   That God is only one in Person as well as Nature: Whereas nothing can
   be more plain from the New Testament, than that there is but One God,
   and yet there are Three Persons, every one of which is that One God:
   And so that though God be but One in Nature, yet he is Three in
   Persons; and so Three Persons, as yet to be but One in Nature.

   And, verily, although there was no other Text in all the Scripture,
   whereon to ground this Fundamental Article of our Christian Faith; that
   of Mat. xxviii. 19. Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing
   them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
   is a sufficient Foundation for it; there being nothing, I think,
   necessary to be believed concerning the glorious Trinity, but what may
   easily and naturally be deduced from these Words, which were spoken, it
   is true, by our Saviour before his Ascension, but I question whether
   they were throughly understood, till after the Holy Ghost was come down
   to Earth. It being only by God himself that we can come to the true
   Knowledge of him, much less are we able rightly to apprehend, and
   firmly to believe Three Persons in the Godhead, without the assistance
   of one of them, that is, of the Holy Ghost; by whom the other two are
   wont to work; he being the Issue, as I may so say, and Breath of both.
   Hence it is, that the Wisdom of the Church, for these many Centuries,
   hath thought fit to Order, That this great Mystery be celebrated the
   next Lord's Day after the Commemoration of the Holy Spirit's coming
   down upon the Disciples, and in them, upon all true Believers; both
   because all Three Persons have now manifested themselves to Mankind;
   the Father in his Creation of them, the Son in his Conversing with
   them, and the Holy Ghost by his coming down upon them: And also to
   shew, that it is only by the Grace and Assistance of God's Spirit, that
   we can rightly believe in this Glorious and Incomprehensible Mystery,
   which our Saviour hath so clearly revealed to us in these Words, Go ye,
   and teach all Nations, &c.

   For the opening of which, we must know that our Saviour in the
   foregoing Verse, acquaints his Disciples, that now all Power was given
   him in Heaven and in Earth; by vertue whereof, he here issueth forth
   his Commission to his Apostles, and, in them, to all that should
   succeed them, to supply his room, and be his Vicegerents upon Earth, he
   being now to reside in his Kingdom of Heaven. For, saith he, All Power
   is given to me in Heaven and Earth; Go ye therefore and teach all
   Nations: As he also saith elsewhere to them, As my Father hath sent me,
   even so send I you, John xx. 21. as if he should have said, My Father
   having committed to me all Power and Authority both in Heaven and
   Earth, 1 therefore authorize and commissionate, yea, and command you to
   go and teach all Nations, &c.

   This therefore is part of the Commission which our Lord and Master left
   with his Apostles immediately before he parted from them. Those being
   the last words which St. Matthew records him to have spoken upon Earth;
   and therefore they must needs contain matter of very great Importance
   to his Church; and it must needs highly concern us all to understand
   the true Meaning and Purport of them. Which that we may the better do,
   in treating of them, I shall observe the same Method and Order as he
   did in speaking them.

   First, Therefore, here is the Work he sends his Apostles about; Go ye
   therefore and teach, ?Poreuthentes oun matheteusate, which more
   properly may be rendred, Go ye therefore and disciple all Nations, or,
   make the Persons of all Nations to be my Disciples, that is,
   Christians. That this is the true meaning of the words, is plain and
   clear, from the right notion of the word here used, matheteuo, which
   coming from mathetes, a Disciple, it always signifieth either to be, or
   to make Disciples, wheresoever it occurs in all the Scriptures, as
   matheteutheis. Mat. xiii. 52. which is Instructed, say we, the Syriakc
   better, [image of script] that is, made a Disciple, a tlmyd that is,
   not only a Scholar or Learner, but a Follower or Professor of the
   Gospel, here called the Kingdom of Heaven. Ana then place where this
   Word occurrs is, Matt. xxvii. 57. ematheteuthe to Iesou, where we
   rightly translate it, was Jesus Disciple. Another place is, Acts xiv.
   21. kai matheteusantes hikanous, which we improperly render, having
   taught many, the Syriack and Arabick, more properly, having made many
   Disciples. And these are all the places in the New Testament where this
   Word is used, except those I am now considering, where all the Eastern
   Languages render it according to its notation, Disciple. The Persian
   paraphrastically expounds it, Go ye and reduce all Nations to my Faith
   and Religion. So that whosoever pleads for any other Meaning of these
   words, do but betray their own Ignorance in the Original Languages,
   and, by consequence, in the true Interpretation of Scripture.

   I should not have insisted so long upon this, but that the false
   Exposition of thee words hath occasioned that no less dangerous than
   numerous Sect of Anabaptists in the World; for the old Latin
   translation having it, Euntes ergo docete omnes Gentes; hence the
   German, where Anabaptism first began; and all the modern Translations
   render it as we do, Go ye therefore and teach Nations, baptizing them.
   From whence it was supposed by some that were not able to dive into the
   true Meaning of the Words, that our Saviour here commanded, that none
   should be baptized, but such as were first taught the Principles of the
   Christian Religion, which is the greatest Mistake imaginable; for our
   Saviour doth not speak one word of Teaching before Baptism, but only
   after, ver. 20. didaskontes. his Meaning being only that bin Apostles
   should go about the World, and perswade all Nations to forsake their
   former Idolatries and Superstitions, and to turn Christians, or the
   Disciples of Jesus Christ; and such as were so should be baptized. And
   therefore Infant-Baptism is so far from being forbidden, that it is
   expresly commanded in these words; for all Disciples are here commanded
   to be baptized; nay, they are therefore commanded to be baptized,
   because Disciples. And seeing all Disciples are to be baptized, so are
   Infants too, the Children of Believing Parents, for they are Disciples
   as well as any other, or as well as their Parents themselves: For all
   that are in Covenant with God must needs be Disciples: But that
   Children were always esteemed in Covenant with God, is plain in that
   God himself commanded the Covenant should be sealed to them, as it was
   all along by Circumcision. But that Children are Disciples as well as
   others, our Saviour puts it out of all doubt, saying of Children, of
   such is the kingdom of God, Mark x. 14. And therefore they must needs
   be Disciples, unless such as are not Disciples can belong to the
   Kingdom of God, which a Man must be strangely distemper'd in his Brain
   before he can so much as fancy.

   And besides, that Children, so long as Children, are looked upon as
   part of their Parents; and therefore as their Parents are, so are they:
   If the Parents be Heathen, so are the Children; if the Parents be Jews,
   so are the Children; if the Parents be Christian, so are the Children
   too; nay, if either of the Parents be a Christian or Disciple, the
   Children of both are denominated from the better part, and so looked
   upon as Christians too, as is plain, 1 Cor. vii. 14. But now are they
   holy, that is, in a Federal or Covenant-sense they are in Covenant with
   God; they are Believers, Christians, or Disciples, because one of their
   Parents is so.

   Now teeing Children are Disciples as well as others, and our Saviour
   here commands all Disciples to be baptized, it necessarily follows,
   that Children must be baptized too. So that the Opinion which asserts,
   That Children ought not to be baptized, is grounded upon a meer
   Mistake, and upon gross Ignorance of the true meaning of the Scripture,
   and especially of this place, which is most ridiculously mistaken for a
   Prohibition, it being rather a Command for Infant Baptism.

   But I must crave the Reader's Excuse for this Disgression from the
   Matter principally intended, tho' I could not tell how to avoid it;
   nothing being more needful than to rescue the words if our blessed
   Saviour from those false Glosses, and horrible Abuses which these last
   Ages have put upon them, especially it coming so directly in my way as
   this did.

   Secondly,, Here is the extent of their Commission, which is very large
   indeed, not being directed to some few particular Persons, but to
   Nations; nor to some particular Nations only, but to all Nations, Go ye
   therefore and disciple all Nations; or, all the World, as it is, Mark
   xvi. 15. This was that which the Prophet Isaiah, or rather God by him,
   foretells, Isaiah xlix. 6. which our Saviour himself items to have
   respect unto, Luke xxiv. 46, 47. The meaning whereof, in brief, is
   this, That though the Jews hitherto had been the only People of God,
   and none but they admitted into Covenant with him, now the Gentiles
   also are to be brought in, and made Confederates or Copartners with
   them in the Covenant of Grace; that the Partition-Wall being now broke
   down, the Gospel is to be preached to all other Nations, as well as the
   Jewish; Christ being now come to be a light to lighten the Gentiles, as
   well as the glory of his People Israel.

   But though the words of the Commission be so clear to this purport, yet
   the Apostles themselves understood it not, till God had interpreted it
   from Heaven to St. Peter, shewing him in a Vision, that he should call
   no Man common or unclean, Acts x. 28. From which time forward, he, with
   the rest of the Apostles, observed their Commission exactly in
   preaching to the Gentiles as well as the Jews. And this was one End
   wherefore the Holy Ghost came down amongst them, even to enable them to
   do what their Master had commanded them. For he had here commanded them
   to preach unto all Nations, but that they could not do, unless they
   could speak all Languages, which therefore the Holy Ghost enabled them
   do, Acts ii. 4, 5. which also is clear demonstration of the the true
   Meaning and Purport of these words: For there was no necessity that the
   Spirit should teach the Apostles all Languages, but that the Son had
   first enjoined them to preach unto all Nations.

   Thirdly, Hence is the manner whereby they are to admit all Nations into
   the Church of Christ, or into the Christian Religion, by baptizing them
   in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and og the Holy Ghost. For
   the opening whereof, we must know that Baptism was a Rite in common use
   amongst the Jews before our Saviour's Time, by which they were wont to
   admit Proselytes into their Religion, baptizing them in the Name of the
   Father, or of God. A little before our Saviour's appearance in the
   World, John Baptist being sent toprepare the way for him, baptized the
   Jews themselves; As many as came unto him in the Name of the Messiah to
   come, which was called, the Baptism of Repentance. I indeed Baptize
   you, says he, with Water, to Repentance; but he that comes after me, is
   mightier than I, Mat. iii. 11. But when our Saviour was to go to
   Heaven, he left Orders with his Apostles to make Disciples; or, admit
   all Nations into the Religion which he had preached, confirmed with
   Miracles, and sealed with his own Blood, by baptizing them in the Name
   of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which Form of Baptism,
   questionless, his Apostles faithfully observed all along, as may be
   gathered also from Acts xix. 2, 3. where we may observe, how when they
   said, they had not so much as heard of an Holy Ghost; he wondring at
   that, asked them, Unto what then were ye baptized? plainly intimating,
   that if they had been baptized aright, according to Christ's
   Institution, they could not but have heard of the Holy Ghost, because
   they had been baptized in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and
   of the Holy Ghost; but v. 5. as also Acts ii. 38, c. viii. 16. we read
   of Baptism administred in the Name of the Lord Jesus. From whence some
   have thought, that the Apostles baptized only the Gentiles, in the Name
   of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Ghost but the Jews in the
   Name of the Lord Jesus only; because they believing in the Father
   already, if they were but baptized in the Name of Jesus, and so
   testifyed their Belief, that he was the Messiah, they could not but
   believe in his Spirit too; but this Expression of baptizing in the Name
   of the Lord Jesus, seems to me rather to intimate that Form of Baptism
   which the Lord Jesus instituted: for doubtless, the Apostle observed
   the Precepts of our Lord better than so, as to do it one Way, when he
   had commanded it to be done another; and baptized only in the Name of
   Jesus, when he had enjoined them to baptize in the Name of the Father,
   and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

   Neither did the Church ever esteem that Baptism valid, which was not
   administred exactly according to the Institution, in the Name of all
   the Three Persons; which the Primitive Christians were so strict in the
   observance of, that it was injoyned, that all Persons to be baptized
   should be plunged three times into the Water, first at the name of the
   Father, and then at the name of the Son, and lastly, at the name of the
   holy Ghost; so that every Person might be distinctly nominated, and so
   our Saviour's Institution exactly observed, in the Administration of
   this Sacrament.

   Hence also it was, That all Persons to be baptized; were always
   required, either with their own Mouths, if adult, or if Infants, by
   their Sureties, to make a publick Confession of their Faith in the
   Three Persons, into whose Names they were to be baptized: For this
   indeed was always looked upon as the Sum and Substance of the Christian
   Religion, to believe in God the Father, in god the Son, and in god the
   Holy Ghost, and they who believed in these Three Persons, were still
   reputed Christians; and they who did not, were esteemed Infidels or
   Hereticks.

   Yea, and our Saviour himself hath sufficiently declared how necessary
   it is for us to believe this great Mystery; as also how essential it is
   to be Christian, seeing that he requires no more in order to our
   Initiation into his Church, but only that we be baptized in the Name of
   the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. In which Words we may observe,

   First, A Trinity of Persons, into whose Names we are baptized, the
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost: This is that Mystery of Mysteries which is
   too high for Humane Understandings to conceive, but not too great for a
   divine Faith to believe, even that although there be but One God, there
   are Three Persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, every one
   of which is that One and the self-same God; and therefore it is, that
   Baptism is here commanded to be administred in the Name of all three.

   Now to confirm our Faith in this great Mystery, whereinto we were all
   baptized, I shall endeavour to shew; in few terms, what Grounds we have
   in Scripture to believe it. For which end we must know, that though
   this Mystery hath received great Light, by the rising of the Son of
   Righteousness upon the World, yet it did not lie altogether
   undiscovered before, yea, from the very Foundation of the World, the
   Church, in all Ages, hath had sufficient ground whereupon to build
   their faith on this great and Fundamental Truth: For in the very
   Creation of the World, he that created it is called, 'lch in the plural
   Number: And in the Creation of Man, he said, Let us make Man in our own
   Image; from whence, though not a Trinity, yet a Plurality of Persons is
   plainly manifest; yea, in the Beginning of the World too, we find both
   Father, Son and Spirit concurring in the making of it.

   For, First, It is said, that God Created Heaven and Earth, and then,
   that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters, Gen. i. 2.
   There are Two Persons, God, and the Spirit of God. And then we read how
   God made the World by his Word: he said let there be light, and there
   was light. From which Expression, St. John himself concludes, That all
   Things were made by the Son of God, or his Word, Joh. i. 3. and so does
   St. Paul, Col. i. 16.

   Thus we read afterwards, The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his
   Word by my Tongue, 2 Samuel xxiii. 2. where we have Jehovah, the Spirit
   of Jehovah, and the Word of Jehovah, plainly and distinctly set down.
   As also in Psal. xxxiii. 6. and Isai. xlii. 1. where there is the Lord
   speaking of his Son, and saying, That he will put his Spirit upon him:
   And this also seems to be the Reason, why the Holy Angels, when they
   praise God,. say, Holy, holy, holy Lord of Host, Isaiah vi. 3.
   Revelations iv. 8. saying, Holy thrice, in reference to the Three
   Persons they Adore.

   Thus we might discover this Truth in the Old Testament, but in the New
   we can scarce look over it: For when Jesus was baptized, Matth. iii.
   16. had we, who know nothing but by our Senses, been present at this
   time with Jesus at Jordan, our very Senses would have conveyed this
   Truth to our Understandings, whether we would or no. Here we should
   have heard a Voice from Heaven; whose was it, but God the Father? Here
   we should have seen one coming out of Jordan; who was that but God the
   Son? Here we should have seen something else too, in the Form of a
   Dove, who was that but God the Spirit? Thus was God the Father heard
   speaking; God the Son was seen ascending out of the Water; and God the
   Holy Ghost descending from Heaven upon him. The first was heard in the
   sound of a Voice, the second was seen in the form of a Man, and the
   third was beheld in the Shape of a Dove.

   Voce Pater, natus Corpore, flamen Ave.

   But there are many such Places as this all the New Testament over,
   where the Three Persons of the Godhead are distinctly mentioned, as
   Luke i. 35. John xiv. 16, 26. Chapter xvi. 7. Galatians iv. 6. But the
   Words of Saint Paul are very remarkable too, 1 Corinthians xiii. 14.
   And yet that all these Three Persons were but One God, Gen. xviii. 2,
   3. John x. 30. Saint John expressly asserts, saying, There are Three
   that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, and the Word, and the Spirit,
   and these Three are One, 1 John v. 7. Which certainly are as plain, and
   perspicuous Terms as its possible to espress so great a Mystery in. But
   I need not have gone so far to have proved, That there are Three
   distinct Persons in the Godhead: The Words I am treating of, being a
   sufficient Demonstration of it: For as all the Three Persons met
   together at our Saviour's Baptism; to doth our Saviour here command,
   That all his Disciples be baptized in the Name of all Three: And
   therefore I cannot but admire how any one should dare to profess
   himself to be a Christian, and yet deny, or oppose the Sacred Trinity,
   into which he was baptized when he was made a Christian; For, by this
   means, he renouncing his Baptism, blasphemes Christ, unchristians
   himself, blotting his own Name out of the Catalogue of those who were
   made Christians, only by being baptized, in the Name of the Father, and
   of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

   II. Here is the Godhead of the Trinity, or of every Person in the
   Trinity, that one as well as the other is God: For here we see Divine
   Worship is to be performed to them all; and all that profess the true
   Religion must be baptized in the Name of the Son and Holy Ghost, as
   well as of the Father which certainly would be the greatest Absurdity,
   yea, the most horrid Impiety imaginable, was not they God as well as
   he. For if they be not God, they are Creatures; if they be Creatures,
   Reason as well as Scripture forbids the same Honour and Worship to be
   conferred on them, which is given to God himself, and only due to him;
   which here, notwithstanding, we see is given to them, and that by our
   Lord himself, commanding Baptism to be administred in his own Name, and
   in the Name of the Holy Ghost, as well as in the Name of the Father;
   and so making himself and the Spirit equal Sharers in the same Honour
   that is given to the Father. So that was there no other place in the
   whole Scripture to prove it, this alone would be fufficient to convince
   any Gainsayer, that the Son and Spirit are God as well as the Father,
   or rather the same God with him. But that I may unvail this Mystery,
   and confirm this Truth more clearly; we will consider each Person
   distinctly, and shew, that one as well as the other is really and truly
   God.

   That the Father is God, none ever deny'd it, and therefore we need not
   prove it. But if the Father be God, the Son must needs be God too; for
   the same Names, Properties, Works, and Worship, which, in Scripture,
   are ascribed to the Father, are frequently ascribed to the Son also in
   Scripture: The Father is called Jehovah in Scripture, so is the Son,
   Hos. i. 7. Jerem. xxiii. 6. The Father is called God, so is the Son,
   John i. 1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
   and the Word was God: with God, as to his Person; God as to his Nature.
   So also John xx. 28. Acts xx. 28, &c, Moreover, Is the Father Alpha and
   Omega, the first and the last? So is the Son, Rev. i. 8. Is the Father
   Eternal so is the Son, Isaiah ix. 6. Revel. i. 8, Is the Father
   Almighty? so is the Son, Heb. i. 3. Is the Father everywhere? so is the
   Son, Matt. xviii. 20. Doth the Father know all things? so doth the Son,
   John xxi. 17. Chap. ii. 24. Did the Father make all things? so did the
   Son, John i. 3. Doth the Father preserve all things? so doth the Son,
   hebr. i. 3. Doth the Father forgive Sins? so doth the Son, Matthew ix.
   6. Is the Father to be worshipped? so is the Son, Hebrews i. 6. Is the
   Father to be honoured? so is the Son, John v. 23. No wonder therefore
   that Christ being thus in the Form of God, thought it no robbery to be
   equal with God, Philippians ii. 6. He did not rob God of any Glory by
   saying himself was equal to him. The greatest Wonder is, How any one
   can believe the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and yet deny this
   great Truth, than which nothing can be more plain from Scripture:
   Nothing being more frequently and more clearly asserted than this is.
   And, verily, it is well for us that it is so; for if Christ was not
   God, neither could he be our Saviour. None being able to free us from
   our Sins; but only he against whom they were committed. And therefore I
   cannot imagine how any one can doubt of Christ's Divinity, and yet
   expect Pardon and Salvation from him: All Our Hopes and Expectations
   from him depending only upon his assumption of our Humane Nature into a
   Divine Person.

   And that the Holy Ghost also is God, is frequently asserted in the Holy
   Scriptures, which himself lndited. Indeed his very Inditing of the
   Scriptures, was a clear Argument of his Deity, as well as the
   Scriptures indited by him. What Man, what Angel, what Creature, who but
   God could compose such Articles of Faith, enjoin such Divine Precepts,
   fortel and fulfil such Prophesies as in Scripture are contained, who
   spake unto, or by the Prophets? Whom did they mean, when they said,
   Thus saith the Lord of Hosts? Who was this Lord of Hosts that
   instructed them what to speak or write? Was it God the Father, or God
   the Son? No, but it Was God the Holy Ghost; For the Prophecy came not
   in old time by the will of Man, but Holy Men of God spake as they were
   moved by the Holy Ghost, 2 Peter i. 21. Acts xxviii. 25; 21:11. Chapt.
   xxi. 11. The Holy Ghost therefore being the Lord of Hosts, he must
   needs be God, there being no Person that is or can be called the Lord
   of Hosts, but He that is the very and eternal God.

   This also may be gathered from 1 Corinth. iii. 16. Know ye not that ye
   are the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwelleth in you; for none
   can be the Temple of God, but he in whom God dwells; for it is God's
   dwelling in a place, that makes that place the Temple of God; and yet
   we are here said to be the Temple of God, because the Spirit dwelleth
   in us. And so elsewhere, Know ye not, saith the Apostle, that your Body
   is the Temple of the Holy Ghost that is in you? 1 Cor. vi. 19. which
   could not be unless the Holy Ghost was God.

   Another express Scripture we have for it in Acts v. 3, 4. where St.
   Peter, propounds this Question to Ananias, Why hath Satan filled thine
   heart to lye to the Holy Ghost? And then tells him in the next Verse,
   Thou hast not lyed to men but to God: And so expresly asserts the Holy
   Ghost to be God.

   Moreover, That the Holy Ghost is truly God, coequal to the Father and
   Son, is plain, in that the Scriptures assert him to be, to have, and to
   do whatsoever the Father or Son is, hath, or doth, as God. For, Is the
   Father and Son eternal? so is the Spirit. Hebrews ix. 14. Is God the
   Father and the Son everywhere? so is the Spirit, Psalm cxxxix. 7. Is
   God the Father, and the Son, a wise, understanding, powerful, and
   knowing God? so is the Spirit, Isaiah xi. 2. Are we baptized in the
   Name of the Father, and the Son so are we baptized in the Name of the
   Holy Ghost. May we Sin against the Father and the Son? so may we Sin
   too against the Holy Ghost. Nay, the Sin against this Person only is
   accounted by our Saviour to be a Sin never to be pardoned, Matthew xii.
   31, 32. We may Sin against God the Father, and our Sin may be pardoned:
   We may Sin against God the Son, and our Sin may be pardoned: But if we
   Sin or Speak against the Holy Ghost, that shall never be forgiven,
   neither in this world, nor yet in that which is to come. But if the
   Holy Ghost be not God, how can we Sin against him? or how comes our Sin
   against him only to be unpardonable, unless he be God? I know it is not
   therefore unpardonable because he is God, for then the Sins against the
   Father and the Son would be unpardonable too, seeing they both are God
   as well as he: Yet though this Sin is not therefore unpardonable,
   because he is God, yet it could not be unpardonable unless he was God.
   For, supposing him not to be God, but a Creature, and yet the Sin
   against him to be unpardonable, then the Sin against a Creature would
   be unpardonable, when Sins against God himself are pardoned: Which, to
   say, would, itself, I think, come near to the Sin against the Holy
   Ghost. But seeing our Saviour describes this unpardonable Sin, by
   blaspheming or speaking against the Holy Ghost, let them have a care
   that they be not found guilty of it, who dare deny the Holy Ghost to be
   really and truly God, and so blaspheme and speak the worst that they
   can against him.

   III. We have seen what Ground we have to believe, that there are Three
   Persons in the Godhead, and that every one of these Persons is God, we
   are now to consider the Order of those Persons in the Trinity,
   described in the Words before us,

   First, The Father, and then the Son, and then the Holy Ghost; every one
   of which is really and truly God; and yet they are All but One real and
   true God. A Mystery which we are all bound to believe, but yet must
   have a great Care how we speak of it; it being both easy and dangerous
   to mistake in expressing so mysterious a Truth as this is. If we think
   of ii, How hard is it to contemplate upon one numerically Divine
   Nature, in more than one and the same Divine Person? or, upon Three
   Divine Persons in no more than One and the same Divine Nature? If we
   speak of it, How hard is it to find out fit Words to express it? If I
   say, The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost be Three, and every One distinctly
   God, it is true: But if I say, They be Three, and every one a distinct
   God, it is false. I may say, The Divine Persons are distinct in the
   Divine Nature: But I cannot say, That the Divine Nature is divided into
   the Divine Persons. I may say, God the Father is One God, and the Son
   is one God, and the Holy Ghost is One God: But I cannot say, That the
   Father is One God, and the Son Another God, and the Holy Ghost a Third
   God. I may say, The Father begat another who is God; yet I cannot say,
   That he begat another God. And from the Father and the Son proceeded
   another who is God; yet I cannot say, from the Father and the Son
   proceedeth another God. For, all this while, though their Nature be the
   same, their Persons are distinct; and though their Persons be distinct,
   still their Nature is the same. So that though the Father be the First
   Person in the Godhead, the Son the Second, and the Holy Ghost the
   Third; yet the Father is not the First, the Son a Second, and the Holy
   Ghost a Third God. So hard a thing is it to word so great a Mystery
   aright; or to fit so high a Truth with Expressions suitable and proper
   to it, without going one way or another from it. And therefore I shall
   not use many words about it, lest some should slip from me unbecoming
   of it: But, in as few Terms as I can, I will endeavour to shew, upon
   what account the Father is the First, the Son the Second, and the Holy
   Ghost the Third Person in the Trinity.

   First, therefore, The Father is placed. first, and really is the First
   Person, not as if he was before the other Two, for they are all
   Coeternal; but because the other Two received their Essence from him:
   For, the Son was begotten of the Father, and the Holy Ghost proceedeth
   both from Father and Son: And therefore the Father is termed by the
   Primitive Christians, riza kai pege Theotetos, the Root and the
   Fountain of Deity. As in Waters there is the Fountain or Well Head;
   then there is the Spring that boils up out of that Fountain; and then
   there is the Stream that draws both from the Fountain and the Spring;
   and yet all these are but one and the same Water: So here, God the
   Father is the Fountain of Deity; the Son, as the Spring that boils up
   out of that Fountain; and the Holy Ghost, that flows from both, and yet
   all Three is but one and the same God. The same also may be explained
   by another familiar Instance: The Sun, you know, begets Beams, and from
   the Sun and Beams together, proceed both Light and Heat: So God the
   Father begets the Son, and from the Father and Son together, proceeds
   the Spirit of Knowledge and Grace: But as the Son is not before the
   Beams, nor the Beams before the Light and Heat, but all are together:
   So neither is the Father before the Son, nor Father or Son before the
   Holy Ghost, but only in order and relation to one another: In which
   only respect, the Father is the first Person in the Trinity.

   Secondly, The Son is the second Person, who is called the Son, yea, and
   the only begotten Son of God, because he was begotten of the Father,
   not as others are by Spiritual Regeneration, but by Eternal Generation,
   as none but himself is: For the opening whereof, we must know, that God
   that made all things fruitful, is not himself Steril or Barren, but he
   that hath given Power to Animals, to generate and produce others in
   their own Nature, is himself much more able to produce one, not only
   like himself, but of the self-same Nature with himself, as he did in
   begetting his Son by communicating his own unbegotten Essence and
   Nature to him. For the Person of the Son was most certainly begotten of
   the Father, otherwise he would not be his Son; but his Essence was
   unbegotten, otherwise he would not be God. And therefore the highest
   Apprehensions that we can frame of this great Mystery, the Eternal
   Generation of the Son of God, is only by conceiving the Person of the
   Father to have communicated his Divine Essence to the Person of the
   Son. And so of himself begetting his other Self the Son, by
   communicating his own Eternal and unbegotten Essence to him. I say, by
   communicating of his Essence, not of his Person to him, for then they
   would be both the same Person, as now they are of the same Essence: The
   Essence of the Father did not beget the Son by communicating his Person
   to him, but the Person of the Father begat the Son by communicating his
   Essence to him; so that the Person of the Son is begotten, not
   communicated; but the Essence of the Son is communicated not begotten.

   This Notion of the Father's begetting the Son by communicating his
   Essence to him, I ground upon the Son's own Words, who certainly best
   knew how himself was begotten; for, as the Father, saith he, hath life
   in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself, John
   v. 26. To have Life in himself, is an Essential Property of the Divine
   Nature, and therefore wheresoever that is given, or communicated, the
   Nature itself, must needs be given, and communicated too.

   Now here we see how God the Father Communicated this his Essential
   Property, and so his Essence to the Son; and, by consequence, though he
   be a distinct Person from him, yet he hath the same unbegotten Essence
   with him: And, therefore, as the Father hath Life in himself, so hath
   the Son Life in himself; and so all other essential Properties of the
   Divine Nature, only with this Personal Distinction, that the Father
   hath this Life in himself, not from the Son, but from himself; whereas
   the Son hath it, not from himself but from the Father: Or, the Father
   is God, of himself, not of the Son; the Son is the same God, but from
   the Father, not from himself; and, therefore, not the Father, but the
   Son is rightly called by the Council of Nice, God of God, Light of
   Light, yea, very God of very God.

   Thirdly, Having thus spoken of the two first Persons in the Sacred
   Trinity, we now come to the last, the Holy Ghost. The last, I say, not
   in Nature or Time, but only in Order: For, as to their Nature, one is
   not better or more God than another; neither, as to Time; is one before
   another; none of them being measured by Time, but all and every one of
   them Eternity itself. But though not in Nature or Time, yet in Order,
   one must needs be before another; For the Father is of himself,
   receiving his Essence neither from the Son, nor from the Spirit, and
   therefore is, in Order, before both; the Son received his Essence from
   the Father, not from the Spirit, and therefore, in Order, is before the
   Spirit, as well as after the Father; but the Spirit receiving his
   Essence both from the Father and the Son, must needs, in Order, be
   after both.

   I confess, the Spirit is no where in Scripture said to proceed from the
   Son, and therefore the incerting this into the Nicene Creed, was the
   occasion of that Schism betwixt the Western and Eastern Churches, which
   hath now continued for many Ages; in which, I think, both Parties are
   blameworthy; the Western Churches for incerting this Clause following
   into the Nicene Creed, without the Consent of a General Council and the
   Eastern for denying so plain a Truth as this is: For though the Spirit
   be not said to proceed from the Son, yet he is called the Spirit of the
   Son, Galatians iv. 6. Rom. viii. 9. which, questionless, he would never
   have been, did not he proceed from the Son, as well as from the Father.
   And, verily, the Father communicating his own individual Essence, and
   so whatsoever he is (his Paternal Relation excepted) to the Son, could
   not but communicate this to him also, even to have the Spirit
   proceeding from him, as it doth from himself. So that as whatsoever the
   Father hath Originally in himself, that hath the Son by Communication
   from the Father: So hath the Son this, the Spirit's proceeding from him
   by communication from the Father, as the Father hath it in himself: And
   the Spirit thus proceeding both from the Father and the Son, hence it
   is that he is placed after both, not only in, the Words before us, but
   also in 1 John v. 7. and so elsewhere.

   From what I have hitherto discoursed concerning this great Mystery, the
   Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, I shall gather some few
   Inferences, and so conclude.

   1. Is the Son God, yea, the same God with the Father? Hence I observe
   what a strange Mystery the Work of Man's Redemption is, that God
   himself should become Man. And he that was begotten of his Father,
   without a Mother, from Eternity, should be Born of his Mother, without
   a Father, in Time; that he who was perfect God, like unto the Father,
   in every thing, his Personal Properties only excepted, should also be
   perfect Man, like unto us in all things, our personal Infirmities only
   excepted; that he that made the World, should be himself made in it;
   that Eternity should stoop to Time, Glory be wrapt in Misery, and the
   Son of Righteousness hid under a Clod of Earth; that Innocence should
   be betrayed, Justice condemned, and Life itself should die, and all to
   redeem Man from Death to Life. Oh Wonder of Wonders! how justly may we
   say with the Apostle, without Controversy, great is the Mystery of
   Godliness, 1 Tim. iii. 16.

   2. Is the Spirit also GOD? Hence I observe, That it is God alone that
   can make us Holy; for seeing the Scripture all along ascribes our
   Sanctification unto the Spirit of God, and yet the Spirit of God is
   himself really and truly God, it necessarily followeth, that the
   special Concurrence and Influence of Almighty God himself is necessary
   to the making us really and truly Holy.

   3. Are all Three Persons in the Trinity one and the same God? Hence I
   inferr, They are to have one and the same Honour conferred upon them,
   and one and the same Worship performed unto them. Or, as our Saviour
   himself saith, That all Men should honour the Son, even as they honour
   the Father, John v. 23. And ye believe in God, believe also in me, John
   xiv. 1. And as we pray to the Father, so should we pray to the Son too,
   as the Apostles did, Luke xvii. 5. and St. Stephen, Acts vii. 59. and
   St. Paul to all Three, 2 Cor. xiii. 14.

   4. Is Baptism to be Administred in the Name of the Father, and of the
   Son, and of the Holy Ghost? Hence I observe, how necessary it is to
   believe in these Three Persons, in order to our being real and true
   Christians: For we being made Christians in the Name of all Three, that
   Man ceaseth to be a Christian that believes only in One: For Faith in
   God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, is necessary to
   the very Constitution of a Christian; and is the Principal, if not the
   only Characteristical Note whereby to distinguish a Christian from
   another Man; yea, from a Turk: For this is the chief thing that the
   Turk both in their Alcoran, and other Writings, upbraid Christians for,
   even because they believe a Trinity of Persons in the Divine Nature.
   For which Cause they frequently say they are People that believe God
   hath Companions; so that take away this Article of our Christian Faith,
   and what depends upon it, and there would be but a little difference
   betwixt a Christian and a Turk: But by this means, Turks would not turn
   Christians, but Christians Turks, if this Fundamental Article of the
   Christian Religion was once removed: For he that doth not believe this,
   is no Christian upon that very account, because he doth not believe
   this by which a Christian is made: And whatsoever else Errors a Man may
   hold, yet if he believes in God the Father, God the Son, and God. the
   Holy Ghost, I cannot, I dare not but acknowledge him to be a Christian
   in general, because he holds fast to the Foundation of the Christian
   Religion, though perhaps he may build upon it Hay and Stubble; and so
   his Superstructure be infirm and rotten.

   I shall conclude with a Word of Advice to all such as call themselves
   by the Name of Christ: I suppose and believe they are all Christians,
   from their taking that Name; and therefore I need not use any Arguments
   to perswade them to turn Christians, for so they are already by
   Profession; But, seeing that they are Christians, let me desire them to
   consider bow they tame to be so? even by being baptized in the Name of
   the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. And if they desire
   to be Christians still, I must advise them to continue stedfast in that
   Faith whereby they were made so. Of all the Errors and Heresies which
   Satan hath sowed amongst us, let us have an especial care to avoid such
   as strike at the very Foundation of our Religion; I mean the Arrians,
   Macedonians, Socinians, and all, manner of Antitrinitarians, such as
   deny the most Sacred Trinity.

   But I hope we have better learned Christ, than to hearken to such
   Opinions as these are; and therefore my next Advice in brief is only
   this, That as we excel others in the Truth of our Profession, so we
   would excel them also in the Holiness of our Life and Conversation: Let
   us manifest our selves so be Christians indeed, by believing the
   Assertions, trusting on the Promises, fearing the Threatnings, and
   obeying the Precepts of Christ our Master, that both Infidels and
   Hereticks may be convinced of their Errors, by seeing us outstripping
   them in our Piety towards God, Equity to our Neighbours, Charity to the
   Poor, Unity amongst ourselves, and Love to all: For this would be a
   clear Demonstration, that our Faith is better than theirs is, when our
   Lives are holier than theirs are; and for our Encouragement thereunto,
   I dare engage, That if we believe thus, as Christ hath taught us, and
   live as he hath commanded us, we shall also obtain what he hath
   promised, even Eternal Happiness in the World to come; where we shall
   see, enjoy, and praise that God, into whose Name we are baptized, even
   Father, Son, and Holy Ghost for evermore. There, with Angels and
   Arch-Angels, with the Heavens and all the Powers therein; with Cherubin
   and Seraphin, and all the blessed Inhabitants of those everlasting
   Mansions; with the glorious Company of the Apostles, the goodly
   Fellowship of the Prophets; the noble Army of Martyrs; all the Company
   of Heaven, and the Holy Church throughout all the World, we shall
   Eternally laud and magnify thy Sacred Name: "O God, the Father of
   Heaven; O God, the Son, Redeemer of the World; O God the Holy Ghost,
   proceding from the Father and the Son; O Holy, Blessed, and Glorious
   Trinity, Three Persons and One God, evermore praising thee, the Father
   of an Infinite Majesty; together with thine Honourable, True and Only
   Son; thee the King of Glory, O Christ; and thee, O Holy Ghost, the
   Comforter; still joyning with the heavenly Choire, and saying, "Holy,
   holy, Lord God of Hosts, Heaven and Earth are full of thy Glory; Glory
   be to thee, O Lord, most high. We praise thee, we bless thee, we
   worship thee, we glorify thee, we give Thanks to thee for thy great
   Glory, O Lord God, Heavenly King, God the Father Almighty. O Lord, the
   only begotten Son, Jesu Christ; O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the
   Father, that takest away the Sins of the World, and sittest at the
   Right-hand of God the Father, O Blessed, Glorious, and Eternal Spirit;
   for thou only art Holy, thou only art the Lord; thou only, O Christ,
   with the Holy Ghost, art most high in the Glory of God the Father; for
   thine, O Lord, is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, for ever
   and ever. Amen.

   Almighty and everlasting God, who hast given unto us thy Servants,
   Grace by the confession of a true Faith to acknowledge the glory of the
   Eternal Trinity, and in the Power of the Divine Majesty to worship the
   Unity; we beseech thee, that thou wouldest keep us stedfast in this
   Faith, and evermore defend us from all Adversities, who livest and
   reignest one God, World without End. Amen.

   And now having led the Christian through this first Stage of his
   Course, and instructed him in the Principles of his Religion, and in
   the great Mystery of the Trinity, into which he was baptized, it may be
   fit to bring him into the World, and shew him how he ought to demean
   himself in regard to the Things of it.

                         Thoughts upon Worldly Riches.

                                    Sect. I.

   HE that seriously considers the Constitution of the Christian Religion,
   observing the Excellency of its Doctrines, the Clearness of its
   Precepts, the Severity of its Threatnings, together with the
   Faithfulness of its Promises, and the Certainty of its Principles to
   trust to; such a one may justly be astonished, and admire what should
   be the reason that they who profess this not only the most excellent,
   but only true Religion in the World, should notwithstanding be
   generally as wicked, debauched and prophane, as they that never heard
   of it. For that they are so, is but too plain and obvious to every one
   that observes their Actions, and compares them with the Practices of
   Jews, Turks, and Infidels. For what Sin have they amongst them which we
   have not as rise amongst our selves? Are they intemperate and
   luxurious? Are they envious and malicious against one another? Are they
   uncharitable and censorious? Are they given to Extortion, Rapine, and
   Oppression? So are most of those who are called Christians. Do they
   they blaspheme the Name of God, profane his Sabbaths, contemn his Word,
   despise his Ordinances, and trample upon the Blood of his only Son? How
   many have we amongst ourselves that do these things as much as they?

   But how comes this about, that they who are baptized into the Name of
   Christ, and profess the Religion which he established in the World,
   should be no better than other People, and in some respects far worse?
   Is it because though they profess the Gospel yet they do not understand
   it? Nor know what Sins are forbidden, nor what Duties are enjoyned in
   it? That none can plead, especially amongst us who have the Gospel so
   clearly revealed, so fully interpreted, so constantly preach'd to us as
   we have. Insomuch that if there be any one Person amongst us, that
   understands not what is necessary to be known, in order to our
   everlasting Happiness, it is because we will not: wilfully shutting our
   Eyes against the Light.

   BUT what then shall we impute this wonder to, that Christians are
   generally as bad as Heathens?Does Chrift in his Gospel dispence with
   their Impieties, and give them Indulgences for their Sins, and License
   to break the moral Law? It is true, his pretended Vicar at Rome doth
   so, but far be it from us to father our Sins upon him, who came into
   the World on purpose to save us from them. Indeed if we repent and turn
   from Sin, he hath both purchased and promised Pardon and Forgiveness to
   us, but not till then: But hath expresly told us the contrary, assuring
   us that except we repent we must all perish, Luc. xiii. 3. I confess
   there have been such blasphemous Hereticks amongst us, called
   Antinomians, who are altogether for Faith without good Works, making as
   if Christ by erecting his Gospel destroy'd the moral Law; but none can
   entertain such an horrible Opinion as that is, whose sinful Practices
   have not so far depraved their Principles, that they believe it is so
   only because they would have it to be so, directly contrary to our
   Saviour's own Words, Matth. v. 17. Think not that I am come to destroy
   the Law or the Prophets: I am not come not to destroy, but to fulfil.
   But I hope there is none of us but have better learned Christ than to
   think that he came to patronize our Sins, who was sent to bless us, by
   turning away every one of us from our Iniquities, Act. iii. 26. But how
   come Christians then to be as bad and sinful as other Men? Is it
   because they are as destitute as other Men of all Means whereby to
   become better? No, this cannot possibly be the reason: For nothing can
   be more certain, than that we all have, or at least may, if we will,
   have whatsoever can any ways conduce to the making us either holy here
   or happy hereafter. We have the way that leads thereto revealed to us
   in the Word of God, we have that Word frequently expounded and applyed
   to us; we have all free Access not only to the Ordinances which God
   hath appointed for our Conversion, but even to the very Sacraments
   themselves, whereby our Faith may be confirmed, and our Souls nourished
   to eternal Life. And more than all this too, we have many gracious and
   faithful Promises, that if we do but what we can, God for Christ's sake
   will afford us such Assistances of his Grace and Spirit, whereby we
   shall be enabled to perform universal Obedience to the moral Law, such
   as God for Christ's sake will accept of, instead of that Perfection
   which the Law requires. So that now, if we be not all as real and true
   Saints, as good and pious Christians as ever lived, it is certainly our
   own Faults: For we have all things necessary to the making of us such,
   and if we were not wanting to our selves, it is impossible we should
   fail of having all our Sins subdued under us, and all true Grace and
   Vertue implanted in us. Insomuch that since the Christian Religion was
   first revealed to the World, there have been certainly Millions of
   Souls converted by it, who now are glorify'd Saints in Heaven, which
   once were as sinful Creatures upon Earth as we now are. But it seems
   they found the Gospel an effectual Means of Conversion and Salvation;
   and therefore it cannot be imputed to any Defect in the Gospel, or the
   Christian Religion, that we are not all as good Men as ever lived, and
   by consequence better than the Professors of all other Religions in the
   World.

   Bur what then shall we say to this wonder of wonders, that Christians
   themselves in our Age live such loose and dissolute Lives, as generally
   they do? What should be the reason that all manner of Sin and Evil
   should be both practised and indulged amongst us, as much as in the
   darkest Corners of the World, upon which the Gospel never yet shined?
   Why when we have searched into all the reasons that possibly can be
   imagined, next to the Degeneracy and Corruption of our Nature, this
   must needs be acknowledged as one of the chief and principal, that Men
   living upon Earth, and conversing ordinarily with nothing but sensible
   and material Objects, they are so much taken up with them, that those
   divine and spiritual Truths, which are revealed in the Gospel, make
   little or no Impression at all upon them, though they hear what the
   Gospel saith and teacheth, yet they are no more affected with it, nor
   concerned about it, than as if they had never heard of it, their
   Affections being all bent and enclined only to the things of this
   World. And therefore it is no wonder, that they run with so full a
   Career into Sin and Wickedness, notwithstanding their Profession of the
   Gospel, seeing their natural Propensity and Inclination to the things
   of this World, are so strong and prevalent within them, that they will
   not suffer them to think seriously upon, much less to concern
   themselves about any thing else.

   THE Apostle, in his Epistle to Timothy, Chap. vi. endeavouring to
   persuade Men from the over eager Desire of earthly Enjoyments, presses
   this Consideration upon us, that such an inordinate Desire of the
   things of this World betrays Men into many and great Temptations, Ver.
   8, and 9. And then he gives this as the reason of it, Ver. 10. For the
   Love of Money is the Root of all Evil; that is, in brief, The Love of
   Riches and temporal Enjoyments is the great reason why Men are guilty
   of such great and atrocious Crimes as generally they are; there being
   no Evil but what springs from this, as from its Root and Origine; which
   is so plain a Truth, so constantly and universally experienced in all
   Ages, that the Heathens themselves, the ancient Poets and Philosophers,
   could not but take notice of it. For Bion the Philosopher was wont to
   say that philarguriathe Love of Money was kakias metropolis the
   Metropolis of Wickedness. And Apollodorus, alla echedon te to
   kaph?laion ton kakon eirekas ek philarguri?, gar pant' eni; When thou
   speakestl of the Love of Money, thou mentionest the Head of all Evils,
   for they are all contained in that. To the same purpose is that of the
   Poet Phocylides, he de philochremosuie meter kakotetos apases, The Love
   of Riches is the Mother of all Wickedness. What these saw by the Light
   of Nature, hath here divine Authority stamped upon it; God himself
   asserting the same thing by his Apostle, ?rhiza gar panton ton kakon
   estin he philarguria, The Love of Money is the Root of all Evils;
   which, that we may the better understand, we must consider.

   1. WHAT is here meant by Money.

   2. WHAT by the Love of Riches.

   3. HOW the Love of Money is the Root of all Evils.

   As for the first, I need not insist long upon it, all Men knowing well
   enough what Money is. But we must remember that by Money is here
   understood not only Silver and Gold, but all earthly Comforts,
   Possessions, and Enjoyments whatsoever, whether Goods, Lands, Houses,
   Wares, Wealth, or Riches of any sort or kind whatsoever.

   2. By the Love of Money we are to understand that Sin which the
   Scriptures call Covetousness, and the true nature and notion of it
   consisteth especially in three things.

   1. IN having a real Esteem and Value for Wealth or Money, as if it was
   a thing that could make Men happy, or better than otherwise they would
   be; as it is plain all covetous Men have their Desire of Riches
   proceeding only from a groundless Fancy, that their Happiness consists
   in having much, which makes them set a greater Value upon Riches,
   preferring them before other things, even before God himself. Hence the
   Love of Money is altogether inconsistent with the Love of God, 1 Joh.
   ii. 15. If any Man love the World, the love of the Farber is not in
   him. It being impossible to love God as we ought, above all things, and
   yet to love the World too at the same time.

   2. HENCE the Love of Money supposeth also a Delight and Complacency in
   the having of it, proceeding from the foresaid Esteem they have for it:
   For being possessed with a fond Opinion, that the more they have the
   better they are, they cannot but be pleased with the thoughts of their
   present Enjoyments, as the rich Man was in the Gospel, Luk. xii. 16,
   17, 18, 19. who because his Ground brought forth plentifully, refolv'd
   to enlarge his Barns, and lay up Stores for many Years, and bid his
   Soul take her Ease. How many such Fools have we amongst us, who please
   and pride themselves with the thoughts of their being rich?

   3. FROM this Esteem for, and Complacency in Money or Wealth, it follows
   that Men are still desirous of having more, placing their Happiness
   only in Riches, because they think they can never be happy enough,
   therefore they think too they are never rich enough. Hence how much
   soever they have, they still desire more, and therefore Covetousness in
   Scripture is ordinarily expressed by pleonexia, which properly
   signifies an inordinate Desire of having more, which kind of Desires
   can never be satisfyed, because they are able to desire more than all
   the World, and to raise themselves as high and as far as the infinite
   Good itself. Now such a Love of Money as this is, consisting in having
   a real Esteem for it, in taking Pleasure and Delight in it, and in
   longing and thirsting after it; this is that which the Apostle here
   saith is the Root of all Evil; that is, it is the great and principal
   Cause of all sorts of Evil that Men are guilty of, or obnoxious to;
   which that I may clearly demonstrate to you, we must first know in
   general that there are but two sorts of Evil in the World, the Evil of
   Sin, and the Evil of Punishment or Misery; and the Love of Money is the
   Cause of them both.

   To begin with the Evil of Sin, which is the only Fountain from whence
   all other Evils flow, and itself doth certainly spring from the Love of
   Money, as much or more than front any thing else in the whole World.
   Insomuch that the greatest part of those Sins which any of us are
   guilty of, proceeds from this Master Sin, even the Love of Money, as
   might easily be shewn from a particular Enumeration of those Sins which
   Men generally are addicted to. But that I may proceed more clearly and
   methodically in demonstrating this, so as to convince Men of the Danger
   of this above most other Sins, I desire it may be consider'd that there
   are two sorts of Sins that we are all guilty of, Sins of Omission and
   Sins of Commission, under which two Heads all Sins whatsoever are
   comprehended.

   FIRST for Sins of Omission. It is plain that our Love of Money is the
   chief and principal Cause that makes us neglect and omit our Duties to
   God and Man, as it is manifest we most of us do. In speaking unto which
   I must take leave to deal plainly, for it is a matter that concerns our
   eternal Salvation; and therefore howsoever some may resent it, I am
   bound in Duty and Conscience to mind Men of their Sins, and
   particularly of this great prevailing Sin of Covetousness, or
   inordinate Love of Money, which most Men give but too much reason to
   fear they are guilty of, and therefore I may tell them of it without
   any breach of Charity. It is true, I cannot pretend to be a searcher of
   Hearts, that is only God's Prerogative, and therefore I shall not take
   upon me to judge or censure any particular Persons; but I shall speak
   to all in general, and leave every one to make the particular
   Application of it to himself. Neither shall I speak of things at
   random, but I shall instance only in such Sins which I can assert upon
   my own Knowledge that most Men allow themselves, and that upon this
   account only, because they love Money.

   FOR first, what is the reason that so few, indeed scarce any of us, are
   at Prayers at Church upon the Week-Day, to perform our Devotion to him
   that made us? Is it because we think it impertinent to pray unto him?
   No, our Presence there on Sundays contradicts that, and I have more
   Charity than to think that any are so atheistical as to imagine it to
   be superfluous to pay our Homage to the supreme Governour of the World,
   and to implore his Aid and Blessing upon us? But what then should be
   the reason of it? in plain Terms it is nothing else but because Men
   love Money, and therefore are loth to spare so much time from their
   Shops or Callings, as to go to Church to pray to God for what they
   want, and praise his Name for what they have. Let us search into our
   own Hearts, and we shall acknowledge this to be the only reason of it.
   But it is a very foolish one, for who can bless us but God?

   2. WHAT is the reason that so many neglect the Sacrament of the Lord's
   Supper? Do not we all look upon it as our Duty to receive it? I dare
   say we do; Christ himself having commanded it, Luk. xxii. 19. and it
   being the only way whereby to manifest our selves to be Christians,
   what then can be the reason of this Neglect of it, but merely the Love
   of Money, which makes Men loath to spend time in preparing and fitting
   themselves for it.

   BUT seeing Men thus excommunicate themselves by not coming to the
   Communion, in plain Terms, they deserve to be excommunicated by the
   Censures of the Church. And if God should in his Providence deprive
   them of ever having an Opportunity of receiving the Sacrament again,
   they must even thank themselves for for it. Howsoever this shall be
   their present Punishment, that they shall be deprived of it, until they
   think it worth their while to come unto it.

   WHAT is the reason that the Sabbath is so profaned? That so many take
   their Recreations upon the Lord's Day, but because they cannot spare
   time for it from getting Money upon other Days? thinking the Day long,
   because they can get little in it, as Amos viii. 5. And why do so many
   profane the Sabbath, while at Church, by thinking upon the World, but
   because they love it? Ezek. xxxiii. 31.

   3. WHAT is the reason that Charity is so cold, but that the Love of
   Money is grown so hot amongst us? For do not we all know it is our Duty
   to relieve the Poor? Hath not God expressly commanded it Hath not he
   threatned a Curse to them that do it not, and promised a Blessing to
   them that do it? what then can be the reason that so many neglect it,
   but because they love their Money more than God?

   To these might be added many other Sins, which the Love of Money daily
   occasions. For what is the reason that many read the. Scriptures so
   seldom, and so cursorily as they do? What is the reason that they
   either have none, or commonly neglect their Family Duties? That every
   slight Occasion will make them omit their private Devotions; that they
   can find no time to look into their own Hearts, to consider their
   Condition, and meditate upon God and Christ, and the World to come.
   What is the reason that many know their Shops better than their Hearts,
   and are acquainted with the temper of their Body more than with the
   constitution of their Souls? That they are so careful and industrious
   in the Prosecution of their worldly Designs, so negligent and remiss in
   looking after Heaven? What is or can be the reason of these things, but
   that inordinate Love, and Affection they have for Money, or the things
   of this World, which makes them so eager in the pursuit of them, that
   they forget they have any thing else to mind, and so much taken up with
   worldly Business, that God, and Christ, and Heaven, and Soul and all,
   must give way to it? Oh, the Folly and Madness of sinful Men! what a
   strange corrupt and degenerate thing is the Heart of Man become! that
   we should be so foolish and unwise as to prefer our Bodies before our
   Souls, Earth before heaven, Toys and Trifles before the eternal God,
   the worst of Evils before the best of Goods, even Sin itself, with all
   the Miseries that attend it, before Holiness and that eternal Happiness
   which is promised to it! And all for nothing else but the love of a
   little Pelf and Trash, which hath no other worth but what our own
   distracted Fancies put upon it.

   AND if the Love of Money be the Root of so many Sins of Omission, how
   many Sins of Commission must needs sprout from it? Indeed they are so
   many that it would be an endless thing to reckon them all up, and
   therefore I shall not undertake it, but shall mention only such of them
   as every one upon the first reading shall acknowledge to be the cursed
   Offspring of this one fruitful and big-bellyed Sin of Covetousness, or
   the Love of Money, of which Cicero observes, that Nullum est Officium
   tam sanctum atque solemne, quod non avaritia: comminuere atque violare
   soleat. So we may say on the other side too, That there is no Sin so
   great and horrid, but Covetousness will sometime put Men upon it.

   Is Idolatry a Sin? yea certainly, one of the greatest that any Man can
   he guilty of, and yet nothing can be more plain, than that
   Coverousness, wheresoever it comes, draws it along with it; insomuch
   that every covetous Man is asserted by God himself to be an Idolater,
   Eph. v. 5. and Covetousness to be Idolatry itself, Col. iii. 5. And the
   reason is plain; for what is Idolatry but to give that Worship to a
   Creature which is due only unto God? But what higher Acts of Worship
   can we perform to God, than to love him and to trust on him which it is
   certain every covetous Man gives to his Money; and therefore
   Covetousness is here called philarguria, the Love of Money. And we
   cannot but be all sensible what Trust and Confidence Men are wont to
   repose in their Estates and Incomes. But such will say, we do not fall
   down before our Money, nor pray unto it; but they trust on it, and that
   is infinitely more than bare praying to it: And though they do not bow
   down before it in their Bodies, yet they make all the Faculties of
   their Souls to bow and stoop unto it; they love and desire it, they
   rejoyce and delight in having of it, they are grieved and troubled for
   nothing so much as the parting with it, nor fear any thing so much as
   the losing of it.

   BUT they will say again, we do not sacrifice to our Bags, nor burn
   Incense to our Estates; we never did, nor intend to offer so much as a
   Lamb or Calf unto it! It is true, they do not, but they offer that
   which is far better, they offer the Poor to it, suffering them to
   perish with Hunger, Thirst and Cold, rather than relieve them with that
   necessary Maintenance which God hath put into their Hands for them;
   they offer their own Bodies to it, exposing them to Heats and Colds, to
   Dangers and Hazards both by Sea and Land, and all for Money; yea, they
   offer their own Souls to it likewise, as a whole Burnt-Offering, giving
   them to lie scorching in Hell Flames to Eternity, and that upon no
   other Account but to get Money: And tell me which are the greatest
   Fools, and the most odious Idolaters, such as offer Beasts to the. Sun
   and Flames, or such as offer themselves both Soul and Body to Dirt and
   Clay? We cannot but all acknowledge the latter to be far the worse, and
   by Consequence the covetous Man to be the greatest Idolater in the
   World, and that too only because he is a covetous Man.

   MOREOVER, is not Extortion and Oppression a Sin? and yet we all know
   that it is the Love of Money that is the only cause of it. Is not
   Strife and Contention a Sin? whence comes it but from our lusting after
   Money, Jac. iv. 1. Is not Perjury a Sin? Is not Corruption of Justice a
   Sin? Is not Cheating and Cousenage a Sin? Is not Pride and Haughtiness
   a Sin? Is not unrighteous dealing betwixt Man and Man a Sin? Is not
   Theft and Robbery a Sin? Is nor Treason and Rebellion a Sin? Are not
   all these Sins,. and great ones too? But whence spring these poysonous
   Fruits into the Lives of Men, but from the bitter Root of Covetousness
   in their Hearts? It is the Love of Money that makes these Sins so rise
   among us: It is this that makes Men forswear themselves, and couzen
   others: It is this that oft-times makes Fathers ruin their Children,
   and Children to long for the Death of their Fathers: It is this that
   makes Neighbours go to Law, and Brethren themselves to be at variance:
   It is this that makes Men strive to over-reach each other, and to blind
   the Eyes of those they deal with: It is this that hath caused some to
   murder others, and others to destroy themselves. What shall I say more?
   There is no Impiety that can be committed against God, nor Injury that
   can be offered unto Men, but the Love of Money hath been the Cause of
   it in others, and will be so in us unless it be timely prevented, and
   therefore it may well be termed the Root of all Evil of Sin.

   AND it being the Root from whence all the Evil of Sin springs, it must
   needs be the Root of the Evil of Punishment and Misery too: Misery and
   Punishment being the necessary consequent of Sin. Indeed this Sin
   carries its Misery along with it, as Seneca himself saw by the mere
   Light of Nature, saying, Nulla avaritia sine pænâ est, quamvis satis
   sit ipsa pænarum, Avarice is without Punishment, tho' it be itself
   Punishment enough. For what a Torment is it for a Mab to be always
   thirsty, and never able to quench his thirst? Yet this is the Misery of
   every covetous Man, whose thirst after Money can never be satisfyed,
   and who is so desirous of having more, that he can never enjoy with
   Comfort what he hath; loving Money so well that he grudgeth himself the
   oft of it. Hence the foresaid Author observed, That in nullum avarus
   bonus est, in se ipsam pessimus, The covetous Man is good to none, but
   worst of all to himself. And as this is the natural Consequent of this
   Sin in itself, so is it the ordinary Punishment that God inflicts upon
   Men for it, not suffering them to take any Pleasure in the use of what
   they love, Eccles. vi. 1, 2. And besides that, what Cares and Fears,
   what Labours and Travels, what Dangers and Hazards doth the Love of
   Money put Men upon? How do they rack their Brains, and break their Rest
   to get it; and when it is gotten, what Fears are they always in lest
   they should lose it again? What Grief and Trouble do the poor Wretches
   undergo for every petty Loss that befals them? So that every covetous
   Man is not only miserable, but therefore miserable because covetous.

   BUT if their Misery be so great in this Life, how great will it be in
   that to come? Concerning which there are two things to be observed:
   First, that the very having of Riches makes it very difficult to get to
   Heaven, Matth. xix. 23, 24, 25. Luk. xvi. 19, 22. Hence Agar was afraid
   of them, Prov. xxx. 8. Neither do we ever read of any of the
   Patriarchs, Prophets, or the Saints recorded in Scripture, to have been
   guilty of this Sin, unless Baruch, who is reproved for it, Jer. xlv. 5.

   AND as the having of Money makes it difficult to get to Heaven, so the
   loving of it makes it impossible to keep out of Hell. For so long as a
   Man is covetous, he is liable to every Temptation, ready to catch at
   every Bait that the Devil throws before him; so that he is led by him
   as he pleaseth, till at length he be utterly destroyed, 1 Tim. vi. 9.
   And therefore the same Apostle elsewhere tells us, that the Covetous
   have no Inheritance in the Kingdom of God, but the Wrath of God will
   most certainly fall upon them, Eph. v. 5, 6. But the Wrath of God is
   the greatest Evil of Punishment that it is possible for Men to bear:
   Indeed it is that which being once incensed makes Hell-fire: And yet we
   see that the heat of our Love to Money will enkindle the flames of
   God's Wrath against us, yea and such flames too as will never be
   quenched, Mark ix. 44. And so for the little seeming transient Pleasure
   they take in getting, or keeping Money now; they must live in Misery
   and Contempt, Shame and Torment forevermore.

   THUS now we see that the Love of Money will not only put us upon the
   Evil of Sin, but it will also bring the Evil of Punishment upon us;
   both which the Apostle here, Ver. 9, 10. imputes to this Sin. And
   therefore he both well may and must be understood of both there sorts
   of Evil, when he saith, that the Love of Money is the root of all Evil;
   which, the Premises consider'd, I hope none can deny. And need I then
   heap up more Arguments to dissuade Men from this Sin, and to prevail
   with them to leave doting upon the World and loving Money? Is not this
   one Argument of it self sufficient? For is it possible for us to
   indulge our selves in this Sin, now we know it is the root of all Evil?
   And that if we still love Money there is no Sin to great but we may
   fall into it, and no Misery so heavy but it will fall upon us. Surely
   if this Consideration will not prevail upon us to despise and contemn,
   rather than to love and desire this World, for my part I know not what
   can. Only this I know, that so long as Men continue in this Sin, all
   Writing and Preaching will be in vain to them; and so will their
   Hearing be, their going to Church, their reading the Scriptures, their
   hearing them read and expounded to them, all this will signify nothing,
   this root of all Evil is still within us, and it will bring forth its
   bitter fruit, do what we can. And therefore as ever we desire to profit
   by what we hear, as ever we desire to avoid any one Sin whatsoever, to
   know what happiest means to escape either present Torment or eternal
   Misery, as ever we desire to be real Saints, and to manifest our selves
   to be so, to go to Heaven, and live with God and Christ for ever, let
   not our Affections be entangled any longer in the briars and thorns of
   this lower World, let us beware of loving Money: If Riches encreafe,
   let us not set our hearts upon them, Psal lxii. 10. but scorn and
   despise them hereafter as much as ever heretofore we have desired or
   loved them.

   Bur I cannot, I dare not but in Charity believe and hope, that by this
   time my Readers are something weaned from their doting upon this
   present World, and desire to know how they may for the future get off
   their affections from it, so as to have this root of all Evil
   extirpated, and quite plucked up from within them. I hope this is now
   the desire of all, or at least of most of them; and therefore I shall
   now endeavour to shew them how they may infallibly accomplish and
   effect it. In order thereto,

   1. LET such Persons often consider with themselves how unsuitable the
   things of this World are for Affections and Love, which was design'd
   only for the chiefest Good. When God implanted the Affection of Love
   within us, he did not intend it should be the root of all Evil, but of
   all Good unto us; and therefore he did not give it us to place it
   fondly upon such low and mean Objects as this World presents unto us,
   but that we should love Himself with all our hearts and Souls, Deut.
   vi. 5. And surely he infinitely deserves our Love more than such Trash
   can do.

   2. LET them remember that so long as they love Money, they may pretend
   what they please, they do not love God, 1 Joh. ii. 14. nor Christ, Mat.
   x. 37. Luk. xiv. 26. and by consequence they have no true Religion at
   all in them, Jam. i. 27.

   3. LET them often read and study our Saviour's Sermon upon the Mount,
   where he pronounces the meek and low, not the rich and mighty, to be
   blessed, Mat. v. 3, 4. and weigh those strong and undeniable Arguments
   which he brings, to prevail upon us not to take thought for the World,
   not trouble our Heads about the impertinent Concerns of this transient
   Life, Mat. vi. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.

   4. LET them labour to, confirm and strengthen their Trust and
   Confidences on the Promises of God, who hath assured us, that if we
   love and fear him, he will take care of us, and provide all things
   necessary for us, Mat. vi. 33. This is the great Argument which the
   Apostle uses, Heb. xiii. 5, 6.

   5. LET them remember that they are called to higher things than this
   World is able to afford them: The Christian is an high and heavenly
   Calling; we are called by it, and invited to a Kingdom and eternal
   Glory, 1 Thess. 2. 12. and therefore ought not to spend our time about
   such low and paultry Trash as Riches and Wealth.

   6. LET them get above the World, let their Conversation be in Heaven,
   and then they will soon look down upon all things here below as beneath
   their Concern. Vilescunt temporalia, cum desiderantur æterna, He that
   seriously thinks upon and desires Heaven, cannot but vilify and despise
   Earth. Oh what Fools and Madmen do the blessed Angels, and the
   glorified Saints in Heaven, think us poor Mortals upon earth to be,
   when they see us busying our selves about getting a little refin'd
   Dirt, and in the mean while neglecting those transcendent Glories which
   themselves enjoy, although they be offer'd to us!

   7. Let them never suffer the Vanity of all things here below to go out
   of their minds; but remember still, that get what they can, it is but
   Vanity and vexation of Spirit, as Solomon himself asserted upon his own
   Experience, though he be sure had more than any of us are ever likely
   to enjoy. And them not only often repeat the words, but endeavour to
   get themselves convinced throughly of the truth of them, which their
   own Experiences duly weighed, and rightly applied will soon do.

   8. LET it be their daily Prayer to Almighty God, that he would take off
   their Affections from the World and incline them to himself, as David
   did, saying, Incline my heart to thy Testimonies, and not to
   Covetousness, Psal. cxix. 36.

   To all these means, let them add the constant and serious Consideration
   of what they have here read, that the Love of Money is the root of all
   Evil; assuring themselves that if they will not believe it now, it is
   not long before they will all find it but too true by their own sad and
   woful Experience; when they shall be stripp'd of their present
   Enjoyments, and so turn Bankrupts in another World, where they will be
   cast into Prison without ever having a farthing to relieve themselves,
   or so much as a drop of water to cool their enflamed tongues.

   By these and such like means none of us but may suppress the Love of
   Money in us, which is the root of all Evil, and so avoid or prevent all
   the Evil which otherwise will proceed from it. Whether any of my
   Readers will be persuaded to use these means or no, I know not;
   howsoever let me tell them, that if they are loath to strive to get
   their Affections deaden'd to the World, it is an infallible sign that
   they are too much in love with it, and that this root and seed of all
   manner of Evil remains in them; nor can it be expected they will be
   persuaded to any one Duty whatsoever, until they are first prevailed
   upon to do this, even to mortify their Lusts and Affections to the
   things of this World. For so long as those are predominant within us,
   no Grace whatsoever can be exerted, nor Duty performed, nor any Sin
   avoided by us.

   BUT oh how happy would it be, if it should please the most high God to
   set what I have said so home upon any, as to induce them to set
   themselves seriously for the future, to the eradicating or rooting up
   this Love of Money out of their hearts! what a holy, what a blessed,
   what a peculiar People should we then be, and how zealous of good
   works! Then we should take all opportunities of performing our
   Devotions to Almighty God; then we should have as many at the
   Sacrament,. as at a Sermon; then our Churches would be filled all the
   week, as well as on Sundays, and the eternal Godconstantly worshipped
   with Reverence and godly Fear; then we would take delight in cloathing
   the Naked, feeding the Hungry, and relieving the Oppressed; Then there
   would be no such thing as cheating and cousenage, as lying and perjury,
   as strife and contention amongstl us. But we should all walk hand in
   hand together in the ways of Piety, Justice, and Charity upon Earth,
   until at length we shall come to Heaven, where we shall be so far from
   loving or desiring Money, that we shall account it as it is, even dross
   and dirt; where our Affections shall be wholly taken up with the
   Contemplation of the chiefest Good, and we shall solace our selves in
   the Enjoyment of his Perfections forevermore.

                         Thoughts upon Worldly-Riches.

                                   SECT. II.

   TIMOTHY after his Conversion to the Christian Faith, being found to be
   a Man of great Parts, Learning, and Piety, and so every way qualified
   for the work of the Ministry, St. Paul who had planted a Church at
   Ephesus the Metropolis or chief City of all Asia, left him to dress and
   propagate it, after his departure from it, giving him Power to ordain
   Elders or Priests, and to visit and exercise Jurisdiction over them, to
   see they did not teach false Doctrines, 1 Tim. i. 3. That they be
   unblameable in their Lives and Conversations, 1 Tim. v. 7. and to
   exercise Authority over them, in case they be otherwise, 1 Tim. v. 19.
   And therefore it cannot in reason but be acknowledged that Timothy was
   the Bishop, Superintendent, or Visiter of all the Asian Churches, as he
   was always asserted to have been by the Fathers of the Primitive
   Church, as Eusebius reports, saying, Timotheos tes ek epheso paroikias
   hisoreitai proto ten episkropen eilechenai, that Timothy is reported to
   have been the first Bishop of the Province of Ephesus. Be sure he had
   the oversight of all the Churches that were planted there, and not only
   in Ephesus it self, but likewise in all Asia, which was subject then to
   his Ecclesiastical Power and Jurisdiction.

   AND hence it is that the Apostle St. Paul in his first Epistle to him,
   gives him Directions how to manage so great a Work, and to discharge so
   great a Trust as was committed to him, both as Bishop and Priest; both
   how to ordain and govern others, and likewise how to preach himself the
   Gospel of Christ. And having spent the whole Epistle in Directions of
   this sort, in the close of it, as it were at the foot of the Epistle,
   he subjoins one general Caution to be constantly observed by him:
   Charge them that are rich, &c. Which words, though first directed to
   Timothy, were in him intended for all succeeding Ministers, and
   Preachers of the Gospel; such I mean who are solemnly ordained and set
   apart for this work. We are all obliged to observe the Command which is
   here laid upon us, as without which we are never likely to do any good
   upon them that hear us: For so long as their minds are set altogether
   upon Riches, and the things of this World, we may preach our hearts
   out, before we can ever persuade them to mind Heaven and eternal
   Happiness in good earnest. This St. Paul knew well enough, and
   therefore hath left this not only as his Advice and Counsel, but as a
   strict Command and Duty incumbent upon the Preachers of the Gospel in
   all Ages, that they charge them that are rich, &c. where it may be
   observ'd in the first place, how we are expressly enjoined to charge
   them that are rich, &c. a word much to to be observed. The Apostle doth
   not say, desire, beseech, counsel, or admonish, the Rich; but
   parangelle tois plousiois, charge and command them that are rich. The
   word properly signifies such a Charge as the Judges at an Assize or
   Sessions make in the King's Name, enjoining his Subjectsto observe the
   established Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom. And so the word is always
   used in Scripture for the strictest way of commanding any thing to be
   observed or done, as Acts v. 28. ou parangelia parengeilamen humin; Did
   not we straitly command you. Luc. v. 14. parengeilen auto. He charg'd
   him to tell no Man. Thus Therefore it is that we are here enjoined to
   charge the Rich in the name of the King of Kings, not to be high
   minded, nor to trust in uncertain Riches, &c.

   And this is the proper notion, and the only true way of preaching the
   word of God; which therefore in Scripture is ordinarily expressed by
   the word keruosein, which properly signifies to publish or proclaim, as
   Heralds do, the Will and Pleasure of the Prince, and in his Name to
   command the People to observe it. Thus we are enjoined to preach the
   word of God, by publishing his Will and Pleasure to Men; charging them
   in his Name, to obey and practise it. For we come not to them in our
   own Names, but in his that created and redeemed them; and therefore,
   altho' we neither have, nor pretend to any Power or Authority over
   them, from our selves; yet by vertue of the Commission which we have
   received from the universal and supreme Monarch of the World, we not
   only lawfully may, but are in duty bound, to charge and enjoin all in
   his Name, to observe what he hath commanded them. Insomuch, that
   although we pretend not to divine Inspiration, or immediate Revelations
   from God, such as the Prophets had; yet we, preaching the same Word
   which they did, may, and often ought to use the same Authority which
   they used, saying, as they did, Thus saith the Lord of Hosts. For
   whatsoever is written in the Scriptures, is as certainly God's word
   now, as it was when first inspired or revealed to them. And therefore
   it cannot be denied, but that we have as much Power to charge upon all,
   the Observation of what is there written; as they ever had, we being
   sent to preach and proclaim the Will of God unto all, by the same
   Person as they were. Hence it is that the Apostle, in the name of God,
   commands Titus, and in him all succeeding Ministers of the Gospel, to
   speak or preach the Word of God, to exhort and rebuke with all
   Authority, Tit. ii. 15. From whence nothing can be more plain, than
   that it is our Duty to preach with Authority, as those who have
   received Power from God, to make known his Will and Pleasure to all
   Men; or as the Apostle here expressly words it, to charge them not to
   be high minded, and the like.

   BUT this I fear may be a very ungrateful Subject to many, and therefore
   I should not have insisted so long upon it, but that there is a kind of
   necessity for it. For I verily believe, that the Non-observance of
   this, hath been, and still is, the principal Reason why People receive
   so little benefit by hearing of Sermons, as they usually do. For they
   look upon Sermons only as popular Discourses, rehears'd by one of their
   Fellow-Creatures, which they may censure, approve or reject, as
   themselves see good. And we our selves, I fear, have been too faulty,
   or at least remiss, in this particular; in that when we preach, we
   ordinarily make a long Harangue or Oration concerning some point in
   polemical, dogmatical, or practical Divinity, and use only same moral
   Persuasions to press upon our Auditors, the observance of what we say,
   without interposing, or exercising the Authority which is committed to
   us, so as to charge them in the Name of the most High God, to observe
   and practise what we declare and prove unto them to be his Will, and by
   consequence their Duty. But for my own part, did I think that Preaching
   consisted only in explaining some point in Divinity, and using only
   moral Arguments to persuade Men to perform their Duty to God and Man, I
   should not think it worth my while to do it, because I could not expect
   to do any good at all by it. For all the moral Arguments in the World,
   can never be so strong to draw us from Sin, as our own natural
   Corruptions are to drive us into it. And therefore we can never expect
   to do any good upon Men, either by our Logick or Rhetorick; but our
   Arguments must be fetched from on high, even from the eternal God
   himself, or else they are never likely to profit or prevail upon them.
   We must charge and command them in God's Name, or else we had as good
   say nothing.

   IT is true, did we, who preach God's Word, propose nothing else to our
   selves, but to tickle Mens ears, and please their fancies, and so to
   ingratiate our selves into their love and favour, it would be easie to
   entertain them with Discourses of another nature, stuffed with such
   fine Words, quaint Phrases, and high Notions, as would be very pleasing
   and acceptable unto them. But I must take leave to say, that we dare
   not do it; for we know, that as our Auditors must give an account of
   their hearing, so it is not long before we also must give an account of
   our preaching too, for so God himself hath told us before hand by his
   Apostle, Heb. 13. 17. But how shall we be able to look the eternal God
   in the face, yea, or to look our Auditors in the face at that time, if
   instead of charging their Duty upon them, in order to their eternal
   Salvation, we should put them off with general Discourses, which
   signifie nothing, only to please and gratifie them whilst we remain
   with them; no, we dare not do it, and therefore I wish Men would not
   expect it from us; for we must not hazard our own eternal Salvation, to
   gain their temporal favour or applause. And therefore, seeing God hath
   been pleased to entrust us so far with Mens Souls, as to direct them in
   the way to eternal Life, howsoever they resent it, we are bound in
   Duty, both to God, to them, and our selves, to deal plainly with them,
   and to use the Authority which he hath here committed to us, where he
   hath expressly commanded us in his Name, to charge them that are rich
   in this world, &c.

   WHERE I desire the Reader to observe in the next place, that we of the
   Clergy are not only empower'd to charge the poorer, or meaner sort of
   People, who by reason of their extream poverty and want, may seem
   inferior to us, but even rich Men too; Charge them, saith the Apostle,
   that are rich in this world. And the reason is, because we come unto
   them in his Name, who gives them all the Riches they do enjoy, and can
   take them away again when he himself pleaseth; so that he can make the
   poor rich, and the rich poor, when he pleaseth, and therefore the poor
   and rich are all alike to him; his Power and Authority is the same over
   both; and therefore we, coming in his Name, are ordered to make no
   distinction, but to charge the one as well as the other; yea, here we
   are particularly commanded to charge them that are rich.

   WHICH is the next thing to be considered in these words, even whom the
   Apostle means by them that are rich in this world? Which is a Question
   that needs a serious Resolution. For many Men, not thinking themselves
   as yet to be rich enough, will be apt to conclude from thence, that
   they are not to be reckoned amongst those whom the Apostle here calls
   rich in this World. But whatsoever they may think of themselves, I
   believe there are but few, except the very poor, who in a Scripture
   sense are not rich Men. For whatsoever any have over and above their
   necessary maintenance, that the Scriptures call Riches, as is plain
   from Agar's wish, Give me neither poverty, nor riches, feed me with
   food convenient for me, Prov. xxx. 8. From whence it is easie to
   observe, that as nothing but the want of convenient Food is Poverty; so
   whatsoever a Man hath over and above his convenient or necessary Food,
   is properly his Riches; and so he that hath it, is in a Scripture sense
   a rich Man, who is therefore called here in my Text ploutos, quasi
   poluousios, one that hath much Substance, or more than he hath
   necessary occasion for. And therefore, although same may be richer than
   others, yet I believe the generality may be justly reckoned in the
   number of the rich Men here spoken of, at least all such, as by the
   Blessing of God, have not only what is necessary for their present
   maintenance, but likewise something to spare, and so may all come under
   the notion of those whom we are here commanded to charge not to be high
   minded, nor trust in uncertain Riches, &c.

   HAVING thus considered the Act which we are here commanded to exert,
   and the Object, the rich of this World, we are now to consider the
   Subject matter, what that is which we are here commanded to charge upon
   them, but that is here expressly set down in several Particulars, all
   which I shall endeavour to explain as they lie in order.

   1. THAT they be not high minded; a necessary caution for rich Men. For
   Riches are very apt to puff Men up with vain and foolish conceits of
   themselves, so as to think themselves to be so much better, by how much
   they are richer than other People; but this is a grand mistake, which
   we are here enjoined to use the utmost of our power and skill to
   rectifie, by charging them that are rich not to be high minded; that
   is, not to think highly and proudly of themselves, because they are
   richer or wealthier than other Men, but to be every way as humble in
   their own eyes, and as lowly minded in the enjoyment of all temporal
   Blessings, as if they enjoyed nothing; as considering, 1. how much
   soever they have, they are no way really the better for it.

   1. NOT in their Souls; they are never the wiser nor holier, nor more
   acceptable unto God by their being rich, Eccles. ix. 1. Job xxxiv. 19 .

   2. NOR in their Bodies; they are never the stronger, nor healthier, nor
   freer from pain and trouble, nor yet longer lived than others.

   3. NOR, in their Minds; their Consciences are never the quieter, their
   Hearts never the freer from cares and fears, neither can they sleep
   better than other People, Eccl. v. 12.

   4. NOR yet in their Estate and Condition.

   1. NOT in this Life. For Riches can never satisfie them, nor by
   consequence make them happy; but they may still be as miserable in the
   enjoyment, as in the want of all things, Eccl. v. 11.

   2. NOR yet in the Life in come; they are never the nearer Heaven, by
   being higher upon Earth; their Gold and Silver can never purchase an
   Inheritance for them in the Land of Canaan, Jac. ii. 5.

   2. THEY are so far from being better, that they are rather much worse
   for their having abundance here below.

   1. THEY have more Temptations to Sin, to Luxury, to Covetousness, to
   the love of this World, to the neglect of their Duty to God, to Pride
   and Self-conceitedness, to Security and Presumption, Luk. xii. 19.

   2. IT is harder for them to get to Heaven, than it is for others; and
   by consequence, the richer they are, the more danger they are in of
   being miserable for ever, Mat. xix. 23. Whence our Saviour himself
   denounceth a Wo upon them that are rich, Luk. vi. 24. and St. James
   bids than weep and howl for their miseries, Jac. v. 1. And therefore
   advises us en rejoice rather at Poverty than Riches, Jac. i. 9, 10. Now
   these things being considered, as spoken by God himself, none can deny
   but that the rich are most certainly in a worse condition than the
   poor; and by consequence, that Men have no cause to be proud, or high
   minded, nor to glory in their riches, Jer. ix. 23. And therefore
   whatsoever outward Blessings God hath bestowed upon us, Let us not be
   high minded, but fear, Rom. xi. 20.

   2. NOR trust in uncertain Riches, which I confess is a very hard Lesson
   for a rich Man to learn, nothing being more difficult than to have
   Riches, and not to true in them, as our Saviour himself intimates, in
   explaining the one by the other, as things very rarely severed, Mark x.
   23, 24. But certainly it is altogether as foolish a thing to trust in
   Riches, as it is to be proud of them. For,

   1. THEY of themselves can stand us in no stead, they cannot defend us
   from any evil, nor procure us any good; they cannot of themselves
   either feed us, or cloath us, or refresh us, or be any ways
   advantageous to us, without God's Blessing, Prov. xi. 4. How much less
   can they be able to deliver us from wrath to come. No, we may take it
   for a certain truth, our Riches may much further our eternal Misery,
   but they can never conduce any thing to our future happiness.

   2. IF we trust in them, be sure they'll fail us, and bring us into
   Misery and Desolation, for to trust in any thing but God, is certainly
   one of the highest Sins we can be guilty of, it is in plain terms
   Idolatry; and therefore He that trusteth in riches, is sure to fall,
   Prov. xi. 28. For this is to deny God, Job xxxi. 24, 25, 28.

   3. THEY are but uncertain Riches, they make themselves wings and fly
   away, Prov. xxiii. 5. They are in continual motion, ebbing and flowing,
   and never continuing in one stay. So that you are never sure of keeping
   them one day; and what reason then can we have to trust on them?
   Especially considering, that they are not only uncertain, but
   uncertainty it self, as the word here signifies, Trust not in the
   uncertainty of riches.

   BUT in the living God; He, he is to be the only Object of our trust,
   whether we have, or have not any thing else to trust on; or to speak
   more properly, there is nothing that we can upon good Grounds make our
   trust and confidence, but only him, who governs, and disposeth of all
   things, according to his own pleasure. So that it is he, and he alone
   that giveth us all things richly to enjoy. It is not our Wit or Policy,
   it is not our Strength or Industry, it is not our trading or
   trafficking in the World, it is none but God that giveth us what we
   have, Deut. viii. 18. Prov. x. 22. And as it is he that maketh Men
   rich, so he can make them poor again, when he himself pleaseth; and
   they have cause to fear he will do so too, unless they observe what is
   here charged upon them.

   THERE are four Duties still behind, which we are here commanded to
   charge all those who are rich to observe.

   1. THAT they do good. In treating of which I might shew the several
   Qualifications required to the making up of an Action good, as that the
   matter of it must be good, as commanded, or at least allowed by God,
   that the manner of performing it be good, as that it be done
   obedientially, understandingly, willingly, chearfully, humbly, and
   sincerely; and that the end be good too, so as that it be directed
   ultimately to the Glory of God. But not to insist upon that now, I
   shall only consider what kind of good Works the Rich are here commanded
   to do, as they are rich Men. And they are two, Works of Piety, and
   Works of Charity.

   1. THEY are here commanded to do works of Piety; where by works of
   Piety; I mean not their loving and fearing, and honouring of God, nor
   yet their praying to him, their hearing his Word, or praising his Name,
   for such works of Piety as these are, the poorest as well as the
   richest Persons amongst us are bound to do; whereas the Apostle here
   speaks only of such works as they who are rich are bound to do, upon
   that account because they are so. And therefore by works of Piety here,
   I understand such works as tend to the Honour of his Name, to the
   Performance of Worship and Homage to him, to the Encouragement of his
   Ministers, the propagating of his Gospel, and the Conversion of Sinners
   to him; all which they are bound to do, to the utmost of their Power,
   out of the Estates which for these purposes he hath entrusted with
   them. For thus they are expresly commanded to honour the Lord With all
   their Substance, or Riches, and with the First-Fruits of all their
   Increase, Prov. iii. 9. And the reason is, because God is the universal
   Proprietor, the Head Landlord of all the World, and we have nothing but
   what we hold under him; neither are we any more than Tenants at will to
   him, who may fine us at his own Pleasure, or throw us out of Possession
   whensoever he sees good. Now lest we should forget this, even upon what
   Tenure it is that we hold our Estates, God hath enjoyned us to pay him,
   as it were, a Quit-rent, or Tribute out of what we possess as an
   Acknowledgment that it is by his Favour and Blessing alone that we do
   possess it. So that whatsoever we do, or are able to offer to him, is
   but a due Debt which we owe him, which if we neglect to pay him, we
   lose our Tenure, and forfeit what we have to the Lord of the Mannor,
   the supreme Possessor of the World. Hence it is, that in all Ages, they
   who were truly pious, and had a due sense of God upon their Hearts,
   were always very careful to pay this their Homage unto God; insomuch
   that many of them never thought they could give enough to any pious
   Use, wherein to testify their Acknowledgment of God's Dominion over
   them, and his Right and Propriety in what they had. A notable Instance
   whereof we have in the Children of Israel; for when the Tabernacle was
   to be built for the Service and Worship of God, they were so far from
   being backward in contributing towards it, that they presently brought
   more than could be used in the building of it, Exod. xxxvi. 5, 6, 7. So
   it was too in the building of the Temple, which David, and the Chiefs
   or Nobles of Israel, made great Preparations for, 1 Chron. xxix. 6, 7,
   8. And that they did this, thereby to acknowledge God to be the Lord
   and Giver of all, is plain from the following words, Ver. 11, 12, 13.
   The same was also observed in the building of the second Temple, as the
   raising the first out of its Rubbish, wherein it had lain for many
   Years. And as for Christians, I need not tell you how forward those who
   have been truly pious, have always been in doing such works of Piety,
   seeing most of the Churches in Christendom, or be sure in this Nation,
   have been erected by particular Persons. And it is very observable,
   that the more eminent any Place or Age hath been for Piety and
   Devotion, the more pious works have been always done in it, for the
   Service and Worship of Almighty God; which plainly shews, that where
   such works are wanting, whatsoever Pretences they may make, there is no
   such thing as true Piety, and the Fear of God. And therefore, as ever
   we desire to manifest our selves to be what we profess, true Christians
   indeed, Men fearing God, and hating Covetousness, we must take all
   Opportunities to express our Thankfulness unto God for what we have, by
   devoting as much as we can of it to his Service and Honour.

   2. BESIDES these works of Piety towards God, the Rich are enjoined also
   works of Charity towards the Poor, which though they have an immediate
   reference to the poor, yet God looks upon them as given to himself,
   Prov. xiv. 31. Ch. xix. 17. Math. xxv. 40. Hence it is that God accepts
   of such works as these also, for part of the Tribute which we owe him;
   whereby we acknowledge the Receipt of what we have from him, and
   express our Thankfulness unto him for it, without which we have no
   ground to expect a Blessing upon what we have, nor that it should be
   really good to us. For, as the Apostle tells us, every Creature of God
   is good, if it be received with Thanskgiving, not else, 1 Tim. iv. 4.
   But no Thanksgiving is acceptable but that which is expressed by works
   as well as words. And therefore it is necessary for us to pay this Duty
   and Service to God, out of what we have, in order to the cleansing and
   sanctifying the Residue of our Estates unto us, without which we have
   not the lawful use of what we possess; but every thing we have is
   polluted and unclean to us, as our Saviour himself intimates, Luk. xi.
   41. A thing much to be considered. For I verily believe that the great
   reason why so many Estates are blasted so soon, and brought to nothing
   amongst us, is because Men do not render unto God his Duty and Tribute
   out of what they have, and therefore it is no wonder that God in his
   Providence turns them out of Possession, and gives their Estates to
   other Persons, who shall be better Tenants to him, and be careful to
   pay him the Duties which he requires of them. And therefore, in order
   to Mens securing their Estates to themselves and Posterity, it is
   absolutely necessary that they observe the Duty which we are here
   recommended to charge upon all that are rich in this World, even to do
   good with what they have, and not only so, but

   2. To be rich too in good works; that is, not only to do good, but to
   do as much good as they are able with their Riches, so as to proportion
   their good works to the Riches which God hath given them wherewith to
   do them, according to the Apostle's Direction, 1 Cor. xvi. 2. Thus in
   the place before quoted, Luc. xi. 41. where our Saviour bids the
   Pharisees to give Alms of such things as they have. His words are ta
   enonta dote tou eleemosunen, Give Alms as much as ye are able, for so
   the words properly signify. And verily whatsoever we do, unless it be
   as much as we can, God will not look upon us as doing any thing at all:
   For we must not think to compound with him. When he hath given us all
   we have, he expects that we render all that he requires of us, that is
   as much as we are able to pay unto him. As if a Man owes you Money, you
   will not accept of part instead of the whole; so neither will God from
   us; we all owe him as much as we are able to devote to his Service and
   Honour, and we must not think to put him off with part of it: For he
   reckons that he receives nothing from us, unless it be proportionable
   to what he hath bestowed upon us. But how little soever it is that we
   give or offer to him, if it be but answerable to our Estates, it will
   be accepted by him. This our Saviour himself hath assured us of, Mark
   xii. 43, 44. From whence we may certainly conclude, that there is not
   the poorest Person whatsoever but may be as rich in good works as the
   richest, because God doth not measure the goodness of our works by
   their bulk or quantity, but by the proportion which they bear to our
   Estates: So that he that gives a penny may do as good a work as he that
   gives a pound, yea and a better too, because his may be as much as he
   is able, whereas the other's is not. I with all Men would seriously
   weigh and consider this, lest otherwise they go out of the world
   without ever having done one good work in it: For we may assure our
   selves, he that is not thus rich in good works, doth no good at all
   with his Riches.

   BUT it is farther to be considered here that this Expression, rich in
   good works, implies that good works are indeed our principal Riches;
   and that Men must not compute their Riches so much from what they have,
   as from what they give and devote to God. For what we have is not ours,
   but God's in our hands; but what we give is ours in God's hands, and he
   acknowledgeth himself our Debtor for it, in that he tells us that we
   lend it to him, and promiseth to pay it us again, Prov. xix. 17. And
   therefore they who cast up their Accounts to know how rich they are,
   ought not to reckon upon what they have lying by them, nor upon their
   Houses and Lands that are made over to them, nor yet upon what is owing
   to them by Men; but should reckon only upon what they have given to
   pious or charitable Uses, upon what Treasure they have laid up in
   Heaven. For whatsoever they may think at present, I dare assure them,
   that will be found to be their only Riches another day. And therefore
   if any one desires to be rich indeed, let him take my Advice, do what
   good he can with the Riches he hath, and then he will be rich enough:
   For this is the way to be rich in good works. But in order unto that,
   he must likewise observe what follows, to be

   3. Ready to distribute; that is, ready upon all occasions to pay his
   Tribute unto God, whensoever he in his Providence calls for it; taking
   all opportunities of doing good, and glad when he can find them, Gal.
   vi. 10. Thus therefore whensoever any opportunities present themselves
   of expressing our thankfulness unto God, by works either of Piety or
   Charity, whatsover other business may be neglected, we must be sure to
   lay hold on that. For I dare say, that there is none but will grant me
   that there is all the reason in the world that God should be served in
   the first place, and that he should have the first fruits of all our
   Encrease, Prov. iii. 9. Exod. xxiii. 19. Deut. xxvi. 2. And therefore
   we cannot but acknowledge, that works of Piety towards God, and of
   Charity to the Poor, or as the Scripture calls them in general good
   works, are always to be done in the first place; and whatsoever other
   works may be omitted, be sure they must not. But we ought still to be
   as ready to pay our Duties unto God, as we are to receive any thing
   from him, as ready to give as to receive; and by consequence as Men let
   no opportunities slip wherein they can encrease their Estates, they are
   much less to let any opportunities pass wherein they can any way
   improve their Estates for God's Glory and others Good; but they ought
   to be ready upon all Occasions to distribute what they can upon
   charitable and pious Uses.

   4. Willing to communicate; as we must do it with a ready hand, so we
   must do it with a willing Heart too. Thus we are enjoined to serve God
   willingly, 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. and chearfully, 2 Cor. ix. 6, 7. Indeed
   God accepts of none but Freewill Offerings. If we be not as willing to
   do good works as we are to have wherewith to do them, we may be
   confident God will never accept of them. And therefore in plain Terms,
   if any would be rich in good works as becometh Christians, and as it is
   our interest to be, they must not stay till they be compelled,
   persuaded, or intreated by others to do them; but they must set upon
   them of their own accord, out of pure obedience unto God, and from a
   due sense of their constant dependence upon him, and manifold
   obligations to him; yea so as to take pleasure in nothing in the World
   so much as in paying their Respects and Service to Almighty God, 1
   Chron. xxix. 14, 15, 17.

   Now to encourage the Rich to employ their Estates thus in doing good,
   the Apostle adds in the last place, that this is the way to lay up for
   themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may
   lay hold on eternal Life. A strange Expression! yea such a one, that
   had not St. Paul himself spoke it, some would have been apt to have
   excepted against it for an Error or Mistake. What, good Works the
   Foundation of eternal Life? No, that is not the meaning of it; but that
   good works are the Foundation of that blessed Sentence which they shall
   receive who are made Partakers of eternal Life, as is plain. from our
   Saviour's own words, Mat. xxv. 34, 35. 36.

   AND verily although there be no such intrinsick value in good works,
   whereby they that do them can merit any thing from God by their doing
   of them; yet nothing can be more certain, than that God of his infinite
   Mercy in Jesus Christ will so accept of them as to reward us for them
   in the World to come. For this our Saviour himself doth clearly
   intimate to us, in the Place before quoted, as also, Mat. vi. 20. Luk.
   xii. 33. Luk. xvi. 9. that is, distribute and employ the unrighteous or
   deceitful Riches you have in this World in such a way as is most
   pleasing and acceptable unto God, that so he may be your Friend, and
   receive you into everlasting Habitations, when these transient and
   unstable Riches fail you. From whence I beg leave to observe, that to
   do good with what we have is the only way whereby to improve our
   Estates for our own good, so as to be the better for them both in this
   and also in the World to come. The Rabbins have a good Saying, that
   mlch mmvn tsrqh good works are the Salt of Riches, that which preserves
   them from Corruption, and makes them savoury and acceptable unto God,
   as also useful and profitable to the Owners. Unless we do good with our
   Estates, we forfeit our Title to them by the Non-payment of the
   Rent-charge which God hath reserved to himself upon them; and therefore
   we may justly expect every moment to be call out of Possession; of
   howsoever though he may forbear us a while, yea so long as we are in
   this World, what good, what benefit, what comfort shall we have of our
   Estates in the World to come? Certainly no more than the rich Man in
   the Gospel had, when he lay scorching in Hell-fire, and had not so much
   as a drop of water to cool his enflamed tongue. Whereas on the other
   side, if we do good with our Estates, if we devote them to the Service
   of God, and to the Relief of the Poor, by this means we shall not only
   secure the Possession of them to our selves here, but shall also
   receive comfort and benefit from them in the World to come; so that our
   Estates will not die with us, but we shall receive benefit by them, and
   have cause to bless God for them unto all Eternity. The Apostle himself
   assuring us. that by this menus we shall lay up for our selves a good
   foundation for the time to come, so as to lay hold on eternal Life.

   THIS one Argument being duly weighed, I hope I need not use any more to
   persuade Men to do good with what they have, and to make the best use
   of it they can. For I know I write to Christians, at least to such as
   profess themselves to be so; and therefore to such as believe there is
   another World besides this we live in, and by consequence that it
   concerns them to provide for that, which, as I have shewn, we may do in
   a plentiful manner, by the right Improvement of what God hath entrusted
   with us in this World. What then do the generality of Men mean to be so
   flack and remiss in laying hold on all opportunities of doing good!
   What, do they think it possible to lose any thing they do for God! or
   do they think it possible to employ their Estates better than for his
   Service and Honour who gave them to us! I cannot believe any think so;
   and therefore must needs advise the Rich again and again not to lay up
   their Talent in a Napkin, but to use their Estates to the best
   advantage for God and their own Souls, that so when they go from hence
   into the other World, they may be received into eternal Glory, with a
   Well done good and faithful Servants, enter you into your Master's Joy.

   BUT fearing lest these moral Persuasions may not prevail so much upon
   my Readers as I desire they might, they must give me leave farther to
   tell them, that 1 am here commanded to charge them that are rich in
   this World, to be rich also in good works: And therefore seeing, as I
   have shewn, there are few but who in a Scripture-sense are rich in this
   world, in obedience to this Command which here is laid upon me, in the
   Name of the most high God, I charge you, and not I only, but the
   eternal God himself, he wills and requires all those whom he hath
   blessed with Riches in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor
   trust in uncertain Riches, but that they put their whole Trust and
   Confidence only in the Living God, whose all things are, and who gives
   us whatsoever we have: That they do good with what he hath put into
   their hands, laying it out upon works of Piety towards him, and of
   Charity to the Poor, that his Worship may be decently performed, and
   the Poor liberally relieved; that they be rich in good works, striving
   to excel each other in doing good in their Generation; that they be
   ready every moment to distribute, and always willing to communicate to
   every good work, wherein they can pay their Homage and express their
   Thankfulness to him for what they have,

                           Thoughts upon Self-denyal.

   THE most glorious Sight questionless that was ever to be seen upon the
   face of the Earth, was to see the Son of God here, to see the supreme
   Being and Governour of the World here; to see the Creator of all things
   conversing here with his own Creatures; to see God himself with the
   nature, and in the shape of Man; walking about upon the surface of the
   Earth, and discoursing with silly Mortals here; and that with so much
   Majesty and Humility mixed together, that every expression might seem a
   demonstration that he was both God and Man. It is true, we were not so
   happy as to see this blessed Sight; howsoever, it is our Happiness that
   we have heard of it, and have it so exactly described to us, that we
   may as clearly apprehend it as if we had seen it: Yea, our Saviour
   himself hath pronounced those in a peculiar manner blessed, who have
   not seen, and yet have believed, Joh. xx. 29. that is, who never saw
   Christ in the Manger, nor in the Temple, who never saw him prostrate
   before his Father in the Garden, nor fastned by Men unto his Cross; who
   never saw him preaching the Gospel, nor working Miracles to confirm it;
   who never saw him before his Passion, nor after his Resurrection, and
   yet do as firmly believe whatsoever is recorded of him, as if they had
   seen it with their Eyes. Such Persons our blessed Saviour himself
   asserts to be truly blessed, as having such a Faith as is the Substance
   of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen, Heb. xi. 1.

   HENCE therefore, although we lived not in our Saviour's time, and
   therefore saw him not do as never Man did, nor heard him speak as never
   Man spake, we may notwithstanding be as blessed, or rather more blessed
   than they that did. If we do but give credit to what is asserted of
   him, and receive and believe what is represented to us in his holy
   Gospels, where by Faith we may still see him working Miracles, and hear
   him declaring his Will and Pleasure to his Disciples, as really as if
   we had then been by him. And therefore whatsoever we read in the Gospel
   that he spake, we are to hearken as diligently to it; as if we heard
   him speak it with our own Ears, and be as careful in the performance of
   it, as if we had received it from his own Mouth: for so we do, though
   not immediately, yet by the infallible Pen of them that did so. And
   seeing he never spake in vain, or to no purpose, nor sufferedan idle or
   superfluous word to proceed out of his sacred and divine Mouth;
   whatsoever he asserted, we are to look upon as necessary to be
   believed, because he asserted it. And whatsoever be commanded, we are
   to look upon as necessary to be observed, because he hath commanded it;
   for we must not think that his Assertions are so frivolous, or his
   Commands so impertinent, that it is no great matter whether we believe
   the one and obey the other or no: No, if we expect to be justified and
   saved by him, he expects to be believed and obeyed by us, without which
   he will not look upon us as his Disciples, nor by consequence as
   Christians, but Strangers and Actions to him, whatsoever our
   Professions and Pretences are.

   It is true, we live in an Age wherein Christianity in the general
   notion of it is highly courted, all Sects and Parties amongst us making
   their Pretences to it, whatsoever Opinions or Circumstances they differ
   in, be sure they all agree in the external Profession of the Christian
   Religion, and by consequence in the acknowledgment that they ought to
   be Christians indeed. But I fear that Men are generally mistaken about
   the notion of true Christianity, not thinking it to be so high and
   divine a thing as really it is; for if they had true and clear
   conceptions of it. they would never fancy themselves to be Christians,
   upon such low and pitiful grounds as usually they do, making as if
   Christianity consisted in nothing else, but in the external performance
   of some few particular Duties, and in adhering to them that profess it;
   whereas Christianity is a thing of a much higher and far more noble
   nature, than such would have it; insomuch, that did we but rightly
   understand it, methinks we could not but be taken with it, so as to
   resolve for the future to the utmost of our power to live up to it, to
   which could I be an instrument of persuading any, how happy should I
   think my self? Howsoever it is my Duty to endeavour it; and for that
   purpose I shall now clear up the true notion of Christianity, that we
   may know, not what it is to be Professors and Pretenders to
   Christianity, but what it is to be real Christians, and true Disciples
   of Christ Jesus, such as Christ will own for his in another World.

   NOW to know whom Christ will accept for his Disciples, our only way is
   to consult Christ himself, and to consider what it is that he requires
   of those that follow him, in order to be his Disciples; a thing as
   easily understood, as it is generally disregarded; for nothing can be
   more plain, than that Christ requires and enjoins all those that would
   be his Disciples, to observe not only some few, but all the Commands
   that he hath laid upon us. Ye are my friends, saith he, and therefore
   my Disciples, if ye do whatsoever I command you, Joh. xv. 14. So that
   unless we do whatsoever he commands, us, we are so far from being his
   Disciples, that we are indeed his Enemies. Nay, they that would be his
   Disciples, must excel and surpass all others in Vertue and good Works.
   Herein, saith he, is my father glorified, that ye bring forth much
   fruit, so shall ye be my disciples, Joh. xv. 8. yea and continue in
   them too, Joh. viii. 31. He tells us also, that they that would be his
   Disciples, must love him above all things, or rather, hate all things
   in comparison of him, Luc. xiv. 26. And that they love one another, as
   he hath loved them, Joh. xiii. 35. To name no more; read but St. Mat.
   xvi. 24. and there you may see what it is to be a Chritlian indeed, or
   what it is that Christ requires of those who would be his Disciples. If
   any man will come after me, let him deny himself, take up his Cross,
   and follow me. Did we but understand the true meaning of these words,
   and order our Conversations accordingly, we should both know what it is
   to be true Christians, and really be so our selves. For I think there
   is nothing that Christ requires of those who desire to be his
   Disciples, but we should perform it, could we but observe what is here
   commanded; which that we may all do, I shall endeavour to give the true
   meaning of them, and of every particular in them, as they lie in order.

   First, saith he, If any man will come after me, that is, If any Man
   will be my Disciple; for Masters ye know use to go before, Scholars and
   Disciples to follow after. And our Saviour here speaks of himself under
   the notion of a Master, that hath Disciples coming after him, and
   saith, that if any one would be one of his Disciples, so as to go after
   him, he must deny himself, take up his cross and follow him. So that
   here are three things which our blessed Saviour requires of those that
   would be his Disciples, and by consequence of us who profess to be so;
   for I dare say, there is none of us but desires to be a Christian, or
   at least to be thought so; for we all know and believe Jesus Christ to
   be the only Saviour of Mankind, that none an save us but he, and that
   there is none of us but he can save, and that all those who truly come
   to him for Pardon and Salvation, shall must certainly have it: Hence it
   is that we would all be thought at least so wise, and to have so much
   Care of our own Souls as to go after Christ, and be his Disciples. I
   hope there are but few but who really desire to be so. But I would not
   have any think that it is so easy a Matter to be a Disciple of Christ,
   or a real and true Christian, as the World would make it; no, we may
   assure ourselves, that as it is the highest Honour and Happiness we can
   attain unto, so we shall find it the hardest matter in the World to
   attain unto it; not in its own Nature, but by reason of its Contrariety
   to our natural Temper and Inclinations. For here we see what it is that
   our blessed Saviour requires of those that would go after him, even
   nothing less than to deny themselves, take up their Crosses, and follow
   him. All which are far greater things than at the first sight or
   reading they may seem to be.

   FOR first, saith he, If any one will come after me, let him deny
   himself; which being the first thing which Christ requires of those
   that go after him, it is necessary that we search more narrowly into
   the Nature of it. For if we fail in this, we cannot but fail in all the
   rest. And therefore, for the opening of this, I shall not trouble the
   Reader with the various Expositions, and the divers Opinions of learned
   Men concerning these words, but only mind him in general, that the
   Self-denyal here spoken of is properly opposed to Self-love, or that
   corrupt and vicious Habit of the Soul, whereby we are apt to admire and
   prefer our own Fancies, Wills, Desires, Interests, and the like, before
   Christ himself, and what he is pleased either to promise to us or
   require of us. And therefore, when he commands us to deny our selves,
   his Will and Pleasure in general is this, That we do not indulge, or
   gratify our selves in any thing that stands in Opposition against, and
   comes into Competition with his Interest in the world, or ours in him,
   howsoever near and dear it may be unto us. But to deny our selves
   whatsoever is pleasing to our selves, if it be not so to God and Christ
   too, so as not to live to our selves, but only unto him that dyed for
   us, to live as those who are none of our own, but are bought with a
   Price, and therefore should glorify God both in our Souls and in our
   Bodies, which are his, 1 Cor. vi. 19, 20. But seeing this is not only
   the first Lesson to be learnt by Christ's Disciples, but that which is
   necessarily required in order to whatsoever else he commands from us, I
   shall shew you more particularly what it is in your selves that you are
   to deny.

   FIRST, you must deny your own Reasons in Matters of divine Revelation,
   so as to use them no farther than only to search into the Grounds and
   Motives that we have to believe them to be revealed by God. For this
   being either proved or supposed, we are not to suffer our Reasons to be
   too curious in searching into them, but believe them upon the Word and
   Testimony of God himself, who is the supreme Truth, or Verity itself.

   FOR we who by all our Art and Cunning cannot understand the reasons of
   the most common and obvious things in Nature, must not think to
   comprehend the great Mysteries of the Gospel, which tho' they be not
   contrary to our Reasons, are infinitely above them. For the natural Man
   received not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are Foolishness
   to him, neither can he know them because they are spiritually
   discerned, 1 Cor. ii. 14. So that to the understanding of the things of
   the Spirit, or which the Spirit of God hath resealed to us, there is a
   great deal more required than what we have by Nature, even the
   supernatural Assistance of the Spirit himself that revealed them. And
   therefore if any Man amongst us seemeth to be wise in this World, let
   him become a Fool that he may be wise, 1 Cor. iii. 18. that is, He that
   would be wise unto Salvation, must look upon himself as a Fool, as one
   incapable by Nature of understanding the things that belong unto his
   everlasting Peace, without both the Revelation and Assistance of God
   himself, and therefore must not rely upon his own Judgment, but only
   upon God's Testimony in what he doth believe; not believing what his
   Reason, but what God's Word tells him; looking upon it as reason enough
   why he should believe it, because God hath said it.

   I know this is an hard Doctrine to Flesh and Blood. For as Job tells
   us, Vain Man would be wise, though Man be born like a wild Ass's Colt,
   Job xi. 12. Though by nature we bee never so foolish, vain and
   ignorant; understanding the great Mysteries of the Gospel no more than
   a wild Ass's Colt doth a mathematical Demonstration, yet howsoever we
   would fain be thought very wise Men, yea so wise as to be able to
   comprehend Matters of the highest, yea of an infinite Nature, within
   the narrow compass of our finite and shallow Capacities. But this is
   that which we must deny our selves in, if we desire to be Christ's
   Disciples, so as to acquiesce in his Word, and believe what he asserts,
   only because he asserts it; without suffering our Reason to interpose,
   but looking upon his Word as more than all the Reasons and Arguments in
   the World besides.

   2. YOU must deny your own Wills. Our Wills, it is true, at first were
   made upright and perfect, every way correspondent to the Will of God
   himself, so as to will what he wills, that is what is really Good, and
   to nill what he nills, that is what is really Evil. But being now
   perverted, and corrupt with Sin, our Wills are naturally inclined to
   the Evil which they should he averse from and averse from the Good
   which they should be inclined to. So that instead of chusing the Good
   and refusing the Evil, we are generally apt to chuse the Evil and
   refuse the Good: Yet for all that our Wills are thus crooked and
   pervese, we cannot endure to have them crossed or thwarted in any
   thing, but would needs have our own Wills in every thing, so as neither
   to do any thing our selves, nor yet have any thing done to us, but just
   as our selves will, who Will usually just contrary to what we should.
   But now they that would be Christ's Disciples, must not be thus
   self-willed, but deny themselves the fulfilling of their own Wills,
   when it doth not consist with the Will of God to have them fulfilled.
   This our Lord and Master hath taught us by his Example as well as
   Precept, saying, Father, if thou be willing remove this Cup from me,
   nevertheless not my Will but thine be done, Luk. xxii. 42. Where we may
   observe that our blessed, Saviour, as Man, could not but have a natural
   Averseness from Death, as all Men by Nature have, and that without Sin.
   Yet though Christ's Will, as Man, was never so pure and perfect, yet he
   wholly submits it to the Will of God. he manifested indeed that it was
   the Will of that Nature which he had assumed, not to suffer Death,
   saying, if it is possible let this Cup pass from me, but he shews
   withal that the Will of Man must still be subject to the Will of God;
   and that Man, even as Man, must deny his own Will, whensoever it
   runneth not exactly parallel with God's, saying, nevertheless, not my
   Will but thine be done.

   AND if Christ himself denyed his own most pure and perfect Will, that
   his Father's might be accomplished, how much more Cause have we to deny
   our Wills, which by nature are always contrary to his Will, yea and to
   our own Good too, preferring generally that which is evil and
   destructive to us, before that which is truly good and advantageous for
   us? And verily a great part of true Christianity consisteth in thus
   resigning our Wills to God's, not minding so much which way our own
   Inclinations bend as what his Pleasure and Command is. A notable
   Instance whereof we have in old Eli, who questionless could not but be
   very willing that the Iniquity of his Sons might be forgiven, and his
   Family prosper in the World, yet howsoever when God had manifested his
   Pleasure to him, that his House should be destroyed, he submitted his
   own Will wholly unto God's, saying, It it the Lord, let him do what
   seemeth him good, 1 Sam. iii. 18. And whosoever of us would be Christ's
   Disciple indeed, must be sure thus to deny and renounce his own Will,
   whensoever it appears to be contrary unto God's, so as even to will,
   that not his own Will but God's be fulfilled, as our Lord and Master
   himself hath taught us each Day to pray, Thy Will done in Earth as it
   is in Heaven. And whosoever hath learn'd this Art of making his own
   Will bow and stoop to God's, hath made a very good Progress in the
   Christian Religion, especially in that part of it which requires us to
   deny our selves

   AND seeing we must deny our Wills, we must needs deny our Affections
   too, which are indeed nothing else but the several Motions of the Will
   towards Good and Evil, but usually they are so disorderly and
   irregular, as to place themselves upon Objects directly opposite to
   what they were designed for; so that we ordinarily love what we ought
   to hate, and hate what we ought to love; desire what we ought to abhor,
   and abhor what we ought to desire; rejoyce in those things which we
   ought to grieve for, and are grieved at such things as we ought to
   rejoyce in. So that if we suffer our Affections to move, according to
   their natural Tendency and corrupt Inclinations, we shall be so far
   from going after Christ, that we shall continually be running from him.
   And therefore it must be our great Care and Study to bridle our
   Affections, deny them their unlawful, and fix them upon their proper
   Objects; yea, and to deny our selves too the lawful use of such things
   as our Affections are apt to be unlawfully placed upon. As for Example:
   It is lawful, yea our Duty to love our Relations, but if our Love to
   them becomes exorbitant, so as to love them more than God, our Love to
   them must be turned into Hatred in Comparison of our Love to him, Luk.
   xiv. 26. And whatsoever lawful thing it is that we take Pleasure in, if
   once we find that our Pleasure in that extinguisheth, or but damps that
   Pleasure which we used, or ought to have in God, we are to deny our
   selves such Pleasures as these are, and rather displease our selves
   than God.

   YEA we must deny our selves moreover the Use and Enjoyment of our
   Estates and earthly Possessions, whensoever they come into Competition
   with his Glory. So that if it comes to that Point, that we must either
   leave our Estates to enjoy Christ, or leave Christ to enjoy our
   Estates; we must be willing and ready, without any more ado, to abandon
   and renounce whatsoever else we have, rather than our Interest in
   Christ. For indeed he is not worthy to be Christ's Disciple that doth
   not prefer him before all things else; neither he that loves the World
   at all in Comparison of Christ: For if any Man love the world, the love
   of the Father is not in him, 1 Joh. ii. 15. And therefore he that would
   be Christ's Disciple indeed, must fix his Heart so fast on Christ, that
   it hang loose and indifferent as to all things here below, being no
   more proud of them, no more delighted in them, no more concerned about
   them, than as if he had them not. So that though he have all things
   besides Christ, he must have nothing but him, or at least in Comparison
   of him; yea, be ready to part with all that he may gain Christ. And
   though many of us may think this an hard Saying, we may assure our
   selves, it is no more than what we must do, if we, desire to be
   Christ's Disciples;

   FURTHERMORE, we must deny our selves those Sins especially, and Lusts
   which we have or do still indulge our selves in, for thus the Gospel
   teacheth you in a particular manner, to deny ungodliness and worldly
   lusts, Tit. ii. 12. And therefore we in vain pretend to be true
   Christians, so long as we live in any one known Sip with any love unto
   it, or delight in it. I suppose none of my Readers guilty of all Sins,
   and I fear there are few but live in some. No Man but may be naturally
   averse from some Sins, but it is very rare to find one that is inclined
   to none; for ordinarily every Man hath his darling, his beloved Sin,
   his own Sin, as David himself once had, though he afterwards, kept
   himself from it, Psal. xviii. 23. So I fear none of my Readers but have
   some Sin, which he may in a peculiar manner call his own, as being that
   which his thoughts run most upon, and his desires are carried most
   unto, which he labours most after, and takes most pleasure in; which he
   is most loth, to be reproved for and most easily overcome by. Now this
   and whatsoever other Sins any of us are addicted to, we must wholly
   leave, and utterly renounce, if ever we desire to be Christ's
   Disciples. And therefore, so long as any of us live in any known Sin,
   as in Pride or Prodigality, in Oppression, or Covetousness, in Malice
   or Uncleanness, in Drunkenness, Uncharitableness, or any other Sin
   whatsoever, we must not think our selves to be Christians indeed,
   Christ will never own us for his Disciples, for so long as we live in
   any known Sin, it is that Sin, not Christ that is our Master, and
   therefore if we would list our selves into his Service, we must be sure
   to deny our selves whatsoever we know to be offensive to him.

   THERE is still another thing behind wherein we must deny our selves, if
   we desire to go after Christ, and that is, we must deny and renounce
   all our Self-righteousness, and all hopes and confidences from our
   selves, and from what we have done, which I look upon as a very great
   piece of Self-denyal, for naturally we are all prone to sacrifice to
   our own Nets, to burn incense to our own Drags, to boast of our own
   good Works, and to pride our selves with the conceit of our own
   Righteousness. Though we he never so sinful, we would not be thought to
   be so, but would very fain be accounted righteous, not only by Men, but
   by God himself, for something or other which our selves do, though when
   all comes to all, we know not what that should be; but howsoever the
   pride of our Hearts is such, that we are loth to go out of our selves
   to look for Righteousness, or to be beholden to another for it. And
   this is the reason that Justification by Faith in Christ hath had so
   many Adversaries in the World; Mankind in general being so much in love
   with themselves, and doting upon what themselves do, that they cannot
   endure to renounce and vilifie then own Obidience and good Works, so
   much as to think that they stand in need of any other Righteousness
   besides their own; as if their own Righteousness was so perfect, that
   God himself could find no fault with it, nor make any Exceptions
   against it, but must needs acknowledge them to be just and righteous
   Persons for it.

   WHEREAS, alas! there is not the best Action that ever a mere Mortal
   did, but if examined by the strict Rules of Justice, it is far from
   being good, yea so far, that God himself may justly pronounce it evil,
   and by consequence condemn the Person that did it, for doing of it. And
   therefore I cannot but wonder what it is that any Man doth or can do,
   for which he can in reason expect to be justified before God, our very
   Righteousness being as the Prophet tells, but as filthy rags, and our
   most holy Performances fraught With Sin and Imperfection, and therefore
   so far from justifying us, that we may justly be condemned for them;
   but this Mankind doth not love to hear of, the pride of our Hearts
   being such, that by all means we must have something in our selves
   whereof to glory before God himself. But wo be to that Person who hath
   no other Righteousness but his own, wherein to appear before the Judge
   of the whole World. For howsoever specious his Actions may seem to Men,
   they will be adjudged Sins before the eternal God.

   He therefore that would come to Christ, although he must labour after
   Righteousness to the utmost of his Power, yet when he hath done all, he
   must renounce it and look upon himself as an unprofitable Servant, For
   Christ came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance, Mat.
   ix. 13. that is, he came not to call such Persons as think they have
   Righteousness enough of their own to serve their turns, for such
   Persons think they have no need of him, and therefore it would be in
   vain to call them; but he calls Sinners, that is, such as may perhaps
   be as righteous as the other, but they do not think themselves to be
   so, but look upon themselves as undone for ever, unless they have
   something else to trust to, than their own good Works and Obedience to
   the Moral Law. Such Persons therefore Christ came to call, and if they
   come to him, they cannot but find Rest and Righteousness in him; and if
   any of us desire to go after Christ, so as to be his Disciples, we must
   be sure to look upon our selves as Sinners, as deserving nothing but
   Wrath and Vengeance for whatsoever we have done, we must renounce all
   our own Righteousness, and be so far from depending upon it, as to
   think that we have none to depend upon, for so really we have not. And
   when we have laid aside all thoughts of our own Righteousness, as to
   the matter of our Justification before God, then, and not till then,
   shall we be rightly qualified so embrace anothers, even that
   Righteousness which is by Faith in Christ. Thus St. Paul, though he had
   as much, yea more reason to trust in the Flesh or in himself than
   others; for himself saith, that as touching the righteousness which is
   of the law, he was blameless. Phil. iii. 6. Yet saith he, what things
   were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. Yea doubtless, and I
   count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ
   Jesus my Lord. For whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do
   count them but dung that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not
   having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is
   through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by
   faith, v. 7, 8, 9. Thus therefore it is that all those must do, who
   desire to be as St. Paul was, real Disciples of Jesus Christ, as we
   must forsake our Sins, so we must renounce our Righteousness too. It is
   true, this is a great and difficult part of Self-denyal, thus to deny
   our selves all that Pride, Pleasure and Confidence, which we used to
   take in the thoughts of our own Righteousness and Obedience to the Law
   of God. But we must remember that the first thing which our Saviour
   enjoins those that come after him, is to deny themselves.

   THUS I have shewn what it is in our selves that we must deny, and how
   it is that we must deny our selves, if we desire to go after Christ; we
   must deny our selves the curiosity of searching too much into the
   Mysteries of the Gospel, by the light of our own clouded Reasons, we
   must deny our Self-conceit, our Self-will, our Self-love,
   Self-interests, Self-confidences, and whatsoever proceeds from and
   terminates in our sensual and sinful selves, so as to have no delight
   in nor dependence upon our selves; yea, we must so deny our selves, as
   to be quite taken off of our former selves, and become other Creatures
   than what before we were. Thus St. Ambrose explains these words,
   saying, Seipsum sibi homo abneget & totus mutetur, Let a Man deny
   himself to himself, so as to be wholly changed from what he was. But
   then you'll say, what need is there of all this trouble, what reason
   can be given that a Man must deny himself before he can be a true
   Christian.

   TO that I answer, it is reason enough that Christ hath commanded us to
   do it, and surely he best knows whom he will accept of as his
   Disciples, and what is necessary to be done in order to our being so.
   And he hath said in plain terms, If any man will come after me, let him
   deny himself, implying, that he that doth not deny himself, cannot go
   after him.

   BUT before that, there is an impossibility in the thing it self, that
   any one should be a true Christian, or go after Christ, and, not deny
   himself, as may be easily perceived, if we will but consider what true
   Christianity requires of us, and what it is to be a real Christian. A
   true Christian we know is one that lives by Faith, and not by Sight,
   that looks not at the things which are seen, but at those things which
   are not seen, that believes whatsoever Christ hath said, trusteth on
   whatsoever he hath promised, and obeyeth whatsoever he hath commanded,
   that receiveth Christ as his only Priest to make atonement for him, as
   his only Prophet to instruct, and as his only Lord and Master to rule
   and govern him. In a word, a Christian is one that gives up himself and
   all he hath to Christ, who gave himself and all he hath to him; and
   therefore the very notion of true Christianity implies and supposes the
   denyal of our selves, without which it is as impossible for a Man to be
   a Christian, as it is for a Subject to be rebellious and loyal to his
   Prince at the same time; and therefore it is absolutely necessary that
   we go out of our selves before we can go to him, we must strip our
   selves of our very selves before we can put on Christ, for Christ
   himself hath told us, that No man can serve two masters, for either he
   hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and
   despise the other, Mat. vi. 24. We cannot serve both God and Mammon,
   Christ and our selves too; so that we must either deny our selves to go
   after Christ, or else deny Christ to go after our selves, so as to mind
   our own selfish ends and designs in the World.

   WHEREFORE I hope I need not use any other Arguments to persuade any to
   deny themselves in the sense already explained; I dare say there is
   none amongst us but would willingly be what we profess, even a real
   Christian, and so go after Christ here, as to come to him hereafter.
   But we have now seen how Christ himself hath told us, that we must deny
   our selves, if we desire to serve and enjoy him. And verily it is an
   hard case it we cannot deny our selves for him, who so far denied
   himself for us, as to lay down his own Life to redeem ours. He who was
   equal to God himself, yea who himself was the true God, so far denied
   himself as to become Man, yea, A man of sorrows and acquainted with
   griefs, for us, and cannot we deny our selves so much as a Fancy, a
   Conceit, a Sin or Lust for him? How then can we expect that he should
   own us for his Friends, his Servants or Disciples? No, he'll never do
   it, neither can we in reason expect that he should give himself and all
   the Merits of his Death and Passion unto us, so long as we think much
   to give our selves to him, or to deny our selves for him. And therefore
   if we desire to be made Partakers of all those glorious things that he
   hath purchased with his own most precious Blood for the Sons of Men;
   let us begin here, indulge our Flesh no longer, but deny our selves
   whatsoever God hath been pleased to forbid. And for that end, let us
   endeavour each Day more and more to live above our selves, above the
   temper of our Bodies, and above the allurements of the World, live as
   those who believe and profess that they are none of their own, but
   Christ's, his by Creation, it was he that made us, his by Preservation,
   it is he that maintains us, and his by Redemption, it is he that hath
   purchased and redeemed us with his own Blood. And therefore let us deny
   our selves for the future to our very selves, whose we are not, and
   devote our selves to him whose alone we are; by this we shall manifest
   our selves to be Christ's Disciples indeed, especially if we do not
   only deny our selves, but also take up our Cross and follow him; which
   brings me to the second thing which our blessed Saviour here requires
   of those who would go after him, even to take up their Cross.

   WHERE, by the Cross, we are m understand whatsoever Troubles or
   Calamities, inward or outward, we meet with in the performance of our
   Duty to God or Man, which they that would go after Christ must take up
   as they go along, without any more ado, neither repining at them, nor
   sinking under them; for we must not think that Christ invites us into
   an earthly Paradise of Idleness and outward Pleasures, as if we had
   nothing to do or suffer for him. For even as Men, we cannot but find
   many Crosses in the World, but as Christians we must expect more, for
   Christ himself hath told us, that in the World we shall have
   Tribulation, John xvi. 33. And therefore whatsoever we meet with, is no
   more than what we are to look for; especially if we walk uprightly in
   the way that leads to Heaven, we cannot but expect to meet with many a
   rub, for God himself hath told us that it is through many tribulation
   that we must enter into the kingdom of heaven, Act. xiv. 22. And
   therefore we must not think to be carried up to Heaven with the breath
   of popular Applause, nor to swim through a deluge of carnal Pleasures
   into the haven of everlasting Happiness. No, we must look to be tossed
   to and fro in this World, as in a raging and tempestuous Ocean, and
   never look for perpetual Calmness and Tranquillity, until we are got
   above the Clouds, yea even above the Sun and Stars themselves. This
   World was always a World of trouble, and ever will be, its very
   Friends, and they that have their Portion here, can find no quiet nor
   satisfaction in it; but the Diciples of Christ they are not of this
   world, as Christ himself tells us, John xvii. 4. And therefore no
   wonder if the World frowns more upon them than others. The way they
   walk in is opposite to the World, it is enmity it self to the Flesh,
   and therefore no wonder if they meet with so much Enmity and Opposition
   here; the way wherein they go after Christ is a cross way, it is cross
   to Sin, cross to Satan, cross to the World, cross to our very selves as
   we are by Nature, and by consequence cross to all Men in the World but
   Christ's Disciples, and therefore it is no wonder they meet with so
   many crosses in it. But howsoever, if we desire to go after Christ, he
   hath told us before hand what we must expect, as he hath born the Cross
   before us, he expects that we now bear it after him; yea we must not
   only bear it, but take it up too: Not that we should run our selves
   into danger, but that we should baulk no Duty to avoid it, so as to be
   willing and ready to undergo the greatest suffering, rather than to
   commit the least Sin, and to run the greatest danger rather than
   neglect the smallest Duty. If whilst we are walking in the narrow path
   of Holiness, there happens to lie a Cross in the way, we must not go on
   one side nor on the other side of it out of the path we walk in,
   neither must we kick and spurn at it, but we must patiently take it up
   and carry it along with us; if it be a little heavy at first, it will
   soon grow lighter, and not at all hinder, but rather further our
   progress towards Heaven.

   BUT here we must have a great care to understand our Saviour's meaning,
   and so our own Duty aright; for we must not think that every trouble we
   meet with in the World is the Cross of Christ, for we may suffer for
   our fancy or humour, or perhaps for our Sin and Transgression of the
   Laws of God or Men, and if so, it is our own Cross, not Christ's which
   we take upon us; we may thank our selves for it, I am sure Christ hath
   no cause to thank us: For this is thankworthy, saith the Apostle, if a
   man for conscience towards God, endure grief, suffering wrongfully, 1
   Pet. ii. 19, 20. And therefore the Duty which our Saviour here imposeth
   on us, in few terms is this, that we be ready not only to do, but to
   suffer what we can for the glory of God and the furtherance of the
   Gospel, and that we omit no Duty, nor commit any Sin for fear of
   suffering; not to think much of any trouble that befals us for Christ's
   sake, but rather to rejoice at it, even as the Apostles rejoiced, that
   they were accounted worthy to suffer shame for his name, Act. v. 41.
   Which was a clear instance of their performing the Duty here enjoined
   both them and us, under the name of taking up our Cross.

   AND I hope there is none of us can take it ill that Christ hath imposed
   so severe a Duty upon us; for we may assure our selves he requires no
   more of us than what himself hath undergone before, so that we can
   suffer nothing for him, but what he hath suffered before for us. Have
   we grief and trouble in our Hearts? so had he, Mat. xxvi. 38. Have we
   pains and tortures in our Bodies? so had he, Mat. xxvii. 29, 30. Are we
   derided and scoffed at? so was he, Mat. xxvii. 31. Are we arraigned or
   condemned, yea do we suffer death it self? it is no more than what our
   Lord and Master hath done before. And let us remember what he told us
   when he was upon the Earth, The disciple is not above his master, nor
   the fervent above his lord, Mat. x. 24. If we be Christ's Disciples, we
   cannot expect to fare better in the World than Christ himself did,
   neither indeed can we fare so bad; for it is impossible that we should
   undergo so much for him as he hath undergone for us, ours being only
   the Sufferings of Men, his the Sufferings of one who was God as well as
   Man, whereby Sufferings in general are sanctified to our human nature,
   it having already undergone them in the Person of the Son of God, so
   that it can be now no disparagement at all to undergo any trouble, as
   hatred, reproach, poverty, pain, yea death it self, or any other
   Calamity whatsoever in this World, seeing the Son of God himself, he
   that made the World, underwent the same while himself was in it. And
   therefore we need not think it below us to stoop down and take up the
   Cross of Christ, as considering that Christ having born it before us,
   hath so blessed and sanctified it unto us; that it is now become an
   honourable, an advantageous, yea and a pleasant Cross, to them that
   bear it patiently, thankfully and constantly as they ought to do,
   especially seeing it is such a Cross as leads unto a Crown; and
   whatsoever we can do or suffer for Christ here, will be fully
   recompenced with Glory hereafter, and therefore instead of being
   troubled to take up our Cross, we are rather to rejoice that we have
   any to take up.

   THUS we see in few words what it is which our Saviour commands from us
   when he enjoins us to deny our selves, and take up our Cross, even that
   we do not gratifie our selves in any thing that is ungrateful unto him,
   nor grudge to take up any Cross, or suffer any trouble we meet with in
   the World for his sake, thinking nothing too dear to forsake, nor any
   thing too heavy to bear for him, who thought not his own Life too dear,
   nor the Cross it self too heavy to bear for us; what now remains, but
   that knowing our Saviour's pleasure, we should all resolve to do it.
   There is none of us but hope and desire to be saved by him, but that we
   can never be, unless we observe what he hath prescribed in order to our
   Salvation: And amongst other things, we see how he hath commanded us,
   to deny our selves, and take up our Cross; as any of us therefore
   desires to be Christians indeed, so as to see Christ's face with
   comfort in another World, let us bethink our selves seriously what Sins
   we have hitherto indulged our selves in; I fear there are but few, if
   any amongst us, but are conscious to themselves, that they have and do
   still live, either in the constant neglect of some known Duty, or else
   in the frequent commission of same beloved Sin; what that is, I dare
   not undertake to tell, but leave that to God and to Mens own
   Consciences; only I desire them to deal faithfully with their own
   Souls, and not suffer themselves to be fooled into a fond and vain
   persuasion that they have any interest in Christ, or are truly his
   Disciples, until they deny themselves that Sin, whatsoever it is, which
   they have hitherto indulged themselves in. And let us not think that we
   shall deny one selves any real pleasure or profit, by renouncing our
   Sins; for what pleasure can we have in displeasing God, or profit in
   losing our own Souls? No, we shall gratifie our selves more than we can
   imagine, by denying our selves as much as we are able, whatsoever is
   offensive or displeasing unto God; for we may be sure, he that came
   into the World on purpose to save us from evil, commands us nothing but
   for our own good, neither would he ever have oblig'd us to deny our
   selves, if we could have been saved without it, and as for the Cross
   that he was so well acquainted with, that he would never have imposed
   it upon us to take it up, but that it is indispensably necessary for
   us. And therefore if we be what we pretend, real and true Christians,
   let us manifest it to the World and to our own Consciences, by denying
   our selves whatsoever Christ hath denied us, and by observing
   whatsoever he hath commanded us, even to the taking up of any Cross,
   that he for his own sake shall suffer to be laid upon us, still
   remembring, that Self-denyal, though it be unpleasant, is a most
   necessary Duty; and the Cross, though it be never so heavy, it is but
   short, and hath nothing less than a Crown annexed unto it, a glorious
   and eternal Crown, which all those shall most certainly obtain, who
   deny themselves.

              Thoughts upon Striving to enter at the strait Gate.

   AS certainly as we are here now, it is not long but we shall all be in
   another World, either in a World of Happiness, or else in a World of
   Misery, or if you will, either in Heaven or in Hell. For these are the
   two only places which all Mankind from the beginning of the World to
   the end of it, must live in for evermore, some in the one, some in the
   other, according to their carriage and behaviour here; and therefore it
   is worth the while to take a view and prospect now and then of both
   these places, and it will not be amiss if we do it now; for which end,
   I desire the Reader in his serious and composed Thoughts to attend me
   first into the celestial Mansions, above yonder glorious Sun and the
   Stars themselves, where not only the Cherubins and Seraphins, Angels
   and Archangels, but many also of our Brethren, the Sons of Men, at this
   very moment are enjoying the Presence, and singing forth the Praises of
   the most high God. There are the Spirits of just Men made perfect,
   perfect in themselves, and perfect in all their Actions, perfectly free
   from all both Sin and and Misery, perfectly full of all true Grace and
   Glory, all their Faculties being reduced to that most perfect and
   excellent frame and constitution, that their Understandings are
   continually taken up with the contemplations of the supreme Truth, and
   their wills in the embracement of the chiefest Good; so that all the
   Inclinations of their Souls rest in God as in their proper Centre, in
   whom by consequence they enjoy as much at they can desire, yea as much
   as they can be made capable of desiring. For all those infinite
   Perfections that are concentred in God himself, are now in their
   possession, to solace and delight themselves in the full and perfect
   enjoyment of them; by which means they are as happy as God himself can
   make them, insomuch that at this very moment methinks we may all behold
   them so ravished, so transported with their celestial Joys, that it may
   justly strike us into admiration, how ever Creatures which once were
   sinful, could be made so pure, so perfect, and altogether so happy as
   they are. And could we but leave our Bodies for a while below, and go
   up to take a turn in the new Jerusalem that is above, we could not but
   be ravish'd and transported at the very sight both of the Place and
   Inhabitants, every one being far more glorious than the greatest
   Emperors of this World, with nothing less than Crowns of Glory on their
   Heads, and Scepters of Righteousness in their Hands, where they think
   of nothing but of the Glory of God, discourse of nothing but praising
   him, do nothing but adore and worship him; in a word, whatsoever is
   agreeable to our Natures, whatsoever is desirable to our Souls,
   whatsoever can any way conduce to make Men happy, is fully, perfectly,
   eternally enjoyed, by all and every Person that is in Heaven. Whereas
   on the other side, if we bring down our thoughts from Heaven, and send
   them as low as Hell, to consider the most deplorable estate and
   condition of those who inhabit the Regions of Darkness, them we shall
   find as miserable as the other are happy; not only in that they are
   deprived of the Vision and fruition of the chiefest good, but likewise
   in that they are in continual pain and torment, as great as infinite
   Justice can adjudge them to, and infinite Power inflict upon them;
   insomuch, that could we lay our Ear to the entrance of that bottomless
   Pit, what howlings and shriekings should we hear, what weeping and
   wailing and gnashing of teeth in the midst of those infernal Flames,
   where, as our Saviour himself tells us, The worm dieth not, and the
   fire is not quenched, Mar. ix. 44. That is, where their Consciences are
   always gnawed and tormented with the remembrance of their former Sins,
   and the Fire of God's Wrath is continually burning in them, never to be
   quenched or abated. For certainly as the smiles and favour of the
   eternal God, constitute the Joys of Heaven, so do his frowns and anger
   make up the Flames of Hell. To see him that made us displeased with us,
   to see Mercy it self to frown upon us, to see the great and
   all-glorious Creator of the World, the chiefest Good to look angrily
   upon us, and to mean himself offended at us, and incensed against us!
   Methinks the very thoughts of it are sufficient to make the stoutest
   Heart amongst us tremble: But then what shall we think of those poor
   Souls that see and feel it? What shall we think of them? Questionless
   they are more miserable than we are able to think them to be. For we
   cannot possibly conceive either the greatness of Heavens Glory, or the
   sharpness of Hell Torments, only this we know, and may be certain of,
   that whatsoever is ungrateful to their Minds, whatsoever is troublesome
   to their Thoughts, whatsoever is contrary to their Desires, whatsoever
   is painful to their Bodies, or whatsoever is or can be destructive and
   tormenting to their Souls, that all they who are once in Hell, shall
   fear and feel that for ever.

   BUT this is too sad and doleful a Subject to insist on long, neither
   should I have mentioned it, but for our own Good; and to prepare us the
   better, both for the understanding and improving the Advice of out
   Saviour, Matth. vii. 13, 14. Enter ye in at the streight Gate, &c. The
   meaning of which Words, in brief, may be reduced to these three Heads.

   FIRST, that it is an easy matter to go to Hell, that Place of Torments
   we have now been describing, and by Consequence that many go thither;
   for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leadeth thither.

   SECONDLY, that it is a hard and difficult thing to get to Heaven, that
   Place of Joys we before spake of, and by Consequence that but few get
   thither, For strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leadeth to
   it.

   LASTLY, howsoever difficult it is, our Saviour would have us strive to
   get to Heaven, so as to press through that strait gate, and walk in
   that narrow way that leadeth into life.

   AS for the first, that the gate is wide, and the way broad, that leads
   to Hell, or that it is an easy matter to go thither, I need not use
   many Words to prove it. For though there be but few that mind it, dare
   say there is scarce any one but believes it, yea and hath oftentimes
   found it too true by Experience, even that it is an easy matter to sin,
   and that, we know, is the broad way that leads to Hell; so broad, that
   they that walk in it can find no Bounds or Limits in it, wherewithin to
   contain themselves; neither are they ever out of their way, but go
   which way they will, they are still in the ready way to Ruine and
   Destruction. And usually it is as plain as broad, so that Men rarely
   meet with any Roughness or Trouble in it, but rather with all the
   Pleasures and Delights which they desire, who look no higher than to
   please the Flesh; yea whatsoever it is that they naturally desire, they
   still meet with it in the Road to Hell; and whatsoever is ungrateful
   irksome to them, they are never troubled with it in the ways of Sin.
   There are no Crosses to be taken up, no self to be denyed; but rather
   indulged and gratifyed; there are no such tedious and troublesome
   things as examining our Hearts, and mortifying our Lusts, as praying or
   hearing, as fasting or watching: These are only to be found in the
   narrow Path that leads to Heaven, the broad way to Hell is altogether
   unacquainted with them, being strewed all along with carnal Pleasures
   and sensual Delights, with popular Applause, and earthly Riches, and
   such fine things as silly Mortals use to be taken with.

   AND hence it is, that as our Saviour tells us, many there be which find
   this way, and go in at this wide Gate that leads to Ruin, because they
   see not whither it leads, but they see the Baits and Allurements which
   are in it, which they cannot but crowd about as Fishes about the Hook,
   or as Flies about a Candle, till they be destroyed. Yea, this way to
   Destruction is so broad, that almost all the World is continually
   walking in it; the Gate so wide that thousands at a time pass through
   it. And therefore we may well conclude it is an easy thing to go to
   that Place of Torments which even now we spake of, or rather that it is
   an hard, a difficult matter to keep out of it; the way being so narrow
   that carries from it that it is a difficult thing to find it, and the
   way so broad that leads unto it that none can miss of it that hath but
   a mind to walk in it.

   BUT I hope none of my Readers have so, God forbid they should have a
   mind to go to Hell; their taking religious Books into their Hands is
   rather an Argument that they have a mind to go to Heaven, and read on
   purpose to learn the way thither. And we do well to take all
   Opportunities of finding out the way to Bliss; for we may assure our
   selves it is a very narrow one, it is hard to find it out, but touch
   more hard to walk in it; for it is a way very rarely trodden, so that
   there is scarce any Path to be seen, most People going either on one
   side, or else on the other side of it; some running into the By-paths
   of Error, Heresy, or Schism, others into the broad way of Profaneness
   or Security: Insomuch that there are but very few that hit upon the
   right Path that leads directly to the New Hierusalem, the Place of
   rest. I speak not this of my self; no, Christ himself, that came from
   Heaven to Earth, on purpose to shew us the way from Earth to Heaven,
   saith, That strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto
   life, and few there be that find it.

   AND let not any think that Christ spoke these Words in vain, or that it
   is no great matter whether we believe what he said or no. For
   questionless, one great Reason why so few ever come to Heaven, is
   because most think it so easy to get thither that they need not take
   any Care or Pains about it. For even amongst our selves, to whom the
   Gospel is so clearly revealed, Men generally think if they do but read
   the Scriptures, and hear Sermons, and live honestly with their
   Neighbours so as to harm no body, but pay every one their own, then
   they shall as surely come to Heaven as if they were there already; nay,
   many are so simple as to think that their Separation from the Church
   Militant on Earth is the way to bring them to the Church Triumphant in
   Heaven; and others so ridiculous as to believe that a Death-bed
   Repentance is sufficient to entitle them to eternal Life. But stay a
   while: It is not so easy a matter to get to Heaven. Indeed to me it
   seems one of the greatest Mysteries in the World, that ever any Man or
   Woman should come thither, that such sinful Worms as we are, who are
   born in Sin, and live so long in Sin and Rebellion against the great
   Creator of the World, should ever be received so far into his Grace and
   Favour as to enjoy Life and eternal Happiness in him. And did we look
   no farther than our selves, we might justly despair of ever obtaining
   so transcendent Glory which we are so altogether unworthy of. But the
   Goodness of God both is and hath been so great to Mankind, that there
   is none of us but in and through the Merits of Christ Jesus, is in a
   Capacity of it. But we must not think that it is so easy a thing to
   come to Heaven, as the Devil, the World, and our own base Hearts, would
   persuade us it is: if we do, we are never likely to come thither; no,
   we may assure our selves, as Heaven is the greatest Good that we can
   attain, so doth it require our greatest Care and Study imaginable to
   attain it.

   THIS therefore is that which I shall endeavour to convince Men of, and
   account my self happy if I can do it. For, I dare say, there is none of
   us but desire to see Christ in Glory, and to be happy with him and in
   him for ever; but that we can never be, unless we do whatsoever is
   required of us in order to it; and if we think it is so easy a matter
   to do whatsoever is required of us, I have just Cause to suspect that
   we never yet made tryal of it, nor set our selves seriously upon the
   Performance of those Duties which are enjoyned us here in Reference to
   our being happy for ever. For if we have set upon it in good earnest,
   we cannot but have found it very hard and difficult, by reason of our
   natural averseness from what is Good, and inclinations unto Evil. For
   we all know, that without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord, Heb. xii.
   14. So that Holiness is the way, the direct and only way that leads to
   Heaven neither is there any way imaginable of being happy hereafter but
   by being holy here. And though it be an easy thing to profess Holiness,
   and to perform some external Acts of it; yet to be truly pious and holy
   indeed, so as we must be if ever we would go to Heaven, this is every
   whit as difficult as the other is easy.

   FOR, first, I suppose, all will grant that he is not truly holy that
   lives in any known Sin, as the Apostle also intimates, saying, He that
   is born of God doth not commit sin, 1 Joh. iii. 9. And therefore he
   that still indulgeth himself in the Commission of any known Sin, he is
   not yet regenerate or born of God, he is not truly holy. So that to our
   being so holy here, as that we may be happy hereafter, it is absolutely
   and indispensably necessary that we forsake and avoid to the utmost of
   our Power whatsoever is offensive unto God and contrary to his Laws.
   But it is as difficult as it is necessary to forsake Sin as we ought to
   do. It is an easy matter, I confess, to rail at Sin, to backbite
   others, or blame our selves for it. But that is not the Business; but
   to loath our Sins as much as ever we loved them, to abhor as much as
   ever we desired them, and to be as much averse from them as ever we
   were inclined to them, to forsake Sin as Sin, and by consequence all
   Sin whatsoever, one as well as another; so as to deny our selves all
   that Pleasure we were wont to take in any Sin, and all that seeming
   Profit which we used to receive by it, and that too, out of love to God
   and fear of his Displeasure. This is to forsake Sin indeed, but it is
   sooner spoken of than done; and it requires a great deal of time and
   skill, and pains to get so great a Conquest over our selves as this is,
   to cut off our Right Hand, pluck out our Right Eye, and cast it from
   us; even renounce and forsake those very beloved and darling Sins,
   which the Temper and Constitution of our Bodies, the Corruption of our
   Hearts, and constant Custom and Practice hath made in a manner natural
   to us. So that our very Natures must be changed, before we can ever
   leave them. And therefore it must needs be a matter of as great
   Difficulty as it is of Moment, to master and subdue those Sins and
   Lusts that have been long predominant in us, which I dare say many of
   us have found by their own sad and woful Experience, having struggled
   perhaps many Years against some Corruption, and yet to this Day have
   not got it under, nor totally subdued it. And it is such, and such
   alone, who are competent Judges in this Case; for they that never
   strove against their Sins, cannot know how strong they are, nor how
   hard it is to conquer them. And therefore it is to those who have made
   it their Business to destroy and mortify their Lusts, that I appeal,
   Whether it be not hard to do it. I am confident they cannot but have
   found it, and therefore must needs acknowledge it to be so; and by
   Consequence that it is no easy matter to get to Heaven, seeing it is so
   hard to keep out of Hell, and to avoid those Sins which otherwise will
   certainly bring us thither; every Sin unrepented of having eternal
   Punisment entailed upon it.

   AND if it be so hard to forsake Sin, how difficult must it needs be to
   perform all those Duties, and to exert all those Graces which are
   necessarily required, in order to our attaining everlasting Happiness.
   It is true, praying and hearing, which are the ordinary means for the
   obtaining true Grace and Holiness, are Duties very common and customary
   amongst us, but they are never the easier because they are common, but
   rather far more difficult. For we being accustomed to a careless and
   perfunctory performing these Duties, cannot but find it an hard and
   difficult matter to keep our Hearts so close unto them, as to perform
   them as we ought to do, and so as that we may be really said to do
   them. For we must not think that fitting at Church while the word of
   God is preached, is hearing the word of God, or that being prefect
   there whilst Prayers are read, is real praying. No, no, there is a
   great deal more required than this to our praying to the great God
   aright; insomuch that for mine own part, I really think that Prayer, as
   it is the highest, so is it the hardest Duty that we can be engaged in.
   All the faculties of our Souls, as well as members of our Bodies, being
   obliged to put forth themselves in their several Capacities, to the due
   performance of it.

   AND as for those several Graces and Virtues which our Souls must be
   adorned withal, before ever they can come to Heaven, though it be easie
   to talk of them, it is not so to act them, I shall instance only in
   some few; as to love God above all things, and other things only for
   God's sake, to hope on nothing but God's Promises, and to fear nothing
   but his Displeasure; to love other Mens Persons, so as to hate their
   Vices, and so to hate their Vices as still to love their Persons; not
   to covet Riches when we have them not, nor trust on them when we have
   them; to deny our selves that we may please God, and to take up our
   Cross that we may follow Christ; to live above the World whilst we are
   in it, and to despise it while we use it; to be always upon our watch
   and guard, strictly observing not only the outward Actions of our Life,
   but the inward Motions of our Hearts; to hate those very Sins which we
   used to love, and to love those very Duties which we used to hate; to
   chuse the greatest Affliction before the least Sin, and to neglect the
   getting of the greatest gain, rather than the performing of the
   smallest Duty; to believe Truths which we cannot comprehend, merely
   upon the testimony of one whom we never saw; to submit our wills to
   God's, and delight out selves in obeying him; to be patient under
   sufferings, and thankful for all the troubles we meet with here below;
   to be ready and willing to do or suffer any thing we can for him, who
   hath done and suffered so much for us, to cloath the naked, feed the
   hungry, relieve the indigent, and rescue the oppressed to the utmost of
   our power: In a word, to be every way as pious towards God, as obedient
   to Christ, as loyal to our Prince, as faithful to our Friends, as
   loving to our Enemies, as charitable to the Poor, as just in our
   Dealings, as eminent in all true Grace and Virtue, as if we were to be
   saved by it, and yet have no confidence in it, but still look upon our
   selves as unprofitable Servants, and depend upon Christ; and and Christ
   alone for Pardon and Salvation.

   I suppose I need not tell any one that it is hard and difficult to
   perform such Duties, and to act such Graces as these are; but this let
   me tell the Reader, that how hard, how difficult soever it is, it must
   be done if ever we desire to come to Heaven, and by consequence it is
   no easie matter to come thither. Seeing therefore the way that leads to
   Heaven is thus narrow, and hard, it is no wonder that there are but few
   that walk in it, or indeed that find it out, as our Saviour himself
   assures us; for People generally love to swim with the Stream, to run
   with the Multitude, though it be into the Gulph of Sin and Misery. It
   is very rare to find one walking in the narrow way, and keeping himself
   within those bounds and limits wherewith it is enclosed; and this seems
   to have been the occasion of these words the Gospel of St. Luke, where
   one said unto Christ, Lord, are there few that be saved? and our
   Saviour answered in these words, Strive to enter in at the strait Gate.
   For many I say unto you will seek to enter in, and shall not be able,
   Luk. xiii. 23, 24. Intimating not only that there are but few that
   shall be saved, but likewise that many of those that seek to be saved
   shall not attain it; not as if any of those who really and cordially
   made it their business to look after Heaven, can never miss of it; but
   that many of those who presuming upon their seeming Obedience and good
   Works, shall think and seek that way to enter into the Kingdom of God,
   shall not be able. For many will say unto me at that Day, saith he,
   Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast
   out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then I will
   profess unto them, I never knew you, Depart from me ye that work
   iniquity, Mat. vii. 22, 23. And if many of those who are great
   Professors of Religion, and make a plausible shew of Piety in the
   World, than notwithstanding come short of eternal Happiness, and if of
   those many which are called there are but few chosen, Mat. xx. 16. we
   may well conclude there are but few, but very few indeed that walk in
   the narrow path that leads to Life, in comparison of those innumerable
   multitudes that continually flock together in the broad way that leads
   to Ruin and Destruction. One great reason whereof is because Men
   generally, though they desire to go to Heaven, yet will not believe it
   to be so hard a thing as really it is, to get thither and therefore
   setting aside the superficial performance of some few external Duties,
   they give themselves no trouble, nor take any pains about it; as if
   Heaven was so contemptible a thing, that it is not worth their while to
   look after it; or howsoever, as if it was so easie a thing to attain
   it, that they cannot miss of it whether they look after it or no.
   Whereas questionless, as Heaven is the greatest Happiness that we are
   capable of, so is it the hardest matter in the World for any of us to
   attain it.

   I say not this to discourage any one, bur rather to excite and
   encourage all to a greater care and diligence in the prosecution of
   eternal Happiness, than ordinarily Men seem to have. It is my hearty
   Desire and Prayer that every Soul among us may live and be happy for
   ever; but that we can never be, unless we be serious, earnest and
   constant in looking after it, more than after all things in the World
   besides. And therefore it is that I have endeavoured to convince Men
   that it is not so easie a thing as they seem to make it to go to
   Heaven, the Path being so exceeding narrow that leads unto it: Which 1
   hope by this time we are all persuaded of, so as to be resolved within
   our selves to play no longer with Religion, but to set upon it in good
   earnest, so as to make it not only our great but our only business and
   design in this World, to prepare for another, and to work out our
   Salvation with fear and trembling, and by consequence to walk in that
   narrow way of true Piety and Virtue that leads to Heaven, without going
   aside into the Vices on either hand, or howsoever to use the utmost of
   our endeavour to observe the Rules which Christ hath prescribed us, in
   order to our living with him for ever. And oh that I knew what Words to
   take unto my self, and what Arguments to use, whereby to prevail with
   every Soul of us, to make it our business to get to Heaven; and by
   consequence to walk directly in the narrow way, and through the strait
   Gate that leads unto it. What influence or effect they may have upon
   the Readers, I know not, howsoever I shall endeavour to present them
   with some such Considerations, as I hope by the blessing of God, and
   the Assistance of his Grace, may be so forcible and prevalent upon
   them, if seriously. weighed, that they should not methinks be able to
   resist them.

   LET us consider therefore in the first place, that though it be never
   so hard to get to Heaven, yet it is possible; and tho' there be but few
   that come thither, yet there are some; and why may not you and I be in
   the number of those few as well as others? There are many perfect and
   most glorious Saints in Heaven at this moment, which once were sinful
   Creatures upon Earth as we now are; but it seems the way thither was
   not so narrow but they could walk in it, nor the Gate so strait but
   they could pass through it, and why may not we as well as they? We have
   the same Natures whereby we are capable of Happiness as they had, we
   have the same Scriptures to direct us to it as they had, we have the
   same Promises of Assistance as they had, we have the same Saviour as
   they had, and why then may not we get to the same place where they are?
   Is the Way more narrow, and the Gate more strait to us than it was to
   them? No surely, it is every way the same, why then should we despair
   of ever attaining everlasting Glory, seeing we are as capable of it as
   any one who hath yet attained it: It is true, if no mortal Men had ever
   got to Heaven, or God had said none should e'er come thither, then
   indeed it would be in vain for us to expect it, or to use any means to
   attain unto, it; but seeing many of our Brethren are already there, and
   many more will follow after them, and we are as capable of coming to
   them as any other, the straitness of the Gate, the narrowness of the
   Way, or the difficulty of getting thither, should never discourage us
   from endeavouring after it, go more than it did them, but rather make
   us the more diligent in the prosecution of it: Especially considering
   in the next place, that we are not only as yet in a capacity of getting
   to Heaven, but we are all invited thither, and that by God himself; for
   he would have all Men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of
   the truth, 1 Tim. ii. 4. Yea, he hath sworn by himself, saying, As I
   live saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but
   rather that the wicked turn from his way and live; and therefore calls
   upon us all, Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die,
   O house of Israel? Ezek. xxxiii. 11. Hence it is that he sent his
   Prophets to invite us, Ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the
   waters, Isa. lv. 1. Yea he came down in his own Person to Earth, on
   purpose to invite us to Heaven, and to direct us the way thither, Come
   to me, saith he, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will
   give you rest, Mat. xi. 29. For God so loved the world, that he gave
   his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
   perish, but have everlasting life, Joh. iii. 16. Whence we may observe,
   that there is no exceptions made against any Person whatsoever, nor by
   consequence against any of us. It is the will, yea and command of God
   too, that we all turn from our evil ways and live, and that every Soul
   amongst us walk in that narrow way that leads unto eternal Bliss; and
   therefore if any of us do perish, Our blood will be upon our own heads,
   our destruction is from our selves, Hos. xiii. 9. For it is nothing but
   the perverseness of our own Wills, and the hardness, pride and
   obstinacy of our own Hearts, that can keep any Soul of us out of
   Heaven, howsoever difficult it is to come thither. For God hath shewn
   how desirous he is to have our Company there, in that he is still
   pleased to grant us both the space and means of Repentance. If he had
   no mind to have us saved, he could have shut us up long ago in Hell;
   but he is so far from that, that he doth not only as yet continue our
   abode on Earth, and lengthen our Tranquillity here, but he still
   vouchsafes unto us whatsoever is necessary, yea whatsoever can any ways
   conduce to our eternal Happiness; we have his Scriptures, we have his
   Sabbaths, we have his Ordinances, we have his Sacraments, we have his
   Ministers, we have the promise of his Spirit, we have the overtures of
   Christ, and of all the merits of his Death and Passion made unto us,
   and what can be desired more to make Men happy? And yet as if all this
   had not been enough, he still continues calling upon us, exhorting,
   commanding, yea and beseeching us most affectionately to turn that our
   Souls may live; for we his Ministers, are Embassadors to Mankind for
   Christ, as though God did beseech you by us; We pray you in Christ's
   stead to be reconciled to God, 2 Cor. v. 20. And he hath sent me unto
   you that read this in a particular manner at this time, to call you
   back out of the broad way that leads to Death, into the narrow way that
   leads to Life and Happiness; In his name therefore I exhort, yea and
   beseech you by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a
   living sacrifice, holy acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable
   service, Rom. xii. 1. Strive to enter in at the strait gate, and never
   leave until you have got possession of eternal Glory.

   NOR let us be discouraged at any difficulties that we meet with in the
   way, for they will soon be over howsoever hard and difficult any Duty
   may seem at first, by Use and Custom it will soon grow easy. The worst
   is at first setting out, when once we have been used a while to walk in
   this narrow way, we shall find it to be both easy and pleasant: For as
   the wise Man tells us, The ways of Wisdom or true Piety, are ways of
   pleasantness, and all her paths are peace, Prov. iii. 17. Though it be
   rough at first, by treading it will soon grow plain, we shall soon find
   the words of Christ to be true, that his yoke is easy, and his burden
   light, Matt. xi. 39. All is, but to be willing and obedient, and
   resolved upon it, to press through all Duties and Difficulties
   whatsoever to get to Heaven, and then by the Merits of Christ's
   Passion, and the Assistance of his Grace, we need not fear but we shall
   come thither.

   AND verily although the way to Heaven should prove not only narrow, but
   hedg'd in with Bryars and Thorns, so that we should meet with nothing
   but Crosses and Troubles in our going to it, yet Heaven will make
   amends for all. For we may well reckon with the Apostle, that the
   sufferings of this Life are not worthy to be compared with the glory
   that idea be revealed in us, Rom. viii. 18. So that whatsoever Pains we
   are at, whatsoever Trouble we suffer in order to our attaining
   everlasting Happiness, bears no proportion at all to the Happiness we
   attain by it; which is so great, so exceeding great that our Tongues
   can neither express, nor our Minds as yet conceive it, consisting not
   only in the freedom from all Evil, but also in the enjoyment of
   whatsoever is really and truly Good; even whatsoever can any way
   conduce to the making us perfectly and completely happy: So that no
   Duty can be too great to undertake, no Trouble too heavy to undergo for
   it. Wherefore, that I may use the words of the Apostle to my Readers,
   my beloved Brethren, be ye stedfast and immoveable, always abounding in
   the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your Labour shall
   not be in vain in the Lord, 1 Cor. xv. 58.

   BY this time I hope we are all resolved within our selves, to follow
   our Saviour's Counsel and Advice, even to strive to enter in at the
   strait Gate, and to walk in that narrow way that leads to Life. If we
   be not we have just cause to suspect our selves to be in the Gall of
   Bitterness and in the Bond of Iniquity; but if we be resolved in good
   earnest, we cannot but be very solicitous to know what we must do in
   order to it? or how everyone of us may enter in at the strait Gate, so
   as to be happy for ever? A Question of the highest importance
   imaginable: So that it is absolutely necessary for every Soul amongst
   us to be throughly resolved in it; for it concerns our Life, our
   immortal and eternal Life, and therefore I shall endeavour to resolve
   it in as few and perspicuous terms as portably I can, that the meanest
   Capacity may understand it. But I must take leave to say beforehand,
   that our knowing of it will signify nothing, unless we practice it,
   neither will you be ever the nearer Heaven because you know the way to
   it, unless you also walk in it.

   AND therefore the first thing that I shall propound, in order to our
   eternal Salvation, is, that we would resolve immediately in the
   Presence of Almighty God, that we will for the future make it our great
   care, study and business in this World, to seek the Kingdom of God and
   the Righteousness thereof in the first place, according to our
   Saviour's advice and command, Matth.. vi. 33. that we would not halt
   any longer between two Opinions, and think to seek Heaven and Earth
   together, things diametrically opposite to one another. If we really
   think Earth to be better than Heaven, what need we trouble our selves
   any farther, than to heap up the Riches, and to enjoy the Pleasures of
   this World: But if we really think Heaven to be better than Earth, as
   all wise Men must needs do, then let us mind that, and concern not our
   selves about this. We know what our Saviour told us long ago, No Man
   can serve two Masters, for either he will hate the one and love the
   other, or else he will hold with the one and despise the other: you
   cannot serve God and Mammon, Matth. vii. 24. that is, in plain English,
   we cannot mind Heaven and Earth both together; for we can have but one
   grand and principal design in the World, and therefore if our principal
   design be to get Wealth or any earthly Enjoyment, we deceive our
   selves, if we think that we mind Heaven at all. For that we can never
   properly be said to do, until we mind it before all things whatsoever
   in the World besides; and let us not say, or think within our selves,
   that this is an hard saying, for we may assure our selves it is no more
   than what we shall all find to be really true, and that never a Soul of
   us shall ever know what Heaven is, that doth not first prefer it before
   all things here below, and by consequence make it his principal, if not
   only design to get thither.

   SUPPOSING us, therefore to be thus resolved within our selves, my next
   Advice is, that we break off our former Sins by Repentance and shewing
   Mercy to the Poor, and that for the future we live not in the wilful
   commission of any known Sin, nor yet in the wilful neglect of any known
   Duty. Where it is evident I advise to no more than what all Men know
   themselves to be obliged to do; for I dare say, there is none of us
   knows so little, but what if he would but live up to what he knows, he
   could not but be both holy and happy. Let us but avoid what we our
   selves know to be Sin, and do what we know to be our Duty, and though
   our knowledge may not be so great as others, yet our Piety may be
   greater and our Condition better. But we must still remember, that one
   Sin will keep us out of Heaven as well as twenty; and therefore if we
   ever desire to come thither, we must not only do some or many things,
   but all things whatsoever is required of us, to the best of our
   knowledge. I speak not this of my self, but Christ himself hath told us
   the same before, even that we must keep the Commandments, all the
   Commandments, if we desire to enter into eternal Life, Matth. xix. 16,
   17. Not as if it was indispensably necessary to observe every Punctilio
   and Circumstance of the Moral Law, for then no Man could be saved; but
   that it must be both our stedfast Resolution, and our chief Study and
   Endeavour to avoid whatsoever we know to be forbidden, and to perform
   whatsoever we know to be commanded by God.

   AND though by this we shall make a fair progress in the narrow way to
   Life, yet there is still another step behind, before we can enter in at
   the strait Gate, and that is to believe in Jesus Christ, as our Saviour
   himself hath taught us, Matth. xix. 21. The sum of which Duty in brief
   is this, That when we have done all we can in obedience to the Moral
   Law, yet we must still look upon our selves as unprofitable Servants,
   and not expect to be justified or Caved by vertue of that Obedience,
   but only by the Merits of Christ's Death and Passions; humbly
   confiding, that in and through him, the defects of our Obedience shall
   be remitted, our Persons accepted, our Natures cleansed, and our Souls
   eternally saved. This is not only the principal but the only thing
   which Paul and Silas directed the Keeper of the Prison to, in order to
   his Salvation, as comprehending all the rest under it, or at least
   supposing them, Acts xvi. 31.

   THUS therefore though Obedience be the way, Faith is the Gate through
   which we must enter into Life. But seeing the Gate is strait as well as
   the Way narrow, and it is as hard to believe in Christ as to observe
   the Law, we must not think to do either by our own strength, but still
   implore the Aid and Assistance of Almighty God, and depend upon him for
   it. For Christ himself saith, No Man can come to me except the Father
   which hath sent me, draw him, John vi. 44. But we can never expect that
   he should draw us, unless we desire it of him. And therefore it must be
   our daily Prayer and Petition at the Throne of Grace, that God would
   vouchsafe us his especial Grace and Assistance, without which I cannot
   see how any one that knows his own Heart, can expect to be saved. But
   our Comfort is, if we do what we can God will hear our Prayers, and
   enable us to do what otherwise we cannot; for he never yet did, nor
   ever will fail any Man that sincerely endeavours to serve and honour
   him.

   LASTLY, Although we are to trust in God for the answer of our Prayers
   in this particular, yet we must not expect that he should do it
   immediately from himself, but we must use those means which himself
   hath appointed whereby to work Faith, and by consequence all other
   Graces in us. Now the Scriptures tell us that Faith comes by hearing,
   Rom. x. 17. Wherefore if we desire to believe, so as to be saved, we
   must wait upon God in his publick Ordinances, and there expect such
   influences of his Grace and Spirit, whereby we may be enabled to walk
   in the narrow way, and enter in at the strait Gate that leads to life.

   THUS I have shewn you in few terms, how to do the great Work which you
   came into the World about, even how to get to Heaven. For howsoever
   hard it is to come thither, let us but resolve, as we have seen, to
   mind it before all things else, fear God and keep his Commands to the
   utmost of our Power, believe in Christ for the pardon of our Sins, and
   the acceptance both of our Persons and Performances; pray sincerely
   unto God, and wait diligently upon him for the assistance of his Grace,
   to do what he requires from us. Let us do this and we need not fear but
   our Souls shall live. If we leave this undone we our selves shall be
   undone for ever. And therefore let me advise all to dally no longer in
   a matter of such consequence as this is, but now we know the way to
   Heaven to turn immediately into it, and walk constantly in it. Though
   the way be narrow it is not long, and though the Gate be strait, it
   opens into eternal Life. And therefore to conclude. Let us remember we
   have now been told how to get to Heaven, it is not in my power to force
   Men thither whether they will or no, I can only shew them the way. It
   is their Interest as well as Duty to walk in it, which if they do I
   dare assure them, in the name of Christ, it is not long but they will
   be admitted into the Choir of Heaven, to sing Halleluja's for evermore.

                     Thoughts upon the Imitation of Christ.

   IF we seriously consider with our selves that Wonder of all Wonders,
   that Mystery of all Mysteries, the Incarnation of the Son of God, it
   may justly strike us into Astonishment, and an Admiration what should
   be the reason and the end of it; why the great and glorious, the
   almighty and eternal God, should take our weak and finite Nature into
   his infinite and incomprehensible Person; why the Creator of all things
   should himself become a Creature; and he that made the World be himself
   made into it; why the supreme Being of all Beings, that gives Essence
   and Existence to all things in the World, whose Glory the Heaven of
   Heavens is not able to contain, should cloath himself with Flesh, and
   become Man, of the self same Nature and Substance with us, who live and
   move and have our Being in him! Certainly it was not upon any frivolous
   or ordinary account, that the most high God manifested himself to the
   Sons of Men in so wonderful and extraordinary a manner as this was. But
   he did it questionless upon some Design that was as great and glorious
   as the Act it self. And if we would know what his End and Design in
   coming into the World was, the Scripture assures us in general, that it
   was for the Salvation of Mankind, whose Nature he assumed: For this is
   a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus
   came into the World to save sinners, 1 Tim. i. 15. And he himself tells
   us, That God so loved the World, that he sent his only begotten Son,
   that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
   life, John iii. 16. Now for the accomplishment of this no less glorious
   than gracious Design, there are two things which it was necessary he
   should do for us, whilst he was upon Earth, even expiate our former
   Sins, and direct unto Holiness for the future; both which he hath
   effected for us: the one by his Death and the other by his Life.

   FOR, by his Death he hath paid that Debt which we owed to God, having
   made complete satisfaction to God's Justice for those Sins, whereby we
   have incurred his Displeasure For Death was threatned to all Mankind in
   case of Disobedience, and by consequence all Mankind being disobedient,
   are obnoxious to it. Neither would it stand with the Justice of God, to
   falsify his Word, nor yet with his Glory, to put up the Injuries that
   we have committed against him, without having satisfaction made unto
   him for them. But it being impossible that a finite Creature should
   satisfy for those Sins which were commited against the infinite God:
   Hence the infinite God himself was pleased to undertake it for us, even
   to satisfy himself for those Sins which were committed against him;
   which he did, by undergoing that Death which he had threaten'd to us in
   our own Nature, united to the Person of his own and only Son, God
   coequal, coessential, coeternal with himself, who is therefore said to
   be a propitiation for our sins, 1 John ii. 2. Neither can there any
   reason imaginable be alledged, why the Son of God himself should suffer
   Death, unless it was upon our account, and in our stead, whose Nature
   he assumed, and in which he suffered it. But not to insist upon that
   now. The humane Nature in general; having thus suffered that Death in
   the Person of the Son of God, which all Mankind was otherwise bound to
   have undergone in their own Persons; hence it comes to pass, that we
   are all in a Capacity of avoiding that Death which we have deserved by
   our Sins, if we do but rightly believe in Christ, and apply his
   Sufferings to our selves.

   AND as Christ by his Death and Passions hath thus satisfied for our
   Sins, so hath he by his Life and Actions, given us an exact Pattern of
   true Piety and Vertue. And although I cannot say it was the only, yet
   questionless one great End wherefore he continued so long on Earth, and
   conversed so much amongst Men, and that so many of his Actions are
   delivered to us with so many Circumstances as they are, was, that we by
   his Example, might learn how to carry and behave our selves in this
   lower World. For as from that time to this, so from the beginning of
   the World to that time, there had been never a Man upon the face of the
   Earth, that had lived so conformably to the Law of God, that it was
   safe or lawful for another to follow him in all things. For all Flesh
   was corrupt, and the very best of Men were still but Men, subject to
   failures in their Lives as well as to Errors in their Judgments, yea
   those very Persons whom the Scriptures record, and God himself
   attesteth to have been eminent in their Generations for Piety and
   Justice, did oftentimes fail in both. Noah is asserted by God himself,
   to have been righteous in his Generation, Abraham to be the Father of
   the Faithful, Moses to be the meekest Man upon Earth, David to be a Man
   after God's own Heart, Solomon to have been the wisest Man that ever
   liv'd, and Job to be a perfect and upright Man, one that feared God and
   eschewed Evil: yet none of these most excellent Persons but had their
   Vices as well as Virtues: And it is observable, that the more eminent
   any were in Piety, the more notorious Sins God hath sometimes suffered
   them to slip in to, to keep them humble. So that from the first to the
   second Adam, there never lived a Man of whom it could be said, This Man
   never sinned, never transgressed the Laws of God, and therefore may in
   all things be imitated by Men.

   BUT now as the First was made, the second Adam continued all along most
   pure and perfect, both in Thought, Word and Action: For he did no sin,
   neither was guile found in his mouth,, 1 Pet. ii. 22. Never so much as
   a vain Thought ever sprang up in his most holy Heart, nor so much as an
   idle Word ever proceeded out of his divine Lips, nor so much as an
   impertinent or frivolous Action was ever performed by his sacred and
   most righteous Hands; his whole Life being nothing else but one
   continued act of Piety towards God, Justice towards Men, Love and
   Charity towards all. And as himself lived, so would he have all his
   Disciples live whilst they are here below; and therefore enjoyns them
   that go after him, not only to deny themselves, and take up their
   Crosses, but also to follow, or imitate him, unto the utmost of their
   Power in their Life and Actions. So that he now expects that all those
   who profess themselves to be his Disciples, do first deny themselves
   whatsoever is offensive unto him; and then that they take up their
   Cross so as to be ready and willing to do or suffer any thing for him,
   that hath done and suffered so much as he hath for us. And then lastly,
   that they write after the Copy that he hath set them; and walk in the
   Steps wherein he is gone before them; even that they follow him through
   all Duties and Difficulties whatsoever, so as still to do unto the
   utmost of their Power as he did, otherwise they in vain pretend to be
   his Disciples. For he that saith be abideth in him, ought himself also
   to walk even as he walked, 1 John ii. 6. that is, he that professeth to
   believe in Jesus Christ, should live as he lived while he was upon
   Earth. Hence St. Paul, a true Disciple of Christ saith, Be ye followers
   of me, even as I also am of Christ, 1 Cor. xi. 1. As he followed
   Christ, he would have others to follow him; but he would have them
   follow him no farther than as he followed Christ.

   IT is true, we were bound to be holy and righteous in all our ways,
   whether we had ever heard of Christ's being so or no, the Law of God
   first obliging us to be so; but howsoever, we have now an additional
   Obligation upon us to be holy, As he who hath called us was holy in all
   manner of conversation, 1 Pet. i. 15. For the Scripture tells us
   expressly, that Christ hath left us an example that we should follow
   his steps, 1 Pet. ii. 21. And our Saviour himself commands all that
   come to him to learn of him, Mat. xi. 29, 30. And therefore we can
   never expect that he should own us for his Disciples, unless we own him
   for our Lord and Master, so far as to obey and follow him; he having
   commanded all those that come to him, to deny themselves, take up their
   Crosses and follow him. And seeing we all I hope desire to be
   Christians indeed, as I have explained the two former of these Duties,
   I shall now endeavour to give the true meaning of the latter too, that
   we may all so follow Christ here, as to come to him hereafter.

   NOW for the opening of this, we must know that we neither can nor ought
   to follow Christ in every thing he did when he was here below; for even
   whilst he was here below, he was still the most high and mighty God,
   the same that he had been from Eternity, and often manifested his Power
   and Glory to the Sons of Men, whilst he was conversing with them in
   their own Natures, wherein it would be horrid presumption for us to
   pretend to follow him. As for example, He knew the very thoughts of
   men, Mat. xii. 25. which I suppose is something past our skill to do.
   Hence also he judged and censured others, Wo unto you, saith he,
   Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye are like unto painted
   sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but are within
   full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness, Mat. xxiii. 27, 28. But
   this we could not do though we might, not being able to search into
   others hearts, neither may we do it though we could, Christ himself
   having expresly commanded us the contrary, saying, Judge not that ye be
   not judged, Mat. vii. 1. Our Saviour also as God foretold future
   events, Luk. xxi. 6. and wrought Miracles, such as were clear
   demonstrations of his infinite Power and Godhead; but in this he is to
   be believed and admired, not followed or imitated by us. Thus also when
   he sent his Disciples to loose another Man's Colt, and bring him away,
   Luk. xix. 30. That he did as Lord and Sovereign of the World, or as the
   supreme Possessor and universal Proprietor of all things; as when he
   commanded the Israelites to spoil the Egyptians, and carry away their
   Jewels and Raiment, for all things being his, he may give them to whom
   he pleaseth; and tho' it would have been a Sin to have taken them away
   without his command, yet his command gave them a propriety in them, a
   Right and Title to them, and they had sinned unless they had obeyed the
   command. So here, our Saviour sent for the Colt, as if it had been his
   own, for so really it was; as he is God, which he manifested himself to
   be at the same time, in that he inclined the hearts, of the civil
   Owners thereof to let him go, only upon the Disciples saying that the
   Lord had need of him, Luk. xix. 33, 34. But this he did not for our
   Example, but to shew forth his own Power and Glory.

   THERE are some things also which our blessed Saviour did as God-man, or
   as the Mediator betwixt God and Man, as his making attonement and
   satisfaction for the Sins of Mankind, his instituting Offices and
   Ordinances, and Sacraments in his Church, and the like; which having an
   immediate respect to his Office of Mediator, and being done upon that
   account, we neither may nor can imitate him in such things. But the
   things which he would have us to follow him in, are such and such only
   as he did as mere Man, that had no immediate dependence upon or
   reference to either his Godhead or Mediatorship. For he having honoured
   our Nature so far, as to take it into his own divine Person, so as to
   become really and truly Man; as so, he did whatsoever Man is bound to
   do, both as to God himself, and likewise as to Men. And being
   absolutely perfect in all the Faculties of his Soul, and Members of his
   Body, he infinitely surpassed all other Men both in divine Graces, and
   moral Virtues, so that he never committed any one Sin, so neither did
   he ever neglect any one Duty, which as Man he was bound to perform
   either to God Or Men, but still observed every punctilio and
   Circumstance of the Moral Law; by which means he hath left us a
   complete Pattern of true and universal Holiness, and hath enjoined us
   all to follow it.

   HOPING therefore that all who profess themselves to be the Friends and
   Disciples of Jesus Christ, desire to manifest themselves to be so, by
   following both his Precepts and Example, I shall give the Reader a
   Short Narrative of his Life and Actions, wherein we may all see what
   true Piety is, and what real Christianity requires of us; and may not
   content our selves, as many do, with being, Professors, and adhering to
   Parties or Factions amongst us, but strive to be thorow Christians, and
   to carry our selves as such, by walking as Christ himself walked; which
   that we may at least know how to do, looking upon Christ as a mere Man,
   I shall shew how he did, and by Consequence how we ought to carry our
   selves both to God and Man, and what Graces and Vertues he exercised
   all along for our Example and Imitation.

   NOW for our more clear, and methodical proceeding, in a matter of such
   Consequence as this is, I shall begin with his Behaviour towards Men,
   from his Childhood to his Death.

   FIRST therefore, when he was a Child of twelve Years of Age, it is
   particularly recorded of him, this he was subject or obedient to his
   Parents, his real Mother and reputed Father, Luc. ii. 51. It is true,
   he knew at that time that God himself was his Father, for, said he,
   wist ye not that I must be about my Father's Business, ver. 49. And
   knowing God to be his Father, he could not but know likewise that he
   was infinitely above his Mother; yea, that she could never have born
   him, had not he himself first made and supported her. Yet howsoever,
   though as God he was Father to her, yet as Man she was Mother to him;
   and therefore he honoured and obeyed both her and him to whom the was
   espoused. Neither did he only respect his Mother whilst he was here,
   but he took Care of her too when he was going hence. Yea, all the Pains
   that he suffered upon the Cross could not make him forget his Duty to
   her that bore him; but seeing her standing by the Cross, as himself
   hung on it, he committed her to the Care of his beloved Disciple, who
   took her to his own home, Joh. xix. 27. Now as our Saviour did, so are
   we bound to carry our selves to our earthly Parents, whatsoever their
   Temper or Condition be in this World. Though God hath blessed some of
   us perhaps with greater Estates than ever he blessed them, yet we must
   not think our selves above them, nor be at all the less respectful to
   them. Christ, we see, was infinitely above his Mother, yet as she was
   his Mother, he was both subject and respectful to her. He was not
   ashamed to own her as she stood by the Cross, but in the view and
   hearing of all there present, gave his Disciple a Charge to take Care
   of her; leaving us an Example, that such amongst us as have Parents,
   provide for them if they need it, as well as for our Children, both
   while we live and when we come to die.

   AND as he was to his natural, so was he too to his civil Parents, the
   Magistrates under which he lived, submissive and faithful; for though
   as he was God he was infinitely above them in Heaven, yet as he was Man
   he was below them on Earth, having committed all Civil Power into their
   hands, without reserving any at all for himself. So that though they
   received their Commission from him, yet now himself could not act
   without receiving a Commission from them. And therefore having no
   Commission from them to do it, he would not entrench so much upon their
   Privilege and Power, as to determine the Controversy betwixt the two
   Brethren contending about their Inheritance; Man, saith he, who made me
   a judge or a divider over you? Luc. xii. 14. And to shew his Submission
   to the Civil Magistrate, as highly as possibly he could, rather than
   offend them, he wrought a Miracle to pay the Tax which they had charged
   upon him, Matth. xvii. 27. And when the Officers were sent to take him,
   though he had more than twelve Legions of Angels at his Service to have
   fought for him if he had pleased, yet he would not employ them, nor
   suffer his own Disciples to make any Resistance, Matth. xxvi. 52, 53.
   And though some of late Days, who called themselves Christians, have
   acted quite contrary to our blessed Saviour in this Particular, I hope
   better things of my Readers, even that they will behave themselves more
   like to Christ, who though he was the supreme Governor of the World,
   yet would not resist, but submitted to the Civil Power, which himself
   had entrusted Men withal.

   MOREOVER, although whilst he was here he was really not only the best
   but greatest Man upon Earth, yet he carryed himself to others with that
   Meekness, Humility, and Respect, as if he had been the least; as he
   never admired any Man for his Riches, so neither did he despise any Man
   for his Poverty; the poor Man and rich were all alike to him. He was as
   lowly and respectful to the lowest as he was to the highest that he
   conversed with. He affected no Titles of Honour, nor gaped after
   popular Air, but submitted himself to the meanest Services that he
   could for the Good of others, even to the washing his own Disciples
   Feet, and all to teach us that we can never think too lowly of our
   selves, nor do any thing that is beneath us; propounding himself as our
   Example, especially in this Particular, Learn of me, saith he, for I am
   meek and lowly in heart, Matth. xi. 29.

   HIS Humility also was the more remarkable, in that his Bounty and
   Goodness to others was so great, for he went about, doing good, Acts x.
   38. Wheresoever you read he was, you still read of some good Work or
   other which he did there, Whatsoever Company he conversed with, they
   still went better from him than they came unto him, if they came out of
   a good end. By him, as himself said, the Blind received their sight,
   and the Lame walked, the Lepers were cleansed, and the Deaf heard, the
   Dead were raised up, and the Poor had the Gospel preached unto them,
   Matth. xi. 5. Yea, it is observable, that we never read of any Person
   whatsoever that came unto him, desiring any real Kindness or Favour of
   him, but he still received it, and that whether he was Friend or Foe.
   For indeed though he had many inveterate and implacable Enemies in the
   World, yet he bare no Grudge or Malice against them, but expressed as
   much Love and Favour to them as to his greatest Friends. Insomuch that
   when they had gotten him upon the Cross, and fastened his hands and
   feet unto it, in the midst of all that Pain and Torment which they put
   him to, he still prayed for them, Luc. xxiii. 34.

   OH! how happy, how blessed a People should we be, could we but follow
   our blessed Saviour in this Particular! How well would it be with us,
   could we but be thus good and loving to one another, as Christ was to
   all, even his most bitter Enemies! We may assure our selves it is not
   only our Misery, but our Sin too, unless we be so. And our Sin will be
   the greater now we know our Matter's Pleasure, unless we do it. And
   therefore let all such amongst us, as desire to carry our selves as
   Christ himself did, and as becometh his Disciples in the World, begin
   here.

   BE submissive and obedient both to our Parents and Governors, humble in
   our own sight, despise none, but be charitable, loving, and good to
   all. By this shall all Men know that we are Christ's Disciples indeed.

   HAVING thus seen our Saviour's Carriage towards Men, we shall now
   consider his Piety and Devotion towards God, not as if it was possible
   for me to express the Excellency and Perfection of those religious Acts
   which he performed continually within his Soul to God, every one of his
   Faculties being as entire in it self, and as perfect in its Acts, as it
   was first made or designed to be. There was no darkness, nor so much as
   gloominess in his Mind, no error or mistake in his Judgment, no bribery
   or corruption in his Conscience, no obstinacy or perverseness in his
   Will, no irregularity nor disorder in his Affections, no spot, no blot,
   no blemish, not the least imperfection or infirmity in his whole Soul.
   And therefore even whilst his body was on Earth, his head and heart
   were still in Heaven. For he never troubled his head, nor so much as
   concerned himself about any thing here below, any farther than to do
   all the Good he could, his thoughts being wholly taken up with
   considering how to advance God's Glory and Man's eternal Happiness. And
   as for his heart, that was the Altar on which the sacred fire of divine
   love was always burning, the flames whereof continually ascended up to
   Heaven, being accompanyed with the most ardent and fervent Desires of,
   and Delight in, the chiefest Good.

   BUT it must not be expected that I should give an exact Description of
   that eminent and most perfect Holiness which our blessed Saviour was
   inwardly adorned with, and continually employed in; which I am as
   unable to express, as desirous to imitate. But howsoever, I shall
   endeavour to mind the Reader in general of such Acts of his Piety and
   Devotion, which are particularly recorded, on purpose for our
   Imitation.

   FIRST therefore, it is observed of our Saviour, that from a Child he
   increased in Wisdom, as he did in Stature, Luc. ii. 52. Where by Wisdom
   we are to understand the Knowledge of God, and of divine things. For
   our Saviour having taken our Nature into his Person, with all its
   Frailties and Infirmities, as it is a created Being, he did not in that
   nature presently know all things which were to be known. It is true, as
   God, he then knew all things as well as he had from all Eternity. But
   we are now speaking of him, as a Man, like one of us in all things
   except Sin. But we continue some considerable time after we are born
   before we know any thing, or come to the use of our Reasons; the
   rational Soul not being able to exert or manifest itself, until the
   natural Phlegm and radical Moisture of the Body, which in Infants is
   predominant, be so digested, that the Body be rightly qualified, and
   its Organs fitted for the Soul to work upon and to make use of. And
   though our Saviour questionless came to the use of his Reason, as Man,
   far sonner than we are wont to do, yet we must not think that he knew
   all things as soon as he was born; for that the Nature he assumed was
   not capable of; neither could he then be said, as he is, to encrease in
   Wisdom, for where there is Perfection there can be no Encrease.

   BUT here before we proceed farther, it will be necessary to answer an
   Objection which some may make against this. For if our Saviour as Man
   knew not all things, then he was not perfect, nor absolutely free from
   Sin, Ignorance it self being a Sin.

   TO this I have these things to answer, first, It is no Sin for a
   Creature to be ignorant of some things, because it is impossible for a
   Creature to know all things, for to be omniscient is God's Prerogative,
   neither is a Creature capable of it, because he is but finite, whereas
   the knowledge of all things, or Omniscience, is it self an infinite
   Act, and therefore to be performed only by an infinite Being. Hence it
   is that no Creature in the World ever was or ever could be made
   Omniscient, but there are many things which Adam in his Integrity, and
   the very Angels themselves are ignorant of; as our Saviour speaking of
   the Day of Judgment, saith, Of that day and hour knoweth no Man, no not
   the Angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father, Mark
   xiii. 32. But the Angels are never the less perfect because they know
   not this. Nay, it is observable, that the Son himself as Man knew it
   not, neither saith he, the Son, but the Father; and if he knew it not,
   then much less was it necessary for him to know it when a Child.

   SECONDLY, As to be ignorant of some things is no Sin, so neither is any
   Ignorance at all sin, but that whereby a Man is ignorant of what he is
   bound to know, For all sin is the transgression of a law. And therefore
   if there be no Law obliging me to know such or such things, I do not
   sin by being ignorant of them, for I transgress no Law. Now though all
   Men are bound by the Law of God to know him, and their Duty to him, yet
   Infants, so long as Infants, are not, neither can be obnoxious or
   subject to that Law, they being in a natural incapacity, yea
   impossibility to perform it, but as they become by degrees capable of
   knowing any thing, they are obliged questionless to know him first,
   from whom they receive their knowledge.

   AND thus it was that our blessed Saviour perfectly fulfilled the Law of
   God, in that although he might still continue ignorant of many things;
   yet howsoever he all along knew all that he was bound to know, and as
   he grew by degrees more and more capable of knowing any thing, so did
   he increase still more in true Wisdom, or in the knowledge of God; so
   that by that time he was twelve years old, he was able to dispute with
   the great Doctors and learned Rabbies amongst the Jews; and after that
   as he grew in Stature, so did he grow in Wisdom too, and in favour both
   with God and Man.

   AND verily, although we did not follow our blessed Saviour in this
   particular when we were Children, we ought howsoever to endeavour it
   now we are Men and Women, even to grow in Wisdom, and every day add
   something to our spiritual stature, so as to let never a day pass over
   our heads, without being better acquainted with God's goodness to us,
   or our Duty to him. And by this example of our Saviour's growing in
   Wisdom when a Child, we should also learn to bring up our Children in
   the nurture and admonition of the Lord, and not strive so much to make
   them rich, as to use all means to make them wise and good, that they
   may do as their Saviour did, even grow in wisdom and in stature, and in
   the favour both of God and Man.

   AND as our Saviour grew in wisdom when a Child, so did he use and
   manifest it when he came to be a Man, by devoting himself wholly unto
   the service of the living God, and to the exercise of all true Grace
   and Virtue, wherein his blessed Soul was so much taken up, that he had
   neither time nor heart to mind those toys and trifles which silly
   Mortals upon Earth are so much apt to dote on. It is true all the World
   was his, but he had given it all away to others, not reserving for
   himself so much as an House to put his head in, Mat. viii. 20. And what
   Money he had hoarded up, you may gather from his working a Miracle to
   pay his Tribute or Poll Money, which came not to much above a Shilling.
   Indeed he came into the World and went out again, without ever taking
   any notice of any Pleasures, Honours or Riches in it, as if there had
   been no such thing here, as really there was not, nor ever will be; all
   the Pomp and Glory of this deceitful World having no other Being or
   Existence, but only in our distempered Fancies and Imaginations, and
   therefore our Saviour, whose Fancy was found, and his Imagination
   untainted, looked upon all the World and the Glory of it as not worthy
   to be looked upon, seeing nothing in it wherefore it should be desired.
   And therefore instead of spending his time in the childish pursuit of
   Clouds and Shadows, he made the Service of God not only his Business,
   but his Recreation too, his Food as well as Work. It is my meat, saith
   he, to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work, Joh.
   iv. 34. This was all the Riches, Honours and Pleasures which he sought
   for in the World, even to do the will of him that sent him hither, and
   to finish the Work which he came about, and so he did before he went
   away; Father, I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finished the
   work which thou sentest me to do, Joh. xvii. 4. If therefore we would
   be Christ's Disciples, so as to follow him, we see what we must do, and
   how we must behave and carry our selves whilst we are here below; we
   must not spend our rime, nor throw away our precious and short lived
   Days upon the trifles and impertinencies of this transient World, as if
   we came hither for nothing else but to rake and scrape up a little dust
   and dirt together, or to wallow our selves like Swine in the mire of
   carnal Pleasures and Delights. No we may assure our selves we have
   greater things to do, and far more noble Designs to carry on whilst we
   continue in this vale of Tears, even to work out our Salvation with
   fear and trembling, and to make our calling and election sure; to serve
   God here, so as to enjoy him for ever. This is the work we came about,
   and which we must not only do, but do it too with pleasure and delight,
   and never leave until we have accomplish'd it; we must make it our only
   pleasure to please God, account it our only Honour to honour him, and
   esteem his love and favour to be the only wealth and riches that we can
   enjoy; we must think our selves no farther happy, than we find our
   selves to be truly holy, and therefore devote one Lives wholly to him,
   in whom we live. This is to live as Christ lived, and by consequence as
   Christians ought to do.

   I might here instance in several other Acts of Piety and Devotion,
   which our Saviour was not only eminent for, but continually exercised
   himself in, as his humble and perfect Submission and Resignation of his
   own will to God's, his most ardent Love unto him, and zeal for him, as
   also his firm and stedfast Trust and Confidence on him; so that nothing
   could ever disquiet or discompose his Mind, but still his Heart was
   fixed, trusting in the Lord. In all which, it is both our Duty and
   Interest to follow him, our Happiness as well as Holiness consisting in
   our dependence upon God, and Inclinations to him.

   BUT we should do well to observe withal, that our Saviour performed
   external as well as inward Worship and Devotion unto God; particularly
   we often find him praising God and praying unto him, and that with his
   Eyes lift up to Heaven in a most humble and reverential Posture, John
   xvii. i. Luke xxii. 4. Matth. 26. 39. yea when he was to chuse and
   ordain some of his Disciples to the Work of the Ministry, and to
   succced him after his departure, under the name of Apostles, he spent
   the Night before in Prayer to God, Luke vi. 12. I confess the words
   there used en te proseuche tou theou, will scarce admit of that
   Interpretation or Exposition, signifying rather in a strict sense, that
   he went into a place appointed for Prayer, which was usually called
   proseuche, a place of Prayer, which kind of Places were very frequent
   in Judæa, and some of them continued till Epiphanius's time, as himself
   asserts; and they were only plots of Ground enclosed with a Wall; and
   open above, and were ordinarily, if not always upon Mountains, whither
   the Jews used to resort to pray together in great Multitudes. And this
   seems to be the proper meaning of these words, where our Saviour is
   said to go into a Mountain, and to continue all Night, on te proseuche
   tou theou, a place dedicated to his Service. Yet howsoever we cannot
   suppose but that he went thither to do what the place whither he went,
   was designed for, even to pray. And by consequence, that seeing he
   stayed there all Night, questionless he spent the whole Night in Prayer
   and Meditation, in order to so great a Work as the ordaining his
   Apostles was.

   Here therefore is another Copy which our Master Christ hath set us to
   write after, a Lesson that all must learn and practise that would be
   his Disciples. Though we ordinarily converse with nothing but Dirt and
   Clay, and with our fellow Worms on Earth, yet as Christ did, so should
   we often retire from the Tumults and Bustles of the World, to converse
   with him that made us; both to praise him for the Mercies we have
   received, and to pray unto him for what we want; only we shall do well
   to have a care that we do not perform so solemn a Duty as this is,
   after a careless and perfunctory manner, because none sees us but God;
   for his seeing us is infinitely more than if all the World besides
   should see us, and we must still remember that Prayer is the greatest
   Work that a Creature can be engaged in, and therefore to be performed
   with the greatest seriousness, reverence, and earnestness that possibly
   we can raise up our Spirits to. And besides our daily Devotions which
   we owe, and ought to pay to God whensoever we set upon any great and
   weighty Business, we must be sure to follow our Saviour's steps, in
   setting some time apart, proportionably to the Business we undertake,
   wherein to ask God's Counsel, and desire his Direction and Blessing in
   the most serious and solemn manner that possibly we can. I need ot tell
   the Reader what benefit we shall receive by this means, none of us that
   shall try it but will soon find it by experience.

   I shall observe only one thing more concerning our Saviour's Devotion,
   and that is, that although he took all occasions to instruct or
   admonish his Disciples and Followers, whether in the Fields or upon the
   Mountains, or in private Houses, even wheresoever he could find an
   opportunity to do it; yet upon the Sabbath-days he always frequented
   the publick worship of God; he went into the Synagogues, Places
   appointed for publick Prayers, and reading and hearing of the Word, a
   thing which I fear many amongst us do not think of, or at least not
   rightly consider it; for if they did, they would not dare methinks to
   walk so directly contrary to our blessed Saviour in this particular;
   for St. Luke tells us, that when he came to Nazareth, where he had been
   brought up, as his custom was, he went into the Synagogue on the
   Sabbath-day, Luc. iv. 16. From whence none of us but may easily
   observe, that our Saviour did not go into a Synagogue, or Church, by
   the by to see what they were doing there; neither did he happen to go
   in by chance upon the Sabbath-day, but it was his custom and constant
   practice to do so, even to go each Sabbath-day to the publick
   Ordinance, there to join with the Congregation in performing their
   publick Service and Devotions to Almighty God.

   AND here I must take leave to say, that was there no other Law, nor any
   other Obligations upon us (as there be many) to frequent the publick
   Worship of God, this Practice and Example of our blessed Saviour, doth
   sufficiently and effectually oblige us all to a constant attendance
   upon the publick Ordinance. For as we are Christians, and profess our
   selves to be his Disciples, we are all bound to follow him; he commands
   us here and elsewhere to do it; and certainly there is nothing that we
   can be obliged to follow him in, more than in the manner of his
   Worshipping God. And therefore, whosoever out of any humour, fancy or
   sloathfulness, shall presume to neglect the publick worship of God, he
   doth not only act contrary unto Christ's example, but transgresses also
   his Command, that enjoins him to follow that example. What they who are
   guilty of this will have answer for themselves, when they come to stand
   before Christ's Tribunal, I know not. But this I know, that all those
   who profess themselves to be Christians, should follow Christ in all
   things that they can, and by consequence in this particular, and that
   they sin who do not.

   BUT in whatsoever other things we may fail, I know the generality of us
   do herein follow our Saviour's steps, that we are usually present at
   the publick worship of God; but then I hope this is not all that we
   follow him in, but that as we follow him to the publick Ordinances, so
   we do likewise in our private Dcvotions, yea and in our behaviour both
   to God and Man. Which that we may the better do, I have endeavoured to
   shew wherein especially we ought to follow Christ, in being obedient to
   our Parents, subject to our Governours, lowly to the lowest, loving and
   charitable unto all; as also, in growing in Wisdom and the Knowledge of
   God, in contemning the World, in devoting our selves wholly to the
   service of God, in resigning our Wills to his, in loving of him, in
   trusting on him above all things else, in daily praying unto God, and
   frequenting his publick Ordinances; to which I may also add, in denying
   our selves, and taking up our Crosses, which himself hath done before
   us, as well as required of us.

   WHAT now remains, but that seeing the steps wherein our Saviour walked,
   we should all resolve to walk together in them. And I hope that I need
   not use Arguments to persuade any to it; it is enough one would think,
   that Christ himself, whose name we bear, expects and commands it from
   us. And in that the sum of all our Religion consisteth in obeying and
   following Christ, the Circumstances of whose Life are recorded on
   purpose that we may imitate him unto the utmost of our power, not only
   in the matter but manner of our actions, even in the circumstances as
   well as in the substance of them.

   BUT this I dare say we all both know and believe, even that it is our
   duty to follow Christ; and therefore it is a sad, a dismal thing to
   consider, that amongst them that know it, there are so few that do it:
   But even those that go under the name of Christians themselves, do more
   generally follow the Beasts of the Field, or the very Fiends of Hell,
   rather than Christ our Saviour. For all covetous Worldlings that look
   no higher than Earth, and all luxurious Epicures that labour after no
   other but sensual Pleasures, whom do they imitate but the Beasts that
   perish. And as for the proud and arrogant, the deceitful and malicious,
   Seducers of their Brethren, and Oppressors of their Neighbours, all
   Backbiters, and False-accusers, all Deriders of Religion, and Apostates
   from it, they are all of their Father the Devil, and his works they do.
   And if all such Persons should be taken from amongst us, how few would
   be left behind that follow Christ? very few indeed! but I hope there
   would be some. And oh that all who read this would be in the number of
   them, even that they would all from this Day forward resolve to come as
   near our blessed Saviour in all their Actions both to God and Man, as
   possibly they can, which if we once did, what holy, what happy lives
   should we then lead? how should we antedate both the work and joys of
   Heaven! and how certain should we be to be there e'er long, where
   Christ that is the pattern of our Lives here, will be the portion of
   our Souls for ever,

   THUS I have shewn what Christ requires of those who would be his
   Disciples, enjoining them to deny themselves, take up their Cross, and
   follow him. And now I have done my Duty in explaining these Words, 'tis
   all my Readers as well as mine to practise them, which I heartily wish
   we would all resolve to do; and I must say, it highly concerns us all
   to do so, for we can never be saved but by Christ, nor by him unless we
   be his Disciples; neither can we be his Disciples, unless we do what
   here is required of us. And therefore if we care not whether we be
   saved or no, we may think no more of these things, nor trouble our
   heads about them; but if we really desire to come to Heaven, let us
   remember he who alone can bring us thither, hath told us, that we must
   deny our selves, take up our cross, and follow him.
     __________________________________________________________________

                      Thoughts upon Our Call and Election.

   MANY are called, saith our Saviour, Mat. xxii. 14. but few chosen. Oh
   dreadful sentence. who is able to hear it without trembling and
   astonishment! If he had said, that of all the Men that are born in the
   World, there are but few saved, this would not have struck such fear
   and horror in us; for we might still hope, that though Turks, Jews, and
   Heathens, which are far the greatest part of the World, should all
   perish, yet we few in comparison of them, who are baptized into his
   Name, who profess his Gospel, who enjoy his Ordinances, who are
   admitted to his Sacraments, that all who are called to him, might be
   chosen and saved by him; but that of those very Persons who are called,
   there are but few chosen: What a sharp and terrible Sentence is this!
   Who can bear it? Especially considering by whom it was pronounced, even
   by Christ himself. If a meer Man had spoken it, we might hope it was
   but a human Error; if an Angel had uttered it, we might think it
   possible he might be mistaken; but that Christ himself the eternal Son
   of God, who is Truth, and Infallibility itself, that he should assert
   it, that he who laid down his own Life to redeem ours, that he who came
   into the World on purpose to call and save us, that he in whom alone it
   is possible for us to be chosen to Salvation, that he should say, Many
   are called but few chosen. This is a hard saying indeed, which may
   justly make our Ears to tingle, and our Hearts to tremble at the
   hearing of it. And yet we see our Saviour here expressly saith it, and
   not only here neither, but again, Mat. xx. 16. Whence we may gather,
   that it is a thing he would have us often think of, and a matter of
   more than ordinary importance, in that he did not think it enough to
   tell us of it once, but he repeated it in the same words again, that we
   might be sure to remember it, and take especial notice of it, that many
   are called, but few chosen.

   IN which words, that we may understand our Saviour's meaning aright, we
   must first consider the occasion of them in this place, which in brief
   was this. Our Saviour, according to the custom that obtained in those
   days amongst the Wise Men of the East, delighting to use Parables,
   thereby to represent his heavenly Doctrine more clearly to the
   understanding of his Hearers, in this Chapter compares the Kingdom of
   God to a certain King that made a marriage for his son, and sent his
   servants to call them, that were bidden to the wedding, v. 2, 3. Where,
   by the King he means the eternal God, the universal Monarch of the
   World, who intending to make a Marriage betwixt his Son and the Church,
   styled the Spouse of Christ, he first sent to his Guests before bidden,
   even the Jews, the Seed of Abraham his Friend, and at that time his
   peculiar People. But they not hearkening to the first Invitation, he
   sends to them again, v. 4. Yet they still made light of it, having it
   seems, as we most have, other business to mind, and therefore went
   their way, some to their Farms, others to their Merchandize, v. 5. By
   which our Saviour intimates, that one great reason why Men accept not
   of the Overtures of Grace made unto them in the Gospel, is because
   their Minds are taken up with the Cares of this World, looking upon
   their Farms, their Trades, and Merchandize, as things of greater moment
   than Heaven and eternal Glory. Yea, some of them took the Servants
   which were sent to invite them, and treated them spitefully, and slew
   them, v. 6. Why, what is the matter? what Injury have the Servants, the
   Prophets, the Apostles, or the Ministers of Christ done them? What do
   they come to oppress them, to take their Estates from them? To
   disgrace, or bring them into bondage? No, they only come to invite them
   to a Marriage Feast, to tender them the highest Comforts and
   Refreshments imaginable both for their Souls and Bodies. And is this
   all the recompence they give them for their kindness, not only to
   refuse it, but to abuse them that bring it? Well might this glorious
   King be angry and incensed at such an affront offered him as this was
   and therefore He sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers,
   and burnt up their city, v. 7. as we all know he did to the murdering
   Jews, who soon after this were destroyed, and their royal City
   Jerusalem burnt. But now the Feast is prepared, shall there be none to
   eat it? Yes, for seeing they who were first bidden were not worthy to
   partake of his Dainties, he orders his Servants to go into the high
   ways and bid as many as they could find to the marriage, v. 6. 9. The
   Jews having refused the Gospel, God sends to invite the Gentiles to it,
   who hitherto had been reckoned Actions to the Commonwealth of Israel,
   strangers to the covenant of promise, having no hope, and without God
   in the world, Eph. ii. 12. But now they also are bidden to the Wedding,
   they are called to Christ, and invited to partake of all the Privileges
   of the Gospel. For the Servants having received the command, went out
   into the high ways, even into all the by-places and corners of the
   World, and gatherer together all as many as they found, both bad and
   good, and the wedding was furnished with guests, ver. 10. But amongst
   these too, when the King came to see his Guests, he saw one that had
   not on a wedding Garment, ver. 11. Under which One are represented all
   of the same kind, who have not on their wedding Garment, that is, who
   walk not worthy of the Vocation wherewith they are called, not being
   cloathed with Humility, Faith, and other Graces suitable for a
   Christian. All which, notwithstanding they were invited, yea and came
   in too upon their Invitation, yet they are cast out again into utter
   Darkness, Matth. xxii. 12, 13. And then he adds, for many are called,
   but few chosen; as if he should have said, The Jews were called but
   would not come, the Gentiles are called they come, but some of them are
   cast out again; so that of the many which are called, there are but few
   chosen. For many are called, but few chosen.

   WHICH short, but pithy Saying, of our blessed Saviour, that we may
   rightly understand, we shall first consider the former part of it, Many
   are called, and then the latter, but few chosen. That we may apprehend
   the full meaning of the first part of this Proposition, Many are
   called, there are three things to be considered.

   1. WHAT is here meant by being called,

   2. HOW Men are called.

   3. HOW it appears that many are called.

   AS for the first, what we are here to understand by being called. We
   must know that this is meant only of God's Voice to Mankind, making
   known his Will and Pleasure to them, calling upon them to act
   accordingly; and so inviting them to his Service here, and to the
   Enjoyment of his Presence hereafter.

   BUT to explain the Nature of it more particularly, we must consider the
   terminus a quo, and the terminus ad quad, what it is God calls us from,
   and what it is he calls us to; both which we shall speak to, jointly or
   together.

   1. HE calls us from Darkness to Light, from Error and Ignorance to
   Truth and Knowledge: As he made us rational and knowing Creatures at
   first, so he would have us to be again, so as to understand and know
   him that made us, and that gave us the power of understanding and
   knowing; and not employ the little Knowledge we have only about the
   affairs of our Bodies, our Trades, and Callings in this World, nor yet
   in learning Arts and Sciences only, but principally about the concerns
   of our immortal Souls, that we may know him that is the true God, and
   Jesus Christ whom he hath sent; without which, all our other Knowledge
   will avail us nothing. We are still in the dark, and know not whither
   we are going; out of which dark, and by consequence uncomfortable as
   well as dangerous Estate, God of his infinite Mercy is pleas'd to call
   us, that we should shew forth the Praises of him who hath called us out
   of darkness into his marvellous light, 1 Pet. ii. 9.

   2. GOD calls us from Superstition and Idolatry, to serve and worship
   him. For we are called to turn from Idols, to serve the living and true
   God, 1 Thess. i. 9. Thus he called Abraham out of Chaldea, and his
   Posterity the Israelites out of Egypt, Places of Idolatry, that they
   might serve and worship him, and him alone. Thus he called our
   Ancestors of this Nation out of their heathenish Superstitions, to the
   Knowledge and Worship of himself, and of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
   And thus he called upon us to flee from Idolatry, 1 Cor. x. 14. not
   only from Heathenish or Popish, but from all Idolatry whatsoever, and
   by consequence from Covetousness, which God himself tells us in plain
   Terms is Idolatry, Col. iii. 5. And so indeed is our allowing our
   selves in any known Sin whatsoever; for we idolize it by setting it up
   in our Hearts and Affections, instead of God; yea, and bow down to it,
   and serve it, though not in our Bodies yet in our Souls, which is the
   highest kind of Idolatry which God calls as from.

   3. HENCE he also calls us from all manner of Sin and Profaneness to
   Holiness and Piety, both in our Affections and Actions. For as the
   Apostle saith, God hath not called us to uncleanness but to holiness, 1
   Thess. iv. 7. Where by Uncleanness he means all manner of Lusts and
   Corruptions which defile the Soul, and make it unclean and impure in
   the sight of God. These God doth not call us to, but from. It is
   Holiness and universal Righteousness that he calls us to, and commands
   us to follow. This is the great thing that Christ in his Gospel calls
   for, For the grace of God which is in his Gospel, hath now appeared to
   all men, teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
   should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world, Tit.
   ii. 11, 12. He now commandeth, all men every where to repent, and turn
   to God, Act. xvii. 30. Hence he is said to have called us with an holy
   Calling, 2 Tim. i. 9. And as he who hath called us is holy, so ought we
   to be holy in all manner of Conversation, 1 Pet. i. 15. Thus therefore
   we all are called to be an holy People, a People zealous of good Works,
   a People devoted wholly to the Service of the living God. In brief, we
   are called to be Saints, a People consecrated unto God; and therefore,
   as every Vessel in the Temple was holy, so we being called to be the
   Temples of the Holy Ghost, every thing in us should be holy; our
   Thoughts should be holy, our Affections holy, our Words holy, our
   Desires holy, every Faculty of our Souls, every Member of our Bodies,
   and every Action of our Lives should be holy, every thing within us,
   every thing about us, every thing that comes from us should be holy,
   and all because our Calling is holy; and we ought to walk worthy of the
   Vocation wherewith we are called, Eph. iv. 1.

   4. GOD calls us from all carnal and temporal things, to mind Heaven and
   eternal Glory. He sees and observes how eager we are in prosecuting of
   this World's Vanities, and therefore calls upon us to leave doting upon
   such transitory and unsatisfying Trifles, and to mind the things that
   belong to our everlasting Peace; not to be conformed to this World, but
   transformed by the renewing of our Minds, that we may prove what is
   that good, that acceptable, and perfect will of God, Rom. xii. 2. To
   set our Affections upon things above, and not upon things that are upon
   earth, Col. iii. 2. To seek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness
   in the first Place, Matth. vi. 33. Hence it is stiled an heavenly
   calling, Heb. iii. 1. and an high calling, Phil. iii. 14. because we
   are called by it to look after high and heavenly things. He that made
   us hath so much Kindness for us, that it pities him to see us moil and
   toil, and spend our Strength and Labour, about such low and pitiful,
   such impertinent and unnecessary things, which himself knows can never
   satisfy us, and therefore he calls and invites us to himself, and to
   the Enjoyment of his own Perfections, which are able to fill and
   satiate our immortal Souls.

   5. HENCE lastly, we are called from Misery and Danger to a state of
   Happiness and Felicity. As he called Lot out of Sodom, when Fire and
   Brimstone was ready to fall upon it, so he calls us from the World and
   Sin, because otherwise Wrath and Fury will fall upon our heads. Or as
   he called Noah into the Ark, to preserve him from the overflowing
   Flood, so he calls us into his Service, and to the Faith of his Son,
   that so we may escape that flood of Misery which will suddenly drown
   the impenitent and unbelieving World. And therefore we must not think
   that he calls and invites us to him, because he stands in need of us,
   or wants our Service; no, it is not because he cannot be happy without
   us, but because we cannot be happy without him, nor in him neither,
   unless we come unto him. This is the only reason why he calls us so
   earnestly to him, For as I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in
   the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and
   live: Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die, O house of Israel! Ezech.
   xxxiii. 11. Let us not stand therefore pausing upon it, and considering
   whether, we shall hearken to God's call or no, nor say severally within
   our selves, How shall I part with my Profits? How shall I deny my self
   the Enjoyment of my sensual Pleasures? How shall I forsake my darling
   and beloved Sins? But rather say, how shall I abide the Judgment of the
   great God? How shall I escape if I neglect so great Salvation as I am
   now called and invited to. For we may assure our selves, this is the
   great and only end why God calls so pathetically upon us to come unto
   him, that so we may be delivered from his Wrath, and enjoy his Love and
   Favour for ever.

   THUS we see what it is that God calls Mankind both from and to; he
   calls them from Darkness to Light, from Idolatry to true Religion, from
   Sin to Holiness, from Earth to Heaven, and from the deepest Misery to
   the highest Happiness that they are capable of. The next thing to be
   considered is, how God is pleased to call us, for which we must know
   that

   1. HE hath vouchsafed to call some with his own Mouth, as I may so
   speak, even by immediate Revelations from himself. Thus he called
   Abraham and Moses, and several of the Patriarchs of the Old Testament.
   And thus he called Paul, Christ himself calling from Heaven to him,
   Saul, Saul, why. persecutest thou me? Act. ix. 4. And it is observable,
   that whosoever were thus called, they always obeyed. But this is not
   the Calling here spoken of.

   2. GOD calls all Mankind by his Works and Providences. All the
   Creatures in the World are as so many Tongues declaring the Wisdom,
   Power, Goodness, and Glory of God unto us, and so call upon us to
   praise, honour, and obey him. And all his Providences have their
   several and distinct Voices; his Mercies bespeak our Affections, and
   his Judgments our Fear. Hear ye, saith he, the rod, and who hath
   appointed it, Mich. vi. 9. The Rod, it seems, hath a Voice, which we
   are bound to hear. But though many, yea all the World be called this
   way, yet neither is this the Calling our Saviour means, when he saith,
   many are called, but few chosen.

   3. LASTLY, therefore God hath called many by the Ministry of his Word,
   and of his Servants the Prophets, the Apostles and their Successors
   declaring it, and explaining it to them. Thus God spake to our fathers
   by the Prophets, rising up early and sending them to call Sinners to
   Repentance, by shewing them their sins, and the dangerous consequents
   of them. As when he sent his ProphetIsaiah, he bids him Cry aloud,
   spare not, lift up thy Voice as a Trumpet, and shew my people their
   Transgressions, and the house of Jacob their Sins, Isa. lviii. 1. And
   they being convinced of, and humbled for their sins, then he sent his
   Prophets to invite them to accept of Grace and Pardon from him, saying
   in the Language of the same Prophet, Ho! every one that thirsteth, come
   ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea
   come buy wine and milk without money and without price, Isai. lv. 1, 2,
   3. And God having thus at sundry tines, and in divers manners spoken in
   time-past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days
   spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things,
   by whom also he made the worlds, Heb. i. 1, 2. who therefore said with
   his own Mouth, that he came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to
   Repentance, Matth. ix. 13. Hence as soon as ever he entered upon his
   Ministry, he called to Mankind, saying, Repent, and believe the Gospel,
   Marc. i. 5. and Come unto see all ye that labour, and are heavy laden,
   Matth. xi. 28. And when he was to depart hence he left order with his
   Apostles, to go and call all Nations, and teach them what he had
   commanded, promising that himself would be with them to the end of the
   World, Matth. xxviii. 19, 20. By vertue therefore of this Commission,
   not only the Apostles themselves, but all succeeding Ministers in all
   Ages to the end of the World, are sent to call Mankind to embrace the
   Gospel, and to accept of the Terms propounded in it. So that when we
   his Ministers preach unto them, or call upon them to repent and turn to
   God, they must not think that we come in our own Name; for as the
   Apostle tells the Corinthians, We are Ambassadors for Christ, as though
   God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye
   reconciled to God, 2 Cor. v. 20. Hence in Scripture we are called also
   kerukes Heralds, and our Office is keruosein to proclaim as Heralds,
   the Will and Pleasure of Almighty God unto Mankind, to offer Peace and
   Pardon to all that have rebelled against our Lord and Master the King
   of Heaven, if they wilt now come in, and submit themselves unto him, if
   not, in a most solemn and dreadful manner, to denounce his Wrath and
   heavy Displeasure against them. So that as the Angel was sent to call
   Lot out of Sodom, when the Lord was going to rain Fire and Brimstone
   from Heaven upon it; So God being ready every Moment to shower down his
   Fury and Vengeance upon the impenitent and unbelieving World, he sends
   us to call Men out of it, to open their Eyes, and to turn them from
   darkness to light, from the power of Satan unto God, Act. xxvi. 18. and
   to invite them to his Court, to live with him and be happy for ever.

   AND that this is the proper meaning of our blessed Saviour, in this
   Place, where he saith many are called, is plain from the Parable
   whereon there Words are grounded; where the King is said to have sent
   his Servants to call the Guests which were bidden to the Marriage
   Feast, and put Words into their Mouths, telling them what to say, ver.
   4. as he hath given us also Instructions how to call and invite Mankind
   in his holy Word. And when of the many which were called, there would
   but few come, hence our Saviour uttered this Expression, that many are
   called, but few chosen. From whence it is clear and obvious, that our
   Saviour means not such as were called immediately from God himself, for
   they were but few, nor yet such as are called by the works of Creation
   and Providence, for so not many only, but all are called; but he means
   such as are called by his Word, and by his Servants and Ministers
   reading, preaching, and explaining of it.

   AND verily that many have been and still are called in this sense,
   which is the next thing I promised to shew, I need not stand long to
   prove. For our Saviour having commanded his Apostles to go and call all
   Nations to his Faith, which is the proper meaning of that place, Mat.
   xxviii. 19. it cannot be denied but that the Apostles presently
   dispersed themselves, and preached the Gospel to all Nations, which
   they did so effectually, that in few Years after, even in St. Paul's
   time, The mystery of the Gospel was made known to all nations for the
   obedience of faith, Rom. xvi. 26. and in St. John's time, some were
   redeemed out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation, Rev.
   vii. 9. Yea, so mightily grew the word of God and prevailed, that the
   Ancients compared it to Lightning, that immediately dispersed it self,
   and was seen all the World over. So that in less than two hundred
   Years, ab ortu solis ad occasum lex Christiana suscepta est, The
   Christian Religion was received all the world over from East to West,
   as Lacantius who then lived asserts. From which time therefore, how
   many thousands of millions of Souls have been called to the Faith of
   Christ, by the preaching of his Gospel. And not to speak of other
   Nations, how son did the Sun of Righteousness arise upon these Western
   parts of the World, and particularly upon this Nation, wherein we
   dwell, several of Christ's own Disciples and Apostles, as Simon Peter,
   Simon Zelotes, James the Son of Zebedee, Joseph of Arimathea,
   Aristobulus, and St. Paul himself, being all recorded by Ecclesiastical
   Writers, to have preached the Gospel to this Nation. Be sure in less
   than two hundred Years the Christian Faith was here received,
   Tertullian himself saying expressly, Britannorum inaccessa Romanis
   loca, Christo subdita, The Romans could scarcely come at Britany, but
   Christ hath conquered it. And soon after him, Arnobius., saith, that
   the Gospel, Nec ipso Indos latuit à parte orientis, nec ipsos Britannos
   à parte occidentis, Was not conceal'd either from the Indians in the
   Eastern part of the World, nor from the Britons themselves in the West.
   And since the Gospel was first here planted, how many have been called
   by it to the Faith of Christ? Yea through the Mercy of the most high
   God, how many at this moment are called all the Nation over? And to
   come still closer to our selves, all that read this have I doubt not
   been often called heretofore, and now are called again. For in the Name
   of the most high God, and of his Son Christ, I pray and beseech you all
   as strangers and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshy lusts which war
   against the soul, 1 Pet. ii. 11. to repent of your Sins, and believe
   the Gospel. I call and invite you also to accept the offers of Grace
   and Pardon which are made you in Jesus Christ, to sit down with him at
   his own Table, and feed by Faith upon his Body and Blood, that so you
   may partake of the Merits of his Death and Passion, and so live with
   him for evermore. Thus you are all called, but I fear there are but few
   chosen.

   HAVING thus explained and proved the first part of this Proposition,
   that many are called, we must now consider the meaning, truth and
   reasons of the other part of it, but few are chosen,. Polloi gar eisi
   kletoi, oligoi de eklektoi.. For many are called, but few chosen; that
   is, there are but few which are so approved of by God, as to be elected
   and chosen from the other part of the World, to inherit eternal Life.
   That this is the main drift and scope of our blessed Saviour in these
   words, is plain from the foregoing Parable, which gave him occasion to
   pronounce them. For there all that were first called refused to come to
   the Marriage Feast which they were invited to, and of them which came
   some had not on their wedding garment; that is, although they came in
   to the outward profession of the Gospel, yet did not walk worthy of the
   Vocation wherewith they were called, and therefore they likewise were
   excluded, upon which our Saviour adds. these words, For many are
   called, but few chosen. From whence it is easie to observe his meaning
   in general to be only this, that although many were called to partake
   of the Privileges and Graces of his Gospel, yet seeing of those who
   were called, many would not come at all, and of those who come, many do
   not come so as the Gospel requires of them, with their wedding garment
   on; hence of the many who are called, there are but few chosen to
   partake of the Marriage Feast, that is, of the glorious Promises made
   in the Gospel, to those that come aright unto it. Few, not absolutely
   in themselves considered, but few comparatively in respect of the many
   which are not chosen; or rather few in comparison of the many which are
   called. For if we consider them absolutely in themselves, they are
   certainly very many, our Saviour himself saith, Many shall come from
   the East and West, and shall sit down with Abraham, &c. Mat. viii. 11.
   And in the Revelations you read of many thousands that were sealed of
   every Tribe, Yea, There was a great multitude which no man could
   number, of all nations, and kindred, and people, and tongues, stood
   before the throne and before the Iamb, cloathed with white, and palms
   in their hands, Apoc. vii. 9. Insomuch that for all the numberless
   number of fallen or apostatized Angels, St. Austin was of opinion, that
   there will be as many Men saved, as there are Angels damned, or rather
   more. For, saith he, upon the fall of the Angels and Men, he determined
   to gather together by his infinite Grace, so many out of the mortal
   Progeny, ut inde suppleat & instauret partem quæ lapsa est Angelorum,
   That be might from thence make up and restore that part of Angels which
   was fallen; ac sic illa dilecta & superna Civitas non fraudetur suorum
   numero civium, quinetiam fortassis & uberiore lætetur. And so that
   beloved City which is above, may not be deprived of the number of its
   Citizens, but perhaps rejoice in having more, Aug. de Civ. Dei, l.
   xxii. c. 1. which notion he grounds upon those words of our Saviour in
   this Chapter, For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given
   in marriage, but are isangeloi, as the Angels of God in heaven, Mat.
   xxii. 30. Or as the words may be interpreted, they are equal to the
   Angels, and equal in number to the fallen, as well as in quality to the
   elect Angels, as that learned and pious Father expounds it. But
   howsoever that be, this is certain, that the number of Men chosen and
   saved, will be very great, considered absolutely in themselves, and yet
   notwithstanding; if they be compared with .the many more which are
   called, they are but very few, Christ's flock is, as himself stiles it,
   mikron poimnion, a very little, little Flock, Luk. xii. 32. that is, in
   comparison of the vast multitudes of Souls that flock after the World
   and Sin. As in a Garden there are but few choice Flowers, in comparison
   of the Weeds that grow in it; there are but very few Diamonds and
   precious Stones, in comparison of Pebbles and Gravel upon the Seashore;
   in the richest Mines there is far more dross than Gold and Silver: So
   is it in the Church of Christ; there is but little Wheat, in comparison
   of the Tares that come up with it; Christ hath a great many hangers on,
   but few faithful and obedient Servants; there are many that speak him
   very fair, and make a plausible profession of the Faith and Religion
   which he taught, but where shall find one that praaiseth it? If there
   be here one and there another, two or three in a Parish, or perhaps in
   a whole City, what is this to the innumerable company of such as are
   called by him, and baptized into his Name, and yet leave him to follow
   after the World and Vanity: Oh what just ground had our Saviour to say,
   Many are called, but few chosen?

   BUT to demonstrate the truth of this Proposition still more fully, and
   as clearly as possibly I can, I must first lay down one Principle as a
   Postulatum, which I suppose all will acknowledge to be true, and that
   is this, that whatsoever profession a Man makes of the Christian
   Religion, it will avail him nothing without the practice of it; or if
   you will take it in our Saviour's own words, Not every one, saith he,
   that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,
   but he that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven, Mat. vii.
   21. Or as the Apostle expresseth it, For not the hearers of the law are
   just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified, Rom. ii.
   13. That is, it is not our hearing and knowing our Duty that will stand
   us in any stead before God, but our doing of it; it is not our
   believing that we may be saved by believing in Christ, whereby we can
   be saved without actual believing in him, without such a Faith whereby
   we depend upon him, for the pardon and salvation of our immortal Souls,
   and consequently for the assistance of his Grace and Spirit, whereby we
   may be enabled to obey his Gospel, and to perform all such things as
   himself hath told us are necessary in order to our everlasting
   Happiness: And whatsoever Faith we pretend to, unless it comes to this,
   that it put us upon universal Obedience to all the Commands of God, we
   may conclude it will do us no good, for it is not such a Faith as
   Christ requires, which always works by Love; conquers the World,
   subdues Sin, purifies the Heart, and sanctifies the whole Soul
   wheresoever it comes. It is such a Faith as this which is the wedding
   Garment, without which no Man is chosen nor admitted to partake of
   those celestial Banquets, which Christ our Saviour hath provided for
   us. And therefore no Man can have any ground at all to believe or hope
   himself to be defied or chosen to eternal Salvation, that is not holy
   in all manner of Conversation; God himself having told us expressly,
   that without holiness no man shall see the Lord, Heb. xii. 14. So that
   having God's own word for it, we may positively and confidently assert,
   that no Man in the world can upon just grounds be reputed as chosen by
   God, that doth not in all things to the utmost of his power, conform
   himself, and adjust his Actions to the Laws and Commands of God. So
   that how many soever are called, how many soever come in to the outward
   profession of the Christian Religion, yet none of them can be said to
   be chosen, but such as are real and true Saints. And how few those are,
   is a matter which we have more cause to bewail than to prove.
   Howsoever, that we may see that we have but too much reason to believe
   this Assertion of our blessed Saviour, that many are called, but few
   chosen, I desire we may but consider the estate of Christendom in
   general, and weigh the Lives and Actions of all such as profess to
   believe in Christ, view them well, and examine them by the Gospel
   Rules, and then we shall soon conclude that there are but few chosen;
   or to bring it home more closely to our selves, who are all called, and
   take out from amongst us all such Persons as come not up to the terms
   of the Gospel, and we shall find that there are but few behind, but few
   indeed who can be discerned and judged by the light either of Reason or
   Scripture to be chosen by God to eternal Life. For take out from
   amongst us,

   1. ALL atheistical Persons, who though they are baptized into the name
   of Christ, and so are called to the Faith of Christ, yet neither
   believe in Christ nor God, such Fools as say in their Heart there is no
   God, Psal. xiv. 1. For all will grant, that they are not chosen by God,
   who do not so much as believe that there is any God to chuse them.
   Neither can it be imagined that the all wise God should chuse such
   Fools as these to be with him, who will not so much as acknowledge him
   to be. And yet how many such Fools have we amongst us, whose practises
   have so depraved their Principles, that they will not believe there is
   any God, because they wish there was none? And when these ate taken
   from amongst the called, I fear the Number of the Chosen amongst them
   will be much lessened.

   2. TAKE out from amongst us all ignorant Persons, that understand not
   the common Principles of Religion, nor the Fundamental Articles of that
   Faith which they are called to: For that these are not chosen, is
   plain, in that though they be called by Christ, yet they know not what
   he would have them do, nor yet who it is that calls them. And therefore
   as God would have all Men to be saved, so for that end he would have
   them come to the knowledge of the Truth, 1 Tim. ii. 4. that is, he
   would have them know all such Truths as himself hath revealed to them
   in his Gospel, as necessary to be known in order to their eternal
   Salvation, without which knowledge it is impossible for a Man to
   perform what is required of him; for though a Man may know his Duty and
   not do it, no Man can do his Duty unless he first know it. And
   therefore gross Ignorance and saving Faith, cannot possibly consist or
   stand together; for saving Faith is always joined with, or puts a Man
   upon sincere Obedience to all the Commands of God. But how can any Man
   obey the commands of God, who neither knows that God whose Commands
   they are, nor yet what these Commands are which God would have him to
   obey? No certainly, a blind Man may as well follow his temporal
   Calling, how intricate soever it be, as he that is grossly ignorant,
   the high Calling of a Christian; for he is altogether uncapable of it,
   and so not only unworthy, but unfit to be chosen to it. Hence God
   himself hath told us, that he is so far from chusing such as live and
   dye in this manner without understanding, that he will never shew them
   any Mercy or Favour. For it is a people, saith he, of no understanding,
   therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that
   formed them will shew them no favour, Isa. xxvii. 11. Neither doth he
   ever blame Mankind for any thing in the World more than for not
   knowing, and therefore not considering him that made and feeds them,
   Isa. i. 2, 3. Hos iv. 1. And that we may be still farther assured that
   he chuseth no such Persons to dwell with him, as do not know him and
   his Commands, he hath given it us under his hand, that he rejects them,
   saying, My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou
   hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no
   priest to me; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will
   also forget thy children, Hos. iv. 6.

   THAT therefore no Persons that are grossly ignorant, and live and die
   in that Condition, are chosen to eternal Salvation, I suppose, the
   Premises considered, all will acknowledge. But alas! how many such
   Persons are there in the World, how many amongst our selves? How many
   who are very cunning and expert in the management of any worldly
   Business, but are mere Novices or rather Idiots in matters of true
   Religion? Or as the Prophet words it, Who are wise to do evil, but to
   do good they have no knowledge, Jer. iv. 22. How many such ignorant and
   sottish People are there in every corner of the Land? and in this City
   it self! where they do, or may hear the Word of God read and expounded
   to them every day, and yet all them seriously of the Grounds of the
   Christian Religion, and the Reason of the Hope that is in them, and
   they are no more able to give a satisfactory or rational answer, than
   if they had never heard of any such Book as the Bible in the World, or
   had been born and bred in the remotest Corners of America, where the
   sound of the Gospel never yet came. But all such, how many soever they
   be, though they be called, they must stand aloof off, for so long as
   they are such we may be confident they are not chosen. Insomuch that
   should we take away no other from the number of the called, but only
   such as know not what they are called to, it would appear but too
   clearly to be true, that of the many which are called, there are but
   few chosen.

   3. TAKE, out from amongst us all vicious, profane, debauched and
   impenitent Persons, all that make a mock of Sin, and that jear at
   Holiness, that live as without God in the World, as if they had neither
   God to serve nor Souls to save; as if there was neither a Hell to avoid
   nor Heaven to enjoy, and therefore make it their business to gratifie
   their Flesh, and to indulge their Appetite with carnal and sensual
   Pleasures, looking no higher than to be fellow sharers with the Brutes
   that perish such as in their bewitching Cups stick not to fly in the
   face of Heaven it self, and dare challenge God himself to damn them,
   that make lying their usual Dialect, and swearing their pleasing
   Rhetorick; and are so far from being troubled for these their Sins,
   that they take pleasure and delight in them, so far from being ashamed
   of them, that they make them their Pride and Glory, and so make it
   their Pleasure to displease God, and their highest Honour to dishonour
   him that is Honour and Perfection it self. For that no such Persons as
   these who live and dye in such notorious Crimes upon Earth, are chosen
   to live with God in Heaven, none can deny that believes the Scriptures
   to be true, which in plain Terms assure us of the contrary. Know ye
   not, saith the Apostle, that the unrighteous shall not inherit the
   Kingdom of God? be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters,
   nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
   nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
   extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God, 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. And
   St. John tells us, that only they who do the Commandments enter into
   the City of Heaven: but without are dogs, and sorcerers, and
   whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and
   maketh a lie, Rev. xxii. 14, 15. So that all such Persons without
   timely Repentance, are most certainly excluded from the number of the
   chosen. And how many are there amongst us, who allow themselves in some
   such Sin or other; or rather where shall we find a Man that doth not?
   But to all Persons that continue in such Sins, I may say, stand you by,
   you have no ground as yet to think that you are chosen, but have rather
   all the reason in the World to believe, that if you go on in such a
   sinful course, you will never know what Heaven or Happiness is. But
   when all such are taken out of the number of the called, what a pityous
   scouting will be left behind! In plain terms, we have just cause to
   fear that ignorant and dissolute Persons make the greatest part of
   those who are called Christians.

   4. TAKE out from amongst us all hypocritical and false hearted Persons,
   that seem indeed to be honest and good Men, but still retain same
   secret Sin or other which will as certainly keep them out of Heaven as
   the mot notorious or scandalous Crime that is: such as our Saviour
   compares to whited Sepulchres, which outwardly appear very beautiful,
   but are within full of dead Mens Bones, and of all uncleanness, Matth.
   xxiii. 27. Such whose outward Conversation is altogether unblameable;
   so that no Man can charge them with Theft, Perjury, Drunkenness,
   Uncleanness, and the like; but in the mean while, they are malicious,
   uncharitable, censorious, proud, self-conceited, disobedient to Parents
   or Magistrates, Covetous, Ambitious, and the like. And so tho' they be
   free from those Sins which others are guilty of, yet they are guilty of
   as bad Sins, which the others may be freed from. To which also may be
   added all such as make indeed a greater shew of Piety, and seem mighty
   zealous for the little Circumstances of Religion, but neglect the
   weightier Matters of the Law, the Love of God, Mercy, Justice, and the
   like. But for all the vain Hopes and high Conceits that such Persons
   may have of themselves, they are far from being such as the Gospel
   requires them, and by consequence from the number of the chosen here
   spoken of. For the Pharisees were such Persons as these, and yet our
   Saviour himself tells us, That except our righteousness exceed the
   righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, we shall in no wise enter
   into the Kingdom of God, Matth. vi. 20. And when he tells us elsewhere,
   That except we repent we must all likewise perish, Luke xiii. 3. his
   meaning is, not that we must repent of some, or many, or most, but of
   all our Sins, and so repent of them as to turn from them; and so turn
   from all Sin, as for the future to be holy in all manner of
   Conversation, otherwise our Saviour himself assures us, that he will
   never save us, but we must perish without remedy.

   LET any Man consider this, and then tell me what he thinks of the
   Number of the chosen, whether it be not very small indeed, in
   comparison of the many which are called. For not to speak of other
   parts of Christendom, all the People of this Nation are called to the
   Faith of Christ; and how many they are I cannot say we all know, for it
   is past any Man's knowledge. But where is the Man amongst us all, that
   doth not harbour same secret Lust or other in his Bosom; yea, of the
   many Men in this Nation, where is he that can say with David, I have
   kept my self from mine Iniquity? Or to use the words of the Prophet,
   Run ye to and fro through the streets of this city, and see now and
   know, and seek if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth
   judgment, that seeketh the truth, that serveth the Lord with a perfect
   heart and a willing mind. I do not deny but there are a great many
   professors of Religion amongst us, who would fain be accounted more
   strict and holy than their Neighbours, so as to be reckoned the
   Religious; as the Friers and Nuns are in the Church of Rome; But are
   they therefore to be esteemed the elect and chosen of God because they
   fancy themselves to be so? Or rather is not their Pride and
   Self-conceitedness an Argument, that they are not so? Blessed be God
   for it, I have no Spleen nor Rancour against any of them, but heartily
   wish they were as truly good and holy as they would seem to be. But
   what? Is not Pride a Sin? Is not Self-conceitedness a Sin? Is not
   Irreverence in God's worship a Sin? Is not Disobedience to Magistrates
   a Sin? Is not Uncharitableness or Censoriousness a Sin? Certainly all
   these will be found to be Sins another Day. And therefore whatsoever
   pretences Men make unto Religion, if they allow themselves in such Sins
   as these, they are as far from being in the Number of the chosen, as
   the most dissolute and scandalous Persons in the World, But when these
   two are removed from the Number of the called, how few of them will
   appear to be chosen.

   5. YET once again. Take out all such as believe not in our Lord Jesus
   Christ, but being morally honest and faithful in performing their Duty
   to God and Man, trust more in their own good Works than to his Merit
   and Mediation. For that all such are to he excluded, is plain from the
   whole tenour of the Gospel, which assures us, that there is no
   Salvation to be had but only by Jesus Christ; nor by him neither, but
   only by believing in him. But if Christ should come this Day to
   Judgment, would he find Faith upon Earth? Verily, I fear, he would find
   but very little if any at all amongst us: He might I believe; find some
   pretty strict and circumspect in obeying of his other Laws, or at least
   endeavouring to do so. But for a Man to do all that is required of him,
   and yet to count himself an unprofitable Servant; for a Man to do all
   he can and yet rest upon nothing that he hath done, but to depend
   wholly upon another, even upon Jesus Christ for Life and Happiness,
   this is hard indeed to Flesh and Blood, and as rare to find as it is to
   find a Rose amongst the Weeds and Thistles of a barren Wilderness, or a
   Diamond amongst the Gravel upon the Sea shoar; here and there I believe
   there may be found one, but so rarely, that they can scarce be termed
   any, be sure but very few in comparison of the many which are called.

   NOW let us put these things together and we shall easily grant that
   this saying of our Saviour was but too true, that many are called but
   few chosen. And to bring it closer to our selves, we are all called to
   repent and believe the Gospel: Now take out from amongst us all
   ignorant Persons that then should be the reason that so many of them
   should be called and invited to the chiefest Good, the highest
   Happiness their Natures are capable of, yet so few of them should mind
   or prosecute it, so as to be chosen or admitted into the Participation
   of it? What shall we ascribe it to, the will and pleasure of Almighty
   God, as if he delighted in the ruin of his Creatures, and therefore
   although he calls them, he would not have them come unto him? No, that
   cannot be; for in his revealed Will, which is the only Rule that we are
   to walk by, he hath told us the contrary in plain terms, and hath
   confirmed it too with an Oath; saying, As I live, saith the Lord God, I
   have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that he should turn
   from his way and live, Ezek. xxxiii. 11. And elsewhere he assures us,
   that he would have all Men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge
   of the truth, 1 Tim. ii. 4. And therefore if we believe what God saith,
   nay if we believe what he hath sworn, we must needs acknowledge that it
   is his will and pleasure, that as many as are called, should be all
   chosen, and saved. And indeed if he had no mind we should come when we
   are called to him, why should he call us all to come? Why hath he given
   us his word, his Ministers, his Ordinances, and all to invite and
   oblige us to repent and turn to him, if after all he was resolved not
   to accept of us, nor would have us come at all? Far be it from us, that
   we should have such hard and unworthy thoughts of the great Creator and
   Governor of the World; especially considering that he hath told us the
   contrary, as plainly as it was possible for him to express his mind
   unto us. I do not deny, but that according to the Apostle, Known unto
   God are all his works from the beginning of the world, Acts xv. 18. And
   that there are several passages in Scripture which intimate unto us
   God's eternal Election of all that are truly pious, to live with him
   for ever. But it is not for us to be so bold and impudent, as to pry
   into the secrets of God, nor so curious as to search into his eternal
   and incomprehensible Decrees; but we must still remember the words of
   Moses, That secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but these
   things which are revealed belong unto us, that we may do all the words
   of his law, Deut. xxix. 29. Whatsoever is necessary for us to believe
   or do, in order to our eternal Salvation, is clearly revealed to us in
   the Holy Scriptures, and therefore what we there read belongs unto us
   to know, neither are we to look any farther than to his revealed Will.
   But God in the Scriptures doth plainly tell us, not only in the places
   before quoted, but elsewhere, that he is not willing that any should
   perish, but that all should come to Repentance, 2 Pet. iii. 9. This is
   the revealed Will of God, which we are to acquiesce in, and rest fully
   satisfied with, so as to act accordingly, without concerning our selves
   about things that are too high for us, and no way belong unto us. And
   therefore it is not in his secret, but revealed Will, that we are to
   search for the reasons of this Proposition, that many are called, but
   few chosen.

   NOW in consulting the word of God, to find out the reasons of this so
   strange Assertion, that many are called, but few chosen, I know no
   better or fitter place to search for them, than this Parable, which
   gave our blessed Saviour the occasion of asserting it; in which it is
   very observable, that he meddles not at all with any reasons a priori,
   deduced from the eternal Decrees of his Father, but he only suggests to
   us the reasons a posteriori, drawn from the disposition and carriage of
   Men, why so many of them are called, and yet so few chosen.

   FOR the opening whereof we must know, that the end and intent of this
   Parable, was only to shew the entertainment which his Gospel had then,
   and should still meet with in the World; many refusing to embrace it at
   all, and of those who embrace it, many still walking unworthy of it. So
   that the Issue and Consequence of it will be, that though many be
   called to it, there are but few chosen. And he hath so worded the
   Parable, that we need not look any farther for the reasons of this his
   conclusion from it, they being almost clearly couched in the Parable it
   self, which that we may the better understand, I shall open and explain
   them particularly, so as to make them intelligible, I hope, to the
   meanest Capacity.

   THE first reason therefore why so many are called, but so few chosen,
   is because they who are called to Christ, will not come unto him; for
   this is the first reason which our Saviour himself in the Parable
   assigns for it; The King, saith he, sent his servants to call them that
   were bidden to the marriage, and they, would not come, Mat. xxii. 3.
   And they would not come, so that that the great fault is still in the
   wills of Men, which are generally so depraved and corrupt, that though
   they be called never so oft, and cannot but in reason acknowledge that
   it is their interest to come, yet they have so strange an averseness to
   the Holiness and Purity of the Gospel which they are called to, that
   they will not come unto it only because they will not; for here, they
   who were first bidden, give no reason of their refusal, only it is
   said, they would not come. And good cause why, for when we have
   searched into all the reasons imaginable, why Men do not fully submit
   themselves to the Obedience of the Gospel, they will all resolve and
   empty themselves into this, that they will not because they will not.
   Let Ministers say what they can, let the Scripture say what it will,
   let God himself say what he pleases, yet Sinners Men are, and Sinners
   they will be, in spite of them all, as the Prophet rebuking the People
   for their Sins, said, But thou saidst, there is no hope; No, for I have
   loved strangers, and after them will I go, Jer. ii. 25. And so it is to
   this day, we tell them of their Sins, and the dangerous consequences of
   them; we tell them that they must not love the World, but seek the
   Kingdom of God and his Righteousness in the first place; we tell them
   from Christ's own Mouth, that except they repent and forsake their
   Sins, they must perish; but they say in effect, that we had as good
   hold our tongues; for they have loved the World, and after it they will
   go, they have found pleasure in the commission of their Sins, and
   therefore they will commit them; Christ calls them to come unto him,
   and they know no reason why they should not, but howsoever they will
   not come. If we were but once willing, the work was done; for what our
   Wills are really inclined to, we cannot but use the utmost of our
   endeavour to attain. But the mischief is, Men read the Gospel, they
   hear Christ calling upon them to believe and obey it, but their Wills
   are still averse from it, there is a kind of antipathy and contrariety
   within them, against such exact and real Holiness as the Gospel
   requires from them. So that if they perish, they must blame themselves
   for it, it is their own choice, they chuse and prefer their Sins with
   all the Miseries which attend them, before the Gospel of Christ, with
   all the Glory and Happiness which is offered in it; and therefore as
   God said to his People, Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die; O house
   of Israel? Ezek. xxxiii. 11. So say I to these Men, repent and believe
   the Gospel, for why will ye die, why will ye perish eternally? Have you
   any reason for it? none in the world but your own Wills. Christ hath
   told you in plain terms, Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast
   out, Joh. vi. 35. But if you will not come unto him, who can help that?
   Are not your selves only in the fault? Will not your blood be upon your
   own heads? What could Christ have done more for you than he hath done?
   What could he have suffered more for you than he hath suffered? How
   could he call you to him more plainly or pathetically than he doth? But
   if after all this, you will not come unto him, you must even thank your
   selves for all the Torments you must e'er long suffer and undergo. And
   this is indeed the case of the greatest part of Mankind, that though
   they be called and invited to partake of all the Merits of Christ's
   Death and Passion, yet they will not come unto him. And this is the
   first and great reason why so many are called, and yet so few chosen,
   Joh. v. 40.

   2. The second reason is because Men do not really believe that they are
   invited to such glorious things as indeed they are, as our Saviour
   himself intimates in the Parable. For when they who were bidden, would
   not come upon the furst Invitation, as not believing the Message which
   these Servants brought them, the King sent forth other Servants,
   saying, Tell them which are bidden, behold I have prepared my dinner,
   my oxen, and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready, come
   unto the marriage, Mat. xxii. 4. When the first Servants were not
   believed, he sent others with fuller Instructions, giving them orders
   to acquaint the Guests, that all things were now ready, and to assure
   them that it was to a Marriage-Feast they were invited. But it seems,
   whatsoever the first or second Servants could say, it was to no
   purpose, they would not believe them, and therefore sent them away as
   they came; whereby our Saviour exactly discovers to us the
   entertainment that his Gospel always did, and still would meet with in
   the World. Before his own coming into the World, he sent his Prophets
   to invite Mankind to accept of the terms propounded in it, and to call
   upon them to repent and turn to God, that their Sins might be blotted
   out, and their Souls admitted into the grace and favour of Almighty
   God, and so partake of eternal Glory, which the Prophets called Men to,
   under the notion of a Feast, A feast of fat things, a feast of wines on
   the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well
   refined, Isa. xxv. 6. which they called all Men to, saying, Ho, every
   one that thirsteth come ye to the waters, Isa. lv. 1. But how their
   Message was received, the same Prophet declares, saying, Who hath
   believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed, Isa.
   liii. 1. and so it is since. For when the Prophets could not be
   credited, God afterwards sent his Apostles, and still to this Day is
   sending Servant after Servant to invite Men to Grace and Pardon, to
   Heaven and eternal Happiness. But we his Ministers may still say with
   the Prophet, Who hath believed our report? We tell Men, that unless
   they repent and turn to God, Iniquity will be their ruin; we tell them
   also, that if they believe in the Lord Jesus they shall be saved, and
   if they be holy here, they shall be happy hereafter. But what signifies
   our telling them of these things, if they believe not what we say? And
   yet who doth? Men give us the hearing, censure what they have heard,
   and that is all the use they make of it, never really or firmly
   believing any one truth that we make known or expound unto them; and
   this being the case not only of some few, but of the greatest part of
   Mankind, hence it comes to pass that so many are called and so few are
   chosen, even because they who are called do not believe it, and so it
   is all one with them whether they be called or no. Be sure God chuseth
   none but such as believe the word he sends unto them; for as the
   Apostle saith, God hath chosen the poor of this world rich in faith,
   Jac. ii. 5. If they be not rich in faith, they are not for his purpose;
   and seeing there are but few that are so; hence of the many which are
   called, there are but few chosen.

   3. ANOTHER reason why of the many, which are called there are so few
   chosen, is because they have no real esteem or value for the things
   they are called to; as it is in the Parable, when the Servants were
   sent to call upon them to make haste to the Feast because all things
   were ready, it is said that they made light of it, v.5. They did not
   think it worth their while to go, though it was to a Feast, to a
   Marriage Feast, yea to the Marriage Feast of so great a Person as a
   King's Son; no, not though they were invited by the King himself unto
   it. Thus it was in ancient times, and thus it is still; the King of
   Heaven sends to invite Men to his Court, to lay aide their filthy
   Garments, and to put on the Robes that he hath prepared for them, that
   they may be holy as he is holy, and so live with him and be happy for
   ever. But they make light of such things as these, they can see no such
   Beauty in Christ, why they should desire him, no such excellency in God
   himself, why they should be in love with him; and as for Heaven, they
   never were there yet, and therefore care not whether they ever come
   there or no; though they be called, they matter not whether they be
   chosen to it or no; and hence likewise it is that of the many which are
   called, there are so few chosen.

   4. ANOTHER reason is, because they who are called are generally
   addicted to the things of this Life, they have the Serpent's Curse upon
   them, to feed upon. the Dust of the Earth, and therefore slight all the
   Overtures that are made them of Heaven and eternal Happiness. As our
   Saviour himself intimates in this Parable, saying, that when they were
   invited they made light of it, and went their way, one to his Farm,
   another to his Merchandise ver. 5. Thus we read of the Pharisees, that
   they being covetous, when they heard the Words of Christ, they derided
   him, Luc. xvi. 14. And thus it is to this Day, though Men be called to
   Christ, they are so much taken up with worldly Businesses, that they
   can find no time to come unto him; but away they go again, one to his
   Trade, another to his Merchandise. These are the things that most Mens
   Minds are wholly bent upon, and therefore they will not be persuaded to
   leave them to go to Christ. It is true, if he called them to great
   Estates, if he called them to a good Bargain, if he called them to
   Crowns and Scepters in this World, theta they would all arise which
   should be chosen first. But the things that he calls us to are quite of
   another nature; he calls us to repent of our sins, to believe in him,
   to contemn the World, to have our Conversations in Heaven. But these
   are things which Men do not love to hear of; as being contrary to their
   earthly temper and inclinations; and therefore we who are God's
   Ministers may call our hearts out before they will set themselves in
   good earnest to mind them. Or to bring it home closer to us, how often
   have we all been invited to that spiritual Feast, the Sacrament of the
   Lord's Supper, but how few are there that come unto it, when the whole
   Congregation is called to partake of it? Scarce one in twenty think it
   worth their while to stay, to have their share in it. What can be the
   reason of this, but that our Minds are taken up with other things,
   which we fancy to be of far greater Concernment to us than all the
   Merits of Christ's Death and Passion. And therefore it is no wonder
   that so many of us are called, and so few chosen, seeing we our selves
   chuse the Toys and Trifles of this transient World, before all these
   real Joys which in the Gospel we are called and invited to.

   5. IN the next Place, many of them which are called, have so strange an
   antipathy to God and Goodness, that they do not only neglect and slight
   their heavenly, in companion of their earthly Calling, but they hate
   and abuse such as are sent to call them, as our Saviour himself
   intimates, ver. 6. O barbarous Cruelty! What hurt, what injury is done
   unto them? They are invited to a Feast, and for this they are angry,
   and kill the Messengers which are sent to invite them. Thus it hath
   been in all Ages. This was the Entertainment, this the Requital that
   most of the Prophets received for the divine Message they brought to
   Mankind, Mat. xxiii. 37. Yea Christ himself, the Son and Heir of God,
   was put to death for inviting Men to Life and Happiness, and so were
   his Apostles too: And so it is to this Day. There is still a secret
   malice and hatred in Mens hearts against such as sincerely endeavour to
   preach the Gospel clearly and fully unto them. We tell them of their
   Sins, we acquaint them with the Danger they are in, we call upon them
   to forsake and avoid them, we invite them to Christ, and so to Heaven
   and eternal Happiness; and for this many of them are angry with us and
   incensed against us. They may forgive us this wrong, I can assure them
   we intend them no Evil, but all the Good we do or can desire to our own
   Souls; and whatsoever the Success be, it is still our Duty to call upon
   them, to advise them of their Duty, and if possible reclaim them from
   their Sins, and if they be angry with us for that, as many are, they
   cannot wonder at our Saviour's saying, that many are called, but few
   chosen.

   6.THE last reason which our Saviour gives in this Parable, why many are
   called, but few chosen, is because of those who are called, and come
   too at their Call, many come not aright, which he signifies by the Man
   that came without his Wedding garment, ver. 11, 12, 13. where although
   he mentions but one Man, yet under that one is comprehended all of the
   same kind, even all such Persons as have the Gospel preached to them,
   and so are called and Invited to all the Graces and Privileges proposed
   in it, all such as profess to believe in Christ, and to expect
   Happiness and Salvation from him, yet will not come up to the Terms
   which he propounds in his Gospel to them, even to walk worthy of the
   Vocation wherewith they are called, Eph. iv. 1. And indeed this is the
   great reason of all why of so many which are called there are so few
   chosen, because there are so few which do all things which the Gospel
   requires of them. Many like Herod will do many things, Marc. vi. 20.
   and are almost persuaded to be Christians, as Agrippa was, Act. xxvi.
   28. How zealous are some for, how violent are others against, the
   little Ceremonies and Circumstances of Religion, and in the mean while
   neglect and let slip the Power and Substance of it? How demure are same
   in their Carriage towards Men, but irreverent and slovenly in the
   Worship of Almighty God? How devout would others seem towards God, but
   are still careless and negligent of their Duty towards Men? Some are
   all for the Duties of the first Table without the second, others for
   the second without the first. Some are altogether for Obedience and
   good Works, without Faith in Christ; others are as much for Faith in
   Christ without Obedience and good Works. Some would do all themselves,
   as if Christ had done nothing for them; others fancy that Christ hath
   so done all things for them, that there is nothing left for themselves
   to do: And so betwixt both their sorts of People, which are the far
   greater part of those who are called, either the Merits or else the
   Laws of Christ are slighted and contemned. But is this the way to be
   saved? No, surely: If I know any thing of the Gospel, it requires both
   Repentance and Faith in Christ, that we perform sincere Obedience to
   all his Laws, and yet trust in him, and him done, for Pardon,
   Acceptance, and Salvation. And whosoever comes short of this, though he
   be called, we may be sure he is not chosen; though he come to the
   Marriage Feast with those that are invited, yet wanting his Wedding
   Garment, he will be cast out again with Shame and Confusion of Face. So
   that it is not our doing some, or many, or most of the things which the
   Gospel requires, that will do our Business, unless we do all to the
   utmost of our Skill and Power. But where shall we find the Man that
   doth so? What ground have we to acknowledge that our Saviour had but
   too much cause to say, Many are called, but few chosen; which I fear is
   but too true, not only of others, but our selves too.

   I say not this to discourage any one: No, it is my hearty Desire and
   Prayer to the eternal God, that every Soul of us might be chosen and
   saved. But my great Fear is, that many think it so easy a matter to go
   to Heaven, that if they do but say their Prayers, and hear Sermons now
   and then, they cannot miss of it, and therefore need not trouble
   themselves any farther about it. But they must give me leave to tell
   them, that this will not serve their turn; if it would, most of those
   which are called would be chosen too. Whereas our Saviour himself tells
   us, in plain terms, the contrary. And yet this should be so far front
   discouraging of us, that it should rather excite us to greater
   Diligence about it than heretofore we may have used, as our Saviour
   himself intimates in his Answer to this Question, Luc. xiii. 23, 24.
   And verily, what greater Encouragement can we have than to consider,
   that though there be but few chosen, yet there are some? For why may
   not you and I be in the number of those few as well as others? Are not
   we all called to Christ? Are not we all invited, yea commanded to
   believe in his Name, and obey his Gospel, that so we may partake of
   everlasting Glory? Let us then all set upon that Work in good earnest
   which we are called to. Let us but fear God, and keep his Commandments,
   and believe in his Son for his Acceptance of us, and then we need not
   fear but though of the many others which are called there are but few
   chosen, yet we few who are all called shall be all chosen; chosen to
   live with God himself, and Jesus Christ, and to sing forth his Praises
   for evermore.

    Thoughts upon the Appearance of Christ the Sun of Righteousness, or the
                               Beatifick Vision.

   SO long as we are in the Body, we are apt to be governed wholly by its
   senses, seldom or never minding any thing but what comes to us through
   one or other of them. Though we are all able to abstract our Thoughts
   when we please from matter, and fix them upon things that are purely
   spiritual; there are but few that ever do it. But few, even among those
   also that have such things revealed to them by God himself, and so have
   infinitely more and firmer ground to believe them, than any one, or all
   their senses put together can afford. Such are the great Truths of the
   Gospel, for which we have the infallible Word and Testimony of the
   supreme Truth; yet seeing they are not the Objects of sense, but only
   of our Faith, though we profess to believe them, yet we take but little
   notice of them, and are usually no more affected with them, than as if
   there were no such things in being. Hence it hath pleased God, in great
   Compassion to our Infirmity, not only to reveal and make known such
   spiritual things to us, in plain and easy terms, but likewise to bring
   them as near as possible to our senses, by representing them to us
   under the Names and Characters of such sensible Objects as bear the
   greatest Resemblance to them; that we who are led so much by our
   senses, may by them also be directed how to apprehend those spiritual
   Objects which he hath told us of, on purpose that we may believe them
   upon his word.

   THUS he often useth the words, Hand, Eye, and the like, to signify his
   own divine Perfections to us. And thus it was that our Saviour preached
   the Gospel to the People, by Parables, and Similitudes of things
   commonly seen and done among themselves. The Prophets also frequently
   took the same course, as might be shewn by many Instances; but one of
   the most remarkable is that in Mat. iv. 2. where the Prophet in the
   Name of God speaking of Christ's coining into the World, expresseth it
   by the rising of the Sun, saying, To you that fear my name shall the
   Sun of Righteousness arise, with healing in his wings.

   FOR that Jesus Christ is that Sun of Righteousness here spoken of, is
   so plain from the Context, and whole Design of the Prophet, that I need
   not insist upon the proving it; but shall only observe, that this being
   the last of all the Prophets in the Old Testament, he shuts up his own,
   and all the other Prophesies, with a clear Prediction of Christ, and
   his Fore-runner John the Baptist, whom he calls Elijah or Elias, and
   concludes his Prophecy with these words concerning him, Behold I will
   send you Elijah the Prophet, before the coming of the great and
   dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to
   the children, and the heart of the children to the fathers, lest I some
   and smite the Earth (or rather the Land) with a Curse, Mal. iv. 5, 6.
   For that by Elijah is here meant John the Baptist, we are assured by
   Christ himself, Matth. xi. 14. And it is very observable, that as this
   Prophet ends the old Testament with a Prediction of Elias, so St. Luke
   begins the New with a relation how John the Baptist was born, and so
   came into the World a little before Christ, as the Morning Star that
   appeared before the rising of the Sun of Righteousness.

   BUT of the Day which shall come at the rising of that glorious Sun, the
   Prophet saith, that it shall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, yea
   and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh
   shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them
   neither root nor branch, ver. 1. It will be a terrible Day to those
   that shall obstinately refuse to walk in the light of it; they shall be
   all consumed, as we read the unbelieving Jews were at the Destruction
   of Hierusalem, that happened soon after that Sun was up. But then
   turning himself, as it were, to his own People, Almighty God here by
   his Prophet chears and comforts them, saying to them, But unto you that
   fear my Name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, with healing in his
   wings, &c. He shall arise to all, but to the other with such a
   scorching Heat as shall burn them up, to these with healing in his
   Wings, or Rays, so as not to hurt but heal them of all their Maladies.

   NOW that which I chiefly design by God's Assistance, to shew from these
   words, is, what Thoughts they suggest to us concerning our blessed
   Saviour, by calling him the Sun of Righteousness. But to make the way
   as plain as I can, we must first consider, to whom he is here said to
   arise with healing in his wings, even to those that fear the Name of
   God; i.e. to those who firmly believing in God, and being fully
   persuaded of his infinite Power, Justice and Mercy, and also of the
   Truth of all his Threats and Promises, stand continually in awe of him;
   not daring to do any thing willingly that may offend him, nor leave any
   thing undone that he would have them do. Such, and such only, can be
   truly said to fear God. And therefore the Fear of God in the
   Scriptures, especially of the Old Testament, is all along put for the
   whole Duty of Man. There being no Duty that a Man owes, either to God
   or his Neighbour, but if he really fears God, he will endeavour all he
   can to do it. But this necessarily supposeth his Belief in God, and his
   holy Word, or rather proceeds originally from it. For he that cometh
   unto God, so as to fear and obey him, must believe that he is, and that
   he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him, Heb. xi. 6. So that
   as no Man can believe in God, but he must needs fear him; so no Man can
   fear God, unless he first believes in him. From whence it necessarily
   follows, that by those who are here said to fear the Name of God, we
   can understand no other but only such as are possessed with a firm
   Belief in him, and with a full Persuasion of the Truth and Certainty of
   those divine Revelations that he hath made of himself, and of his Will
   to Mankind, and therefore live accordingly.

   OF these, and these only, it is here said, that to them shall the Sun
   of Righteousness arise with healing in his wings. Not to any other; no
   other being able to see his light, nor capable of those healing
   Influences that proceed from him. For though he be a Sun, he is not not
   such a Sun as we see with our bodily Eyes in the Firmament, but the Sun
   of Righteousness, shining in the highest Heavens, beyond the reach of
   our senses, visible only to the Eye of the Faith, the Evidence of
   things not seen. Insomuch that although he he risen, and darts down his
   Beams to this lower World continually, yet they who have not Faith, can
   neither see him, nor enjoy any more Benefit by him than as if he was
   not risen, or did not shine at all. As if a Man be born stark blind,
   though the Sun shines never so clear about him, he sees no more than he
   did before, but lives in the dark at Noonday as much as at Midnight,
   neither can ye ever make him understand what Light or Colours are; for
   having not that sense, by which alone such things can be perceived, he
   can never understand what you mean by such things, so as to form any
   true Notion of them in his mind. So it is in our present Case; though
   the Sun of Righteousness be risen, and shines most gloriously in the
   World; yet being the Object only of our Faith, without that a Man can
   discern nothing of him. He may perhaps talk of him as a blind Man may
   talk of Light, but all the while he knows not what he means by the
   Words which he useth about him. For he useth them only as Words in
   course, taken up from those he talks with, without having any Effect or
   Operation at all upon his mind; whereas they who really believe God's
   Word, and what is there revealed concerning the Sun of Righteousness;
   they see his Light, they feel his Heat, they experience the Power and
   Efficacy of his Influences; and therefore, although they who have not
   Faith (as few have) can be no way profited by what they shall hear or
   read of him, yet they who have, and act it upon what they hear or read
   out of God's holy Word concerning him, they will find their Thoughts or
   Apprehensions of him cleared up, and their Affections enflamed to him;
   so as to love and honour him for the future, as the Fountain of all
   that spiritual Life and Light, and Joy they have. For to them he will
   arise with healing its his wings.

   HE did not only arise once, but he continually ariseth to those who
   believe in God, and fear him. For thus saith the Lord, to you that fear
   my Name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, with healing in his
   wings. It is true, he speaks more especially of his Incarnation, or
   visible Appearance in the World, but by this manner of speaking; he
   intimates withal that this Sun of Righteousness is always shining upon
   his faithful People, more or less, in all Ages from the beginning to
   the end of the World. For in that it is said he shall arise, it is
   plainly supposed that he was the Sun of Righteousness before, and gave
   Light unto the World, though not so clearly as when he was actually
   risen. As we see and enjoy the light of the Sun, long before be riseth,
   from the first dawning of the Day, though it grows clearer and clearer,
   all along as he comes nearer and nearer to his rising; so the Sun of
   Righteousness began to enlighten the World as soon as it was darkened
   by Sin; the Day then began to break, and it grew lighter and lighter in
   every Age. Adam himself saw something of this Light, Abraham more;
   Abraham rejoyced to see my Day, saith this glorious Sun, he saw it, and
   was glad, Joh. viii. 56: David and the Prophets after him saw it most
   clearly; especially this, the last of the Prophets: He saw this Sun in
   a manner rising, so that he could tell the People that it would
   suddenly get above their Horizon, The Lord whom ye seek, saith he,
   shall suddenly come to his Temple, Mal. iii. 1. and acquaints them also
   with the happy Influences it would have upon them, saying, in the Name
   of God, Unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise
   with healing in his wings.

   The Sun of Righteousness; that is, as I observed before, Jesus Christ
   the righteous, who is often foretold and spoke of under the name and
   notion of the Sun or Star that giveth light unto the World. There shall
   come a star out of Jacob, said Balaam, Num. xxiv. 17. And he shall be
   as the light of the morning when the sun riseth, saith David, 2 Sam.
   xxiii. 4. And the Prophet Isaiah speaking of his coming, saith, The
   people that walked in darkness have seen a great light, and they that
   dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light
   shined; Isa. ix. 2. For that this was spoken of Christ, we have the
   authority of the Evangelist, Mat. iv. 16. To the same purpose is that
   of the same Prophet, Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory
   of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold the darkness shall cover the
   earth, and gross darkness the people, but the Lord shall arise upon
   thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee, Isa. lx. 1, 2. The sun
   shall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightness shall the
   moon give light unto thee. But the Lord shall be unto thee an
   everlasting light, and thy God thy glory, v. 19, 20. To which we may
   add the many places where Christ is called tsmch which we translate the
   Branch. As, I will bring forth my servant the Branch, Zech. iii. 8.
   Behold the man, whose name is the Branch, c. vi. 8. I will raise up to
   David, a righteous Branch, Jer. xxiii. 5. And a Branch of
   righteousness, c. xxxiii. 15. In all which places the original word
   signifies also the rising of the Sun, and is accordingly rendred by the
   LXX, Anatole, Oriens, not that part of Heaven where the Sun riseth, but
   the Sun it self as rising there. And so it is translated also both in
   the Syriack and Arabick Versions. And where it is said, In that day
   shall the Branch of the Lord be beautiful, Isa. iv. 2. In the LXX it is
   epilampsei ho Theos, God shall shine forth. In the Syriack [image of
   syriack script] The rising of the Lord shall be for glory. In Arabick,
   [image of arabick script] The Lord shall rise as the sun. And that this
   is the true sense of the word in all these places, appears from the
   Prophecy of Zacharias the Father of John the Baptist; for speaking of
   Christ's coming, he expresseth it according to our Translation, by
   saying, The day spring from on high hath visited us, Luk. i. 78. But in
   the original it is the same word that the LXX use in all the aforefaid
   places, Anatole, Oriens, the rising Sun. And it is much to be observed,
   that all the said places of the Prophets, are interpreted of the
   Messiah or Christ; by the Targem or Chaldee Paraphrase, made by the
   ancient Jews themselves; for tsmch the rising Sun, is there translated
   msych' the Christ, as if it was only another name for Messiah, the
   Saviour of the World. From all which it appears, that when the Prophet
   here calls our Saviour Christ the sun of righteousness, he speaks
   according to the common sense and practice of the Church at that time.

   AND verily he may well be called the Sun, both in respect of what he is
   in himself, and in respect of what he is to us. As there is but one Sun
   in the Firmament, it is the chief of all Creatures that we see in the
   World. There is nothing upon Earth, but what is vastly inferior, the
   very Stars of Heaven seem no way comparable to it; it is the top, the
   head, the glory of all visible Objects: In like manner, as there is but
   one Saviour in the World, he is exalted far above all things in it, not
   only above the Sun it self, but above all Principality, and Power, and
   Might, and Dominion, and every Name that is named, not only in this
   World, but also in that which is to come. All things are put under his
   feet, and he is given to be head over all things to the Church, Eph. i.
   21, 22. The very Angels, Authorities and Powers of Heaven, \are all
   made subject to him, 1 Pet. iii. 22. And that is the reason that he is
   said to be at the right hand of God, because he is preferred before,
   and set over the whole Creation, next to the Almighty Creator himself,
   where he now reigns, and doth whatsoever he pleaseth in Heaven and
   Earth.

   AND as the Sun is in itself also the most glorious, as well as the most
   excellent Creature we see, of such transcendent Beauty, Splendor and
   Glory, that we cannot look stedfastly upon it, but our eyes are
   presently dazled, so is Christ; the Sun of righteousness, When he was
   transfigured, his face did shine as the sun, Mat. xvii. 2. When St.
   John had a glimpse of him, he saw his countenance as the sun that
   shineth in his strength, Rev. i. 16. When he appeared to St. Paul going
   to Damascus at mid day, there was a light above the brightness of the
   sun shining round about him, and them that journied with him, Acts
   xxvi. 13. And it is no wonder, For he is the brightness of the Father's
   glory, and the express image of his person, Heb. i. 3. And therefore
   must needs shine more gloriously than it is possible for any mere
   Creature to do; his very Body, by reason of its Union to the divine
   Person, is a glorious body. Phil. iii. 21. The most glorious doubtless
   of all the Bodies in the World, as far exceeding the Sun, as that doth
   a clod of Earth; insomuch, that could we look upon our Lord as he now
   shines forth in all his Glory in the highest Heavens, how would our
   eyes be dazled? Our whole Souls amazed and confounded at his excellent
   Glory? The Sun would appear to us no otherwise than as the Moon and
   Stars do, when the Sun is up. And he that so far excels the Sun in that
   very property, wherein the Sun excels all other things, may well be
   called the Sun: The Sun by way of præeminence, the most glorious Sun in
   the World, in comparison whereof nothing else deserves to be called by
   that Name. Neither may our blessed Saviour be justly called by this
   glorious Name, only from what he is in himself, but likewise for what
   He doth for us, as may be easily demonstrated from all the benefits
   that we receive from the Sun, I shall instance in some of the most
   plain and obvious.

   FIRST therefore, the Sun we know is the Fountain of all the Light that
   we have upon Earth, without which we could see nothing, not so much as
   the way that is before us, but should be always groping and stumbling
   in the dark, whereas by it we can discern every thing that is about us,
   or at any distance from us, as far as our sight can reach. In which
   respect our blessed Lord is the Sun indeed; The light of the world,
   Joh. viii. 12. The true light; that lighteneth every one that cometh
   into the world, c. i. 9. A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory
   of his people Israel, Luk. ii. 32. A marvellous light, 1 Pet. ii. 9.
   Whereby we can see things that are not visible to the eye, as plainly
   as we do those that are. For this day spring from on high, this Sun of
   Righteousness hath visited us, to give light to them that sit in
   darkness and in the shadow of death, and to guide our feet into the way
   of peace, Luc. i. 78, 79. To shew us the invisible things of God, and
   direct us to all things belonging to our everlasting Peace and
   Happiness. He hath made them all clear and manifest to us in his
   Gospel. But whatsoever maketh manifest is light, Eph. v. 13. Wherefore
   he is said to have brought life and immortality to light through the
   Gospel, 2 Tim. i. 10. Because he hath there so clearly revealed them to
   us, that by the light of his holy Gospel we may see all things
   necessary to be known, believed, or done, in order to eternal Life, as
   plainly as we can see the most visible Objects at Noon day.

   BY this Light we can see as much of the Glory of God himself, as our
   mortal Nature can bear. For No man hath seen God at any time, the only
   begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him,
   Joh. i. 18. Neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to
   whomsoever the Son will reveal him. Mat. xi. 27. So that no Man ever
   had or can have any right knowledge of the true God, but only by his
   Son our Saviour Christ. But by his means, they that lived before might
   see him as by twilight, we who live after this Sun is risen, may see
   him by the clearest Light that can be given of him, for he hath fully
   revealed and declared him to us in the Gospel.

   BY this glorious Light we can see into the Mystery of the eternal
   Trinity in Unity, so as to believe that God the Father, Son and Holy
   Ghost are one, one Jehovah, one God. That God the Father made all
   things at the first by his Word, and still upholds and orders all
   filings according to his Will. That God the Son was made flesh, became
   Man, and as such died upon the Cross, and so offered up himself as a
   Sacrifice for the sins of the whole World; that he rose again, went up
   to Heaven, and is now there at the right hand of God; that upon our
   Repentance and Faith in him our sins are all pardoned, and he that made
   us is reconciled to us by the Merits of his said Death; that by the
   Power of his Intercession which he now makes in Heaven for us, we are
   justified or accounted righteous in him, before his, and in him our
   Almighty Father; that God the Holy Ghost abide! continually with his
   Church, moving upon, actuating and influencing the means of Grace that
   are there administred; that he sanctifies all that believe in Christ,
   leads them into all Truth, comforts them in all their Troubles, and of
   assists them in doing whatsoever is required of them. These and many
   such great and necessary Truths as lay in a great measure hid before,
   are now by the Light of the Sun of Righteousness shinning in his
   Gospel, made so plain and evident, that all may see them, except they
   wilfully shut their Eyes, or turn their Backs upon then.

   AND though the Sun in the Firmament enlightens only the Air, to make it
   a fit medium through which to see; this glorious Light that comes from
   the Sun of Righteousness, enlightens Mens Minds too, and opens their
   Eyes, to beheld the wondrous things that are revealed in the law of
   God, Psal. cxix. 18. And that too so effectually in some, that they
   likewise are able to enlighten others, to open their Eyes, and turn
   them from Darkness to Light, Acts xxvi. 18. Insomuch that they also are
   the Light of the World, Mat. v. 14. not originally in themselves, but
   by communication from him, as the Moon is first enlightened by the Sun,
   and then reflects its light to the Earth.

   MOREOVER, the Sun is the first Cause under God, not only of Light, but
   also of all the Life that is in any Creature upon Earth, without which
   nothing could live, no, not so much as a Vegetable, much less an Animal
   Life; for that which we call Life, wherewith such Creatures as have
   Organs fitted for it, are actuated and quickned, so as to be said
   properly to live, at all depends upon the heat and influences of the
   Sun; should the Sun once cease to be, or to influence the World, all
   living Creatures would immediately expire and die. So is Christ the Sun
   of Righteousness, the Fountain of all spiritual Life. In thee, saith
   David, is the fountain of life, in thy light we shall see light, Psal.
   xxxvi. 9. Where we see that Light, and Life in this sense also go
   together; they both proceed from the same Fountain, the Sun of
   righteousness, who therefore saith, I am the light of the world, he
   that followeth me shall not walk in darkmess, but shall have the light
   of life, Joh. viii. 12. that Light which hath Life always proceeding
   from it, and accompanying it; so that he is both Light and Life it
   self.. I am, saith he, the way, the truth, and the life, Joh. xiv. 6.
   And our Life, as the Apostle calls him, Col. iii. 4. even the life of
   all that believe in him. The life that I now live in the flesh, saith
   the same Apostle, I live by the faith of the Son of God, Gal. ii. 20.
   And therefore he who believeth, and so hath the son, he hath life, and
   he that hath not the son, hath not life, 1 Joh. v. 12.

   FROM all which it appears, that All men by nature are dead in
   trespasses and sins, Eph. ii. 1. But when any arise from the dead by
   faith, it is Christ that gives them life, c. v. 14. Who cane into the
   world on purpose that they might have life, and that they might have it
   more abundantly, Joh. x. 10. more abundantly, that is, in the highest
   and most excellent manner that it is possible for Men to live. For this
   Life which the Sun of Righteousness raiseth Believers to, is the Life
   of Righteousness, an holy, an heavenly, a spiritual, divine Life; it is
   the Life of Faith, whereby they live to other purposes, and in a quite
   different manner from other Men; they live to God, and not unto the
   World, they live in a constant dependence upon him, and submission to
   him, they live with a firm belief of his Word, and sincere obedience to
   his Laws; they live altogether in his Service, so that whether they
   eat, or drink, or whatsoever they do, they still do it to the glory of
   God, 1 Cor. x. 31. In short, they strive all they can to do the Will of
   God upon Earth, as the holy Angels do it in Heaven, and so have their
   Conversation there, where their Saviour and their Treasure is.

   BUT this Life is infused into them, only by the Rays of the Sun of
   Righteousness, by that Holy Spirit which proceedeth from Christ,
   whereby they being born again, and made the Children of Light, thus
   walk in newness of Life; and so it is nourished also, preserved and
   strengthned only by him, who therefore calls himself the bread of life,
   Joh. vi. 35, 48. And the Bread of God, which cometh from heaven, and
   giveth life unto the world, v. 33, the living bread, of which if any
   man eat, he shall live for ever, v. 51. And this Bread which he gives
   is his flesh, which he gave for the life of the world, ibid. For his
   flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed; so that whoso
   eateth his flesh and drinketh his blood hath eternal Life, and he will
   raise him up at the last day, that he may live for ever. v. 54, 55, 58.
   Foe Christ is the resurrection and the life, whosoever believeth in
   him, though he were dead, yet shall he live, and whosoever liveth and
   believeth in him shall never die, c. xi. 25, 26. Though his Body may
   die, yet not his Soul. And his Body also at the last Day shall be
   raised again to Life, by the power of this glorious Son. For as in Adam
   all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive, 1 Cor. xv. 22.

   SEEING therefore that Jesus Christ is the Fountain of the Life of
   Righteousness, the Author of that spiritual and eternal Life which the
   righteous live; as the Sun is of our natural, he also may most properly
   be called the Sun, and the Sun of Righteousness, as he is in the words
   before us. And so he may be likewise from his chearing and refreshing
   our Spirits in the inward Man, as the Sun doth in the outward. The
   light of the eyes, saith the Wise Man, rejoiceth the heart, Prov. xv.
   30. And truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
   eye to behold the sun, Eccles. xi. 7. This we all find by daily
   experience, and so we do too, that the light and heat of the Sun
   agitate or move our animal Spirits in so benign and delicate a manner,
   that we are always more chearful and pleasant when the Sun shines
   clearly, than we are in a dark Night or cloudy Day. But in this the Sun
   of Righteousness infinitely exceeds the other, for he is the Fountain
   not only of some, but of all the true Joy and Comfort that his faithful
   People have or ever can have in the World. It all proceeds from him,
   whom having not seen they love, in whom, though now they see him not,
   yet believing they rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory, 1
   Pet. i. 8. For upon their believing in him, as having been delivered
   for their Offences, and raised again for their Justification, he
   manifesteth himself, and his special love and favour to them, in the
   pardon of their Sins, and their Reconciliation to Almighty God, whereby
   their Souls are filled, not only with unspeakable, but glorious Joy, of
   the same nature with that which the glorified Saints in Heaven are
   continually transported with. This is that which is called the lifting
   up the light of God's countenance, and his causing his Face to shine
   upon them, Psal. iv. 6. Psal. lxvii. 1. Psal. lxxx. 3. Num. vi. 25.
   When the Sun of Righteousness thus shineth upon them, refreshing and
   comforting their hearts, by the sweet influences of that Holy Spirit
   that proceedeth from him.

   BUT the Sun doth not only refresh the Earth, but makes it fruitful; it
   is by his means under God, that Plants grow and bring forth Fruit, and
   that Animals do the respective Works which God hath set them. So is
   Christ the Cause or Author of all the good and righteous Works that are
   done in the World; he himself saith, without me ye can do nothing, Joh.
   xv. 5. And his Apostle could say upon his own experience, I can do all
   things through Christ which strengtheneth me, Phil. iv. 13. And that
   the Fruits, all the Fruits of Righteousness, and by Jesus Christ, or
   come from him, Chap. i. 11. who therefore in this respect also may well
   be termed the Sun of Righteousness.

   TO which we may likewise add, that as the Works which God hath made
   upon Earth by his Power, although they have no light in themselves
   whereby they can be seen, yet they appear in all their Beauty and
   Colours by the Sun reflecting his light upon them; so the Works which
   his Servants do, by his Assistance and Grace, although they have no
   real worth, nor are exactly righteous in themselves, yet by the Sun of
   Righteousness reflecting his Righteousness upon them, they seem or are
   accounted righteous in the sight of God, or as St. Peter speaks, they
   are acceptable to God by Jesus Christ, 1 Pet. ii. 5. without whom
   therefore there could be no such thing as Righteousness seen upon
   Earth, no more than there could be Colours without light. But as by one
   man's disobedience many were made Sinners, so by the Obedience of one
   many are made righteous, Rom. v. 19. both sincerely righteous in
   themselves, and accepted of as righteous before God, by his
   Righteousness imputed to them. So that all Righteousness, both as it is
   performed by Men, and as it is approved of by God, comes only from
   Jesus Christ. And this seems to be the great reason wherefore he is
   here called in a peculiar manner the Sun of Righteousness, and promised
   to arise to his faithful People with healing in his wings, that they
   may grow up as Calves in the stalls; to shew that it is by him only
   that they are healed of their Infirmities, and restored to a sound
   mind, so as to grow in Grace, and bring forth the Fruits of
   Righteousness, such Righteousness as by him is acceptable to God, from
   whom they shall therefore at the last Day receive the Crown of
   Righteousness, that Crown which this Sun of Righteousness hath procured
   for them.

   UPON these, among many other accounts, Jesus Christ the Saviour of
   Mankind may truly be called the Sun of Righteousness, as he is here by
   the Spirit of Truth itself, for our Admonition and Comfort. For hereby
   we are put in mind how to think of our blessed Saviour, and to exercise
   our Faith in him, so as to love and honour him with all our Hearts, and
   to put our whole Trust and Confidence in him for all things necessary
   to our eternal Salvation. Forasmuch as we are by this means given to
   understand, that what the Sun is to this lower World, the same is
   Christ to his Church. But the Sun, as we have heard, is the most
   excellent, and most glorious thing that we see in the World. It is the
   next Cause, under God, of all the Light that is in the Air, and of all
   the Life that any Creatures live upon the Earth. It is that which
   refresheth the Earth, and makes it fruitful. It is that also which
   gives a lustre to all things that are about us, so as to make them
   pleasing and delightful to the Eye.

   AND accordingly, whensoever I think of my blessed Saviour, the Sun of
   Righteousness I apprehend, or rather by the Eye of Faith I behold him
   in the highest Heavens, there shining in Glory and Splendor infinitely
   greater than any mortal Eye can bear, invested with supreme Majesty,
   Honour and Authority over the whole Creation. I behold him there
   surrounded with an innumerable Company of holy Angels, as so many fixed
   Stars, and of glorified Saints as Planets enlightened by him; all his
   Satellites or Servants waiting upon him; ready upon all occasions to
   reflect and convey his benign Influences or Favours to his People upon
   Earth. I see him yonder, by his own Light; I behold him displaying his
   bright Beams, and diffusing his Light round about, over his whole
   Church, both that which is triumphant in Heaven, and that which is
   militant here on Earth, that all the Members of it may see all things
   belonging to their Peace. I behold him continually sending down his
   quickening Spirit upon those who are baptized into, and believe in his
   holy Name, to regenerate them, to be a standing Principle of a new and
   divine Life in them. I behold him there manifesting himself, and
   causing his Face to shine upon those who look up to him, so as to
   refresh and cheer their Spirits, to make them brisk and lively, and
   able to run with Patience the race that is set before them. I behold
   him there continually issuing forth his Holy Spirit, to actuate and
   influence the Administration of his Word and Sacraments; that all who
   duly receive them may thereby grow in Grace, and be fruitful in every
   good Word and Work. I behold this Sun of Righteousness shining with so
   much Power and Efficacy upon his Church, that all the good Works which
   are done in it, though imperfect in themselves, do notwithstanding
   appear through him as good and righteous in the sight of God himself,
   and are accordingly rewarded by him. In short, as the Sun was made to
   rule and govern the Day, so I behold this Sun of Righteousness as
   governing his Church, and ordering all things both within it and
   without it, so as to make them work together for the good of those who
   love God, till he hath brought them all to himself, to live with him in
   the highest Heavens, where they also shall by his means, shine forth as
   the sun in the kingdom of their Father for ever, Mat. xiii. 43.

   COULD we keep these and such like thoughts of our blessed Saviour
   always fresh in our Minds, could we be always thus looking upon him, as
   the Sun of Righteousness shining continually upon us and his whole
   Church, what holy, what heavenly, what comfortable Lives should we then
   lead? We should then despise the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked
   World, as nothing, as less than nothing in comparison of this most
   glorious Sun and his Righteousness. We should then with St. Paul, count
   all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Jesus Christ
   our Lord, and should count them but dung that we may win Christ, and be
   found in him, not having our own righteousness which is of the law, but
   that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is
   of God by faith, Phil. iii. 8, 9. We should then leave gazing upon the
   trifles of this lower World, and should be always looking up to this
   Sun of Righteousness, so as to be enlightened by him, Psal. xxxiv. 5.
   with such a Light as will discover to us the Glories of the other
   World, together with the way that leads to it.

   WE should then abhor and detest the works of Darkness, and walk as the
   Children of Light, and accordingly shine as Lights in the World. And
   then we should have the Light of God's Countenance shining continually
   upon us, enlightening, enlivening, and refreshing our whole Souls, and
   pacifying both our Hearts and Lives so, as to make us meet to be
   Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light; in that
   everlasting Light which comes from the Sun of Righteousness, who liveth
   and reigneth, and shineth with the Father and the Holy Ghost, one God,
   blessed for ever.
